1
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,848
Hand over the milk money, Weaver.

2
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:38,760
I can't do that, Derek.

3
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:41,126
I'm not sure
you'll spend it on milk.

4
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:45,300
That's me, Mitch Weaver.

5
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:48,201
That's Sam, my lifelong best friend.

6
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:52,173
I never had a dad growing up,
so Sam's dad Pops filled in a little.

7
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,234
He was a boxer,
real tough guy.

8
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:59,180
One thing to remember in life,
no matter where you go or what you do...

9
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:01,945
don't take no crap from nobody.

10
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:05,181
I never liked the guy,
but he was right about not taking crap.

11
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:08,349
Wow! My dad sure is great.

12
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:13,294
Hey, do you know where
he hides his guns?

13
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,058
Don't worry.

14
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:22,032
We planted the guns in the bully's desk
so he'd get in trouble.

15
00:01:22,105 --> 00:01:24,505
It wasn't me!

16
00:01:24,574 --> 00:01:28,408
Let me go!
They weren't mine!

17
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,709
We always did stuff like that,
get back at people who messed with us.

18
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,308
There was this crossing guard
used to grab all the kids' asses.

19
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:38,149
Back then people weren't on
the lookout for that kind of thing.

20
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:41,190
The only way to nail a guy like that
was to catch him red-handed.

21
00:01:41,258 --> 00:01:43,249
That's where Super Glue came in.

22
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:47,285
Look, everybody! Crossing guard's
grabbing 8-year-old's ass over here!

23
00:01:52,902 --> 00:01:56,201
We really got back at
this ornery baby-sitter we didn't like.

24
00:01:58,174 --> 00:02:01,940
After all these years,
this picture still makes me horny.

25
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:05,175
I mean, wistful!
It makes me wistful.

26
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:08,547
When I was 16,
the saddest event of my life occurred.

27
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,051
My mom died.

28
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,580
Everyone did their best to console me,
particularly Aunt Jenny.

29
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:17,388
It wasn't easy, because
I'm not comfortable expressing my...

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,951
What do you call them? Emotions?

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,794
Anyways, I learned to express myself
in other ways.

32
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:25,630
I started making little notes to myself.

33
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:27,363
Note to self.

34
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:31,931
Remember, Aunt Jenny is your aunt.

35
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:34,602
Then there was this character
we had to deal with.

36
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:36,942
She thought just because she was
a meter maid...

37
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:40,176
that she had the right to go around
giving everybody parking tickets.

38
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,582
That's where the popcorn
came in handy.

39
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,823
In high school, I still didn't take crap
from anyone, man or beast.

40
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:55,990
This Doberman would always chase us.

41
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,591
So we borrowed my cousin's
huge German shepherd...

42
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:00,602
who also happens to be gay.

43
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,869
Taught that Doberman some humility.

44
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,504
Boy, those were the days.

45
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:10,068
But then, something happened.
I grew up.

46
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,843
Okay, 132 Highfield Avenue
in three minutes.

47
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,112
I can make it.
I can make it.

48
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:19,854
Oh, no!

49
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:34,736
Hi, there.
Thirty minutes or free, right?

50
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:37,830
And you took 32 minutes.

51
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,603
So close and yet so far.

52
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,771
Gimme a break. That free pizza
comes out of my paycheck.

53
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:46,145
That doesn't seem fair, does it?

54
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:51,513
Then the guy says,
"If you want the money for this pizza...

55
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:54,682
you tell Aldo and the rest
of those sweaty Italian fruits...

56
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,692
to come down
and get it from me themselves."

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,925
Also, he started saying nasty things
about that Mussolini character.

58
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:06,298
The guy called.
I know you didn't make it on time.

59
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:09,566
None of the other pizza places have
the 30-minute thing anymore.

60
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,072
Can't we drop it?

61
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,042
You think we should drop
the 30-minute guarantee?

62
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,238
You think Aldo's should be
just like all the others?

63
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:21,848
Mitch Weaver, you're not fit
to wear this shirt.

64
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,946
That's my Canadians jersey.

65
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,616
You have anything in a 10-1l2 wide?

66
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:01,354
Toni-Ann, what are you doing?

67
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:05,518
I've had it. Uncle Aldo called.
He told me he fired you.

68
00:05:05,595 --> 00:05:10,430
That's your 14th job in the past
three months! I can't take it anymore!

69
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,594
Honey, I understand you're upset.

70
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,605
Maybe you'll feel better
after we have some dirty sex.

71
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:20,803
Forget it! I'm through
wasting my life with you.

72
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:22,310
Good-bye!

73
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:25,438
- What about the rest of my stuff?
- Your stuff?

74
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,449
There is no "your stuff."

75
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:30,077
I have paid for everything
in this apartment.

76
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,555
Wait a minute. That's not true.

77
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,716
I paid for the popcorn machine.

78
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:50,768
What's up, fruity?

79
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,273
Hey, ass-bite.

80
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,972
By the looks of this popcorn machine, I
guess she tossed you out for good, huh?

81
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:58,638
Yep.

82
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:00,910
Passed your car back there.

83
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:04,010
- It's a nasty flat, but I can fix it.
- Thanks, Sam.

84
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:07,784
I was wondering. Could I crash
with you and your dad for a while?

85
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:12,924
No. I'm gonna turn away my best friend
so he's gotta sleep in his car. Come on.

86
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,699
Hey, that's my shirt.

87
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,099
You're wearing my shirt.

88
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:26,674
Here you go.

89
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:28,574
No, that's all right.

90
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:31,307
I was talking to somebody else
that's different than you.

91
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:40,617
Two, three, up.

92
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,555
Press those knees straight.

93
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,957
And again. Take it down.

94
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:47,087
Two, three...

95
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:48,653
and lift it up.

96
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:56,466
- Pops, how you doin'?
- Pretty good, son.

97
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,838
But it'd be goin' a lot better
if you brought me a whore.

98
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,536
I thought you couldn't...

99
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,205
I can't but...

100
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,249
I subscribe to this magazine
to give me a few ideas.

101
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,718
There's an article about home
stereo equipment, too. That's for you.

102
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:12,379
That's great.

103
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:15,481
- I'll be right back, all right?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,163
Do me a favor.

105
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:25,200
Could you stay with him for a while?

106
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:26,826
What's the matter?

107
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:30,202
You know how I feel about your father.
I'm uncomfortable around him.

108
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:32,901
He's kind of... I don't know.

109
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:34,967
Creepy, you know?

110
00:07:35,044 --> 00:07:37,308
He creeps the hell out of me,
to tell you the truth.

111
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,109
He likes you.

112
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:42,777
I gotta call somebody
to borrow a jack.

113
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:44,786
Stay with him for a while.

114
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,287
All right.

115
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,893
Feelin' okay, Mr. McKenna?

116
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,395
Don't worry about me.

117
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:58,093
I just want to thank you
for spending a little time with me.

118
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,829
- Well, no problem.
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:04,304
- I also want to say I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

120
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:08,105
For being a creepy old man.

121
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:10,475
I apologize, you rotten bastard!

122
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:14,482
- You say those things about me?
- Pops! Pops! Let go!

123
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,486
Get out of here, Sam!
I'll kill this bastard!

124
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:21,717
I can still hear,
no matter how creepy I look.

125
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:25,386
- It's Mitch! Let go.
- All right, take him.

126
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:28,089
Everything's falling apart.

127
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:30,223
Remember how things were
when we were young?

128
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:32,392
Yeah, it was great.

129
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,901
Yeah, it was.

130
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,461
I felt good about myself back then.

131
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,339
If somebody messed with me, no problem.
I didn't take crap from anybody.

132
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,540
Now I'm in my 30s, I can't hold a job.
I go out with women I don't even like.

133
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,981
Worst of all, I take crap
from absolutely everybody.

134
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:50,680
Things could be worse.

135
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:54,245
I could've got my nose bit off
by a Saigon whore.

136
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:02,964
You bastard!

137
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:07,762
I'm just messin' with you, Jimmy.
I saw you down there.

138
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:10,203
Get Jimmy a beer on me.

139
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:12,468
Okay. It's okay.

140
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,843
Wow, look at her.

141
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,142
Yeah. She's all yours, buddy.
Go get her.

142
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,151
Hi. How ya doin'?
I'm Sam McKenna.

143
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,892
I live with my dad.

144
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:41,801
It appears Travis Cole
has bailed out the city once again...

145
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:45,898
coming up with the necessary funding
to save the Chelsea Opera House.

146
00:09:45,975 --> 00:09:49,103
How could a man in my position
not step in and do his civic duty?

147
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:51,373
That opera house is part
of this city's heritage.

148
00:09:51,447 --> 00:09:53,972
Heck, yes, I'm gonna keep it up
and running.

149
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,383
I love this city,
and as we all know...

150
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,921
I love opera.

151
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,422
Right, Spunky?

152
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:05,325
A guy like Travis Cole
has a great life.

153
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,555
Why? Just because he's rich?

154
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,861
No. Because he doesn't take crap
from anybody.

155
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,265
There are two kinds of people in this
world: Those who get stomped on...

156
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:16,066
and those who do the stomping.

157
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,164
Where'd you come up
with that theory?

158
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,210
That famous guy said it.
What's his name?

159
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:23,438
Oh, yeah. Jesus.

160
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:25,174
Hi. I'm Mitch.

161
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,013
Hello, Mitch.

162
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:31,281
Maybe later you'll drop by the house.

163
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:33,618
You know, check out the hot tub.

164
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:37,125
- Hey, pal, beat it!
- Why don't you beat it?

165
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:40,993
The lady obviously isn't interested
in you, jerk-off! So get lost!

166
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,793
Maybe we should let the lady decide.

167
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,130
- I think you should fight it out.
- Good idea.

168
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,965
- Great idea!
- Brilliant idea!

169
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:51,564
- I love the idea.
- Terry, Jack, Mike, Rick.

170
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:55,509
Oh, no. My dumb friend needs me.
I gotta go.

171
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,819
Well, Mitch, looks like
we've got ourselves a fight.

172
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:07,083
Great. It's fightin' time.
Can I be on their side?

173
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:11,956
Looks like there's gonna be a brawl.
You playin' something good?

174
00:11:12,028 --> 00:11:15,987
Hell, yeah!
Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man."

175
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:18,590
G-7!

176
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:22,200
You just hit G-8.

177
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,737
Bring it on!

178
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,170
How come you get a pool cue?

179
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,247
Come on.
You fell right into my trap.

180
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,448
Sammy, bite 'em!
Bite 'em in the nose!

181
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:50,264
Note to self.
Learn to fight.

182
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:59,832
I wanna go over there and rip
their heads off, every one of them.

183
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:05,279
That would probably work, since they're
so tired from beating us mercilessly.

184
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:08,749
But since we rented the cop uniforms,
let's try it my way, all right?

185
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,856
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Neil, is that you?

186
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:17,290
Yeah, it's me, Neil.

187
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,923
It's Jason. We just got back from
beating these guys. Messed 'em up good!

188
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:26,958
The whole time, this guy's lying there,
crying like a little girl.

189
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:30,062
- Wait, I'll get Terry.
- Don't get Terry. I mean...

190
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:32,539
The reason I'm calling is this.

191
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:36,339
There's these guys going around
to frat houses pretending to be cops.

192
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:39,472
But they're not real cops.
They're fake cops.

193
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:41,948
They just robbed a bunch of stuff
from the Delta Psi house.

194
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:43,952
So don't be fooled, okay?

195
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,954
Sure thing.
Thanks for calling.

196
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:48,115
Okay, no problem, dude.

197
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,887
Now you go back to doing something
latently homoerotic, all right?

198
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:03,298
Hello, real cops?
Yes, I'd like to register a complaint.

199
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:06,205
We got a complaint about the noise.

200
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,402
Whatever you say, Officer.

201
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:10,970
Officer down! We need backup!

202
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:23,517
- Okay, we'll take care of these two.
- You got it.

203
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,060
Hey, frat sisters,
remember us?

204
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,091
I'll take this one.

205
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:41,672
- I'll take the next one.
- All right, man.

206
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:52,581
That felt great, man,
getting back at those guys tonight.

207
00:13:52,655 --> 00:13:55,249
I've got to admit, that was brilliant,
what you did.

208
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:57,258
You are the king of revenge.

209
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,659
Pipe down! I'm trying to watch
these broads work out.

210
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,062
- You want another beer?
- Yeah.

211
00:14:05,668 --> 00:14:07,636
Mitch, you wanna come over here?

212
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:09,694
I'm not falling for that one again.

213
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,040
- I think I'm having a heart attack.
- Not gonna work.

214
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:22,541
Pops! You all right?

215
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:34,793
I'm gonna let him sleep.

216
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:38,027
Could you stay with him
while I find the doctor?

217
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,034
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

218
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,339
I'm glad you came.

219
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:51,642
Hey, Mr. McKenna.
I'll go get Sam.

220
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:55,115
No, hold on.
There's something I want to tell you.

221
00:14:55,184 --> 00:14:57,277
Oh. I'm gonna find Sam.

222
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:59,913
Mitch, sit your ass down!

223
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:06,825
It's embarrassing being physically
afraid of a hundred-year-old man...

224
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:08,830
who just had a coronary...

225
00:15:08,898 --> 00:15:10,832
so could we hurry this up?

226
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,164
I'm not doin' too well.

227
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:16,500
So knowing that, I think
I better tell you this now.

228
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:20,342
- Tell me what?
- I'm your father.

229
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:29,542
You must be delirious,
because you're not my father.

230
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:32,712
I don't know who my father is,
but it's not you.

231
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:34,449
Here, Mitch.

232
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:40,486
Look at the picture
in this locket.

233
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,356
Holy Lord!

234
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:49,666
That's a picture of you and my mom
having sex!

235
00:15:49,738 --> 00:15:52,832
God! Why would you show me that?

236
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,376
I'm sorry, son.

237
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:58,038
I figured you'd never believe me
unless I showed you that picture.

238
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:03,348
I loved your mother as a friend, but it
wasn't true love. We both knew that.

239
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,789
Besides, back then they didn't have
these fancy birth control methods.

240
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:10,553
Like pullin' out.

241
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,821
Oh, God!

242
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:15,796
Stop sayin' dirty stuff for a second,
would you?

243
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,232
Does Sam know about this?

244
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:22,862
No. And I don't want you to tell him.

245
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,371
Why not?

246
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:29,005
I don't want him to feel
he's been lied to his entire life.

247
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:31,512
Down deep he's very sensitive.

248
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,514
Promise me you won't tell him.

249
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,880
I can't promise you.

250
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,885
Sam's got a right to know.

251
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,944
I'm gonna tell him.

252
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:42,286
Hello. I'm Dr. Farthing.

253
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:44,417
Are you Mr. McKenna's son?

254
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:50,298
I gotta talk to Sam.

255
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:54,359
Mitch, don't tell him!
Don't you tell him!

256
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:57,428
Now, let me ask you.

257
00:16:57,506 --> 00:16:59,906
Are you a betting man?

258
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,136
I don't know. Sure.

259
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:05,544
If someone were taking bets on
your father's bout with death...

260
00:17:05,614 --> 00:17:08,742
I'd bet everything I own on death.

261
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:12,385
It's a good bet.
The odds are he'll probably die.

262
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,317
Couldn't you have prepared him
for that?

263
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:18,326
Oh, well...

264
00:17:18,394 --> 00:17:21,386
kind of thought I did
with that betting analogy.

265
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,556
What is wrong with my dad?

266
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:25,600
Oh, your dad?

267
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:29,695
In a nut shell,
your dad needs a heart transplant.

268
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:34,232
Because of his age,
he's low priority on the donor's list.

269
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,905
Was your father a famous athlete
or rock star?

270
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,246
No. He was a boxer,
but he wasn't famous.

271
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,780
Sorry, no heart there.

272
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:48,880
But, for $600...

273
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,859
I could sell you
a fully-adjustable hospital bed.

274
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:55,192
Are you crazy?
I don't need a bed.

275
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,996
Playing hardball, are you?
Okay, $550.

276
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,230
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this!

277
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:03,601
No, wait.

278
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:05,970
I can't believe this is happening.

279
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,033
Wait. Where're you goin'?
Your friend's leaving...

280
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:11,875
Come back here. I can help him.

281
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:15,447
Please, come back, sit down.

282
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:21,048
I'm sorry.
I'm a compulsive gambler.

283
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:26,652
Now, I know there's nobody to blame
for this but myself.

284
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:30,392
I don't know. Maybe the Buffalo Bills,
or the Boston Red Sox or Mr. "T"...

285
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:31,899
or the Jets.

286
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:35,664
Mr. "T"? Are you telling me
that you bet on the fight...

287
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:38,172
in Rocky III,
and you bet against Rocky?

288
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,334
Hindsight is 20l20, my friend.

289
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,537
The point is, I'm in trouble.

290
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,541
Deep trouble. Which could be good
for Mr. McKenna's father.

291
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:52,986
There is a way I can get his name bumped
to the top of the list to get his heart.

292
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,080
How?

293
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,159
If you pay me $50,000.

294
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,698
- Did you say $50,000?
- No.

295
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:07,224
I whispered $50,000.
I need it in two weeks.

296
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:11,899
This is awful, but I've given these
bookies practically everything I have.

297
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:19,507
When I was young, my mom used to tell me
that the lights we see in the sky...

298
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,516
are from stars that burned out
millions of years ago.

299
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,711
It's like life.

300
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:29,156
Something can be one way you think
all your life...

301
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:31,954
and in reality
it's completely different.

302
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,226
Yeah.

303
00:19:34,296 --> 00:19:37,197
I'm gonna kill you, asshole!

304
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,292
Sam, are you pissing
off the side of the building?

305
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,802
Sort of.

306
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:48,439
You know, I'm going crazy here
over Pops. He's gonna die!

307
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,240
He's not gonna die. You're gonna get
the money and get him a heart.

308
00:19:51,313 --> 00:19:54,248
$50,000 in two weeks?
Come on!

309
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:57,717
My sister Carol said she'd send
two grand. Where will I get the rest?

310
00:19:57,786 --> 00:20:01,483
- Are you gonna not try?
- Of course I'm gonna try!

311
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:06,391
What if I got a job?

312
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:08,589
Maybe I could pay this guy off
in installments.

313
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:11,895
Yes. Now you're talkin'.
I'll help you every step of the way.

314
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,963
Thanks, buddy.

315
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,239
You little bastards!

316
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:21,242
That was a hell of a piss.

317
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,645
Look at the "help wanted" section.

318
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm looking at the "buy and sell" ads.
Maybe we can sell something.

319
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:31,150
- Just look for a job.
- All right, all right!

320
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,744
Movie line comin' up.

321
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:43,455
How's that lookin', baby?

322
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:58,306
He was supposed to keep drivin'.

323
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:04,349
To start with,
the bottom stair is a roundover.

324
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,082
It does a 180 into the newel post.

325
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:11,752
The bannister has a 90 degree easement
and dies into the newel post.

326
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,489
Ninety degrees.

327
00:21:14,563 --> 00:21:17,225
- That's gonna be a problem.
- What's the problem?

328
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,463
We lied on our resumes.
We know nothing about construction.

329
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:23,232
When is lunch?

330
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:24,738
You're fired.

331
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:28,843
Ass-bite, you sure this is a good idea?

332
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:31,880
Hell, yeah.
It's 50 bucks for eatin' brownies.

333
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:34,973
They are safe, but there is a chance
of some side effects...

334
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,044
including mild itching, nausea, chills,
hallucinations and rashes.

335
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:42,682
These are good?
Aren't they good?

336
00:21:49,064 --> 00:21:51,532
I think I feel a slight itch.

337
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,428
No, maybe not.

338
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:57,465
Could be my imagination.

339
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:14,654
We eat the pig and
then together we burn.

340
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:20,526
- What you talkin' about, Satan?
- Come with me.

341
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:24,692
You belong with me.

342
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:26,700
Burn!

343
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:38,473
The hell with that job.
Who wants to be itchy anyway?

344
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:41,948
All right. Everybody line up.

345
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:44,781
Don't be dummies.
Just get in line.

346
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,286
That's fine.

347
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:50,883
Gentlemen, members of the national
office are coming here tonight...

348
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,985
for their annual inspection
of this theater.

349
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:57,589
Right now, I'm going to explain to you
my managing style...

350
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,931
for the benefit of the new guys.

351
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:05,766
So there you are, tubby.

352
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:08,105
You look like a bucket of lard
on a bad day.

353
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:09,734
You baby gorilla.

354
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,972
Why don't you work the zoo
and stop bothering people?

355
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,743
Got a call yesterday
from Baskin Robbins.

356
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:19,116
They said that they're down
to only five flavors.

357
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:21,417
You're swelling up as I talk to you.

358
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,583
Look at you. How's this?
How's it doin'?

359
00:23:25,861 --> 00:23:28,523
Hello, ice cream.
Having a good time running around?

360
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:35,102
Are you laughing 'cause I called your
friend a fat pig? Think that's funny?

361
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,264
I was laughing earlier
when you were talking to his belly.

362
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,003
Why don't you get a horse and live
in the mountains? Don't bother anybody.

363
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:44,170
You've got a personality
like a dead moth.

364
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:47,306
Okay, the fun's over.

365
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:50,283
Anybody messes this thing up
for me tonight is through.

366
00:23:50,352 --> 00:23:53,844
Not only are you fired,
your life is over.

367
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:58,484
I'll see to it you never work again, and
wind up tearing tickets off in Kuwait.

368
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:01,728
Everybody's sucking sand.

369
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:03,958
Nobody messes up,
understand me?

370
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:06,728
Don't mess up!

371
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:12,640
That guy's gonna be our boss?

372
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,439
After a speech like that, how does
he expect us not to screw him over?

373
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:19,571
Every one of us said the same thing
our first day working for Hamilton...

374
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,582
only nobody does anything.

375
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,017
Trust me, this isn't just talk.
Nobody screws me over like that.

376
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:27,851
- Me, neither.
- I can't help you. I need this job.

377
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:30,915
But if you really screw over Hamilton,
I'll give you ten bucks.

378
00:24:30,993 --> 00:24:33,723
Mark me down for $20.

379
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:36,127
Mr. Witherspoon.

380
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:38,598
Class operation, Hamilton.
Good job.

381
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:42,103
Thank you.
Let me get you some refreshments.

382
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:45,331
Okay, we're all set.

383
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:48,205
One, two, three. Look away!

384
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,376
Look, an alien.

385
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:01,513
Yeah, we better have sex
with each other.

386
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:10,957
Note to self.
Sam just looked at the screen.

387
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:13,661
No, I didn't.
I was just making sure the reel had...

388
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,469
- This alien looks like a hot guy.
- Right. We better have sex with him.

389
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:23,238
Gimme that.
It took long enough, you dummy.

390
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:36,557
Hamilton, you're through.

391
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,262
That was amazing.
You should do that stuff for a living.

392
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:46,900
Sam, tonight...

393
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:49,960
we made a wad of cash for doing
something that comes natural to us.

394
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:51,733
Revenge.

395
00:25:51,807 --> 00:25:54,401
We should open
a "revenge for hire" business.

396
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,172
I've never heard of
a "revenge for hire" business.

397
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,179
Exactly. We'd be the first.

398
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:02,239
With every genius business idea,
there's got to be a first.

399
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:05,809
Like the guy who first thought
of delivering pizza to people's houses.

400
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:07,821
Or the guy who invented crack.

401
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:11,916
Who's gonna hire us?

402
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:14,587
I have a feeling people are going
to pay us a lot of money...

403
00:26:14,663 --> 00:26:16,597
to do their dirty work.

404
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:22,728
Okay, let's get a few things
straight here.

405
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:27,298
As long as the rent's on time,
you don't wreck the place, we're okay.

406
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,967
If not...

407
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:31,969
I punch you in the stomach.

408
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:36,074
If that ever comes up,
that Sam's department.

409
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:38,449
Yeah, that's my department.

410
00:26:41,089 --> 00:26:43,353
Good.

411
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:45,017
Good luck to you.

412
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:46,526
Thanks.

413
00:26:50,098 --> 00:26:51,531
Mildred!

414
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:54,935
Wait up.

415
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:57,369
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hi, Mildred.

416
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:00,875
I guess you forgot my name.
It's not Mildred, it's Kathy.

417
00:27:00,942 --> 00:27:03,467
No, I didn't forget.
You never told me, so I just guessed.

418
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:07,106
Oh. That's a novel approach.

419
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:10,743
So, how'd the fight with
those fraternity guys turn out?

420
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:12,411
We kicked their ass!

421
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:15,684
I was punching one guy
and kicking this other guy.

422
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:18,123
I threw one dude right through
a plate glass window.

423
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:21,458
- Really?
- Sort of, except the exact opposite.

424
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,863
Don't you think it's silly
for grown men to fight?

425
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:28,300
Did you see the movie Kickboxer?
They're all grown men.

426
00:27:30,105 --> 00:27:32,039
Are we going to your apartment now?

427
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:36,572
I'm going back to work.

428
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:39,239
- Where do you work?
- Right there.

429
00:27:40,448 --> 00:27:43,815
Phillips Motors!
Are you a dirty car salesman?

430
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:47,582
- No. I'm a dirty accountant.
- Hey, Kathy!

431
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:52,855
Break's over, sweetheart.
Get your ass in here! Now!

432
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:56,022
- Who's that dude?
- Anton Phillips, the owner.

433
00:27:56,097 --> 00:28:00,329
- Does he always talk to you like that?
- Well, yeah.

434
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:03,929
But he's doing a live TV commercial
tomorrow, so he's worse than usual.

435
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:08,640
Anyway, it was nice
seeing you again, Mitch.

436
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:13,613
Live TV commercial?

437
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:17,551
Okay, settle down, prostitutes.

438
00:28:17,619 --> 00:28:22,420
Understand that you each get $20,
and this requires no sex.

439
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,981
No sex at all...

440
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,255
regardless of what
this character tells you.

441
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:30,423
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter?

442
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:34,332
We spend most of the money
my sister sent for Pops on this office.

443
00:28:34,402 --> 00:28:37,428
And now we're wasting the rest of it
so you can impress some girl?

444
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:40,531
No. This isn't for her.

445
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:44,238
This is so we can get a free commercial
for Dirty Work on live television.

446
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:52,149
And in five, four, three, two.

447
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,984
Hello, everyone.
I'm Anton Phillips...

448
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:57,251
President of Phillips Motors.

449
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:00,294
We'll return in a moment
to the Channel 11 Movie Matinee...

450
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:06,028
but I'm here with you live to show you
some great luxury automobiles.

451
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:09,434
Like this one-year-old
Cadillac Deville...

452
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,699
priced right at $36,000.

453
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:14,537
Fully loaded:
V-8 engine, standard.

454
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:17,942
Shock-resistant CD player, standard.

455
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:20,140
- The trunk looks kinda small.
- This is live!

456
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:23,810
I'm on live T...
Trunk's fine.

457
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:27,252
As you can see, friends,
it's not small.

458
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:29,722
It's a big trunk.
I'll show you right here.

459
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:31,884
You got a dead hooker in the trunk!

460
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,825
No! It can't be.

461
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:36,796
- It was. It was a dead hooker.
- It wasn't a dead hooker!

462
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:40,130
- I know a dead hooker when I see one.
- What's happening?

463
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:43,659
- Come on down.
- Here's another dead hooker!

464
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,205
What?

465
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,533
Oh, my goodness!

466
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:52,239
I've never seen so many dead hookers
in all my life.

467
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:54,509
Lord knows I have.

468
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:58,643
- I can remember a time...
- Look, there's Mitch on TV.

469
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,416
Yeah, there's Mitch.

470
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:05,585
And there's the Saigon whore...

471
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,527
that bit my nose off!

472
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:13,399
These are nice cars.
These are luxury automobiles.

473
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:17,165
I've got a whole place.
They're fully loaded.

474
00:30:17,238 --> 00:30:19,570
They're loaded
with dead hookers.

475
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:22,872
You're seein' things.
Don't shoot this.

476
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:26,004
- This is not part of the commercial.
- Some jerk making your life miserable?

477
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:30,108
You want revenge? Call 555-0187
and let us do your dirty work.

478
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:31,743
And we're clear.

479
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,284
Wake up, slut!

480
00:30:35,357 --> 00:30:37,086
Well, well, well.

481
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:40,321
We meet again.
Nose biter!

482
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:43,023
Time to pay the fiddler, whore!

483
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:48,294
That was great.
Let's get out of here.

484
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:52,465
Nurse, record vital signs, please.

485
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,941
If that stethoscope is as freezing cold
as it was yesterday...

486
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:58,138
I'm gonna shove it
right up your ass!

487
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,238
Vital signs normal.

488
00:31:05,553 --> 00:31:06,986
Hey, Pops!

489
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:10,252
Sam! Mitch!
What are you two fruits up to?

490
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:13,317
You should've seen it.
We just did this cool thing on TV...

491
00:31:13,395 --> 00:31:15,795
that should really help
our revenge business.

492
00:31:15,864 --> 00:31:17,491
We found our calling.

493
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:22,093
Looking back, I must've been your age
when I found my calling.

494
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,138
So you became a boxer?

495
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:27,072
That's when I started working
in stag films.

496
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:30,310
I'm gonna find Dr. Farthing.

497
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,577
Hey, look, Pops.

498
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,982
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

499
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:41,079
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to tell Sam.

500
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:43,624
Or not!

501
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,660
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Sam.

502
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:48,855
He might react badly.

503
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,866
I wouldn't want anything to break up
our relationship before I die.

504
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:57,300
Okay, I won't tell him.

505
00:31:57,372 --> 00:31:58,930
Yeah.

506
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:09,443
Note to self.
Forget about fathering children.

507
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:16,884
- Any bleeding?
- Only when I sit down.

508
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,892
What happened to your arm?

509
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,691
I'm not sure. It's either
from sleeping on it the wrong way...

510
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:25,892
or from bookmakers throwing me out
of a speeding car.

511
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:29,232
- Did you get the 50 grand?
- Not yet.

512
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:33,536
If we get some money in two weeks,
could we pay the rest in installments?

513
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:37,009
No. Well, there are nine days left.

514
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:40,980
Might I suggest kidnapping the child
of a celebrity?

515
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:46,146
You know, I realize Pops isn't your
favorite person in the whole world...

516
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,520
so I appreciate how hard
you're trying to help him out.

517
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:51,183
That's nice.

518
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,193
I've gotta tell you something.

519
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:57,163
Your father is not only your father.

520
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,525
He's also...

521
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:05,437
He's also a good man.

522
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:07,441
Your father is a good man.

523
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,170
Yeah.

524
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:10,734
Mitch, you know...

525
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,045
I wanted to...

526
00:33:16,985 --> 00:33:19,510
You're my best friend, man.

527
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:21,817
Keep your distance there, Liberace.

528
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,323
I was just...

529
00:33:25,026 --> 00:33:27,494
Hey, Kathy!
I'm glad to see you.

530
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:31,464
Did you really think you were helping me
with that disgusting stunt?

531
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:34,900
Hey, maybe you don't realize it,
but that disgusting stunt...

532
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:37,437
was this idiot's way of saying
he likes you.

533
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,900
I'm gonna stand over there.

534
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:45,042
The guy deserved it.

535
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:48,241
Because of what you did,
Anton had to sell the dealership.

536
00:33:48,316 --> 00:33:51,149
Now I'm out of a job.
Did I deserve that?

537
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:54,746
No, but you shouldn't work for a guy
who treats you bad anyway.

538
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:59,452
That is a decision for me to make,
not you or your awful company.

539
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:02,087
Putting prostitutes
in the trunks of cars?

540
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:05,132
- That is so...
- Cool!

541
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,998
The dead hooker in the trunk thing
was the coolest thing ever.

542
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,231
Wow, Mitch, congratulations.

543
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:14,298
Now you're famous for being a jerk.

544
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,276
I wish some girl would look at me
the way she looks at you.

545
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:19,279
What are you talking about?
She hates me.

546
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:21,747
No, she's mad at you.
There's a difference.

547
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:24,785
She's mad at you
because she likes you so much.

548
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:28,811
I'm short, not invisible.
Can I get a little help down here?

549
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,018
Heather, who works here,
is an abusive drunk.

550
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:35,324
Calls me names. Hits me.
Your classic dwarf hater.

551
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:37,330
Here she comes.

552
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,700
Move over, short stuff.

553
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:46,667
Hey, baby, you ever had a chick
with a beard before?

554
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:49,141
I can't say that I have,
bearded broad.

555
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,509
Then, sugar, you haven't lived.

556
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:58,115
Note to self.
I don't want to live.

557
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,488
I'll be in my trailer, honey.

558
00:35:01,556 --> 00:35:05,492
If you want it,
come and get it.

559
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:10,330
Does that go for me, too?

560
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,567
So can you help me?

561
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:15,967
Yeah, we can help you.

562
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:39,055
No beard.

563
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:41,595
My problem is with
these guys next door.

564
00:35:41,663 --> 00:35:45,326
They drive around in their Porsche
90 miles an hour where my kids play...

565
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,833
blasting their music.

566
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:50,701
They have loud, wild parties
still going on when I get up for work.

567
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:53,297
- Sounds awful.
- It's unbearable.

568
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,740
It's unbearable to live next door
to that house.

569
00:35:56,711 --> 00:36:00,442
Then we'll make it unbearable
to live in that house.

570
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:08,745
This should do it.

571
00:36:08,823 --> 00:36:11,883
Oh, Mitch, this is brutal.

572
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:13,927
We hide these fish
all over the house?

573
00:36:13,995 --> 00:36:15,929
And they'll stink for days.

574
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:18,056
Okay, let's go.

575
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,451
Come on, quick.

576
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:41,689
My flight doesn't leave for an hour.

577
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,586
- Nice place you've got.
- Yeah, yeah.

578
00:36:52,433 --> 00:36:54,025
You want it?

579
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:55,535
Check it out.

580
00:36:56,471 --> 00:36:57,904
Looks good.

581
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:02,275
What's the problem?

582
00:37:03,244 --> 00:37:04,677
Smells like fish.

583
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:06,976
What was that? Some sort of signal?

584
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:09,016
Is that a signal?
You wearing a wire?

585
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:11,313
No. It really does smell
like fish in here.

586
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:13,513
You're a damn cop! That's it.

587
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:16,056
Show these guys what we do to cops.

588
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:18,592
Say hello to the devil for me.

589
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:20,092
Behind you!

590
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,031
I've been hit. Kill them!

591
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,589
Kill them!

592
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:30,103
Make your gun fight
like the devil himself!

593
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:33,538
Burn in hell, you bastards!

594
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:36,668
Oh, sweet Jesus! He got me.

595
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:41,681
Mark, over there. Grab it.
I use it to cut firewood.

596
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,180
What's he using? You're killing me
with that chain saw!

597
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:55,195
He took away my chain saw,
and now he's using it on me.

598
00:37:57,799 --> 00:38:00,632
My, God! Is that a hand grenade?

599
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:15,882
Good Lord!

600
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,011
We gotta get out of here.
Will you come on?

601
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:31,322
That's it!
This noise has got to stop!

602
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:36,733
Oh, my God.
I never asked you to do this.

603
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:39,102
Ed, we gotta go.

604
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:41,232
Could you pay us now?

605
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:45,006
Four hundred bucks, and we need
$50,000 in six days?

606
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,708
- We're not even close.
- I know we're not.

607
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:51,510
There's a message.

608
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:53,520
Maybe it's a job.

609
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:56,656
Hey, fatso. Fatso!

610
00:38:56,724 --> 00:39:00,524
It's me, Hamilton, your boss
from the movie theater.

611
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:02,756
I saw that TV commercial you made.

612
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:07,199
Fat, fat, fat! When you sweat,
marbles come off your ass.

613
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:16,299
Hello. Dirty Work.

614
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:21,906
No, I can hear you fine.
It must be your phone.

615
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,708
Sure, we'll be right over.

616
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,819
So this whole block will become a
parking lot for the Chelsea Opera House?

617
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:40,231
Yep, to make sure none
of Travis Cole's friends...

618
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:43,361
have to park their Mercedes
on the street.

619
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,304
I've lived in this house for 62 years.

620
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,808
Now the bulldozers
are coming tomorrow.

621
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:54,842
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- No, no. I have a plan.

622
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,299
What do you make of this?

623
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:16,632
Either it's a trick and we're walking
into a huge ambush...

624
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:21,038
or this is the single, dumbest act
in the history of crime.

625
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:35,622
How we gonna get out of here?

626
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,750
We can't make bail.
Pops is gonna die.

627
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:41,260
We're gonna be left here to rot.

628
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:45,561
I'm not worried about the rotting now,
I'm worried about something else.

629
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:48,067
What else is there to worry about?

630
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:51,536
We're in prison with prisoners.

631
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,437
So what?

632
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:57,204
So what? You know what prisoners do
to each other all the time.

633
00:40:57,278 --> 00:40:59,610
No. What?

634
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,443
You don't know?

635
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:03,847
No!

636
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:05,351
They...

637
00:41:17,064 --> 00:41:18,497
I never heard that.

638
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,761
You never heard that?

639
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:22,769
How could you have never
heard of that?

640
00:41:22,837 --> 00:41:25,431
That's what prisons
are most famous for.

641
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:29,442
All right, let's go.

642
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,612
Not you, tubby.

643
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:35,911
You sure you don't want him, too?

644
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:42,282
The popcorn in the bulldozer stunt
was allegedly perpetrated by these men:

645
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:44,517
Mitchell Weaver
and Samuel McKenna.

646
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:47,459
But was this
a dangerous act of mischief...

647
00:41:47,528 --> 00:41:51,020
or a heroic example
of civil disobedience?

648
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:54,329
Those two boys sure are heroes to me.

649
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:58,862
If Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna
are heroes, then who's the villain?

650
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:02,067
Many would say that would be
the builder of the parking lot...

651
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:05,840
millionaire real estate mogul,
Travis Co...

652
00:42:05,913 --> 00:42:09,371
Damn it. That looks bad.
We've got to stop the hemorrhaging.

653
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,975
Martin, could you wait outside?

654
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:14,544
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about what happened.

655
00:42:14,622 --> 00:42:17,318
It's all right, Martin.
It wasn't your fault.

656
00:42:21,028 --> 00:42:23,588
By the end of the day, I'd like Martin
jobless, homeless...

657
00:42:23,664 --> 00:42:26,565
penniless and hairless.

658
00:42:33,741 --> 00:42:36,676
You fellows have a lot of growing up
to do, I'll tell you that.

659
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:39,679
Ridiculous!
Completely ridiculous!

660
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:44,714
Can you believe these characters?
Way out of line!

661
00:42:44,785 --> 00:42:48,243
Have a good mind
to go to the warden about this.

662
00:42:48,322 --> 00:42:51,758
The lack of respect
hurts the most.

663
00:42:51,826 --> 00:42:53,418
That's what hurts the most.

664
00:42:53,494 --> 00:42:56,725
Except for the other thing.
That hurts the most.

665
00:42:56,797 --> 00:43:00,426
But the lack of respect
hurts the second most.

666
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,265
Weaver, McKenna,
you're free to go.

667
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:08,841
Ridiculous!

668
00:43:11,746 --> 00:43:13,873
First of all,
Mrs. Murphy is owed...

669
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:17,349
my deepest apologies for the hardships
she's unjustly suffered.

670
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:22,856
Secondly, all charges have been dropped
against Mr. Weaver and Mr. McKenna...

671
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:25,448
who are not criminals
but heroes.

672
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:28,188
In fact, all of us are going out
for popcorn.

673
00:43:29,096 --> 00:43:31,462
Okay, Spunky,
you can come too.

674
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:36,002
I think he's got his thumb
up that dog's ass.

675
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,868
Gentlemen, I think I have a job for you.

676
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:45,643
Mitch, Sam, considering your recent
exploits as mischief makers...

677
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:48,443
I think you may be able to help me.

678
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:54,079
There's a small walk-up building
I own over at 99 Franklin Street.

679
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:58,023
It's low-income housing.
My way of giving back to the community.

680
00:43:58,092 --> 00:44:01,220
But much to my chagrin,
the criminal element...

681
00:44:01,295 --> 00:44:04,731
has reared its ugly head
in the form of drug dealers, gangs...

682
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:07,893
even a house of prostitution.

683
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:11,233
He's doing that... Why don't you get
the cops to get them out?

684
00:44:11,305 --> 00:44:13,364
It's not that simple.

685
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,898
As long as those criminals
pay their rent on time...

686
00:44:16,977 --> 00:44:19,537
the police say I have no grounds
to evict them.

687
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:23,845
- What do you want us to do?
- Get the building condemned.

688
00:44:23,918 --> 00:44:28,617
By any means necessary. That way,
everyone will be evicted legally.

689
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:32,455
Then I'll fix it up, rent the apartments
to honest, hardworking people.

690
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:36,223
I don't know. We've never done
anything this big before.

691
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:39,460
Gentlemen, let me give you
a minute to think it over.

692
00:44:41,202 --> 00:44:42,965
Doesn't it seem like...

693
00:44:43,037 --> 00:44:45,130
He's definitely doing that dog.

694
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:48,903
Doesn't it seem like we're getting
into something over our heads here?

695
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:51,877
So, gentlemen, have you decided?

696
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,714
We'll do it...

697
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:57,580
for $50,000.

698
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,452
Very well.
$50,000 it is.

699
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:08,394
Good news, Mr. McKenna.

700
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:11,295
All right, boys!
Bring on the whore!

701
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:13,629
No, it's not a whore.

702
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:16,795
We're gonna get you the $50,000
for your heart transplant.

703
00:45:16,871 --> 00:45:18,429
That's good, too.

704
00:45:18,505 --> 00:45:20,632
We don't have the money yet, Pops.

705
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:23,768
- Yeah, but it's a sure thing.
- Excuse me.

706
00:45:23,844 --> 00:45:26,176
Sam, can I have a word with you?

707
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:28,909
- Sure.
- Thank you.

708
00:45:28,983 --> 00:45:31,918
Wait. You didn't tell him, did ya?

709
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:35,413
Thanks.

710
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:38,424
But I still want to,
and I can't promise you I won't.

711
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:44,021
Just getting my photo album.
What are you so jumpy about?

712
00:45:44,999 --> 00:45:49,163
I don't know. Maybe it's your
lifelong pattern of random assault.

713
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:51,431
Look at this.

714
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:54,702
That's me fighting for the middleweight
championship of the Golden Gloves.

715
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,939
That's me shaking hands with
Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. President.

716
00:46:00,014 --> 00:46:01,276
My goodness!

717
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:05,177
That's your mom giving me a...

718
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:06,685
I'm sorry.

719
00:46:06,754 --> 00:46:09,382
That's Sam's mom.

720
00:46:10,457 --> 00:46:13,221
Yeah. Irene.

721
00:46:15,164 --> 00:46:18,565
His blood levels are good.
Should cut down on finger foods.

722
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:20,568
What happened to your foot?

723
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:24,265
What I don't understand is,
when you owe a bookie a lot of money...

724
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:28,799
and he blows off one of your toes,
you still owe him the money.

725
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:32,904
Doesn't seem fair since he's gonna
kill me in four days anyway.

726
00:46:32,981 --> 00:46:36,178
Mitch says we'll have the money
for you.

727
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:41,086
Oh, thank God!
I mean, that's good news, Sam.

728
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:43,681
We just have to get
the building condemned.

729
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,422
We go in, wreck the joint.
Pops is saved.

730
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,957
Did you call him Pops?

731
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,654
What havoc are you planning now?

732
00:47:20,729 --> 00:47:22,993
What are you doing here?

733
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:25,933
Actually, I was looking for you.

734
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:29,061
I saw how you and your friend
saved that woman's house.

735
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:33,404
Guess you can use your powers
for good as well as evil.

736
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,678
I'm on my way
to my grandmother's place.

737
00:47:37,746 --> 00:47:39,907
Do you want to walk me?

738
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,315
Note to self. Mitch was right.

739
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:45,080
No, he wasn't.

740
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,247
It's too late.
It's already on tape.

741
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,691
I'm glad you finally realized
you should never take crap from anybody.

742
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,888
There's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma.

743
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:59,059
Your grandmother lives here?
At 99 Franklin Street?

744
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:02,262
Yep. Grandma,
I'd like you to meet Mitch.

745
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:06,467
Hi. Kathy's told me about you.
You're a hero.

746
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:11,775
Well, today I'm a hero. Tomorrow,
who knows? You might both hate me.

747
00:48:13,248 --> 00:48:15,739
Girls, I'm over here.

748
00:48:15,818 --> 00:48:18,685
Excuse me, Mitch.
It was nice meeting you.

749
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:24,086
Are those prostitutes?
I mean, who are those girls?

750
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,128
They work with my grandmother. She runs
a business out of her apartment.

751
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:32,292
Sixty years old
and still going strong.

752
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,927
Yeah, I bet she is.

753
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:37,699
Would you like to come in
for some coffee?

754
00:48:37,773 --> 00:48:42,403
Oh, no. I have to go lift weights.

755
00:48:42,477 --> 00:48:43,910
What?

756
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:49,150
Okay, some other time, maybe?

757
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,845
That'd be great.

758
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:53,319
Okay. Bye.

759
00:49:07,936 --> 00:49:11,463
That sweet girl's grandmother
runs a whorehouse...

760
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,906
out of the building
we're about to destroy?

761
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:17,605
Yeah. I feel awful doing this to Kathy.

762
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,115
Mitch, you're starting to like Kathy,
aren't you?

763
00:49:21,183 --> 00:49:23,583
No!

764
00:49:23,652 --> 00:49:27,986
I know you. When you say no
like that, you mean yes.

765
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:30,320
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

766
00:49:30,392 --> 00:49:33,361
Did you ever rob a bank?

767
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:36,556
Did you ever climb Mount Everest?

768
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:41,035
Did you ever say you could see why
women find Sean Connery sexy?

769
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,264
Okay, so I like Kathy a little.

770
00:49:46,341 --> 00:49:50,471
Man, I hate the fact we have to destroy
her grandmother's building.

771
00:49:50,545 --> 00:49:52,809
- But we have to.
- Yep.

772
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:43,055
We did it, man!
I can't believe it! Pops lives.

773
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,185
What'd I tell you?
Here's to a brand-new heart.

774
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:49,560
That's right. I couldn't have done it
without a genius like you.

775
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,895
I couldn't have done it without...

776
00:51:53,602 --> 00:51:56,435
a big oaf to smash down
all the doors like you.

777
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:58,132
Yeah!

778
00:51:59,274 --> 00:52:01,708
Hey, we should go pick up
our 50 grand.

779
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:03,745
Good idea.

780
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:06,110
Hey, is that the building?

781
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,646
Building owner James Kirkpatrick
had little to say.

782
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:13,517
Kirkpatrick owns that building?

783
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:18,287
- What happened to the building?
- I have no idea, but I'll find out.

784
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,056
Resident Gladys Waite
lamented the fall of the building.

785
00:52:21,129 --> 00:52:23,120
I don't know what I'll do.

786
00:52:23,198 --> 00:52:27,134
I've been running a sewing business
out of my apartment for 30 years.

787
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:29,033
Sewing business?

788
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:33,598
Tenants are staying at a local shelter.
But what about the condemned building?

789
00:52:33,675 --> 00:52:36,701
Unfortunately, I'll have to level it.

790
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:40,145
Enough boring talk. I want to talk
about my true passion...

791
00:52:40,215 --> 00:52:42,945
which is the grand reopening
of the opera house.

792
00:52:43,018 --> 00:52:45,953
All proceeds go to benefit
the homeless.

793
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:50,754
You know how I feel about the homeless.
They're human beings and have no homes.

794
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:02,336
May I help you gentlemen?

795
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:05,202
Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna
to see Travis Cole.

796
00:53:05,273 --> 00:53:08,436
Mr. Cole said your services
are no longer needed.

797
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,705
No longer...

798
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:13,646
Fellas, I have an idea.
Get Mr. Cole on the phone...

799
00:53:13,715 --> 00:53:15,478
I have a better idea.

800
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,348
Why don't we kick
every one of your asses...

801
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,583
and then go upstairs
and kick Cole's ass, too?

802
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,597
All right, I screwed up.

803
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,432
What do we do now?

804
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:41,308
Homeless guys.

805
00:53:42,377 --> 00:53:47,610
I'll give you a dollar each if you run
into this building and yell and scream.

806
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,243
That's very nice,
but I think what you need...

807
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:54,755
are like some psycho,
out-of-control homeless guys.

808
00:53:54,823 --> 00:53:58,190
We're more the broken, spiritless...

809
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,229
"I've lost the will to live" type
homeless guys.

810
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:03,628
How about for two dollars?

811
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:24,909
Mitch, Sam, what a pleasant surprise.

812
00:54:24,986 --> 00:54:27,887
- Where's our money?
- What money?

813
00:54:27,956 --> 00:54:31,050
You owe us $50,000 for getting the
building on Franklin Street condemned.

814
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:32,718
We want it now.

815
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:35,854
But I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

816
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:39,697
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

817
00:54:39,768 --> 00:54:41,201
Son of a bitch!

818
00:54:41,269 --> 00:54:44,500
Once you stopped my bulldozer
from leveling that old lady's house...

819
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,803
I couldn't let you get away with it.

820
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:50,936
So I figured out a way for you to
help me and hurt you at the same time.

821
00:54:51,012 --> 00:54:53,947
I guess I showed you guys something
about dirty work.

822
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:57,542
Whatever. But we're not leaving
without our 50 grand.

823
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,460
When you jumped on that guard's back
and yelled...

824
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,727
"The CIA put a chip in my brain"...

825
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,497
I was laughing so hard
I almost shit my pants.

826
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,731
Almost?

827
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:23,337
Thanks. That was fun.

828
00:55:23,411 --> 00:55:25,743
More fun than working for Cole.

829
00:55:27,082 --> 00:55:30,108
- You worked for Cole?
- All of us have.

830
00:55:31,253 --> 00:55:32,845
I had a life...

831
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:37,290
a house, cars,
respect in the community.

832
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,055
Suddenly it was all taken away.

833
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,586
I finally realized
just how low I'd sunk.

834
00:55:43,665 --> 00:55:46,395
I was at my daughter's soccer game.

835
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:48,265
She lives with her mom.

836
00:55:48,336 --> 00:55:52,796
I was standing on the sidelines
and a cop asked me to move along.

837
00:55:52,874 --> 00:55:55,570
That's when it hit me.
I'm not even a human.

838
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,077
Here's your $2.

839
00:56:05,754 --> 00:56:09,349
How could you stand outside
my grandmother's home...

840
00:56:09,424 --> 00:56:11,392
the day before you destroyed it?

841
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:14,155
You're telling me you thought
she was a drug dealer?

842
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:18,495
- No, I thought she was a whore!
- What is wrong with you?

843
00:56:18,566 --> 00:56:21,660
Look, we made a mistake.

844
00:56:21,736 --> 00:56:24,102
The worst thing is
we didn't even get paid.

845
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,538
The worst thing is
you didn't get paid?

846
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:30,544
- The reason we needed that money...
- Stop right there.

847
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:34,048
You drive these people from their homes
and all you care about is money?

848
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:36,049
I should call the police.

849
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:40,178
I'm really sorry about what happened,
but listen...

850
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:43,554
I'm done listening.
Have a nice life.

851
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:52,057
No, beat it, nurse!

852
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:55,864
Come back when you're a broad!

853
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:00,935
Hey, fellas.

854
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:04,077
Why so glum?

855
00:57:04,145 --> 00:57:08,548
We didn't get the money.
Mr. Sure Thing here was wrong.

856
00:57:08,616 --> 00:57:11,881
I don't know what happened.
I messed up. I'm sorry.

857
00:57:11,953 --> 00:57:13,420
That was easy.

858
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:19,324
You can chalk this up as a loss
and forget about it. I can't do that.

859
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,227
Pops is my dad.

860
00:57:22,297 --> 00:57:24,891
I'm sorry.
I gotta tell him. Sam...

861
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:27,230
No. I'll tell him.

862
00:57:27,302 --> 00:57:29,236
Tell me what?

863
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,767
I'm Mitch's father, too.

864
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:35,870
It's true.

865
00:57:35,944 --> 00:57:39,573
This is no time for one
of your practical jokes.

866
00:57:39,647 --> 00:57:41,945
Show him the locket.

867
00:57:42,016 --> 00:57:43,347
Show me what?

868
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,726
This is Pops...

869
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:56,223
and your mother!

870
00:57:56,297 --> 00:57:58,128
Yeah, I know.

871
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,860
You cheated on Mom?

872
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,734
No! She was there, too.
Who do you think took the picture?

873
00:58:05,173 --> 00:58:09,473
Wait a minute.
So that makes us...

874
00:58:09,544 --> 00:58:11,375
Brothers.

875
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:15,543
- You lied to me!
- Pops wouldn't let me tell.

876
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,051
Don't blame him.
You should have told me.

877
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,247
You know how hard that man
can squeeze a pair of balls?

878
00:58:21,322 --> 00:58:23,290
It's not bad that we're brothers.

879
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:25,553
Sure, for you!
You've got everything.

880
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,721
You're smart, people like you,
you never have to pay for sex.

881
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,958
Pops was the one thing I had
that you didn't.

882
00:58:31,032 --> 00:58:33,500
Now I don't even have that.

883
00:58:33,568 --> 00:58:36,401
Stay away from me, all right?

884
00:58:50,251 --> 00:58:54,745
That was really funny,
siccing the cops on us.

885
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,314
Really?
I thought it was funny...

886
00:58:57,392 --> 00:59:01,658
but I'm surprised you did
because you got your asses kicked.

887
00:59:05,366 --> 00:59:08,335
Things will get better.
Hang in there.

888
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:09,995
Thanks for listening.

889
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,439
Listen, pal...

890
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:18,411
you ever need anything,
I mean anything at all...

891
00:59:19,814 --> 00:59:21,247
you come to me.

892
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:23,784
- Can I stay at your place tonight?
- This is the thing.

893
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:28,050
I live over at the Y, as you know.

894
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:34,887
I got a roommate, Old Jack, who is
a little particular about strangers.

895
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:36,954
No, problem, Jimmy. Thanks.

896
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,898
He just got his knee drained.

897
00:59:39,968 --> 00:59:41,902
I'll find another place.

898
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:47,169
He needed it, too. That thing
was getting a little bit ripe.

899
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:50,234
I get the picture.
I'll sleep in my car.

900
00:59:50,311 --> 00:59:53,007
Old Jack's a odd duck, I tell you.

901
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:59,343
Many times I catch him staring
at me sleeping, which is off-putting.

902
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,752
- I guess that would be.
- His feet bleed.

903
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:03,757
I don't want to stay at your place!

904
01:00:03,825 --> 01:00:06,419
Point taken.
Point taken, Mitch.

905
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,808
Hey, buddy.

906
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,945
I'm trying to get some sleep
back here.

907
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:56,633
Note to self. Remember, no matter
how bad life gets, there is always beer.

908
01:00:59,547 --> 01:01:02,175
All right, I screwed up.
What do we do now?

909
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,683
Homeless guys.

910
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:07,448
I'll give you a dollar each if you run
into this building and yell and scream.

911
01:01:07,522 --> 01:01:10,047
I left the recorder on.

912
01:01:13,361 --> 01:01:15,659
I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

913
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:19,188
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

914
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:21,235
Son of a bitch!

915
01:01:23,104 --> 01:01:27,473
I guess I showed you something
about dirty work.

916
01:01:32,714 --> 01:01:34,306
What are you doing?

917
01:01:34,382 --> 01:01:36,850
Getting the money from Cole.

918
01:01:38,753 --> 01:01:41,586
My tape recorder was running.

919
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,057
Everything in Cole's office
I got on tape. And I got a great plan.

920
01:01:45,126 --> 01:01:49,426
Another plan? Like the plan
that got us here in the first place?

921
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:55,197
I think I know how to get the $50,000
to save the apartment. I need your help.

922
01:01:57,739 --> 01:02:02,438
Look, a lot of stuff came pouring
out of me at the hospital...

923
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:06,139
because I was in shock
about what I'd heard.

924
01:02:06,214 --> 01:02:09,274
How did you feel when you found out?

925
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,376
I don't know.
At first I felt a little weird.

926
01:02:12,453 --> 01:02:17,049
But we've always been like brothers.
Now it's just official.

927
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,650
It's kind of cool.

928
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:23,458
I guess it is cool.
But it does change things.

929
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,828
How?

930
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:27,129
Remember in second grade...

931
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:30,796
when we used rusty soda can tops
to become blood brothers?

932
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:35,502
It was a bunch of trouble for nothing
because we were already brothers.

933
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,307
Yeah, that's right.

934
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:42,076
Hey, remember in fifth grade
when I was under the monkey bars...

935
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:44,482
and I peeked at
your sister's underwear?

936
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:46,213
Remember that?

937
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:49,586
I was sneaking a peek
at my own sister's underwear.

938
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:55,152
That's right. And remember
in 12th grade, you had sex with her?

939
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,597
Okay, enough reminiscing.

940
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:07,274
Listen.

941
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:11,573
In the past two weeks, I've been
beaten up, thrown out of buildings...

942
01:03:11,646 --> 01:03:14,615
I've slept in my car,
spent the night in jail...

943
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:17,845
And when you were in jail,
those guys...

944
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,855
The point is, you aren't the only ones
who got screwed over.

945
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,858
Yes, I made a big mistake
destroying your building...

946
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,053
but I know how we can get it back.

947
01:03:27,128 --> 01:03:30,063
Why should we believe you?

948
01:03:30,131 --> 01:03:34,534
I walked through life believing
the only principle I had to live by...

949
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,968
was "Don't take crap from anybody."

950
01:03:37,038 --> 01:03:39,529
Suddenly all that changed.

951
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,235
Suddenly I was trying to do something
for someone else.

952
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:46,713
We were trying to earn $50,000
to get a heart transplant for our dad.

953
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,047
You two are brothers?

954
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:52,712
Yeah, it's a long story.

955
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,721
My dad boned his mom.

956
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,723
Okay, it's a short story.

957
01:03:57,892 --> 01:04:01,589
I'm saying that when you're doing it
for someone else...

958
01:04:01,662 --> 01:04:05,154
it's not just revenge,
it's standing up for yourself.

959
01:04:05,233 --> 01:04:08,930
That's why I'm asking all of us
to stand up for ourselves.

960
01:04:09,003 --> 01:04:14,066
Travis Cole screwed all of us.
I say we fight back. Are you with me?

961
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:22,680
Are you with me based on the guarantee
that if I'm wrong, you can kick my ass?

962
01:04:26,954 --> 01:04:31,118
I understand how upset you were
when you found out what we did.

963
01:04:31,192 --> 01:04:33,126
I want to thank you
for going along with us.

964
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:36,686
I promise you'll get your building back.

965
01:04:36,764 --> 01:04:38,197
Okay, Mitch.

966
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:43,137
Don't screw me over again.
I mean it.

967
01:04:45,473 --> 01:04:47,407
Why didn't he punch you, too?

968
01:04:47,475 --> 01:04:49,375
I have no idea.

969
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:55,474
Deciding to fight back against Cole
is turning things around for me.

970
01:04:55,550 --> 01:05:00,715
Travis Cole is empty inside, so he has
to make everyone around him empty.

971
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:04,849
That's what he did to me.
But I'm not empty anymore.

972
01:05:04,926 --> 01:05:08,589
I'm filled with something,
filled with purpose...

973
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:11,996
filled with hope,
filled with dignity.

974
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:14,000
It's all thanks to you g...

975
01:05:15,303 --> 01:05:17,134
Guys?

976
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,639
Guys, wait up.

977
01:05:25,746 --> 01:05:28,840
How you doin'? I got a delivery
of some opera costumes here.

978
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:31,646
- What's the company name?
- Company name?

979
01:05:36,757 --> 01:05:38,349
Very clever.

980
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,335
These brownies are great.

981
01:05:52,006 --> 01:05:55,772
Let's go, prostitutes, homeless guys.
Shake a leg.

982
01:05:55,843 --> 01:05:58,573
Come on, haven't got all day.
Let's go.

983
01:05:58,646 --> 01:06:01,513
Good Lord! I'm in whore heaven!

984
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,351
What are they watching?

985
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,758
In this corner, weighing in...

986
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:17,798
at 225 pounds...

987
01:06:17,865 --> 01:06:21,892
the former heavyweight champion
of the world...

988
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:23,834
Kenny Norton!

989
01:06:24,906 --> 01:06:28,273
And his opponent Gary Coleman!

990
01:06:30,878 --> 01:06:34,314
Come on, man, bring it! Bring it!

991
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,882
Well, here we are.

992
01:06:45,259 --> 01:06:49,025
Building tenants, you'll be serving
as the ushers and ticket takers.

993
01:06:49,096 --> 01:06:52,293
So take one of those,
and Kathy will tell you what to do.

994
01:06:52,366 --> 01:06:55,130
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I don't know why I'm here.

995
01:06:55,202 --> 01:07:00,003
Why are you here? Wait, I remember.
Intense physical attraction to me.

996
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,939
What's the trouble, sir?

997
01:07:06,013 --> 01:07:11,110
My costume is not here. I cannot go
on a stage without my costume.

998
01:07:11,185 --> 01:07:14,780
Relax. I will track down
your costume personally.

999
01:07:14,855 --> 01:07:19,519
By the way, you're a fat guy.
Would you care for a brownie?

1000
01:07:20,628 --> 01:07:23,859
Excuse me, coming through.
Pardon me.

1001
01:07:23,931 --> 01:07:27,196
Excuse me. Sorry.
Coming through here.

1002
01:07:27,268 --> 01:07:31,602
I know I must really smell.
Plus, I farted. Coming through.

1003
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:35,005
Joining me, the man responsible
for this glorious event...

1004
01:07:35,076 --> 01:07:37,408
real estate mogul Travis Cole.

1005
01:07:37,478 --> 01:07:41,141
Thank you. I'm proud of two things
about tonight's event.

1006
01:07:41,215 --> 01:07:46,016
First, all proceeds from the opera
will go to benefit the homeless.

1007
01:07:46,087 --> 01:07:50,285
And secondly, I personally oversaw
every aspect of this production.

1008
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,452
And I believe it will be known
as the finest staging...

1009
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:56,223
of Don Giovanni ever presented.

1010
01:07:56,297 --> 01:07:58,925
Excuse me, coming through.

1011
01:08:00,735 --> 01:08:03,863
Hey, did you fart? Oh, I think
that was me from before. Sorry.

1012
01:08:03,938 --> 01:08:05,872
Excuse me, coming through.

1013
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:09,205
Fellas, you've heard the old saying:

1014
01:08:09,276 --> 01:08:12,939
"In the land of the blind,
a man with one eye is king."

1015
01:08:13,014 --> 01:08:15,847
Well, today, in the land
of the skunks...

1016
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:18,544
the man with half a nose is king.

1017
01:08:24,525 --> 01:08:26,049
Hello, everyone.

1018
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:32,861
I'm your mayor, Adrian Riggins.
Thank you.

1019
01:08:32,933 --> 01:08:35,868
Before tonight's performance
of Don Giovanni...

1020
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:39,667
let's take a moment to recognize the man
that made this night possible...

1021
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:44,677
the best friend this city
has ever had, Travis Cole.

1022
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,754
Enjoy the opera, everyone.

1023
01:09:15,376 --> 01:09:16,968
What the...

1024
01:09:19,547 --> 01:09:22,607
Wow! Get a load
of that mountain range.

1025
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:25,380
Come back, baby.

1026
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:30,724
This is the most daring portrayal
of Don Giovanni I've ever seen.

1027
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:34,488
Let's go. Time for Pops
to climb that mountain.

1028
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:35,995
What's up, fruity?

1029
01:09:36,063 --> 01:09:39,658
How did you... It doesn't matter.
You'll be gone in a minute.

1030
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:43,430
Aha! You didn't count on
my loyal army of prostitutes, did you?

1031
01:09:45,606 --> 01:09:47,096
What do you want?

1032
01:09:47,174 --> 01:09:50,234
Just relax. Let's watch
your dirty opera.

1033
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,745
You're a hell of a woman, baby.

1034
01:09:52,813 --> 01:09:56,010
Let me take you to Vegas.
You know what they say.

1035
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:59,052
It ain't over till the fat lady
checks into a hotel with Pops.

1036
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,556
What are you doing?
You're ruining Don Giovanni.

1037
01:10:02,623 --> 01:10:05,319
Don Giovanni?
Who's that dude?

1038
01:10:05,392 --> 01:10:07,383
The opera.
You're ruining the opera.

1039
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:11,659
Oh, the opera. Yes, we are ruining that.
Sam, now!

1040
01:10:11,732 --> 01:10:14,292
You got it, buddy!

1041
01:10:14,368 --> 01:10:18,896
Sing the song, boys!

1042
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:25,143
Bow, and kneel before me!

1043
01:10:29,783 --> 01:10:32,343
Jimmy! Release the skunks.

1044
01:10:32,419 --> 01:10:34,944
Okay, I got it. I'm on it.

1045
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:38,048
Don't let me down, boys.

1046
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:41,219
Run. Fly. Fly away.

1047
01:10:41,295 --> 01:10:45,163
Run! Run out! Fly!

1048
01:10:45,232 --> 01:10:46,665
Fly!

1049
01:10:51,472 --> 01:10:56,034
Skunks used to heighten the atmosphere
of squalor and despair. Brilliant!

1050
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:07,152
Oh, the cameras are here.

1051
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,155
By the way, Travis...

1052
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,748
remember when you said this?

1053
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:17,354
Note to self. Making love to blowup doll
not as good as advertised.

1054
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:22,366
Sorry. I must have gone too far.

1055
01:11:22,436 --> 01:11:23,869
I'll just...

1056
01:11:25,105 --> 01:11:27,539
I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

1057
01:11:27,608 --> 01:11:30,975
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

1058
01:11:31,045 --> 01:11:32,672
Son of a bitch!

1059
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:36,580
I bet those reporters would love
to get hold of this tape.

1060
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,887
How much do you want?

1061
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:43,446
All I want is the $50,000
you owe us.

1062
01:11:43,524 --> 01:11:45,014
$50,000.

1063
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:48,084
Make it out to Dr. Farthing.

1064
01:11:48,162 --> 01:11:50,630
Kirkpatrick.

1065
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:52,962
Kirkpatrick is going to punch you
in the stomach.

1066
01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:54,967
Here you go.

1067
01:11:58,138 --> 01:12:00,072
You'll sign this contract...

1068
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,576
that gives back ownership
of 99 Franklin Street to Kirkpatrick.

1069
01:12:03,644 --> 01:12:06,442
Give it here.

1070
01:12:06,513 --> 01:12:09,573
Thanks, Mitch.
I'm glad I didn't have to punch you.

1071
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:11,584
Me too, buddy.

1072
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:16,252
Okay, Cole, it's been nice
doing business with you.

1073
01:12:16,323 --> 01:12:18,917
You probably want to go home,
kick back...

1074
01:12:18,993 --> 01:12:22,087
and enjoy a nice glass
of Chihuahua piss or something.

1075
01:12:22,162 --> 01:12:23,254
Farthing.

1076
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:28,965
Here's the check for $50,000.

1077
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:30,469
That's great, Mitch.

1078
01:12:33,574 --> 01:12:36,065
Want to bet I don't go to my bookie?

1079
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:40,409
You're paying off your bookie so you can
live to perform Pops's heart transplant.

1080
01:12:48,589 --> 01:12:50,989
Note to self.

1081
01:12:51,058 --> 01:12:53,925
Stop payment on $50,000 check.

1082
01:12:57,564 --> 01:12:58,758
Oh, Travis.

1083
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,629
Son of a bitch, bastard!

1084
01:13:00,701 --> 01:13:04,637
You idiot. That contract
won't hold up for ten seconds...

1085
01:13:04,705 --> 01:13:07,139
after my lawyers get through with it.

1086
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:11,007
And, oops, what happened
to your tape?

1087
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:15,811
You wrecked it. Well, don't worry.
I have one on the house P.A. System.

1088
01:13:15,883 --> 01:13:17,578
Hit it, Kathy.

1089
01:13:19,553 --> 01:13:22,386
Note to self. Remember to get
ass wart cream...

1090
01:13:22,456 --> 01:13:24,617
for giant wart on my ass.

1091
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:27,456
It's a little bit past that.

1092
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,656
You bastard! You can't destroy me.
I'm Travis Cole.

1093
01:13:30,731 --> 01:13:33,791
No one destroy's Travis Cole!
No one!

1094
01:13:37,404 --> 01:13:39,304
Fat lady, are you okay?

1095
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:44,675
Yes, I'm okay. Just keep
that crazy old man away from me.

1096
01:13:46,847 --> 01:13:49,008
What the hell is going on?

1097
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:52,018
I don't care if you are my son.
Get your own broad.

1098
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,749
Bravo!

1099
01:13:57,157 --> 01:14:01,218
In a startling turn of events
at the opera house...

1100
01:14:01,295 --> 01:14:05,561
real estate mogul Travis Cole
has been arrested for fraud.

1101
01:14:05,632 --> 01:14:07,566
Mr. Cole, anything to say?

1102
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:11,000
Good brownies.

1103
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:15,167
Jenkins, listen to me.
This is very important.

1104
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:20,908
Stop payment on a check for $50,000
I made out to a Dr. Farthing. Got that?

1105
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:24,940
Jenkins, are you ready
for some crazy, rough sex?

1106
01:14:26,019 --> 01:14:27,953
Absolutely!

1107
01:14:28,021 --> 01:14:32,685
Good, Jenkins. I'm counting on you.
And find Spunky.

1108
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:39,527
Hey, Mitch.

1109
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,468
Jimmy. Your new nose looks great.

1110
01:14:43,537 --> 01:14:46,631
Thanks. Best $200 I ever spent.

1111
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:52,873
- That girl you're with, she's not the...
- Yep.

1112
01:14:52,946 --> 01:14:57,076
Lin-Yung, the Saigon whore
who bit my nose off.

1113
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,778
We're getting hitched.

1114
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:02,113
Let's go.

1115
01:15:02,189 --> 01:15:07,593
Hold on.
I'm talking to my friend here!

1116
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:12,724
Jeez, sometimes you got
to remind the hen who the rooster is.

1117
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:15,835
Good luck to you, Jimmy.

1118
01:15:15,903 --> 01:15:18,235
Okay. See you around.

1119
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:23,573
When I say "Let's go," you go.

1120
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:27,671
Yeah? It's time you shut
your cake hole, Yoko!

1121
01:15:27,748 --> 01:15:29,181
Women.

1122
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:34,145
Don't talk back to me
in front of my friend.

1123
01:15:34,221 --> 01:15:36,655
You're making me really angry.

1124
01:15:36,723 --> 01:15:40,591
Whoa, that scares me to death.

1125
01:15:42,763 --> 01:15:46,199
You bit my new nose off!
Damn it!

1126
01:15:46,266 --> 01:15:48,894
How you feeling with your new heart?

1127
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:53,633
I feel great thanks to you and Sam,
my two boys.

1128
01:15:53,707 --> 01:15:57,438
Now that I met Gladys, I hope
they can fix another part of my body.

1129
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,809
I'll give you a hint.

1130
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,178
It rhymes with "cock."

1131
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:11,590
Sam and I got great new jobs.
Pops got his heart. And I got the girl.

1132
01:16:11,658 --> 01:16:15,526
And Dr. Farthing, well,
he got over his gambling problem.

1133
01:16:15,596 --> 01:16:19,464
But the bookies beat him
to death anyway, so he's dead.

1134
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:22,764
That's it. Bye.

1135
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:29,301
Cole, it's nice
doing business with you.

1136
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,844
Now you probably want to get home...

1137
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:39,112
Sorry.

1138
01:16:39,186 --> 01:16:41,916
- Nurse, you want to record vitals?
- Cut.

1139
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:45,823
Cole, it's been nice doing business
with you. Now you...

1140
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,656
Cut.

1141
01:16:51,632 --> 01:16:53,793
Say your line again.

1142
01:16:57,404 --> 01:17:00,532
- Check the gate please.
- Cut.

1143
01:17:03,343 --> 01:17:07,404
- Well, Cole...
- I'm trying to help you.

1144
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,881
Have you always been like this?

1145
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,180
How you got this movie,
I'll never know.

1146
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:16,586
- Some other time we could go camping?
- What?

1147
01:17:16,657 --> 01:17:19,319
- You know, just you and me.
- Let's go.

1148
01:17:19,393 --> 01:17:21,327
Mitch, I'm lonely.

1149
