00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:49,163
[Stephen] Would you stay still already?

3
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,165
[Stephen] What a geek!

4
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,167
- I'm not a geek!
- You're doing it wrong!

5
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:55,169
- Shut up!
- You're doing it wrong.

6
00:00:55,237 --> 00:00:57,262
- It doesn't go like that.
- Who asked you?

00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:00,308
- Who's your brother?
- You are, Stevie!

8
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,935
You do it like this, it'll open up in a fire,

9
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:06,139
you'll get burned and die.

What d'you got, Adcox, a big deal?

13
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,455
Medium deal, Captain.

14
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:16,889
Hey, Brian, want to come along?

15
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,757
- Dad...
- Stephen, you've come a dozen times.

16
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:22,319
Give your brother a chance. What d'you say?

17
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,422
We'll be back in a minute. How about it?

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,331

- Give it a yank, a good pull.
- [Horn Blast]

23
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,893

Okay.

29
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,009
You stay near the truck now.

30
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:44,979
That doesn't look too bad.

31
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:47,447
Drop two lines and hold the squad.

32
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:49,484

Hey, that's your old man up there, Brian.

36
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:31,025
Nice grab, Captain!

37
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,857
Take it easy. You'll be okay.

38
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,781
We got it! Come on.

- [Scream]
- Dad!

42

Hey, Brian! Brian McCaffrey, got some I.D.?

43
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:02,336
Hey, Willie! I'll give you I.D.!

44
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,374
- The littlest McCaffrey!
- How you doin'?

45
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:07,706
Hot off the presses, boys! Station assignments!

46
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,746
Hey, McCaffrey! Station assignments!

47
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,906
Why don't you hold onto that for me, huh?

48
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:14,678
Something wrong with my eyesight?

49
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,686
You really trying this fireman thing again?

50
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:20,417
- Quitting once wasn't good enough?
- It's in the blood.

51
00:06:20,491 --> 00:06:22,425
- Is that right?
- Willie, you owe me a brew!

52
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:24,484
Hold on! I'm talking to the fire chief!

53
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,961
Let's look and see what else was in your blood.

54
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:28,999
I always looked forward to getting these.

55
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:33,435
- You hold onto those, huh?
- Whoa! I got station 17!

56
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:38,134
"Aspen Snowmobile Tours. Brian McCaffrey, Sales."

57
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,472
It didn't offer the growth and challenge that I needed.

58
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:42,273
Uh-huh.

59

63
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:57,794
I was ahead of my time, Willie.

65
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,298
What's the matter with you? Aren't you even curious?

66
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,167
Engine 115, right?

67
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,370
How'd you know, you prick? These are supposed to be sealed.

68
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,676
Lucky guess.

69

- Thanks, how long you been in town?

Four months.

88

- Oh, really.
- But I, uh...

89
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:03,950
I've been really busy at the academy.

So... I don't know what--

96
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:29,507
Maybe you and I could... could get together for a beer.

97
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,673
A beer?

98
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,784

00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:53,205
- Can I come in for a second?
- Sure.

164
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,131
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

165
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:58,143
Good to see you.

166
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,479
So that's Sean, huh?

167
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,413
Geez, he's a little giant now.

168
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:07,783
You'd be surprised what a few years can do to a kid.

169
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,880
- Remember your Uncle Brian?
- No.

170
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,323
You don't remember him?

171
00:15:13,393 --> 00:15:17,523
Hey, Sean-man. Where's your daddy today?

172
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,835
Uh... Stephen's not staying here anymore.

173
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,069
He moved out last April.

174
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,880
Uh... huh.

175
00:15:34,948 --> 00:15:36,973
I'm sorry, Helen, I uh--

176
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:41,384
You guys should try picking up the phone once in a while.

178
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,401
Hey!

179
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,036
Hey.

180
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:05,134
I, uh... talked to Helen.

181
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,683
I thought Dad's boat was finally retired...

182
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,685
to the old family graveyard.

183
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,750
Don't you worry about falling out of this thing?

184
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,328
I've gotta tell you,

185
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,956
I love what you've done with the place.

186
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,193
Yeah, it's comin' along.

187
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:35,200
You want a beer?

188
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,505
Yeah, why not?

189
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:40,910
What, you been rippin' off fire stations again?

190
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,914
Just some old stuff...

191
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,542
that Adcox gave me that the department was gonna throw out.

192
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:48,052
But it's good enough for this tub.

193
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,782
What is this?

194
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:52,654
"Iron Butterfly," "Cream"?

195
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,489
You gotta be kidding! This isn't an actual operating 8-track!

196
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,495
What do you want, Brian?

197
00:16:57,563 --> 00:16:59,827
What are you doin' here?

198
00:17:03,836 --> 00:17:06,498
I wanna know why you messed with my station assignment.

199
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,870
I mean, does this really have to be...

200
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,375
one of those big brother, little brother...

201
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:13,969
you broke my G.I. Joe and I'm still pissed games?

202
00:17:14,047 --> 00:17:16,106
Man, how do you do it, huh?

203
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,207
How d'you keep coming up with...

204
00:17:18,284 --> 00:17:20,252
new and amazing ways to fuck up?

205
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,254
I mean, that Scotch bullshit?

206
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:25,655
Am I really supposed to believe you came home...

207
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,920
because you felt heartstrings moan for the family biz?

208
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:29,928
You were bankrupt! The scary thing is...

209
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:33,432
you probably coulda got away with it for awhile.

210
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,433
Hang back a little bit at the fires--

211
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,526
You know the drill.

212
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:40,629
The only problem is, that in this job...

213
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,675
there's just no place to hide.

214
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:45,677
It's not like having a bad day selling log cabins.

215
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:48,407
You have a bad day here, somebody dies.

216

And that's just not fucking good enough.

I didn't even want to be a damn fireman.

Look, I know I quit the academy before.

221
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:06,824
- And I know how you musta felt.
- Oh, you do?

222
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,867
You know how I felt?

223
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:11,369
I gotta do this, Stephen.

224
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:15,407
I need to know.

225
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:19,309
Yeah, I think you're going to find out, Brian.

Know him? I practically raised him.

00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:50,738
Help!

329
00:27:56,985 --> 00:28:00,682
Where's my brother?

330
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:03,246
I don't know. I ain't seen him, Bull.

331
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:10,196
Is anybody in here?

332
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:45,392
My God!

333
00:28:45,466 --> 00:28:47,559
I got one!

334
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:49,569
I got one!

335
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,742
I got one!

336
00:28:56,744 --> 00:28:58,678
Somebody, give me a hand!

337
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:06,646
[Coughing]

338
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,655
Is she going to be all right?

339
00:29:08,723 --> 00:29:12,250
I'm afraid you're a little too late with this one.

340
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:20,831
[Laughter]

341
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:29,599
Sorry to hear about the mannequin.

342
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:32,840
I heard you two were close.

343
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:55,389
You all right?

344
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:57,658
You didn't get burned, did you?

345
00:29:57,732 --> 00:30:00,963
Look, I'm a little busy right now.

346
00:30:06,808 --> 00:30:09,902
You've got an awful short memory for direct orders.

347
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:12,913
- I told you to stay beside me.
- I heard somebody call.

348
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,949
What was that bullshit with the standpipe?

349
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:16,278
The cap was stuck!

350
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:19,411
I told you to stay right be-fucking-side me, Brian!

351
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:23,048
Hey, look, I was doing it!

352
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:25,684
I was up there doing it!

353
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,921
You don't know, man. You don't know what I did!

354
00:30:27,996 --> 00:30:32,399
What you did was drop the ball, Probie.

355
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:36,699
You split the team up. Get that part right...

356
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:42,271
if you wanna.

357
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,197
- Let me get one of those.
- Here you go.

358
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:10,169
[Grindle] I don't know, Axe. I don't know.

359
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:12,604
That Stephen, man.

360
00:31:12,674 --> 00:31:15,507
What goes through that guy's head?

361
00:31:15,577 --> 00:31:17,670
Never wears his mask.

362
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:21,011
Making us take it on in the first room like that.

363
00:31:21,082 --> 00:31:24,518
This shit's happening too often, man.

364
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:28,022
- Could've flashed. Should've flashed!
- Yeah, but it didn't.

365
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:32,389
- Stevie knows.
- The guy's lucky.

366
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,089
[Dispatch Radio]

367
00:31:38,033 --> 00:31:40,558
- Alderman.
- Inspector Rimgale.

368
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:43,365
- I... need to get in that trunk.
- Oh, excuse me.

369
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:45,406
Thanks.

370
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,946
Pretty fancy shoes you're wearing for a fire scene.

371
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:54,504
Guess you haven't been to many fires.

372
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:57,016
We wanted to talk to you about Alan Seagrave's death.

373
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:59,383
We still haven't gotten a fire report.

374
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:02,150
You'll get that answer as soon as I do, ma'am.

375
00:32:02,223 --> 00:32:05,158
A man gets stuffed through the windshield of his own car.

376
00:32:05,226 --> 00:32:07,160
Is that an accident or arson?

377
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:11,324
[Swayzak] People are asking me. I gotta tell 'em something.

378
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,391
We're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case...

379
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:18,371
to embarrass the alderman because of his fire department cutbacks.

380
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,501
I have an uncomplicated job: to decide if a fire is arson.

381
00:32:22,577 --> 00:32:25,045
If so, to catch the son-of-a-bitch doing it.

382
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:27,604
If my investigative methods happen to muck up...

383
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:30,617
the campaign of certain mayor wanna-be's,

384
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,778
I gotta tell you,

385
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:35,448
I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.

386
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:38,924
I'm sure you're gonna have that report on my desk as soon as it's ready.

387
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:41,291
- You'll have it.
- Thank you.

388
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:46,631
That guy better not make any rights on reds in my district.

389
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,727
Hey, Swayzak?

390
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,101
You missed it.

391
00:32:53,174 --> 00:32:55,836
Get over there. Keep 'em busy.

392
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,108
You should've been there. It was fucking great!

393
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:03,582
We almost lost a whole goddamn company for you.

394
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:07,849
Since you shut down 33, there's no fucking backup.

395
00:33:07,922 --> 00:33:09,981
We appreciate it. I don't know about the rest,

396
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:14,017
- but you got my vote for mayor.
- If you have a problem, help us.

397
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,586
- Work with the task force.
- The task force?

398
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:20,361
Three guys have died because of cuts made by your fucking task force!

399
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:24,997
Know that little glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye?

400
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,837
That's your career dissipation light. It went into overtime.

401
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:30,002
- Come on, man.
- No.

402
00:33:30,078 --> 00:33:33,241
If anybody's lights are about to go out,

403
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:35,646
believe me, they're yours.

404
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,577
Thanks a lot, fellas.

405
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:42,145
You did a great job today, by the way.

406
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:45,021
Alderman, will this affect your task force findings?

407
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:47,857
No more today. Good-bye.

408
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:50,921
So this is that big city job you were talking about.

409
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:54,400
Yeah. Welcome home, Brian.

410
00:33:57,806 --> 00:34:00,707
Where's that fucking guy buy his shoes?

411
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:03,642
Did you check those out? They're like fucking butter.

412
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,770
Yoo-hoo! Hey, G-man!

413
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,781
Get outta here.

[Gargling]

415
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:18,552
Do you have to do that?

416
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:22,255
Yeah. Could you believe that fire?

417
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,822
There we were, Adcox and me...

418
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,927
pulling that lady right out of the fire's fucking throat.

419
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:32,802
We saved a life, man!

420
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:34,933
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

421
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:37,603
I love it here! Fighting 17th!

422
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,738
Goddamn!

00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:41,805
Stephen's amazing.

424
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:45,216
You see how he took that fire? By the balls!

425
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:48,449
I'm gonna be that good someday.

426
00:34:48,523 --> 00:34:51,720
You watch. You'll see.

427
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:55,729
You know what Stephen said to me?

428
00:34:55,797 --> 00:34:58,288
When the shit was coming hard,

429
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:01,426
he said, "You never know...

430
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:04,528
till the moment the fire stares you down...

431
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:08,303
- if you're just gonna do this job--"
- Or be great at it, right?

432
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:11,903
He using that line of shit on you now?

433
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,177
You think he made that little gem up?

434
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,346
My old man used to use that line every other day.

435
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,480
It's no line, man!

436
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:24,957
That's no line.

437
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:27,187
[Fire Bell]

438
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:29,730
Hey, kid, we ain't waitin'!

439
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:33,057
Go, go, go!

440
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:37,764
Let's go! No, no, not that way!

441
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,773
What's going on?

00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,775
Come on. Let's go!

It's lunch, Probies! Let's get started!

Ooo, caw, caw! A couple of crows, man!

- Or we feed you to the thing.

Shut up. You got something against dalmatians?

448
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,664
[TV] Accident or murder?

449
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,166
That's the question arson investigators are struggling with...

450
00:36:07,235 --> 00:36:10,932
after a freak explosion known by firefighters as a backdraft--

451
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:14,668
Hey, Pengelly, you're on TV.

452
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:18,007
- I saw you too!
- Look, that's me.

453
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,709
[TV] He's been identified as Alan Seagrave, a prominent Chicago C.P.A.

454
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:25,844
Despite pressure from the city council,

455
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,411
fire officials refuse to speculate on the cause,

456
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,923
saying only that their investigation is continuing.

457
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:34,484
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- Here he goes again.

458
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:36,553
As 17th's official toastmaster--

459
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:40,192
- And bullshitter.
- Thank you, Santos.

460
00:36:40,268 --> 00:36:42,600
Did I mention you were cut out of my will?

461
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,695
I think it appropriate...

462
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:48,970
that we recognize the two asswipes... probationary firemen,

463
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:52,706
among us today, who were officially baptized...

464
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,010
into the world of old man fire.

465
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,483
First, to Tim.

466
00:36:57,552 --> 00:37:01,044
Despite the fact he was born with a dull expression...

467
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:04,421
and a really hideous pair of ears,

468
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:06,824
he not only took on the beast,

469
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,828
but pulled from its clutches,

470
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,525
assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter... me,

471
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,592
a kicking and screaming civilian...

472
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,639
who'll probably wind up suing us for breaking her fingernails.

473
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:21,004
And to Brian.

474
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,703
Help me, Santos.

475
00:37:23,778 --> 00:37:27,145
[Laughter, Whistling]

476
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,844
Whose own contribution...

477
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,446
was both more beautiful and less likely to sue us.

478
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:38,583
Son-of-a-bitch.

479
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,321
When I heard that both McCaffrey brothers...

480
00:37:41,396 --> 00:37:46,231
were being assigned here at this station at the same time,

481
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,293
my heart was filled with a... sudden desire to transfer.

482
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:54,338
So raise a glass, lads,

483
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:58,311
to funny-looking Tim and the McCaffrey brothers.

484
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,370
For despite the fact...

485
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,973
they've gotten on each other's nerves for years,

486
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:06,418
have managed with great effort to still be pissed off at each other.

487
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:09,012

00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:20,447
#What is it good for Absolutely nothing#

491
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:25,357
#Say it again, y'all War, look out#

#I despise 'cause it means--#

495
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,240
Thanks for the ride.

496
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:50,811
Hey, Brian.

497
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,849
I'll see you tonight, huh?

498
00:38:58,693 --> 00:39:01,457
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

499
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:09,432
I've known Jack Fitzgerald since he was a candidate.

500
00:39:09,504 --> 00:39:11,529
They had fire engines then?

501
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:16,270
- Get that man's name!
- I gotta say, he was just as ugly then.

502
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,608
Can I have a beer, please?

503
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:23,776
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hey.

504
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:27,948
- ...home of the real firemen.
- [Groaning]

505
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:30,389
Enough of us stroking each other.

506
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,983
Here's the man we're here to honor,

507
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:36,792
- Chief Jack Fitzgerald.
- [Applause]

508
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:40,858
I know I speak for everybody here.

509
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:43,803
It's about time you retired...

510
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,432
and made a promotion for somebody else.

511
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:49,500
Think I oughta change the view.

512
00:39:49,577 --> 00:39:52,546
[Fitzgerald] I couldn't have wished for a better life.

513
00:39:52,614 --> 00:39:55,082
Thank you much.

514
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,027
- I don't believe this shit!
- Pretty boy, get a load of this.

515
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,895
Bull, wait'll you listen to this shit.

516
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,060
- Let me see.
- Hey-hey-hey.

"Probationary Fireman, Brian McCaffrey,

518
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,706
on his first fire, showed the bravery and courage of a veteran...

519
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:23,903
when he risked life and limb to...

520
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:27,540
- double-check a burning floor, alone.

a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company."

523

"McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject...

of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken...

526
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,990
- at the scene of his father's death."
- That's me.

527
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,125
What are we gonna do about this?

528
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:49,227
- Hey, 17, what's going on?
- Well...

529
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:52,637
I think that it's union bylaw...

530
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:56,074
that if you get your picture in the paper, even if it's bullshit,

531
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:58,977
- you buy the whole company a drink.
- All right!

532
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:02,881
I know I'm gonna have another double... on the hero!

533
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:05,715
- Give him a hand over here.
- What's this?

534
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:08,153
Leave 'em alone.

535
00:41:08,223 --> 00:41:10,487
Good job.

# [Irish Jig]

537
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:21,735
Brian McCaffrey, huh?

538
00:41:21,803 --> 00:41:26,365
Brian, this is my boss, Alderman Swayzak. He wanted to meet you.

539
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,932
You should be proud of helping to save that woman's life.

540
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,979
- That was a hell of a job.
- Don't believe everything you read.

541
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:35,312
Don't be so modest, Brian.

542
00:41:35,383 --> 00:41:37,874
See that?

543
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:40,546
That's a mannequin.

544
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:53,166
Look, Brian,

545
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:56,601
let me just get down to it, okay?

546
00:41:56,671 --> 00:42:00,232
I've been checking you out. Jennifer can't say enough.

547
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,971
I need your help.

548
00:42:05,046 --> 00:42:08,345
- I'm gonna offer you a job.
- I've already got a job.

549
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,579
The great thing about this job, it's still with the fire department.

550
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:15,248
One of your best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working a really tough case.

551
00:42:15,323 --> 00:42:17,757
He needs an extra pair of hands.

552
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:20,454
If that name is gonna come from my office,

553
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:22,723
- I want it to be you.
- Why is that?

554
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:27,166
I want someone from a real traditional fire-fighting clan.

555
00:42:27,235 --> 00:42:30,727
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions...

556
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:33,706
like dying young. Thanks anyway.

557
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:44,377
Took you all of 30 seconds to blow that off.

558
00:42:44,452 --> 00:42:48,582
Brian, I know it's not my place to say this,

559
00:42:48,656 --> 00:42:52,490
but I think you're passing on a great opportunity.

560
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,223
- You're smarter than that.
- Look, Jen.

561
00:42:56,297 --> 00:43:00,631
I'm trying to do something here. Can't you see that?

562
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:02,932
I'm trying to be a fireman,

563
00:43:03,004 --> 00:43:05,598
not some kind of poster boy for Swayzak.

564
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:08,836
There's gotta be at least 500 other smoke eaters here...

565
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:11,743
that do that shit for real every day.

566
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:15,010
Why don't you tell Swayzak to talk to one of them?

567
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:40,034
#Lost the wanted driver#

568
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:48,441

575

#The work is light but not easy#

576
00:44:17,712 --> 00:44:20,078
Helen, can I talk to you for a minute?

577
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:23,276
- What about?
- It's about Sean.

578
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:26,650
Right here, right now, you wanna talk about Sean?

579
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:29,281
- How you doin', Stephen?
- Hey, Jackson.

580
00:44:29,357 --> 00:44:32,656
You don't have to stop dancing.

581
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:35,696
It's only our son, for Christ's sake.

582
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,789
- Stephen, you don't have to remind me.
- Stephen,

583
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:43,462
- what about your dumbass brother?
- Wait a second.

584
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:47,975
Saving a mannequin. How fuckin' stupid can a guy get?

585
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:51,136
- Stephen, relax.
- Let go.

586
00:44:53,214 --> 00:44:55,444
Stephen!

587
00:44:55,516 --> 00:44:58,974
You got anything else you want to say about my brother?

588
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:01,487
Goddamn you, McCaffrey!

589
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:10,064
Atta boy, Brian!

590
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,302
Take it outside!

591
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:19,204
- Knock it off!
- Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

592
00:45:21,643 --> 00:45:24,441
Ow-ow-ow. Oh, I'm bleeding.

593
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:29,813
Jesus!

594
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:32,409
Knock it off. Come on, eh?

595
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:34,614
Hey! Knock it off.

596
00:45:34,689 --> 00:45:37,590
Hey, hey, I'm fine.

597
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:40,219
Jesus, Stevie, you never know when to quit, do you?

598
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:42,320
Do you ever wonder why...

599
00:45:42,397 --> 00:45:46,299
you're stuck a fucking lieutenant for life?

600
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,631
No.

601
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:57,807
Come on. Let's get a drink.

602
00:45:57,879 --> 00:46:00,109
- [Brian] You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

603
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:02,081
Hey, whoa!

604
00:46:03,418 --> 00:46:06,979
- Get him outta here!
- I just wanna get a drink.

605
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:10,684
You need to get the hell outta here. Let's go.

606
00:46:10,758 --> 00:46:13,278
The whole family's crazy.

607
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,777
[Brian] You nailed him.

608
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:17,872
He's all right. He said something.

609
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,577
- What'd he say?
- I don't remember.

610
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,677
Listen, I can walk by myself.

611
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:25,552
Ow! I hurt my ankle, man.

612
00:46:25,624 --> 00:46:28,957
Don't stand and laugh. Get me up!

613
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:32,895
Yeah. Oop. Photographer.

614
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:36,400
- Think I can get on the cover of "Life"?
- Let's go.

615
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:38,959
- Is Axe a great guy?
- Huh?

616
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:42,131
He doesn't know shit about what I want.

617
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:44,903
[Stephen] I've got news for everybody. I'm not my old man.

618
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:49,845
A fire won't get me. I know more than he did.

619
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,884
I know more about fire than all of 'em.

620
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:56,148
Time for bed, Sugar Ray.

621
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:58,246
Let me get those for you.

622
00:46:58,323 --> 00:47:00,621
Get outta my way. I can get my shoes off.

623
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,627
You're such a pain in the ass.

624
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,959
You always were.

625
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,967
What are you talkin' about? I saved your ass tonight.

626
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:17,605
Why don't they trust me anymore, huh, Brian?

627
00:47:17,676 --> 00:47:22,613
Really, the guys just don't trust me anymore.

628
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:36,718
Hey, this boat could be great, don't you think?

629
00:47:39,264 --> 00:47:41,357
Maybe I'll just...

630
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:48,069
just take it out on weekends.

631
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,871
Sean and me.

632
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:55,003
We could just float.

00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:26,902
#The show goes on#

647
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:32,170
#And the sad-eyed sisters go walkin' on#

648
00:49:32,243 --> 00:49:36,407
#Everyone watchin' all along#

649
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:39,314
#The show goes on#

650
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:44,981
#As the earth turns and the summer's all gone#

651
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:50,688
#Still without you the show goes on#

652
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:59,427
You're not breaking any records, Brian.

653
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:03,099
Goddamn it! Get it on your shoulder!

654
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:07,439
All right, Stephen. Come on, Stephen!

655
00:50:09,414 --> 00:50:12,076
Come on, Brian. Kick that old man's ass!

656
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:18,916
Run, damn you!

657
00:50:21,826 --> 00:50:24,693
I'm comin'. I'm comin'!

658
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:56,825
Aw, shit!

659
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,760
Are you okay?

660
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,821
Yeah.

661
00:51:06,805 --> 00:51:08,739
Run, damn you!

662
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:15,312
Oh, shit. Okay, roll the hose.

663
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,848
Are you kidding me?

664
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:20,851
- Roll that hose by myself?
- You heard me.

665
00:51:20,919 --> 00:51:25,720
- What about Tim?
- Aw, shit. What about Tim?

666
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,156
For Christ's sake. Next time I'll let you win.

667
00:51:30,562 --> 00:51:33,861
You got a problem with drilling, Probie?

668
00:51:33,932 --> 00:51:37,925
- Is that it?
- No! I don't have a problem,

669
00:51:38,002 --> 00:51:41,529
but let's just have one drill, Lieutenant,

670
00:51:41,606 --> 00:51:46,168
- not one for the company and one for me.
- Roll the hose now!

671
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:49,372
I'm not gonna quit, Stephen. You hear me?

672
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:52,561
I'm not gonna quit.

673
00:51:57,266 --> 00:52:00,030
My baby! My baby is still up there!

674
00:52:00,102 --> 00:52:02,570
- Please, somebody!
- Where's your baby at?

675
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:05,300
How many men you got in there?

676
00:52:05,374 --> 00:52:07,808
My baby is still up there. Please help me!

677
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:10,436
Hold on, Steve. Don't go up there.

678
00:52:10,512 --> 00:52:13,777
- Wait for the hose line.
- Brian!

679
00:52:22,558 --> 00:52:25,391
Hey, don't take that kind of shit from it!

680
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,691
Don't let it know you're scared!

681
00:52:30,933 --> 00:52:35,233
- Stephen, we gotta wait for a hose team.
- No time.

682
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:45,107
Come on!

683
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:58,920
[Creaking]

684
00:52:58,994 --> 00:53:01,963
- You ready?
- We gotta wait for a hose team.

685
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,897
Jump when I say. It won't get us.

686
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:07,663
Now! Hold your breath!

687
00:53:09,304 --> 00:53:11,738
[Crying]

688
00:53:25,821 --> 00:53:30,485
Stephen!

689
00:54:24,146 --> 00:54:26,512
- Steve, Steve.
- All right.

690
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:29,175
- You kicked ass, Bull.
- Way to go, Bull.

691
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:31,276
Thanks.

692
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:37,488
Man, that was pretty crazy, huh?

693
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:42,628
I waited. I would've waited.

694
00:54:42,698 --> 00:54:48,466
- Come on. Don't worry about it.
- You did it, man.

695
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:52,530
You did it all the way. You were really a hero.

696
00:54:55,577 --> 00:54:59,013
Brian... it's not about being a hero.

697
00:55:00,315 --> 00:55:03,045
I went in because there was a kid up there.

698
00:55:03,118 --> 00:55:07,680
I do what I do because that's my way. And it was Dad's way.

699
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:11,317
- Maybe it's not everybody's way.
- Dad's way?

700
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:14,419
He tell you that in a fucking seance, huh?

701
00:55:14,496 --> 00:55:17,056
You said you needed to know something.

702
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:20,260
What did you learn today, huh?

703
00:55:20,335 --> 00:55:23,998
What if there had been another kid up there?

704
00:55:26,842 --> 00:55:28,969
Oh, I don't know.

705
00:55:30,545 --> 00:55:32,604
What do you think, Brian?

706
00:55:32,681 --> 00:55:35,343
Time to move on?

707
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:46,752
You're right.

708
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:51,488
You win, Stephen. You're the best.

709
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:59,032
Hey, Brian?

710
00:56:08,884 --> 00:56:10,374
Brian.

711
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:12,886
Hi.

712
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:16,651
Listen, Jen, I--

713
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:20,183
I've been thinking about what you said.

714
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:23,322
If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.

715
00:56:26,902 --> 00:56:28,893
Well, great!

716
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:31,768
That's great, really great news.

717
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,776
The alderman'll be thrilled that you're working with us.

718
00:56:37,612 --> 00:56:39,910
Marty's a good man, Brian.

719
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:42,973
Yeah.

720
00:57:09,465 --> 00:57:12,229
[Rimgale] So stop me if I got this wrong.

721
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:15,464
The fire's almost out, you're upstairs on the unburned floor...

722
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:17,802
- checkin' for heat. Correct?
- Yes, sir.

723
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:20,239
- Messages for you.
- Thank you.

724
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:22,300
You've been told by your battalion chief, your captain...

725
00:57:22,378 --> 00:57:25,040
and by me not to do nothin', right?

726
00:57:25,114 --> 00:57:27,309
- Do nothin' until ordered, correct?
- Yes, sir.

727
00:57:27,383 --> 00:57:30,511
Now the itch starts. The glory boy flash starts.

728
00:57:30,586 --> 00:57:32,520
"I'm a hero. Heroes don't stand around."

729
00:57:32,588 --> 00:57:34,749
- You can tell me. That's what it was?
- Yes, sir.

730
00:57:34,824 --> 00:57:37,952
So you punched out a window for ventilation.

731
00:57:38,027 --> 00:57:41,326
Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline?

732
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:43,957
Was that before or after you noticed...

733
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:47,059
you were standing in a lake of gasoline, you idiot?

734
00:57:47,136 --> 00:57:50,435
Before, sir.

735
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:53,703
You could have burned, killed, or crispered half that company.

736
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:58,236
You wrecked the physical evidence that I use to prove that it's arson.

737
00:57:58,314 --> 00:58:02,307
You know how goddamn hard it is to determine the cause.

738
00:58:02,385 --> 00:58:05,513
Now go home and you think about that.

739
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:10,791
- I'll have to call him back.
- Excuse me.

740
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,851
- Yeah?
- Brian McCaffrey, your new assistant.

741
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:16,193
Oh, Dennis' kid. Why don't you go find a corner to hide in?

742
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:18,597
I'll get to you later. I don't wanna deal with you now.

743
00:58:24,807 --> 00:58:26,138
Great.

744
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:50,722
You still standing there?

745
00:58:53,069 --> 00:58:56,197
I think we should get something straight here now.

746
00:58:56,272 --> 00:58:58,206
I was assigned to this office by the city.

747
00:58:58,274 --> 00:59:00,538
- You better get used to me.
- I know who you were assigned by.

748
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:03,373
I knew your father too. He was a hell of a fireman.

749
00:59:03,446 --> 00:59:05,380
He had a hell of a reputation.

750
00:59:05,448 --> 00:59:07,882
But it don't cut slack here as far as I'm concerned.

751
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:11,283
Swayzak sends you here, fine. I gotta eat you. Those are rules.

752
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:13,322
I got nothin' to say about that.

753
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:16,449
Swayzak or no, you work for me now.

754
00:59:16,525 --> 00:59:19,050
Step outta line, make one false move, you're outta here.

755
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:22,894
Don't think you're the first.

756
00:59:22,965 --> 00:59:25,160
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?

757
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:26,394
Pest control.

758
00:59:33,242 --> 00:59:36,939
#Shadow, shadow#

759
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:38,502
Hi, Shadow.

760
00:59:38,581 --> 00:59:41,015
Hi, Ronald. How ya doin'? Stayin' comfortable?

761
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:45,611
- I didn't think you would make it.
- I wouldn't miss this.

762
00:59:45,688 --> 00:59:47,952
- Who's that?
- He works for me.

763
00:59:48,023 --> 00:59:50,218
Is he a fireman? I like firemen.

764
00:59:50,292 --> 00:59:52,226
You like everybody, Ronald.

765
00:59:52,294 --> 00:59:56,754
Brian McCaffrey. Yeah, sure. No, that's Stephen.

766
00:59:59,101 --> 01:00:01,535
He's the little one with the hat.

767
01:00:01,604 --> 01:00:04,368
Oh, what a treat!

768
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,001
- Hey, do I know you?
- Your dad did.

769
01:00:09,678 --> 01:00:11,771
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Nah, put it away.

770
01:00:11,847 --> 01:00:15,146
Come on, Shadow. He lost his dad to the animal and...

771
01:00:15,217 --> 01:00:18,914
you didn't even tell him who he was coming to see? Tell him.

772
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:23,118
Let me tell you about Ronald. Ronald likes telephones.

773
01:00:23,192 --> 01:00:25,660
Likes to tape wooden matches to the bell strikers...

774
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:28,663
and then wrap it in cotton with gasoline.

775
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:31,723
Had a whole little thing goin', huh? And when you got bored?

776
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:33,735
What'd you do?

777
01:00:33,803 --> 01:00:38,365
- He started makin' calls.
- Never proved.

778
01:00:38,441 --> 01:00:40,705
Tell him about us down on State Street.

779
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:44,872
Nah. Nobody cares about that one.

780
01:00:44,947 --> 01:00:48,781
It was your basic warehouse torch I was doin' for the owner.

781
01:00:48,851 --> 01:00:51,684
I mean, they were a cakewalk. I just--

782
01:00:51,754 --> 01:00:56,623
I just lost my concentration and my animal turned on me.

783
01:00:56,692 --> 01:00:58,819
Got the whole place going like hell.

784
01:00:58,894 --> 01:01:02,193
My hair was on fire, my hands,

785
01:01:02,264 --> 01:01:04,528
everything. I was dead.

786
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,625
Then suddenly I was alive. I was pulled out of there...

787
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:10,229
by my hero, my Shadow here.

788
01:01:10,306 --> 01:01:13,434
Except, he didn't see this big tub of phosphorous, did you?

789
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:17,878
Explosion lit him up so bright, left his shadow on the wall.

790
01:01:17,947 --> 01:01:21,314
Still shy about rolling up your sleeves, Shadow?

791
01:01:21,383 --> 01:01:23,374
Show him your stomach.

792
01:01:23,452 --> 01:01:27,980
The funny thing about firemen,

793
01:01:28,057 --> 01:01:30,355
night and day, they're always firemen.

794
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:33,953
[Guard] Ronald Bartel.

795
01:01:34,029 --> 01:01:37,487
All right, the parole board has received...

796
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,864
Mr. Bartel's fitness report,

797
01:01:39,935 --> 01:01:44,736
his I.D. 44, endorsement from his section warden.

798
01:01:44,807 --> 01:01:46,775
Dr. Norris?

799
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:49,140
As supervising psychiatrist, I would describe...

800
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:51,771
Mr. Bartel's progress as remarkable.

801
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:53,838
Taking into account his disability and the six years...

802
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:57,113
he's already served, I recommend a parole.

803
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:59,552
Mr. Bartel,

804
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:02,090
do you regret your crimes?

805
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:06,321
Yes, and--

806
01:02:06,395 --> 01:02:11,332
and I'm aware of the pain that I have caused.

807
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,868
If released, will you commit these crimes again?

808
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:15,904
No. No, I won't.

809
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:19,236
Do you consider yourself ready for society?

810
01:02:19,308 --> 01:02:21,276
Yes, I do.

811
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:25,507
Yeah, right, Ronald. You're ready, all right.

812
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:28,175
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

813
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,378
- Shadow.
- Remember this?

814
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:33,614
Remember this, Ronald?

815
01:02:33,689 --> 01:02:35,748
- Remember who it belonged to?
- Mm-hmm.

816
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:38,258
What did you do to that little girl?

817
01:02:38,327 --> 01:02:41,125
It's not fair, Shadow.

818
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:43,562
What did you do to that little girl?

819
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:57,044
I burned her.

820
01:02:57,112 --> 01:02:59,103
You burned her.

821
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:03,709
What do you do to old ladies, Ronald?

822
01:03:03,786 --> 01:03:05,879
Burn them.

823
01:03:05,955 --> 01:03:08,583
And what about the world, Ronald?

824
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:11,285
What would you like to do with the whole world?

825
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:16,195
Burn it all. [Laughing]

826
01:03:22,438 --> 01:03:25,930
See ya next year, Ronald.

827
01:03:55,971 --> 01:03:57,905
[Screams]

828
01:04:04,446 --> 01:04:07,882
[Lieutenant] We figured the body's the owner, some guy named Cosgrove.

829
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:11,010
Weird blast, though, like that other guy...

830
01:04:11,086 --> 01:04:13,213
who went through the windshield of his own car.

831
01:04:13,288 --> 01:04:16,485
Explosion blew out the flame before the engine got here.

832
01:04:16,558 --> 01:04:20,289
Good for us; not too good for him.

833
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:33,972
Bring the toolbox.

834
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:42,045
Tim, get the hot spots.

835
01:04:42,117 --> 01:04:45,883
You in the cheap seats, watch it.

836
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:48,345
There's Brian.

837
01:04:48,424 --> 01:04:51,951
Well, let's go.

838
01:04:52,027 --> 01:04:55,428
[Rimgale] Hey, McCaffrey, need a special invitation? Come on.

839
01:04:57,132 --> 01:04:59,600
Charge the line, Axe.

840
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:05,634
- What do you want me to do with this?
- Shhh.

841
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:08,506
We got heavy smoke stains observed in entry room.

842
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:10,977
[Rimgale] Smoke demarcation line is very low.

843
01:05:11,046 --> 01:05:14,482
Fire never got hot enough here to cook the soot off.

844
01:05:16,985 --> 01:05:20,443
Come on, you sneaky little son-of-a-bitch.

845
01:05:20,522 --> 01:05:24,014
Come on. Tell me where you came from.

846
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:26,561
Point me where you started.

847
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:28,755
Come on.

848
01:05:33,102 --> 01:05:35,627
Burn indicators distended toward northern wall.

849
01:05:35,704 --> 01:05:39,697
Less soot here, more heat.

850
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:41,970
Lack of discoloration in shattered glass...

851
01:05:42,044 --> 01:05:44,569
indicates slow burn before explosion.

852
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:50,074
There's some little dead rat critters here.

853
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,248
Fire originated in this room. Took its time.

854
01:05:56,325 --> 01:05:58,259
Hung out.

855
01:05:58,327 --> 01:06:02,559
The air ran out. It couldn't breathe. It was snuffed.

856
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:05,259
But it wasn't dead.

857
01:06:05,367 --> 01:06:07,961
Must have been all that trapped heat lying low,

858
01:06:08,036 --> 01:06:11,267
waiting for some sucker to give it one big gulp of air.

859
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,332
Another backdraft.

860
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,812
This is our point of origin. Let me have a crowbar.

861
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,785
No sign of accelerants.

862
01:06:35,731 --> 01:06:40,201
Well, if it's arson, somebody figured a new way to hide it.

863
01:06:42,403 --> 01:06:46,134
[Ricco] Okay, we got Alan Seagrave...

864
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:49,802
and Donald Cosgrove.

865
01:06:49,877 --> 01:06:51,811
Both deaths due to close encounters...

866
01:06:51,879 --> 01:06:55,371
with stationary objects.

867
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:58,419
We have an office door for Cosgrove...

868
01:06:58,486 --> 01:07:00,716
and, oh, an '87 Porsche for Seagrave.

869
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:04,656
No nonrelevant traumas.

870
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:08,593
No significant blood toxicology.

871
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:12,827
Attitude of both trajectories are consistent with explosion.

872
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:16,131
They ran the residue you scraped from both front doors.

873
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:19,139
It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum.

874
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:21,175
It burns almost completely away when you light it.

875
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:23,233
- So it was on both doors?
- Yeah.

876
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:26,803
Something else I want to show you. You're gonna have to help me.

877
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:30,282
McCaffrey, why don't you come over and help us?

878
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,876
No, I don't think so. Not in my contract.

879
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:35,252
I just rewrote your contract.

880
01:07:35,323 --> 01:07:37,723
Come on over and help us.

881
01:07:37,792 --> 01:07:41,523
Anyway, here, we're gonna have to lift him.

882
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:44,531
Great.

883
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:48,194
Christ, he's not gonna sell you insurance. Just lift him up.

884
01:07:50,538 --> 01:07:52,836
Hold on.

885
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:55,171
You see that patch of shirt right there?

886
01:07:55,243 --> 01:07:57,211
We wondered about the discoloration.

887
01:07:57,278 --> 01:07:59,769
So I scraped a piece off and ran a spectro on it.

888
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:03,874
On a lucky shot, we picked up traces of something.

889
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:05,919
What was it?

890
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:08,547
Ah, trychtichlorate.

891
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:10,955
[Ricco] Nobody around here ever heard of it.

892
01:08:11,025 --> 01:08:13,585
[Rimgale] Yeah, trychtichlorate. It eats magnesium.

893
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:16,027
It's an absorption catalyst used in toxic waste accidents.

894
01:08:16,097 --> 01:08:18,793
It's rare. They stopped making it a couple of years ago.

895
01:08:18,866 --> 01:08:22,324
We figured it got in his clothes in a gas state from the fire.

896
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:24,337
What was it doing in the fire?

897
01:08:24,405 --> 01:08:27,033
That's your job. Okay!

898
01:08:27,108 --> 01:08:30,600
[Gurgling]

899
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:35,808
[Helen] Stephen, what-- What are you doing here?

900
01:08:35,883 --> 01:08:38,408
Just fixin' my roof.

901
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:42,320
You've gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.

902
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:45,188
Look, I just-- I wanted to, I don't know, not exactly...

903
01:08:45,259 --> 01:08:47,318
apologize for the other night, especially since...

904
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:49,329
- I don't remember much.
- You remember.

905
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:52,525
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to say, I don't know, something.

906
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,967
The great communicator.

907
01:09:00,575 --> 01:09:04,602
So what's going on, Stephen?

908
01:09:07,415 --> 01:09:12,318
You only bang on the roof when you got something on your mind.

909
01:09:12,386 --> 01:09:14,752
How's Brian doing?

910
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:19,759
- He's out. He quit.
- He just up and quit for no reason?

911
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:22,557
I don't care what you heard, Helen, I treated him better...

912
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,098
than any other probie I ever had. All right?

913
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,259
He probably hates my guts...

914
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:29,860
but at least he finally took a look in the mirror.

915
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:32,906
So once again, Stephen's right and somebody else is wrong.

916
01:09:32,974 --> 01:09:34,908
You always gotta be right.

917
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:37,342
- That's such bullshit.
- Yeah? Why?

918
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:40,574
Because I'm the first to admit it when I'm wrong.

919
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:42,582
Yeah? How often does that happen?

920
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:44,709
In a fire? Never!

921
01:09:47,488 --> 01:09:50,048
He would have bought it, Helen.

922
01:09:50,124 --> 01:09:53,651
I'm telling ya, maybe not today, maybe not next year;

923
01:09:53,728 --> 01:09:57,186
but it would have happened. All right? He's my brother.

924
01:09:57,264 --> 01:09:59,232
I couldn't just--

925
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,894
You just couldn't live with that.

926
01:10:07,208 --> 01:10:09,142
McCaffrey.

927
01:10:12,446 --> 01:10:14,414
Yeah?

928
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,445
Take the top off.

929
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,823
Holy shit!

930
01:10:23,891 --> 01:10:26,883
That's it. That's it.

931
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:30,453
Son-of-a-bitch! This guy is different. He don't love fire.

932
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:31,793
- Who?
- The killer.

933
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:34,664
He used magnesium to make it look like an accident.

934
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:36,498
I got it after we went to see Ronald.

935
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:38,936
Torchers want to fry the whole goddamn world.

936
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:42,442
But the fires that killed those guys never burned up that much.

937
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:46,207
The trychtichlorate hid the magnesium in the plug, but it burned slow.

938
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,373
And he made his burns backdrafts.

939
01:10:48,449 --> 01:10:52,044
- But he killed these guys.
- Could have killed everybody.

940
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:55,316
Backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.

941
01:10:55,389 --> 01:10:59,519
- What reason?
- Why backdrafts.

942
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:01,584
Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove...

943
01:11:01,662 --> 01:11:04,426
went to a hell of a lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire.

944
01:11:04,498 --> 01:11:06,762
They also made sure that the fire blew itself out.

945
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,428
So that's why they used the putty in the doors.

946
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:12,605
What do we got? A torch with a conscience?

947
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:16,666
No. We got a stone killer trying to make a point.

948
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:18,939
You can make the call now. It's arson, right?

949
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:22,141
I'm not calling anyone yet.

950
01:11:22,216 --> 01:11:24,684
You can't rush this. I've seen it too many times before.

951
01:11:24,752 --> 01:11:27,414
I wanna make sure this torch doesn't walk.

952
01:11:27,488 --> 01:11:30,685
We're gonna wait.

953
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:33,124
[Boat Horn]

954
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:38,398
Well, well, Mr. McCaffrey.

955
01:11:38,466 --> 01:11:41,367
- Welcome aboard.
- Nice boat you got here.

956
01:11:41,435 --> 01:11:43,494
What? You mean mine?

957
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:47,632
Well, not yet. Glad to have you as part of the team, Brian.

958
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:50,404
Let's get a picture with Mr. McCaffrey and myself.

959
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,876
You look good. Yeah, there you go.

960
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:59,647
Thanks. Hi.

961
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,950
Yeah, have fun now. Great night, isn't it?

962
01:12:02,022 --> 01:12:04,582
[Swayzak] Who is that?

963
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:07,252
- Larry Dewaay.

But the outer door held and it waited for Tim.

1101
01:25:17,864 --> 01:25:20,526
In a word, Brian,

1102
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,125
what is this job all about?

1103
01:25:23,203 --> 01:25:24,864

It's a living thing, Brian.

1105

It breathes, it eats,

1106

and it hates.

The only way to beat it...

1108
01:25:53,767 --> 01:25:56,292
is to think like it;

1109
01:25:56,369 --> 01:25:59,634
to know this flame will spread this way across the door...

1110
01:25:59,706 --> 01:26:01,640
and up across the ceiling;

1111
01:26:01,708 --> 01:26:04,142
not because of the physics of flammable liquids,

1112
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:07,008
but because it wants to.

1113

Some guys, fire owns 'em. Makes 'em fight it on its level.

1114

The only way to truly kill it...

1115
01:26:15,322 --> 01:26:19,520
is to love it a little, just like Ronald.

01:27:00,033 --> 01:27:03,662
- Get me his files.
- Do you know what you're asking?

1123
01:27:03,737 --> 01:27:05,068
Yeah.

1124
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:08,471
Four years ago I was punching a cash register.

1125
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:11,066
Two years ago, Marty Swayzak didn't even know my name.

1126
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:13,078
I was bringing the guy coffee.

1127
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:15,671
I practically run that office now.

1128
01:27:15,749 --> 01:27:19,310
And Marty-- He believes in me.

1129
01:27:19,386 --> 01:27:21,911
I just don't--

1130
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,924
You're asking me to throw that all away.

1131
01:27:25,992 --> 01:27:28,483
Your boss is a liar.

1132
01:27:49,816 --> 01:27:53,752
Stephen?

1133
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:57,654
I'm sorry, Helen. I just couldn't sleep.

1134
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:03,757
Well, what's wrong?

1135
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:06,799
It used to be real clear.

1136
01:28:06,866 --> 01:28:08,800
When I was a kid,

1137
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:14,766
what meant most to me about this job was...

1138
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:17,241
no "ifs."

1139
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:20,746
Somebody called the fire department, we came.

1140
01:28:20,814 --> 01:28:23,612
We just showed up.

1141
01:28:27,987 --> 01:28:30,888
Those guys, they just don't know how much I love 'em.

1142
01:28:37,063 --> 01:28:40,032
You don't leave people hangin'.

1143
01:28:43,470 --> 01:28:46,530
It holds everything up, doesn't it?

1144
01:28:46,606 --> 01:28:49,632
Loyalty.

1145
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,700
I don't get it.

1146
01:28:51,778 --> 01:28:55,714
"Till death do us part." Isn't that what you heard, Helen?

1147
01:28:55,782 --> 01:28:59,081
You go, we go. It's all the same...

1148
01:28:59,152 --> 01:29:01,177
piece of shit without that, isn't it?

1149
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:05,486
It's the end of everything.

1150
01:29:11,231 --> 01:29:14,257
I'm sorry I came.

1151
01:29:16,436 --> 01:29:19,428
There's just nobody I can talk to.

1152
01:29:24,344 --> 01:29:28,303
I really miss you.

1153
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:19,026
[Stephen] You sure you really want to put grape jelly in the eggs?

1154
01:30:19,098 --> 01:30:22,659
Yeah, it's part of my formula. It's an experiment.

1155
01:30:22,735 --> 01:30:24,703
- It's an experiment?
- Yeah.

1156
01:30:24,771 --> 01:30:26,705
Let's get these eggs going.

1157
01:30:26,773 --> 01:30:28,832
- Hey, I want to do that.
- Can you do it?

1158
01:30:28,908 --> 01:30:32,810
That's good.

1159
01:30:34,881 --> 01:30:37,679
I'll put that in the formula.

1160
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:39,843
- You gonna leave the shells?
- Yeah.

1161
01:30:39,919 --> 01:30:43,013
- They're part of the formula?
- Yeah.

1162
01:30:43,089 --> 01:30:46,547
I guess you know what you're doing.

1163
01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:50,494
- I know what I'm doing.
- Uh-oh.

1164
01:30:50,563 --> 01:30:52,497
Mom!

1165
01:30:52,565 --> 01:30:55,193
I didn't know you'd be up so early.

1166
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:58,863
Mom, go back to bed. We're making you breakfast in bed.

1167
01:31:04,777 --> 01:31:07,439
- Stephen, can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

1168
01:31:07,513 --> 01:31:10,073
You keep going there. You're doing good.

1169
01:31:10,149 --> 01:31:12,115
He knows what he's doin'.

1170
01:31:12,248 --> 01:31:16,548
He told me he likes those piano lessons you got him taking.

1171
01:31:16,619 --> 01:31:20,350
It's just I don't want to confuse him, you know.

1172
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:24,484
I knew who you were when we got married.

1173
01:31:24,561 --> 01:31:26,756
I knew how you did things.

1174
01:31:29,265 --> 01:31:31,199
And--

1175
01:31:32,302 --> 01:31:35,738
I mean, you haven't--

1176
01:31:35,805 --> 01:31:38,000
I just can't anymore.

1177
01:31:38,074 --> 01:31:41,168
I just-- you know,

1178
01:31:41,244 --> 01:31:45,476
I gotta worry about Sean.

1179
01:31:45,548 --> 01:31:48,449
- Yeah.
- I mean, you're the best.

1180
01:31:48,518 --> 01:31:50,884
You really are.

1181
01:31:50,954 --> 01:31:54,947
But the chances that you take just--

1182
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,528
You scare me now.

1183
01:32:08,405 --> 01:32:10,532
Sean.

1184
01:32:10,607 --> 01:32:13,269
Listen, I, uh--

1185
01:32:13,343 --> 01:32:15,311
I blew it.

1186
01:32:15,378 --> 01:32:18,006
I forgot that I gotta work this morning.

1187
01:32:18,081 --> 01:32:21,016
So, um--

1188
01:32:21,084 --> 01:32:24,019
That's all right. We'll just do it again next Saturday.

1189
01:32:24,087 --> 01:32:26,885
- All right?
- Mom's crying.

1190
01:32:40,970 --> 01:32:44,167
The latest polls came in, Marty.

1191
01:32:48,978 --> 01:32:50,912
Marty?

1192
01:33:00,089 --> 01:33:02,023
Jesus Christ, Marty.

1193
01:33:02,091 --> 01:33:05,720
What's going on?

1194
01:33:05,795 --> 01:33:09,128
We have a city planners meeting in 15 minutes.

1195
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:12,259
Marty.

1196
01:33:18,007 --> 01:33:22,068
You've gotta level with me, Marty.

1197
01:33:22,145 --> 01:33:26,104
Is there something about these deaths you're not telling me?

1198
01:33:26,182 --> 01:33:30,380
No.

1199
01:33:53,843 --> 01:33:57,279
- What's this?
- Just take it.

1200
01:34:15,031 --> 01:34:19,161
Rimgale's gonna wanna talk to Swayzak about this.

1201
01:34:19,235 --> 01:34:23,103
I'm sorry.

1202
01:34:23,172 --> 01:34:26,869
That's a dumb thing to say.

1203
01:34:26,943 --> 01:34:29,468
You're right.

1204
01:34:29,546 --> 01:34:33,778
Good-bye, Brian.

1205
01:34:39,622 --> 01:34:42,216
What the hell you do with this thing?

1206
01:34:42,292 --> 01:34:44,453
What do you mean? I drove it, Joe.

1207
01:34:44,527 --> 01:34:47,462
This is a copy of Swayzak's report that we know is bullshit;

1208
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:50,624
but we could never argue with the numbers because they're airtight.

1209
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,533
This file she gave you proves it's phoney.

1210
01:34:53,603 --> 01:34:57,061
I checked on the firm that recommended the cuts to Swayzak's task force.

1211
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:59,506
They've done exactly one job, a manpower study.

1212
01:34:59,576 --> 01:35:02,511
I checked further and it's not even a company. No employees... nothing.

1213
01:35:02,579 --> 01:35:06,174
- Just a P.O. box.
- I wonder who wrote that report.

1214
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:09,412
- Someone who knows how to work numbers.
- Exactly.

1215
01:35:09,485 --> 01:35:13,148
Like a bunch of dead financial wizards.

1216
01:35:13,222 --> 01:35:17,056
- Seagrave, Holcomb, Cosgrove--
- And Swayzak.

1217
01:35:17,126 --> 01:35:20,254
Why did he go through this trouble to cut firehouses?

1218
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:23,766
When a firehouse closes, Swayzak converts it into a community center.

1219
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:26,461
- That's sweet.
- Lakeside Dynamics, remember them?

1220
01:35:26,536 --> 01:35:28,834
They get all the expensive construction work.

1221
01:35:28,905 --> 01:35:31,305
I'm telling you, this is a total scam.

1222
01:35:31,374 --> 01:35:34,537
These guys were making a ton of money.

1223
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:39,727
It's time we had a little talk with Mr. Swayzak. Let's go.

1224
01:35:58,612 --> 01:36:00,944
Mr. Swayzak?

1225
01:36:05,953 --> 01:36:08,114
Gas. Check in there.

1226
01:36:10,858 --> 01:36:14,055
[Hissing]

1227
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,574
Aaah!

1228
01:36:30,544 --> 01:36:33,741
[Screaming]

1229
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:54,693
Come on. Come on!

1230
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:12,817
- Let's go. Come on!
- [Coughing]

1231
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:40,440
- [Coughing]
- Hey, kid.

1232
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:42,539
I think I've got a problem here.

1233
01:37:50,825 --> 01:37:54,090
Is it true that you were rescued by the fire department's arson team?

1234
01:37:54,161 --> 01:37:56,629
That's quite a bunch of guys, huh?

1235
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:02,329
I'm so goddamn helpless here.

1236
01:38:02,403 --> 01:38:04,564
I can't do a fucking thing.

1237
01:38:04,638 --> 01:38:07,903
[Sighs]

1238
01:38:07,975 --> 01:38:12,344
- What do you want me to do?
- I've been lying here thinkin'.

1239
01:38:12,413 --> 01:38:17,350
For hours... thinkin' and thinkin' and thinkin'.

1240
01:38:17,418 --> 01:38:21,115
We're close. We're close.

1241
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:23,122
But we're not lookin' in the right place,

1242
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:25,124
not in the right place.

1243
01:38:28,529 --> 01:38:33,557
So, you've come to pick Ronald's brains...

1244
01:38:33,634 --> 01:38:37,866
because nobody knows the animal like Ronald.

1245
01:38:44,778 --> 01:38:47,542
It must've looked like it was going to be...

1246
01:38:47,615 --> 01:38:51,346
a medium deal, didn't it, when your father bought it?

1247
01:38:51,418 --> 01:38:53,750
What?

1248
01:38:53,821 --> 01:38:59,521
Did you watch him when he made that ballsy jump and saved--

1249
01:38:59,593 --> 01:39:01,754
I didn't come to talk about my father.

1250
01:39:01,829 --> 01:39:05,162
I sent away for a copy of that "Life Magazine"...

1251
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:08,167
with your picture on the cover.

1252
01:39:08,235 --> 01:39:10,601
It's a collectible.

1253
01:39:10,671 --> 01:39:13,765
- Who's doing this, Ronald?
- Wrong question.

1254
01:39:13,841 --> 01:39:16,275
Who isn't?

1255
01:39:16,343 --> 01:39:18,436
It isn't a spark, is it? Because there isn't enough damage...

1256
01:39:18,512 --> 01:39:20,878
and he wouldn't have had any fun.

1257
01:39:20,948 --> 01:39:24,782
It isn't an insurance pro because there isn't any profit.

1258
01:39:24,852 --> 01:39:27,343
- Who does that leave us with?
- What's his tool?

1259
01:39:27,421 --> 01:39:31,380
How does he do it? How does he talk to the fire?

1260
01:39:31,458 --> 01:39:35,019
- The outlets.
- No.

1261
01:39:35,095 --> 01:39:38,360
That's a probie. That's beneath you, Brian.

1262
01:39:40,501 --> 01:39:44,733
Trychtichlorate.

1263
01:39:44,805 --> 01:39:48,332
Very good. Very good.

1264
01:39:48,409 --> 01:39:52,743
You still haven't put it together?

1265
01:39:52,813 --> 01:39:55,043
- I have.
- Then who, Ronald?

1266
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:59,245
You wanna know who?

1267
01:40:01,355 --> 01:40:04,654
I wanna know...

1268
01:40:04,725 --> 01:40:08,821
if this kid really wanted to be...

1269
01:40:08,896 --> 01:40:11,091
just like his dad.

1270
01:40:15,436 --> 01:40:18,633
Did he?

1271
01:40:23,444 --> 01:40:25,378
Okay.

1272
01:40:25,446 --> 01:40:27,937
I'm outta here.

1273
01:40:28,015 --> 01:40:32,111
All right! I wanted to be him, okay?

1274
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:40,589
I wanted to be him more than anything.

1275
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:43,027
You loved him.

1276
01:40:43,097 --> 01:40:46,430
Yeah.

1277
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:51,096
You watched him dance with the animal. You saw your dad burn.

1278
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:54,538
Fuck you, Ronald! Who the hell's doin' this?

1279
01:40:54,608 --> 01:40:57,668
