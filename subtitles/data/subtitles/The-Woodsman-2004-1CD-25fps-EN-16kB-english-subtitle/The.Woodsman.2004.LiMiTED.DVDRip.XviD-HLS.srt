1
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,680
On your left.

2
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,840
On your right.

3
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,880
You must check in
with your P.O. Once a week.

4
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,480
Your P.O. Is entitled
to visit at any time.

5
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,160
You cannot come
within 300 feet of-

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,000
You must register immediately
upon return-

7
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,120
- Walter?
- Hey, Bob.

8
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
It's good to see you.

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,920
That's Mary-Kay.

10
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
The only reason I'm doing this is 'cause
I know you did good work for my father.

11
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
So you be here on time.
You do your work.

12
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
I don't want
any kind of problem, period.

13
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,320
God, that looks awful.

14
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
Yeah.

15
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,160
Now, this looks good.

16
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Want some? Homemade.

17
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,720
No, thanks.

18
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,360
You won't taste
a better chicken salad in town.

19
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
I said no, thank you.

20
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry. I got to get back to work.

21
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,840
- So, how are you adjusting?
- I'm adjusting okay.

22
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,240
- And your new apartment?
- Apartment's okay.

23
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,080
- How's the job?
- The job's okay.

24
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,920
Do I take "okay" to mean
you feel good about working there?

25
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
I said the job's okay.

26
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,920
That's right. You did.

27
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,280
- Vicki!
- Fuck you, asshole.

28
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,320
- Come on. What's wrong, huh?
- Kiss my ass.

29
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,920
Boy, you still think fast.

30
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,400
You don't need to think fast
to handle a beer.

31
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,760
Well, it took some talking
to convince your super I was a relative.

32
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah, well, I told her
all my relatives were good-looking.

33
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,480
- Jesus Christ, man, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

34
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
You look good-

35
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,800
damn good,
considering you're an old man now.

36
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Feels like the whole world's
gotten younger.

37
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,800
So, you're doing okay?

38
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Yeah, I'm okay.

39
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,040
- How's business?
- Booming.

40
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,920
Can't keep up with the work.
In fact, I just hired a few new guys.

41
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,400
Just until, you know, we catch up.

42
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Living across the street
from a grade school. Jesus.

43
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,600
Something wrong with that?

44
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm just thinking of the noise.

45
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,600
It's the only landlord in town
who'll take my money.

46
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,640
So, how's Annette?

47
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,200
A little tense.

48
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,720
You know, you're the only member
of the family still speaking to me.

49
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,840
Yeah, well, I remember when
they all gave Annette shit...

50
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,560
because she married the brown-skinned boy
from down the street- except her brother.

51
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,400
And what about Annette?

52
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,200
I'm workin' on it.

53
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,360
- So how old is Carla?
- She's gonna be 12 next week.

54
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,680
We're gonna throw her
a big party on Saturday.

55
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,640
I wish I could ask you to come.

56
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,560
Good enough
to eat today, baby.

57
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,160
Ooh, yeah.

58
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,080
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, huh?

59
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,360
How'd you like it if someone did
that shit to your sister, huh?

60
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,200
Piece of shit!

61
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,920
Fuck off!
Clean that shit up!

62
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
- Oh, yeah.
- Play with yourself, asshole!

63
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,600
You okay?

64
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,560
What?

65
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,240
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.

66
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
So, what'd he do?

67
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,400
- What did who do?
- You know, the new guy.

68
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Drugs, armed robbery,
manslaughter-

69
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Mind your business, Mary-Kay.

70
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,160
Have you made any friends there?

71
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.

72
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
You seem a little hostile today.

73
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,440
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.

74
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,680
No need to call me doctor.
I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.

75
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,440
It's all the same to me.

76
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,040
Walter, I'd like you
to try something for me.

77
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,680
- What's that?
- I'd like you to keep a journal.

78
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,200
- No fuckin' way.
- Why not?

79
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
Evidence.

80
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,800
Perhaps a journal would
encourage you to reflect.

81
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
Try it?

82
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Sixteen, 17, 18, 19, 20.

83
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,760
320 feet.

84
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,600
How about that?

85
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
Want a ride?

86
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,480
- I'm all right.
- It's fucking freezing out here.

87
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,400
- I'm fine.
- Come on. I won't bite.

88
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,800
Something wrong
with this picture.

89
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,840
Here's this nice, hard-working guy...

90
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,280
suddenly appears out of the blue.

91
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Takes the bus to and from work.

92
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,200
I mean, who takes
the bus anymore?

93
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,640
People who don't have cars.

94
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,040
- It's very weird.
- Not as weird as a sharp, young...

95
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
good-looking woman
working in a lumberyard.

96
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,880
Oh, yeah?
What's weird about that?

97
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,600
Most women wouldn't choose it.

98
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,360
Guess I'm not like most women.

99
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,320
You never spoke to me before.

100
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,760
I thought you were a dyke.

101
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,560
- Are you?
- What do you think?

102
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,680
You plan on drinking
both those beers?

103
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,440
- Is that a school?
- K through sixth.

105
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
Doesn't it get noisy?

106
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
I like the noise.

107
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,240
I used to think you were shy...

108
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,880
but now I think it's something else.

109
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,280
What?

110
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,480
- Something happened to you.
- Yeah?

111
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,400
I'm not easily shocked.

112
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
I get that impression.

113
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,720
So, you gonna tell me your dark secret?

114
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,160
Why do you want to know?

115
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,160
Don't you think I should know
before we have sex?

116
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,400
I don't like to waste time.

117
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,400
So, you gonna tell me
your deep, dark secret?

118
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
No.

119
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

120
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,480
So, you're not a dyke.

121
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,400
Not tonight.

122
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,080
Hey, that was intense.

123
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,160
You're still here.

124
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,080
I didn't say I didn't like it.

125
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,080
What are you doing?

126
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,160
This table's a heavy little bitch, man.

127
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,680
It's cherry.

128
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,280
This wood. It's cherry.

129
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,200
It's a nice table.

130
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,800
It's my own design. You're not gonna
find another one like it in the world.

131
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,680
- It was a beautiful gift.
- So, why are you giving it back to me?

132
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,800
Because, man, you need a table.

133
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,920
Carlos, I made this table for you
and Annette as a wedding present.

134
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,000
- I put a lot into it.
- I know, man.

135
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,480
I love the table too.
But I also love my wife.

136
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,280
Hey, you got a beer?

137
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,720
"I watch the kids arrive at school.

138
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,800
But for the last few weeks,
I've noticed someone else watching them.

139
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,760
I call him Candy. "

140
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,000
She's at the top
of her class at school.

141
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,880
How about your kids?

142
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,360
- They're good.
- Yeah?

143
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,840
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

144
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,840
She's really doing great at school.

145
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,720
I don't see her much, but-

146
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,680
- I'd keep away from him.
- What?

147
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,720
The new guy.

148
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,160
I'd keep away from him
if I were you.

149
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,600
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- I think he's damaged goods-

150
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,680
real damaged.

151
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,880
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do.

152
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,640
Thanks a bunch for the advice.

153
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,360
Suit yourself.

154
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,640
Close, but no ciggy.

155
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
Thanks, babe.

156
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,840
Thank you.

157
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,320
Hey, Walter.

158
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
Hello.

159
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,720
Hello.

160
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,600
You okay?

161
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,760
Walter, what did you do?

162
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,280
What happened to you?

163
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,400
Walter?

164
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,000
Why do you want to know?

165
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
Because I like you.

166
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,240
What's the worst thing
you ever did?

167
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,440
The worst?

168
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,800
I fucked my best friend's husband.

169
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,680
I mean, my best friend
since second grade.

170
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,040
He had the hots for me and-
Yeah, he was cute.

171
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,360
We'd get it on for days.

172
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,920
And then he told her- the shit.

173
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,320
Broke up their marriage.
Ruined our friendship.

174
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,520
I still feel like the lowest piece of shit
when I think about that.

175
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So, what did you do?

176
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,000
I molested little girls.

177
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,800
Twelve years in prison is no joke.

178
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
How young?

179
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,760
Between 10 and 12.

180
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,680
Once a nine-year-old
told me she was 11.

181
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,120
Once a 14-year-old
told me she was 12.

182
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,280
I always asked
how old they were.

183
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,640
What did you do to them?

184
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,720
It's not what you think.

185
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,800
I never hurt them.

186
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
Never.

187
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,920
Look...

188
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,880
I want you to go now, all right?

189
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,040
I told you
I'm not easily shocked.

190
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,920
Yeah, well, you should be shocked.

191
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,640
- Or do you get off on this shit?
- What?

192
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,640
When will I be normal?

193
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,760
We have a lot of work to do.

194
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,840
- Will I ever be normal?
- What's your idea of being normal?

195
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,600
What's your idea
of being a fuckin' shrink?

196
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,080
- Sorry.
- Watch where you're going.

197
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Sorry.

198
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
So what's happening?

199
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,680
Braves are kicking the shit
out of the Phillies.

200
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,440
Fucking Phillies.

201
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,400
It's just the beginning of the season.
You got to give them a chance.

202
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
- So, how was the party?
- What party?

203
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,920
- The birthday party.
- Fuck. It was great.

204
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,160
You should have seen Carla.
She was so pretty.

205
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,680
She looked like a princess.

206
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,520
She's the light of my life, man.

207
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,600
You don't want
to love them too much though.

208
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,560
No such thing, man.
I couldn't love her enough.

209
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,920
Oh, I've got photos.
You want to see?

210
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,840
- Nah, it's all right.
- Ah, come on.

211
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,560
I don't want to see
any goddamn pictures, all right?

212
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,920
They're just photos
I took at the party.

213
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,400
Carlos, I want to see my sister
and my niece in person.

214
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,800
Okay?

215
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,560
Yeah, okay.

216
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,320
I'm just saying Carlos
has a thing for his daughter.

217
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,240
If he's not careful, he's gonna suffer.

218
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,200
You think I'm crazy?

219
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,920
Do you think you're crazy?

220
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,800
You know, talking to you is like riding
on a fuckin' merry-go-round.

221
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,880
That's a marvelous image, Walter.

222
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,360
Because by going in circles we find things
we missed the first time around.

223
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,880
When will I be normal?

224
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,640
"So what should I do?

225
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,560
Call the cops?

226
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,080
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

227
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,920
But what if Candy seduces one
to go for a ride?

228
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
Yeah, that's right.

229
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,120
If the boy goes for a ride...

230
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
it's because he wants
to go for a ride. "

231
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,960
Walter.

232
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Cop.

233
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,080
Sergeant Lucas.
You mind if I come in?

234
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,520
You are in.

235
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,080
Yeah, I am.
But I always like to ask.

236
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,800
It's a force of habit.
You don't mind if I look around, do you?

237
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,240
I would.

238
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,520
Why, you got something to hide?

239
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,040
Doesn't everybody?

240
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,240
Have a seat.

241
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,840
I could get a search warrant.

242
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,600
Yeah, if you could get a search warrant,
you would have brought one today.

243
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,360
This cherry?

244
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,560
Yeah.

245
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,480
It's a little unusual design
for a contemporary piece, but-

246
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,520
Walter...

247
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,520
two nights ago a 10-year-old girl
got attacked not far from here.

248
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,880
That's a bit of a coincidence,
don't you think?

249
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,720
- What time did it happen?
- I'll ask the questions.

250
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,080
If you tell me what time
it happened, maybe I could-

251
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,200
Get your hands out
of your fuckin' pockets!

252
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,040
Sit down!

253
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,960
I know every fuckin' move
you make-

254
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,440
every goddamn step.

255
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
When you sleep, when you eat...

256
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,360
when you shit, when you jack off-

257
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,280
When you're sitting there
by the window...

258
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,240
watching the little girls
in their cotton white dresses...

259
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,160
and you're sittin' there on your little
jack-off bench, and you're jackin' off.

260
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,040
Do you show your cock
to little girls when you jack off?

261
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,360
- You can't talk to me like-
- Like what?

262
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,800
Like a piece of shit? That's what
you are to me, a piece of shit.

263
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,680
Throw you out
that window right now.

264
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,600
Think somebody's gonna miss you?

265
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,280
I could say you jumped
when I came in.

266
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,840
Who you think
they're gonna believe, me or you?

267
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,320
You'd just be a dead piece of shit.

268
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,400
We need to make sure...

269
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,480
that you're being
a good boy, Walter.

270
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,480
Okay?

271
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,760
- Okay?
- Okay.

272
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,280
Okay.

273
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,080
Okay.

274
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,320
Have a good day.

275
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,920
Nice table.

276
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,640
Yes, may I help you, please?

277
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,320
- What did you think would happen?
- I don't know.

278
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,360
- What did you want to happen?
- I don't know!

279
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,800
Would you please stop writing
in the fucking pad?

280
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,760
You know that if anything happens to me,
I go back to prison.

281
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
No parole. No nothin'. For life.

282
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,720
- Is this the first one?
- Of course it is!

283
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,360
- Why do you think I'm telling you?
- I want you to calm down.

284
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
You followed a girl.

285
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
Perhaps you wanted to see
what it felt like after so many years.

286
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,320
Maybe subconsciously
you were testing yourself.

287
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,440
And here you are...

288
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,400
talking about it with me.

289
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,680
This is positive.

290
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
Walter, we'll pick up here
next week.

291
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
Remember when
you asked me what...

292
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,880
my idea of normal was?

293
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,400
Normal is when I can see a girl...

294
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,520
be near a girl, even talk to a girl...

295
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,360
and not think about-

296
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
That's my idea of normal.

297
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,240
What are you lookin' at?

298
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,720
- What's this?
- What's it look like?

299
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,880
A plant. I don't need a plant.

300
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,760
Everyone needs a plant.

301
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,680
This ivy is one tough baby.

302
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,960
It's a cutting from one of mine.

303
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,520
So, here's the deal.

304
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
Give it a little water...

305
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,600
go easy on the direct sunlight...

306
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,640
and notice it
every once in a while.

307
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,880
They love it when you look at 'em
or touch their leaves.

308
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,240
Think you can handle that?

309
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,080
Such an asshole.

310
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,440
Thanks.

311
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,520
Want to go for a ride?

312
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,360
Sure.

313
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,760
Get your coat.

314
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,560
Why do you stay?

315
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,120
I see something in you,
something good.

316
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,400
You don't see it yet, but I do.

317
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,640
You know, most people
say the odds are against me.

318
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,320
What odds?

319
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,480
Percentages...

320
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,400
for guys like me.

321
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,000
Most of us end up back there.

322
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,080
Well, most people don't know
what they're talking about.

323
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,040
You want to talk about odds?

324
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,960
Someday I'll tell you how I survived...

325
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,280
as the only daughter
in a family with three sons.

326
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,920
Hell, maybe you should
tell me now.

327
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,800
Maybe not.

328
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,720
You scared?

329
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,160
I got poked around
here and there.

330
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,240
Jesus. Which brother?

331
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
All three, in chronological order.

332
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,320
Why are you telling me this?

333
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,440
I'm trying to tell you who I am,
if you're interested.

334
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,240
You must hate your brothers.

335
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,160
- I love my brothers.
- No, you don't.

336
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,760
I love all of them.

337
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,760
They're strong, gentle men
with families of their own.

338
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,800
If you ever asked them about what they did
to me, they'd beat the shit out of you.

339
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,040
And they'd call you a fucking liar.

340
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,520
Hey...

341
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
I never told anyone that before.

342
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,760
Yeah, he's right there.

343
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,920
Hey, Jim.

344
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,160
Yeah. Okay.

345
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,760
I'll tell him. Bye-bye.

346
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,280
Bob said you wanted to see me.

347
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,880
He wants everyone to sign
this card for Reggie.

348
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,400
It's a baby girl.

349
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,400
Reggie must be a happy man.

350
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,360
I heard you're lookin'
for another job.

351
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,320
Where'd you hear that?

352
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,760
- Around.
- I'm not lookin' for another job.

353
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,320
I just heard they're looking for some
good men down at Dan Shroeder's place.

354
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,320
I like my job. Thank you.

355
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,800
- So, I've got some good news.
- What's that?

356
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,760
Annette will see you.

357
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,080
Aren't you glad?

358
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,160
When?

359
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,440
Early July.

360
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,840
- That's three months from now.
- It's a better time.

361
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,520
Carla will be away at camp.
House'll be quiet.

362
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,280
It's better when it's quiet.

363
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,480
- Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
- Now, come on, Walter.

364
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,920
You should see my appointment book.
It just got crazy.

365
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,720
- It isn't what you think.
- Isn't it?

366
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,760
Look, the important thing
is that you and Annette talk.

367
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,200
She needs to see you,
and you need to see her.

368
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,640
I'm not a monster.

369
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,800
Hey.

370
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,480
So next week, Annette's gonna
be away for a few days, right?

371
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,200
And the thing is,
when Annette's away...

372
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,160
I get horny as hell for other women.

373
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,880
I mean, I fantasize about
fucking some beautiful woman.

374
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,920
You don't have to tell me this.

375
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,400
I know. I'm just sayin' I understand.

376
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,560
It's crazy out there. I mean,
girls wearing mini-this, mini-that-

377
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,640
Sometimes when I walk down the street
and I pass a sexy-looking woman...

378
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,600
she makes me feel
like I'm bothering her.

379
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,320
Hey, I see a pretty lady, I look.

380
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,800
That's the price of beauty, my friend.

381
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,320
You wouldn't believe the things Carla
and her friends are wearin' these days.

382
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,840
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

383
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,400
You ever have...

384
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,080
feelings for Carla?

385
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,600
What do you mean?

386
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,480
You know, feelings.

387
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,680
Look, man, I ain't got your sick fuckin'-
Disease? Is that what it is?

388
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,120
Whatever the fuck it is,
I ain't got it.

389
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,360
So if you ever touch
my daughter, I'll kill you.

390
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,560
When I say the word "girl"...

391
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,400
what is the earliest image
you can remember?

392
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,640
When I say the word "pretty,"
when I say the word "pleasure"...

393
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,800
who do you see?

394
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,760
I see my sister.

395
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,320
Where is she?

396
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,640
She's asleep in my bedroom.

397
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,080
Where are you?

398
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,600
I'm in my bed too.

399
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,600
How old are you and your sister?

400
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,720
Oh, about six.

401
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,160
That would make her four.

402
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,200
What are you doing?

403
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,800
Nothin'. Takin' a nap.

404
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,920
- A nap?
- Yeah, a nap.

405
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,440
Kids take naps.
You ever take a nap, Rosen?

406
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,080
I don't wanna talk about this.
What the hell are you doin' back there?

407
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,240
Did you and your sister
often take naps-

408
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,560
I want you back in your chair. Now!

409
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,600
I'm sorry.

410
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't like nobody behind my back.

411
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,960
Walter, what did you do
while taking naps with your sister?

412
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,600
Nothin'.

413
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:08,600
Did you touch her?
Did you take her clothes off?

414
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,680
- You take your clothes off?
- This is bullshit.

415
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,800
I'm only asking questions.

416
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,560
All right. I'm gonna tell you
just to shut you up.

417
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,040
I smelled her hair.

418
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,880
What else?

419
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,840
Nothin'.

420
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,320
That's it.

421
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,240
I just liked smellin' her hair.

422
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,520
You felt pleasure?

423
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,800
Yes.

424
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,400
- Did you get an erection?
- I was six years old.

425
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,840
I meant later,
when you two took naps-

426
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,760
when the two of you
held each other...

427
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,440
when you were 10 or 11,
and she was eight or nine-

428
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,680
when the two of you
were all alone...

429
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,640
completely alone in that big house.

430
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,960
It was a small house.

431
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,680
All right. A small house...

432
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,960
with small rooms.

433
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,440
I smelled her hair.

434
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,320
That's all.

435
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,480
I just liked smellin' her hair.

436
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,680
Hi.

437
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,480
Hello.

438
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,800
What are you looking at?

439
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,320
Up in that oak tree
there's a nest.

440
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,680
- Where?
- Up there.

441
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,800
- A little higher.
- There are little chicks.

442
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,720
- You want to see?
- Sure.

443
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,280
They're starlings.

444
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,240
- Is that right?
- I don't like starlings.

445
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,760
- Why not?
- They're extremely aggressive birds.

446
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,000
Plus their habits are pretty filthy.

447
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,280
The mother must have her hands full.

448
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,720
So, you always carry these with you?

449
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,720
When I go bird-watching.

450
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,680
It's why I like coming here.

451
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,600
It's just a city park.

452
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,600
You'd be surprised
how many kinds of birds you find here.

453
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,680
Last week, I saw a purple martin...

454
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,400
and the week before that,
I saw a solitary vireo.

455
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,880
- That's rare.
- A solitary vireo?

456
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,360
- I like that.
- Their sound is really musical.

457
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,880
Are you a bird-watcher too?

458
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,600
Me? No, I'm a-

459
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,560
more of a people-watcher.

460
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,000
The way you were staring
at the tops of those trees...

461
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,920
I thought you were
gonna take off and fly.

462
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,600
I should go now.

463
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,000
You come here a lot?

464
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,920
My daddy likes me home
before dark.

465
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,200
- Well, it's good to listen to your dad.
- Bye.

466
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,600
Good morning, fellow sports fans.
The match is about to begin.

467
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,960
Candy enters the arena
looking sweet and trim.

468
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,320
He checks out the scene but plays it cool.
He's definitely holding back.

469
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,880
Uh-oh. Candy's eyes
have locked on to something.

470
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,480
Oh, yeah. A cherub lad has separated
himself from his friends.

471
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,920
Candy quickly makes his move.
He offers the boy a bag of treats.

472
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,320
Round one to Candy.

473
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,040
The cherub walks away.!

474
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,680
Round two goes to the cherub.

475
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
Very risky move by Candy.

476
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,880
I have never seen Candy act so cocky.

477
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,200
The cherub looks at Candy.
Cherub looks for his friends.

478
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,160
But his friends are long gone.
The cherub is alone.

479
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,080
The cherub crosses the street- 

480
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,560
The cherub gets in the car.

481
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,320
- Hey, Walter.
- What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?

482
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,760
You can listen to
my stories about Jesus.

483
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,360
Oh, no. This is too much.
This is too much sun.

484
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,680
- What?
- This is ivy.

485
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,680
These plants don't like
a lot of sunlight.

486
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,640
Don't they grow outside?

487
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,120
Yeah, they grow outside.
But outside they got trees to shade 'em.

488
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,320
So now you're gonna take me
on a nature walk?

489
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,080
Have a seat.

490
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,080
So, yesterday you take
the 12 bus home...

491
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,720
but you don't get off
at your regular stop.

492
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,680
You stay on.
Why'd you stay on?

493
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,720
Fell asleep. When I woke up,
I was confused.

494
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,520
I got off at the wrong stop,
and I walked home.

495
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,680
You walked home?

496
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah.

497
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,720
Some of these guys...

498
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,200
they walk right
into a family's house.

499
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
Very-

500
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,160
It's very fuckin' ballsy.

501
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,720
Had this one guy,
he's on death row-

502
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,160
I'll call him Henry-

503
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,280
and he's tellin' me
about his last victim.

504
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,520
She's a little-
little cutie named Adele.

505
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,360
She's seven years old.

506
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,400
And Adele's mother's got
the TV playing so loud...

507
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,840
he can hear Letterman
tellin' jokes in the next room.

508
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,680
And he walks into Adele's room...

509
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,640
puts his hand over her mouth.

510
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,600
He says, "If you scream, little girl,
I'm gonna kill your mother."

511
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,440
So, of course,
Adele doesn't scream.

512
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,280
She doesn't cry.
She doesn't make a sound.

513
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,800
And Henry takes her by the hand.

514
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,840
They walk out the front door.

515
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,920
Ten days later,
they find Adele's body-

516
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,280
what's left of it.

517
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,440
You believe in fairy tales?

518
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,440
Fairy tales?

519
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,600
Yeah, like, Alice in Wonderland and-

520
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,720
No.

521
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,240
Yeah. Yeah, me neither.

522
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,600
What's the one with the woodsman?

523
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,640
- Woodsman?
- Yeah. With the ax.

524
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,480
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know it.

525
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,320
The woodsman-
He cuts open a wolf's stomach.

526
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,200
The little girl comes out alive.

527
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,320
- Little Red Riding Hood.
- Little Red Riding Hood.

528
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,520
That's it. That's it.

529
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,520
The woodsman-
He cuts open the wolf's stomach.

530
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,120
The girl comes out without a scratch.

531
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,440
You ever see a seven-year-old...

532
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,040
been sodomized in half?

533
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,000
She was so small...

534
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,360
just broken.

535
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,720
I saw 20-year vets on that job-
hard guys, man-

536
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,280
and they just broke down and cried.

537
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,240
I was there. I cried.

538
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,800
There ain't no fuckin' woodsman
in this world.

539
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,320
I don't know why they keep
lettin' freaks like you out on the street.

540
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,680
It just means that we gotta
catch you all over again.

541
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,920
I'll see you, Walter.

542
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,280
Talk to me like you fuckin'-

543
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,200
Speak to me like you fuckin'-

544
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,520
I am not-

545
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,480
I am not-

546
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,760
- Let's go.
- You don't feel sorry for this sick fuck.

547
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,320
- Mind your own business, Pedro.
- This is my business.

548
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,880
What the hell is goin' on here?

549
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,840
Who did this?

550
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,000
Any man who can't deal with it,
you meet me in the office.

551
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,600
I'll pay you for the week.
You can clear the fuck out.

552
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,560
We got a lot of orders today.
Get to work.

553
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,320
This is bullshit.

554
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,960
Are you okay?

555
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,600
Watch your back, bitch.

556
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,760
This is ready whenever.

557
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,800
Where's Walter?

558
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,360
I don't know.

559
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,800
I don't fucking believe this.

560
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,960
- Goddamn it, Mary-Kay!
- Bitch, what the fuck are you doin'?

561
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,760
- What is going on?
- This is bullshit, Bob!

562
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,160
It's bullshit.

563
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,280
People have the right to know.

564
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,760
See anything interesting?

565
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,000
Not yet.

566
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,400
- What are you writin' in that book?
- It's my bird book.

567
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,800
I've identified 67 species
of birds this year alone.

568
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,720
Wow.

569
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,880
Where are your friends?

570
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,160
Don't you have any friends?

571
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,400
I have friends.

572
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,520
A pretty girl like you
should have a lot of friends.

573
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,040
I'm not pretty.

574
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,080
- Well, not in the common way.
- What does that mean?

575
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,920
It means that uncommon beauty...

576
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,800
is commonly overlooked.

577
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,880
You know, like people only notice...

578
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,480
the birds with the brightest colors.

579
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,040
What's your name?

580
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,120
Let's see. Linda.

581
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,280
Susan?

582
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,960
Jennifer?

583
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,960
Jackie?

584
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,920
You tell me your name,
and I'll tell ya mine.

585
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,760
Robin.

586
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,880
Yeah, like the bird.

587
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,040
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

588
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,360
- No, you're not.
- I will be in three months.

589
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,400
I can't wait. I hate being 11.

590
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,240
It has to be the stupidest age
in the world.

591
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,360
What's your name?

592
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,160
Walter.

593
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,240
- Do you have many friends?
- No.

594
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,200
How come?

595
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,800
A long time ago, I was sent away f-

596
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,320
When I came home,
all my friends were gone.

597
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,440
Sounds like you were banished.

598
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,680
Banished, yeah.

599
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:23,440
Birds are my friends.
They know I watch them...

600
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,920
but they don't mind
because they like being watched...

601
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,400
if they know
you won't hurt them.

602
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,280
- Robin-
- Yes?

603
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:40,960
Would you like to sit on my lap?

604
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,240
What?

605
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,560
Would you like to sit on my lap?

606
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,560
No, thank you.

607
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,040
Okay.

608
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,040
Doesn't matter.

609
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,920
Do you want me to sit on your lap?

610
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,400
Yes.

611
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,520
I would enjoy that.

612
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,720
I know this place that's really quiet...

613
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,680
except for the sound
of these tiny little birds.

614
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,440
They sound like finches.

615
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,720
Yeah, they might be finches.

616
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,080
Do you want to see?

617
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,640
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.

618
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,360
- Does he?
- Yes.

619
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,480
Do you like it when he asks you?

620
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,560
No.

621
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,080
Why not?

622
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,120
Are you two alone
when he asks you?

623
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,320
Does he say strange things?

624
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,880
Does he move his legs
in funny ways?

625
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,000
Walter...

626
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,800
do you still want me
to sit on your lap?

627
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,280
I will.

628
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,760
I don't mind.

629
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,440
No.

630
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,720
Go home, Robin.

631
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,680
Come on in. It's open.

632
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,120
Hey, Walter.

633
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,360
What can I do for you,
Sergeant Lucas?

634
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,960
I don't know. We'll see.

635
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,720
You didn't hear? Last night-

636
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,920
all that shoutin'
and screamin' outside?

637
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,880
No.

638
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,200
Yeah, a guy got beat up
pretty bad last night out there.

639
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,080
- You don't know anything about this?
- Nope.

640
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,600
I could take ya downtown.

641
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,840
Yeah, you could...

642
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,160
but it'd be a waste of your time.

643
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,120
There was a boy there.
He could I.D. The assailant.

644
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,200
He gave a description.

645
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,680
It fits you really, really close.

646
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,960
That's a nasty scratch
on your neck.

647
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,000
I got a passionate girlfriend.

648
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:43,200
What's with the boxes?

649
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,840
I'm movin' in with her.

650
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,680
Congrats. Lucky you.

651
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,520
I count my blessings.

652
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,640
Yeah, I bet you do.

653
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,440
Well, all right.

654
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,360
I'll be seein' you around, Walter.

655
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,200
Hey.

656
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,520
You think you're gonna
catch this guy?

657
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,000
Yeah. Yeah.

658
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,720
We're gonna catch him.

659
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,720
But the victim can't talk.

660
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,640
Among all his other injuries,
he's got a broken jaw.

661
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,920
However, we did run
a check on the victim...

662
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,200
and as it turns out
he's wanted in Virginia.

663
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,280
Raped a boy down there.

664
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,280
You stay out of trouble, Walter.
I'm watchin' you.

665
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,960
I saw my sister.

666
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,880
It was hard.

667
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,360
She's still really hurt and angry.

668
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,760
I understand that. I do.

669
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,760
It's gonna take time, Walter.

670
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,760
Time?

671
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,760
How do you feel about that?

672
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,280
I feel...

673
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,880
okay.
