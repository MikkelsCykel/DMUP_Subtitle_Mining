1
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:35,249
## Asked that girl
what she wanted to be ##

2
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:39,101
## and she said, baby, can't you see? ##

3
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:42,873
## I wanna be the famous,
a star of the screen ##

4
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:44,740
## but you can do ##

5
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:46,742
## something in between ##

6
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,413
## baby, you can drive my car ##

7
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:53,417
## yes, I知 gonna be a star ##

8
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:57,688
## baby, you can drive my car ##

9
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,091
## and baby, I love you ##

10
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:07,031
## I told that girl that
my prospects were good ##

11
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:10,785
## and she said, baby,
it's understood ##

12
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,505
## working for peanuts
is all very fine ##

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,609
## but I can show you a better time ##

14
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,345
## baby, you can drive my car ##

15
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,349
## yes, I知 gonna be a star ##

16
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,120
## baby, you can drive my car ##

17
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,273
## and baby, I love you ##

18
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:35,392
## beep beep beep beep yeah ##

19
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,230
## beep beep beep beep yeah ##

20
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,000
## beep beep beep beep yeah! ##

21
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,029
Remember, the driver
must always see the big picture.

22
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,298
When driving through
puddLes or in heavy rain,

23
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,566
your tires may
begin to hydroplane...

24
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,137
actually ride on the water
rather than the pavement.

25
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,170
If this happens to you, don't panic

26
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,908
and especially don't jam on your brakes.

27
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,576
In this actual scientific demonstration,

28
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,911
we see that in as little
as a quarter inch of water

29
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:19,049
your tires may lose contact
with the surface completely.

30
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:53,817
Does your brother
have mono or something?

31
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,353
- He slept through the entire course.
- No.

32
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:58,722
He's just brain-dead.

33
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:03,259
Mr. Anderson.

34
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:06,228
It's punks like you that paramedics

35
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:09,233
end up scraping off the
road at 4:00 in the morning.

36
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,303
For your sake and the safety of others,

37
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,473
I hope you fail your driving exam.

38
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,689
Wait up!

39
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:35,726
Wait up! My bus!

40
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:02,202
You know, dean, I can't help wondering,

41
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,687
is it ever gonna get that good for me?

42
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:08,158
Anderson, the only difference
between you and that greaseball

43
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:11,595
is that he has a license, and you don't.

44
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

45
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,967
Scumbag!

46
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,873
Get on it. I'll drive you home.

47
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,044
No way, man. I have a
driver's exam to take Saturday.

48
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,878
- I don't want to get killed.
- Les.

49
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:32,416
Your license is just as
important to me as it is to you.

50
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,619
I'll take it easy.

51
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:37,186
Trust me.

52
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,556
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

53
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,892
Watch out, watch out!

54
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,194
Dean! Dean!

55
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:49,467
- I'll get you, you little prick!
- Dean!

56
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,481
- Hee-hee-hee-hee!
- Whoa!

57
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,118
Here you go!

58
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,220
Front-door service!

59
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:14,725
- Great. Thanks.
- Wow!

60
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,425
Whose caddy?

61
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,563
It's my grandfather's.
16 years old, man,

62
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,099
and it only has 20,000 miLes on it.

63
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,233
Wow!

64
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,705
- What's it doing here?
- My granddad's afraid to take it on long trips,

65
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,508
so he borrowed my dad's car for a week.

66
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,277
Do you know this boat would kick ass

67
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,244
up at archies?

68
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,115
Do you think there's any chance
we can get it Saturday night?

69
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,949
- Not a chance in hell.
- No way.

70
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:42,686
- Hey, dad, what's up?
- I'm just cleaning out the garage,

71
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,254
making some room for the
old boat. What do you think?

72
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,325
- As long as you're here, you want to give us a hand?
- Hey, Deano!

73
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,328
I'd love to, Mr. Anderson,
but I just remembered...

74
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,450
I'm allergic to dust and cardboard boxes

75
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,735
I gotta go.
See you tonight, Les!

76
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,706
- See you tonight, Deano.
- Take care of that cough, dean.

77
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,740
- Dad?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,877
Do you think there's
any way you can tell me

79
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,944
if I can borrow mom's
car Saturday night?

80
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:12,383
Here's the deal, Les. First get
your license, then we'll talk.

81
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,824
Natalie!

82
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,195
What nice happened to who today?

83
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,397
What interesting news?

84
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,687
For your information,
this is exactly what I ate

85
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:55,259
when I was pregnant with all
of you. You turned out okay.

86
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,926
- Dad?
- Yep?

87
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:59,997
Did you, um, look at
the brochure I gave you?

88
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,133
- You bet.
- What did you think?

89
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, a $23,000 BMW

90
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:08,439
for a 16-year-old kid who's
never had a job a day in his life?

91
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,439
I think it's a great idea.

92
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,943
But dad, the car
wouldn't only be for me.

93
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,411
I mean, she can use it too!

94
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:17,780
Don't include me in your obsessions.

95
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,734
Les, isn't it premature to be
talking about getting a car?

96
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,013
You just finished your driver's
ed course two hours ago.

97
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:27,223
Karl says that in America,
people are mislead to believe

98
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:31,161
- that a car represents freedom
and individuality... - right.

99
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:34,549
When in essence, it is more
oppressive than anything else.

100
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,902
Burdening the individual
with such materialistic cost...

101
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,222
wait, who cares what your
commie boyfriend thinks?

102
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:44,508
- I see it's great to be an American.
- I agree.

103
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,108
Yes!

104
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,879
This is the most oppressive
environment a child can be raised in.

105
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,849
Natalie, one day soon,
it will all be over.

106
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,652
You'll go away.

107
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,123
All right, I知 out of here.

108
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,426
Hey, buddy, down!

109
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,001
Yo, let's go!

110
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:15,372
Les, come on, get your butt down here!

111
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,207
Les!

112
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,611
Get down here, Les!

113
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,148
- Get out!
- Out!

114
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,818
Right. I'll see you later.

115
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,456
## Sweet, sweet surrender... ##

116
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,927
- mom... - what
are you doing?

117
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,594
Duck down! Duck down!

118
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,597
Mom, mom! No, don't stop here.

119
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,435
- Go, go!
- Is something wrong with the car, dean?

120
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,235
No, it's not the car, it's you.

121
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,473
- You're driving. Please, just go.
- All right.

122
00:11:57,214 --> 00:12:01,419
- Thanks, mom. Drive safely.
- Boy: Hey, dweebs!

123
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,188
Does mommy hold your
dicks when you piss?

124
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,594
Sorry, mom, I didn't introduce
you. Those are my friends.

125
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,731
- Oh. Good night
- good night, mom.

126
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:19,069
## When your life meets mine ##

127
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:22,406
## you reach way down inside... ##

128
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,009
thanks, mom.

129
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,228
Good night, honey.

130
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:30,012
- Ignore.
- Bye, mom!

131
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,499
- Be careful!
- Hey, guys!

132
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,661
Hey, guys! Where are you going?

133
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:38,789
Guys! Hey, guys, it's me, CharLes!

134
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:48,798
Oh, baby!

135
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,867
Hey, do you ever wonder what kind of car

136
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,371
some of these babes would
lose their virginity in?

137
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,007
You never cease to amaze me, Deano.

138
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,974
No, seriously. Okay,

139
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,445
look at Sheryl Lieberman.

140
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,215
A V.W. Convertible.

141
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,951
Sheryl Lieberman? Trans am.

142
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:11,488
- Beth Macclain.
- A Volvo. No, wait.

143
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:14,525
A station wagon.

144
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,661
Okay, I got one for you. Bonnie duper.

145
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:22,433
- A cargo van.
- A garbage truck!

146
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,175
Mercedes.

147
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,310
Mercedes lane.

148
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,614
I've bumped into her a million times.

149
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,347
She's never bumped into me once.

150
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,085
- Come with me.
- No, listen, you don't own me.

151
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,985
Women have rights in this country.

152
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,357
Not like Kuwait or Pakistan
where they worship their men.

153
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,194
Mercedes, it has nothing
to do with worship.

154
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,847
It has to do with going
to parties with kids!

155
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:54,430
I happen to go to
school with these kids.

156
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:57,501
- I have friends here.
- Friends, yes. Friends, okay.

157
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,538
But these are children.
They can do nothing for you.

158
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,941
Mercedes, I知 beginning to...

159
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,076
perspire.

160
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,213
You know that I hate to perspire.

161
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,579
Now let us go.

162
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,882
I think I can find my own way home,

163
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,384
- thank you.
- Don't do this, Mercedes.

164
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,022
And Paolo, if you're
wondering about Saturday night,

165
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,424
I just remembered I already have a date.

166
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,394
You have a date? With who?

167
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:28,698
- With him.
- With me?

168
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:31,135
Didn't we make arrangements?

169
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,972
Yeah, I... I
believe so.

170
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,774
But nothing was final.

171
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,578
Well, now they're final.

172
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,314
Ciao!

173
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,551
Hey, watch it!

174
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,521
Thanks.

175
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,263
Les, I have the answer.

176
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,399
What don't you just
ask her, to make sure?

177
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:07,037
I'd love to, CharLes, but I can't
talk to something I can't see, right?

178
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,807
Last night was the closest any
of us have ever been to her.

179
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,374
Well, you're in luck, loverboy,

180
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,611
'cause she's sitting
down right over there.

181
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:21,485
- Wait, wait, dean. I can't do it, man!
- Go on, ask her.

182
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,855
If you're lucky, she'll bite.

183
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:33,998
Dean: Go for it!

184
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,786
Les!

185
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:41,072
Les.

186
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,308
Les?

187
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,880
Les, it's me, papa!

188
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:54,083
Les, wait up!

189
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,754
Where are you going? Les?

190
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,692
What's the matter? Is there
something wrong with having a father?

191
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,326
Dad, what are you doing here?

192
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:06,647
I had to run some errands
for your mom after work

193
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,898
and I thought I壇 stop
by and take you driving.

194
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:12,269
I figure, if you can handle this
cruiser you can handle anything.

195
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,071
- What about grandpa?
- What about grandpa?

196
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:18,509
- Who knows what he's doing with my car. Get in.
- Yeah!

197
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:22,947
- Dad, here comes a stop sign.
- Nice call.

198
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,351
That was a good one.

199
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:30,621
Why don't we make a
right turn right here?

200
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:33,858
- What?
- I have to ask you a favour,

201
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,624
and you could say no.

202
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,729
But I will never, ever ask you for
another favour as long as I live.

203
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,264
Les, you know that's a lie.

204
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,802
Okay, see that girl over there walking?

205
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,935
Dad!

206
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,439
That is the girl of my dreams.

207
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,207
Okay, okay.

208
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,077
- Let's give her a cruise!
- Dad.

209
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,445
Dad, shh! Look,

210
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,917
- she just asked me out last night, dad.
- Yeah?

211
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,951
Now, if I drove by her

212
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:05,121
with you in the
car with me...

213
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,157
no offence, it just wouldn't
work. You understand?

214
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:12,029
You're asking me to let you drive
this car alone without a license.

215
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,864
- Are you crazy?!
- I'm just gonna go up to her,

216
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:18,102
circle around, maybe say hello
to her and come right back.

217
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:19,870
Two minutes! I'll be careful, dad.

218
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,439
- Sure.
- Thanks.

219
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,576
- Be careful.
- I will, I promise.

220
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,878
- I trust you.
- Thanks, dad.

221
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,383
- Oh and, dad, dad!
- Yeah?

222
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,018
Would you mind?

223
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:48,397
Mercedes!

224
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:51,469
Mercedes? Les Anderson, from the party

225
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,055
last night.

226
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,572
Oh. Oh, hi!

227
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,609
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.

228
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,978
Hop in, I値l give you a lift.

229
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,530
Sure.

230
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:04,982
Hold on!

231
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,057
After you, Madame.

232
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,673
Okay, so, which house is yours?

233
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,076
- Third one on
the left. - Okay...

234
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,979
but, I知 not going home.

235
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:37,813
Where are you going?

236
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,518
To a friend's house, in Cedarwood.

237
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,787
You don't mind, so you?

238
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,430
Not at all.

239
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,570
Les?

240
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,573
Les?!

241
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:09,146
Les!

242
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,790
- Thanks a lot.
- Wait, wait!

243
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,424
Mercedes!

244
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:25,227
Last night at the party,

245
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:27,530
you kind of mentioned something about

246
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,267
me and you maybe going
out Saturday night.

247
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,101
Anyway, I was just

248
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:35,806
wondering if it was still on.

249
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,741
Sure. Call me tomorrow.

250
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,245
Let me give you my number
in case something comes up.

251
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,783
- Oh, here. Write it on this.
- Great.

252
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:50,388
Thanks a lot for the ride, Les.

253
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,157
Yeah, no problem.

254
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,299
How could you do it, Les?

255
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,443
What were you thinking about?

256
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,518
I don't believe it. I mean...

257
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,923
not only did you break
your explicit promise to me,

258
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,592
but you used up your last favour.

259
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:32,596
I suppose you know where
this leaves you, don't you?

260
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,897
- Not in good shape?
- That's right.

261
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:37,468
Look, dad, just let me
explain it to you, okay?

262
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,970
She told me she lived three houses down.

263
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,723
I thought I was taking her home.

264
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,441
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

265
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:45,374
Tell Mercedes lane the truth,

266
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,711
- that Les Anderson doesn't have a license?
- Yes.

267
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:51,715
And risk her having a heart
attack from laughing so hard at me?

268
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,452
Her? Her having a heart attack?

269
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,154
Look, dad, please put
yourself in my shoes.

270
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:02,793
Look, you're upsetting your mother.

271
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,195
She's pregnant, you know?

272
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,496
Do you understand what happens

273
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,632
if you get caught
driving without a license?

274
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,470
They make you wait two years
before you can take the test again.

275
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:15,272
That's 24 months. That's
an awful lot of bus rides.

276
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,573
Relax, Deano. I didn't get caught.

277
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,210
And you would have done the
exact same thing that I did.

278
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,248
Now, did you guys come over here
to ask me some questions, or what?

279
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,450
All right, here's one:

280
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,354
"How can you identify a blind pedestrian

281
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,224
to whom you must yield
the right of way?"

282
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,057
This is a complete waste of time.

283
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,995
It's not like you just moved
here from bedrock or something.

284
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,682
You've been a passenger
in a car all your life.

285
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,334
And what is this shit?

286
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,604
Natalie!

287
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,973
Hey, Natalie, I was wondering,

288
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,943
if you're driving 55 miLes per hour

289
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,844
and you collide with a runaway train,

290
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:57,748
would it make
any improvements on your face?

291
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:07,224
Good luck on your exam
tomorrow, Einstein!

292
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,495
Good afternoon, children!

293
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,567
In the next 20 minutes, you
will be given 30 questions.

294
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,601
Anything over five mistakes

295
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:21,839
will be considered a failing grade.

296
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:25,042
We'll begin at the sound of the bell.

297
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,913
Begin.

298
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:36,520
Welcome to the department
of motor vehicLes driver's test.

299
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,788
Press start to begin.

300
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,790
Question one: What should you do

301
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,827
if you miss your exit
from an expressway?

302
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,296
Jam on the breaks and back up;

303
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:48,130
b: Make a quick u-turn.

304
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:51,769
Go on to the next one. Correct.

305
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:55,037
- Ha!
- Question two:

306
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:57,475
Which is usually the
smoothest lane of traffic?

307
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,678
Why don't they just give licenses away?

308
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,647
- Incorrect.
- What?

309
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,455
Question three: You must
look for bicycle riders

310
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,292
in the same lanes used by
motor vehicLes, because they...

311
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,626
a: Must ride facing oncoming traffic;

312
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:20,097
b: Are entitled to
share the road with you;

313
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:22,566
c: Always have the right of way.

314
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,872
Incorrect.

315
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:33,110
When driving through fog
or rain, it is advisable...

316
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,958
...c: Stop.

317
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,593
Incorrect.

318
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,697
Warning, one more wrong and you fail!

319
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,704
Finished!

320
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:04,940
Question 26.

321
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:08,412
At 55 miLes per hour you come
upon a large puddle of water.

322
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,980
Do you a: Pump the brakes;

323
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:14,151
b: Gently ease your
foot off the gas pedal;

324
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,220
c: Accelerate?

325
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,900
Incorrect. You have failed!

326
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,677
- Damn!
- Oh man!

327
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:43,981
- What happened?
- I lost my screen.

328
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,016
Someone pull the plug or something?

329
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:50,471
Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson!

330
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:53,055
Mr. Anderson. Oh, Mr. Anderson.

331
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,494
You can thank your sister for this one.

332
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,294
- I can?
- Uh-huh.

333
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,229
Due to a computer malfunction,

334
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:02,800
we are unable to search
the system's memory

335
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,967
for your test results.

336
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,606
However, since your sister
received a perfect score,

337
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,539
we are going to pass you

338
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:13,577
and allow you to take your road test.

339
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:18,248
I mean, how different can you

340
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,851
and your twin sister actually be?

341
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,123
- What about me?
- Wait a minute, stand back.

342
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,892
Don't crowd me. I'm a living time bomb

343
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:40,738
- okay.
- Hi.

344
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,945
Last name first, first name last.

345
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,746
Anderson. Les Anderson.

346
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,517
Buckle up, son! It's
the real world out here!

347
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,786
Anderson?

348
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,721
I want you to take a long,

349
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,258
hard look at this cup of coffee.

350
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,393
I love my coffee.

351
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,663
It's probably the one
thing I truly cherish

352
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,899
on this godforsaken
mudball called earth.

353
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,366
What I知 trying to say

354
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:14,872
is that most examiners use a clipboard.

355
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,139
I don't believe in them.

356
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,742
What i do believe in is my cup of coffee.

357
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:22,062
Now that coffee's hot,
filled right to the brim.

358
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,348
If it spilled on me, it's
probably burn me, huh?

359
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,815
- Speak up, son!
- Yeah, yeah.

360
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,152
- Nobody likes to get burned, do they?
- No.

361
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,821
So it's real simple. You burn me

362
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,488
you fail.

363
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,308
You don't, you pass.

364
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,093
It's as simple as that.

365
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,609
All right, Anderson.

366
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,514
Let's start off with some light traffic.

367
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,893
Now I want you to get over in that lane.

368
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,927
Now.

369
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:20,536
Very good, Natalie.

370
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,040
Now, why don't you head
up to the left here?

371
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,912
Let's see how you handle this hill.

372
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,881
Very good.

373
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,351
Anderson, let's pull to a stop

374
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,921
- right here.
- Here?

375
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:48,197
What the heck's wrong with him?

376
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:51,267
Every time I come up this
road there's some idiot kid.

377
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,338
- Come on, you moron!
- What are you waiting for, Christmas?

378
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:57,575
Ought to have a truck
to get that thing moving.

379
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,314
Ha ha!

380
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:09,019
Okay, Natalie, I壇 like you to
stop right next to this car here.

381
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,655
Good.

382
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,626
Now why don't you
parallel park right here?

383
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,932
Very, very, very good!

384
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:29,039
Anderson, I want you to make
a parallel park right in here.

385
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,376
- In there?
- What am I speaking, Greek? In here.

386
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,257
Ha!

387
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,062
Congratulations. Here's your license.

388
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,465
- Please, drive safely.
- Thanks.

389
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,834
- Good morning. How are you?
- Lousy!

390
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,841
I got it! I got it!

391
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,276
Slow down!

392
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,888
You're in luck, Anderson.

393
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,388
The cup...

394
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,792
was empty.

395
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,930
See you on the battlefield
sometime, soldier.

396
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,368
Congratulations. Here's your license.

397
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,637
And please, drive safely.

398
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:38,008
Mr. Anderson. Just a minute.

399
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,046
Someone wants to speak with you.

400
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,169
Well, Mr. Anderson,

401
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,171
we were able to retrieve

402
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,540
your test results from the computer.

403
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:15,146
And I suppose you
already know you failed.

404
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,147
God giveth

405
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:20,885
and the D.M.V. Take away.

406
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,752
You mustn't fuck

407
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,556
with the department of
vehicLes, Mr. Anderson.

408
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:28,426
We can make your life a living hell.

409
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:28,486
- Hi!
- Hi, we're home!

410
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,454
Where is everybody?

411
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,059
- Please, we'll keep the
plastic on... - yeah... no...

412
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:38,729
- Mom? Dad?
- Yeah, in here. Shh.

413
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:41,230
Mom? Dad? Hi.

414
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:44,435
Yeah, hi, sport. 
What's the good word?

415
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,769
Um...

416
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,505
I have to tell you guys something.

417
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,210
Oh no, you put a dent
in the car already?

418
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,979
What is it, honey?

419
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,983
Um...

420
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,454
- I...
- What?

421
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,657
What?

422
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,994
## I'm a free man! ##

423
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,928
- wow! Yeah!
- Yes!

424
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,398
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

425
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,700
So tell me, was it murder? Was it tough?

426
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,805
Not at all, dad. It was like
taking candy from a baby.

427
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,371
Great. Look,

428
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,940
I filled your mom's car up with some gas

429
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:28,245
just in case you felt like
taking it for a little spin.

430
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,646
- How sweet.
- Well, dad.

431
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:33,918
I was kind of thinking about going
to my room and taking a little nap.

432
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,352
- I'm exhausted.
- Honey, what is wrong with you?

433
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,423
- Say "ah!"
- Mom, come on, what could be wrong with me?

434
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,524
- It's the greatest day of my life!
- I know.

435
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,328
So why don't you take advantage
of your father's senility

436
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:47,198
- and take my car for a spin?
- Go ahead.

437
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:50,034
I don't know if you
guys remember or not,

438
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,604
but 16 years of waiting and dreaming

439
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,906
is a lot of pressure. And I知 not sure

440
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:57,139
that being behind the wheel of a car

441
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,176
is the right place
for me to be right now.

442
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,382
Hello?

443
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,253
Did you hear that? You did
it, man. How does it feel?

444
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,053
Dean, what's going on?

445
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:14,625
Hold on a second. I'm
looking for my car keys.

446
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,978
Found them right here,
next to my Card.

447
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,296
Great. Now come over and pick us up.

448
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,332
- Uh, I can't.
- Of course, you can.

449
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,936
You can do anything,
Les. You have a license.

450
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,037
What? See that, dean, my mom's calling.

451
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,375
They're already asking me to run
errands. I have to go. Goodbye!

452
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,928
"Test failed"?

453
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,231
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

454
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,765
Robert!

455
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,501
## Trouble ##

456
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,168
## trouble ##

457
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,304
all right, Mercedes! Ha-ha. Yeah!

458
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,442
Well, you know...
lower it, it's ringing.

459
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,108
Come here.

460
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:09,945
Hello?

461
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,516
Rudy, mom's got brownies in the kitchen.

462
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,417
- Go! Hurry,
quick! - But...

463
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,488
- dad, what do you need?
- Les, my boy.

464
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:21,025
We're drinking a toast to you.

465
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,627
Mercedes: Hello? Hello?

466
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,162
Hello?!

467
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,116
Dad, that's really thoughtful of you,

468
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:31,702
but I shouldn't be drinking and driving.

469
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,571
I know that, Les. I know that.

470
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:36,274
- Have a drink. 
- But I...

471
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:38,908
you just saved me $26,000.

472
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,746
- What?
- First raise your glass

473
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:46,150
to saving me 26,000 buckaronis.

474
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:48,520
How did I do that, dad?

475
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:50,672
Simple. 23,000 for the BMW,

476
00:34:50,707 --> 00:34:52,816
3,000 for the insurance.

477
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:54,925
- I don't get it.
- No?

478
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,994
- No.
- Get it?

479
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,896
He failed?

480
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,734
He failed and he lied.

481
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,336
Look, dad,

482
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,473
I figured that I can
get through the weekend

483
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,308
and then take it over Monday, you know?

484
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,576
I know what you figured.

485
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,748
Listen, you're grounded for two weeks.

486
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:20,149
It's not the end of the world.

487
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,119
Feels like it.

488
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,511
- Good evening, Karl.
- Good evening, Mrs. Anderson.

489
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,931
- Is Natasha at home?
- She'll be down in a second.

490
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,501
- How are you feeling?
- Fine. Fine.

491
00:35:36,536 --> 00:35:39,001
- Fine, thank you.
- I admire you.

492
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,889
I really admire you
for having the courage

493
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:44,384
to bring a child into
this oppressive world.

494
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:46,844
- And let me just...
- Natalie!

495
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,499
Natasha, we're going to a protest.

496
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:55,119
Do we have to take your mother's

497
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,153
imperialist gas guzzler?

498
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,191
Would you rather take my
grandfather's Cadillac?

499
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:52,408
- Hello?
- Hi, is Les in, please?

500
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,913
- Yeah, this is Les.
- Hi, this is Mercedes.

501
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:58,414
Do you remember me?

502
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,118
Remember you? Yes, of
course. Hi, how are you?

503
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,319
Actually, I知 a little lonely.

504
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,322
I thought that we had a date tonight,

505
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,126
and I figured I壇 call you
since you hadn't called me.

506
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:11,227
Oh, um,
well, I...

507
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,264
I was out all day. I
was deep-sea fishing.

508
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,803
So you haven't changed your
mind about tonight, have you?

509
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:20,871
Tonight? Now?

510
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,673
- No.
- Great.

511
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,910
So you can pick me up in 20 minutes?

512
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:31,882
- Les?
- Hang on.

513
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,537
An innocent girl,

514
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,871
a harmLess drive.

515
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,509
What could possibly go wrong?

516
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,247
Mercedes?

517
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,118
I'll be there in half an hour.

518
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,425
Oh man!

519
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,494
No! No! No!

520
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,533
No, not the bushes!

521
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,019
God!

522
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,957
Oh! Ah!

523
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,694
Sh... -

524
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,759
Ow! Ow!

525
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,532
Hmm. Hmm?

526
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,442
Don't worry, it was
nothing. Go back to sleep.

527
00:40:11,477 --> 00:40:13,544
Mmm... that's nice.

528
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,937
Let's go.

529
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,282
## 'cause you spell trouble ##

530
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:53,582
## trouble ##

531
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,054
## I tried to please you,
but I知 wasting my time ##

532
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:58,656
## you're nothing but trouble ##

533
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:00,723
## trouble ##

534
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,527
## trouble, baby ##

535
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,965
## trouble. ##

536
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,279
- Thank you.
- Take good care of my car, pal.

537
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,048
Yes, sir.

538
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,823
Come on, man, open up!

539
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,192
- Let's go!
- Open the door, Les.

540
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,696
Did you see that? If
I let him park my car

541
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:40,431
he'll ruin my transmission. No way!

542
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,036
Hey, what about my tip?

543
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,642
Here we are.

544
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,446
Wait, we can't park here.
It's a tow-away zone.

545
00:41:55,481 --> 00:41:57,646
On a Saturday night?

546
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,885
You're acting like it's the
first time you've ever driven.

547
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,201
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

548
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,706
- Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?
- I'm with her.

549
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,410
You wouldn't be with her if
she was your Siamese twin!

550
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:28,646
- Lose yourself, kid.
- Mercedes!

551
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,150
Hi!

552
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,088
- It's nice to see you.
- Hi.

553
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,363
Damn it!

554
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,466
- Paolo?
- Mercedes.

555
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,635
What a lovely surprise it is to see you.

556
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,340
- I have to talk to you.
- By the way, this is Veronique.

557
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,960
She's going to be moving in with me.

558
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:01,545
Is this the one you told me about?

559
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,682
Would you like a
drink? Give her a drink.

560
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:07,385
- What are you having?
- Nothing.

561
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,963
Mercedes! Hey, are you okay?

562
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,035
Oh my god. My car!

563
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:28,639
Whoa! Jesus!

564
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:32,626
Wait, wait! Wait! Hold up!

565
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:35,344
Get off my truck, boy!

566
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,150
Look, mister, you
can't do this to my car!

567
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:41,169
Boy, I致e driven with deer, antelope,

568
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,180
even bears strapped to that bumper.

569
00:43:43,215 --> 00:43:45,121
Ain't no 65-lb. Sack of flyshit

570
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,274
like you gonna shake
me a hell a difference.

571
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:49,393
I'll pay you. I'll give
you everything I got!

572
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,630
Aah!

573
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,637
Just how much you talking about?

574
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,644
Please, sir, be gentle.

575
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,848
For 80 bucks?!

576
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,322
80 bucks!

577
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,534
Would you like some champagne?

578
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:32,654
- It might help.
- No, thanks.

579
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:34,739
I already had some tonight.

580
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,208
I'm really sorry about the car.

581
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,211
- I feel like it was all my fault.
- Don't be silly.

582
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,483
I should have given the car to
the valet in the first place.

583
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,850
I'm sorry about your friend.

584
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:51,122
He was a jerk anyways. I don't
know why I even hung around him.

585
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,460
- Let's get out of here.
- And go where?

586
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:59,063
With the amount of
money I have in my pocket

587
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:01,163
we have two choices.

588
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,602
We can either sit in front a
parking meter for 20 minutes,

589
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:07,004
or go buy ourselves a newspaper.

590
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,843
Let me tell you. I know a quiet spot

591
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,112
with plenty of free parking.

592
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,024
Are you sure there's a road here?

593
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:30,594
Thank god.

594
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:54,984
Hey, it's amazing up here.

595
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,755
How did you ever find this place?

596
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,491
Someone I know used to take me here.

597
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,027
Not a boyfriend.

598
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,129
My father used to take me here

599
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:10,166
to show me how beautiful
the world could be

600
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,636
if you could step away
and see it at a distance.

601
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,527
- I haven't been here in a long time.
- No, no, no.

602
00:46:19,562 --> 00:46:22,313
Not on the car. I mean,
I値l get you a blanket.

603
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,385
- You sure come prepared.
- Like a boy scout.

604
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,552
- Les?
- Yes?

605
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,889
I'm sorry I dragged you into all this.

606
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,293
- I don't usually act like this.
- No, it's okay.

607
00:46:36,328 --> 00:46:37,828
I don't mind.

608
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,533
Here you go.

609
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,640
- I'm really glad I called you tonight.
- Yeah?

610
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:53,010
I'm... I知
really glad too.

611
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,348
All we're missing now is
some soft romantic music.

612
00:46:57,383 --> 00:46:59,483
Hold on.

613
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,833
Oh man.

614
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,408
Oh great. Grandpa's top 10!

615
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,362
Wait... aren't you
drinking rather heavily?

616
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:46,762
## Strangers in the night ##

617
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,600
- ## exchanging glances... ##
- do you want to dance?

618
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:51,836
- ## Wandering in the night... ##
- to this?

619
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:53,769
- Uh, yeah. Where?
- Right up here.

620
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,574
You couldn't pray for
a more romantic setting.

621
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,278
Yeah, I guess so.

622
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,686
## Something in your eyes ##

623
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:11,053
## was so inviting ##

624
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,591
## something in your smile ##

625
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:16,327
## was so exciting... ##

626
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,765
- maybe I should take my shoes off.
- Yeah.

627
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,600
Good idea.

628
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,174
## Strangers in the night ##

629
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:32,174
## two lonely people ##

630
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,446
## we were strangers in the night ##

631
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:37,413
## up to the moment ##

632
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,251
## when we said our first hello ##

633
00:48:40,286 --> 00:48:43,052
## little did we know ##

634
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,006
## love was just a glance away ##

635
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:48,926
## a warm, embracing dance away... ##

636
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,595
Get up! Get off! Get off the car!

637
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,067
- What's the matter, Les?
- The hood, it's caving in. Get off quick!

638
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:57,767
Little Les, I love this song.

639
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,705
Then you definitely had too
much to drink. Come on, get off.

640
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,609
Oh wow! Stay here.

641
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,686
Come on, get in.

642
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:17,420
- Oh!
- Shh.

643
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,558
We've got to get this
thing fixed. Slide over.

644
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,463
Mercedes, please.

645
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,068
You have such baby-soft skin.

646
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,374
## Ever since that night ##

647
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:39,577
## we've been together... ##

648
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,687
Don't worry about the noise,
man. My parents are vampires.

649
00:49:49,722 --> 00:49:52,841
And I値l tell you
something. You have balls.

650
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:55,960
You definitely have balls
for snagging this car.

651
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:57,827
I'm impressed.

652
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,314
All right, Les. Let's see the license.

653
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:02,767
No way. Forget it, guys. It's ugly.

654
00:50:02,802 --> 00:50:05,334
Of course it is. Big deal.

655
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,336
- Come on, Les.
- No way!

656
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,271
- Let me take a picture of it.
- Forget it.

657
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,575
Don't you think he should
let me take a picture of it?

658
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,844
- Okay. CharLes, okay.
- All right.

659
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:16,313
- Say "cheese"!
- Cheese.

660
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,483
Great.

661
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,989
Well, take a look,
Les. What do you think?

662
00:50:25,024 --> 00:50:27,258
- Excellent work, dean.
- Thanks.

663
00:50:27,293 --> 00:50:29,225
This is spectacular!

664
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,062
You saved me, man. Thanks.

665
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:37,001
So, I guess we can go to archies now?

666
00:50:37,036 --> 00:50:39,187
Look, Deano, pal, I promise you,

667
00:50:39,222 --> 00:50:41,303
next weekend, yeah, fine, okay.

668
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,072
We can go to archies. But not tonight.

669
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,543
Mercedes doesn't have to
be home for a couple hours.

670
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:48,044
Les, let me explain something to you.

671
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,381
UnLess you're into some
intense kinky shit...

672
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:52,617
and you never know after tonight,

673
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:54,819
this Mercedes has a dead battery.

674
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,558
Les, we're talking about
archies atomic here.

675
00:51:00,593 --> 00:51:02,460
You can't get there without a license.

676
00:51:02,495 --> 00:51:04,162
It's in the middle of nowhere.

677
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:05,795
No busses, no trains, no planes.

678
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,265
Only the slickest, most
intense driving machines

679
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,366
you've ever seen in your life.

680
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,721
I have the directions my brother
gave me in my back pocket.

681
00:51:13,756 --> 00:51:17,041
You won't regret this. There's
five girls for every guy.

682
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:19,510
And we're not talking
dogs, we're talking bunnies.

683
00:51:19,545 --> 00:51:21,410
Dean, did you wipe your feet off?

684
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,380
Yes, I wiped the concrete off my feet.

685
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:25,800
Hey, CharLes, push in the lighter.

686
00:51:25,835 --> 00:51:28,194
I got a surprise for everybody.

687
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:30,519
No way. Not in here. Huh-uh.

688
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,890
What's the matter with
you, Les? This is a car,

689
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:34,523
it's not an oxygen tent.

690
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,326
Dean, if there's any evidence
at all that I took this car

691
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,731
my dad's gonna slaughter me first
and ask questions later, okay?

692
00:51:40,766 --> 00:51:43,634
Stop it!

693
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:57,480
Hey, Les, this is great and all,

694
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:59,550
but could take the car out of neutral?

695
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:01,585
We just got passed by a street-sweeper.

696
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,363
Hey, girls, whose
car you driving, grandma's?

697
00:52:12,398 --> 00:52:14,497
Come on, race him.

698
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,233
Let's mess with the faggots, man.

699
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,671
Wait,
get that...

700
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,752
Go!

701
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:40,558
Les, what's the matter with you?

702
00:52:40,593 --> 00:52:42,558
Are you 16 or 60?

703
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,563
You could have given those
gear heads a run for their money.

704
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:47,296
Dean this is my grandfather's car.

705
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,934
Give me a car that I知
not genetically related to,

706
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:51,702
I promise things will change, okay?

707
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:55,404
- Honey.
- Okay, okay, okay!

708
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,641
Okay, I知 counting. Do your breathing.

709
00:52:57,676 --> 00:53:00,076
okay.

710
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,745
Is it hot in here?

711
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,547
Is it hot or is it just me?

712
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:08,818
- It's hot?
- It's like a sauna in here.

713
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:12,156
Want me to go down to the garage
and turn on the air conditioning?

714
00:53:12,191 --> 00:53:15,860
No, that's okay. I like
to just sit here and sweat.

715
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:17,795
I'll turn on the air conditioning.

716
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:51,328
Hey, Robert?

717
00:53:51,363 --> 00:53:52,997
Robert?!

718
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:58,069
- Yes?
- I'm not hot anymore. I'm hungry.

719
00:53:58,104 --> 00:54:00,903
Will you make me a sandwich, please?

720
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,974
- Okay, honey.
- Sardines and pickLes, okay?

721
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,486
## Saturday night is
the loneliest night ##

722
00:54:15,521 --> 00:54:17,987
## of the week ##

723
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:21,926
## 'cause that's the night
that my sweetie and I ##

724
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,480
## used to dance cheek to cheek ##

725
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:28,964
## I don't mind Sunday night at all ##

726
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:33,237
## 'cause that's the night
friends come to call ##

727
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:36,707
## and Monday through Friday痴 a gas ##

728
00:54:36,742 --> 00:54:40,378
## and another week goes past ##

729
00:54:40,413 --> 00:54:42,345
## but Saturday night ##

730
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,050
## is the loneliest night of the week ##

731
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:48,317
## I sing the song ##

732
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,586
## that I sang for the memories... ##

733
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,857
- you asshole, do up her shirt.
- No way.

734
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:55,024
Forget about it. I mean, look at us.

735
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,495
We're three wild animals
bombing down the highway

736
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:59,514
with the cruise control set to 55 m. p.h.

737
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:01,499
I don't need a ticket
on my first night out.

738
00:55:01,534 --> 00:55:03,699
God damn it, stop that!

739
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,936
What is this crap we're listening to?

740
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:08,139
My parents don't even listen to this!

741
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:12,808
- Give me that camera!
- No!

742
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,612
God damn it, dean, it's not your camera.

743
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:18,382
- Give me the camera. Give me it!
- No! No!

744
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,535
- Give me it!
- No!

745
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,653
- Jesus!
- Watch out!

746
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,628
Oh, we're gonna die!

747
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,933
- I told you this was gonna happen.
- Shit!

748
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:50,214
- Les, stop the car! 
- Uh-oh.

749
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,473
I think I知 gonna throw up.

750
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,678
- Get her out of the car, quick!
- Help! Help!

751
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:22,979
Help! Get her off of me!

752
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:24,982
- Not in the car, please!
- I'm trapped!

753
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:32,989
Les, I apologize for everything,

754
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:35,693
but that ride was definitely
worth the price of admission.

755
00:56:35,728 --> 00:56:37,995
That makes up for a
whole life of boredom.

756
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:39,663
There's a scratch on my car.

757
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:42,999
Where?

758
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:45,901
Right there. Right here,
there's a big old scratch.

759
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:48,739
- Hold on, let me see.
- My dad'll murder me. Look at this!

760
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:51,307
- There is no scratch.
- There is a scratch here.

761
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:54,412
A tiny little scratch. Your dad
is not going to see that scratch.

762
00:56:54,447 --> 00:56:56,747
Your dad's a 40-year-old
guy who wears glasses.

763
00:56:56,782 --> 00:56:59,515
Not an eagle, okay? Now listen to me.

764
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,553
We are two seconds away from
archies. Do you understand?

765
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:05,656
You listen to me. Two
seconds or not two seconds.

766
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:07,957
Watch my lips. We're
not going to archies.

767
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,795
We're not driving in my
grandfather's Cadillac anymore.

768
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,995
We are in fact going home, okay?

769
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,417
- No, it's not okay!
- You don't look too good.

770
00:57:16,452 --> 00:57:19,804
We cannot turn around now.

771
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,472
We'd better get you a soda.

772
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,474
You have worked really hard

773
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:28,412
for that license in your wallet.

774
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:31,315
You've had 16 years of humiliation,

775
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,282
begging for lifts from people

776
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,353
who couldn't give a
shit about your image.

777
00:57:35,388 --> 00:57:37,987
Les, you've had to stand and watch

778
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:41,258
as all the pretty girls drove
off in some older jerk's car.

779
00:57:41,293 --> 00:57:43,527
Humiliation... I know,
I致e been through it!

780
00:57:43,562 --> 00:57:45,294
But that's all over now.

781
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,198
Les, that thing in your wallet,

782
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:51,068
that's no ordinary piece of paper.

783
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,868
That is a driver's license!

784
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,172
It is not only a driver's license,

785
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:57,106
it's an automobile license!

786
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,110
And it's not only an automobile license,

787
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:00,977
it is a license to live,

788
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:05,282
a license to be free,
to go wherever, whenever,

789
00:58:05,317 --> 00:58:07,618
and with whomever you choose.

790
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,982
Archies, man. Let's do it.

791
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:24,535
- Deano, I don't know.
- Les,

792
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,602
to live in fear

793
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,173
is not to live at all.

794
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,013
What about Mercedes?

795
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:39,917
I don't think this is such a good idea.

796
00:58:39,952 --> 00:58:41,550
Of course it's a good idea.

797
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,021
In half an hour, there's
gonna be babes all over us.

798
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:46,123
She'll kill it for us.

799
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:53,462
Wow, did you ever
imagine in all your life

800
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:57,301
that you would see a Mercedes fit
inside the trunk of a Cadillac?

801
00:58:57,336 --> 00:58:59,236
Look, I feel bad about this.

802
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:01,570
Feel bad? For her?

803
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,875
This trunk is bigger than
the size of my bedroom.

804
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,644
Let's go.

805
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:11,882
Nighty-night.

806
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,890
## Chills over me ##

807
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:23,327
## different from the rest ##

808
00:59:23,362 --> 00:59:25,730
## I won't settle for Less ##

809
00:59:25,765 --> 00:59:27,598
## hello ##

810
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:32,837
- ## won't take no ##
- ## won't take no ##

811
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:35,304
## oh, baby ##

812
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,976
## from now on, you and I ##

813
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,445
## stood the test of time ##

814
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,050
## still you're on my mind always ##

815
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:51,355
- ## night and day ##
- ## night and day ##

816
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,924
- ## oh baby... ##
- whoa!

817
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:56,627
Honey! I love you!

818
00:59:56,662 --> 00:59:58,813
Hey, eyes forward.

819
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,965
Look at her!

820
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,868
Hey, come back here.

821
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,172
## You know you are my life, girl ##

822
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:10,106
## crucial ##

823
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:12,693
## baby, you're the one ##

824
01:00:12,728 --> 01:00:15,246
## crucial lovin'... ##

825
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,812
hi!

826
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,350
- ## Baby ##
- ## crucial... ##

827
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:21,884
hey, hey, hey. Hey guys.

828
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,722
Wait up for a second. Why don't
you guys go get some dinner?

829
01:00:24,757 --> 01:00:27,992
I'm gonna get dessert.
All right? Go, go.

830
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,993
Hi!

831
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:34,098
## Love is on the rise ##

832
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:37,352
## don't want to be alone ##

833
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:40,571
## I need to find someone ##

834
01:00:40,606 --> 01:00:43,191
## I can call my own ##

835
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:45,776
## not just anyone ##

836
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,844
## oh no... ##

837
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,816
- here you go.
- Thank you.

838
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,302
Guys, it's all set up.

839
01:00:55,337 --> 01:00:57,586
I took care of everything.

840
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:00,191
They'll be here in a few
minutes... one for each of us.

841
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:02,425
Dean, I will never doubt you again.

842
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,962
- I know you won't!
- My dreams never get this good.

843
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:07,248
My fantasies never get this good!

844
01:01:07,283 --> 01:01:09,500
And this is only the beginning!

845
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:10,933
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

846
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,603
Les: Yeah, let's eat!

847
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,547
Sorry.

848
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,651
- Quick, roll up the windows!
- Those asshoLes again.

849
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,954
CharLes, you spasticated idiot!

850
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:35,726
It was an accident!
Roll up the windows!

851
01:01:35,761 --> 01:01:37,994
Hey, my hamburger!

852
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:40,229
Give me my hamburger. Ow! Ow!

853
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:43,034
- Roll the window down.
- No, keep it up!

854
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:45,170
- Roll it down!
- No, keep it up!

855
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,271
Hey, come here!

856
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,275
- Hi!
- God damn it!

857
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,313
- You can't leave now. What about the girls?
- They're maniacs.

858
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,369
Archies, come back!

859
01:02:18,404 --> 01:02:23,040
Come back!

860
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:28,411
I'm standing outside the 
gates of allied technologies

861
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:31,866
where a group of peaceful protesters
are gathered to demonstrate against

862
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:35,286
the late-night transportation of
military hardware through our streets.

863
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:38,589
Now, Jim, as you can see, there's
a wide range of people here

864
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:40,723
- all singing and chanting...
- I don't know.

865
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,227
I don't think this is such
a good idea. Can we go home?

866
01:02:43,262 --> 01:02:45,980
Look, dean, we're going
home. And if you don't like it

867
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,699
you can jump out right here...
wherever the hell we are.

868
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,873
Hey, that looks like my mom's Audi.

869
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,570
Holy shit! I think we're being invaded!

870
01:03:09,605 --> 01:03:13,057
Here they come!

871
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,229
Come on!

872
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:24,535
Hey! No, no, not on my
car! What are you doing?

873
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:28,437
My car! My car!

874
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,072
Hey, I know that guy!

875
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,826
He looks like my sister's boyfriend!

876
01:03:32,861 --> 01:03:35,511
- Les?
- Shit, my sister! Duck!

877
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:38,115
- What are you doing?!
- Natalie, don't tell dad.

878
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,685
- I beg you!
- You don't even have a license!

879
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,284
Natalie, don't tell dad!

880
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,571
All right, let's
round these people up.

881
01:03:44,606 --> 01:03:46,824
Cuff them and put them in the wagon.

882
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:48,926
Excuse me!

883
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:51,527
Shit.

884
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:53,663
As you can see behind me,

885
01:03:53,698 --> 01:03:55,431
what started as a peaceful protest

886
01:03:55,466 --> 01:03:58,469
has now mushroomed into a
substantial demonstration.

887
01:03:58,504 --> 01:04:00,803
It seems that tempers
flared when executives

888
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,607
from allied technologies
refused to speak to rep...

889
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:09,578
- Oh my god!
- What was going on back there?

890
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,950
I don't know, but I値l tell you,
this caddy sure can take a beating.

891
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:15,353
Not half the beating you'll get

892
01:04:15,388 --> 01:04:17,188
unLess you clam up, dean!

893
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:25,895
Oh this is great. This is real classic.

894
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,366
CharLes: They must be
checking for drunk drivers.

895
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,635
- Yeah, no shit!
- Don't sweat it.

896
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,835
Think of your license as a credit card.

897
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,222
Sooner or later, you've
got to break it in.

898
01:04:35,257 --> 01:04:37,500
Pull over on the curb, right over there.

899
01:04:37,535 --> 01:04:39,709
And what are you worried about?

900
01:04:39,744 --> 01:04:43,114
We're sober. They're here to
catch drunks, like that dick.

901
01:04:43,149 --> 01:04:45,549
Have you had anything
to drink tonight, sir?

902
01:04:45,584 --> 01:04:48,150
Take it easy.

903
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:49,787
License and registration.

904
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:56,494
License and registration, son.

905
01:04:57,862 --> 01:04:59,895
Um, sir,

906
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,832
I forgot my license at home.

907
01:05:01,867 --> 01:05:03,799
But um,

908
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:06,704
I could give you this.

909
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:15,446
All right, sit tight.

910
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:19,181
Why didn't you show him your license?

911
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:22,253
What was that thing you flashed
in front of us at the house?

912
01:05:22,288 --> 01:05:23,919
My school I.D.

913
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,855
Are you telling us
that you left the house

914
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:29,794
on your first night out with
a license without a license?

915
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:32,797
No, dean, I知 not telling you that.

916
01:05:32,832 --> 01:05:34,964
Look, guys,

917
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:37,101
I failed my exam.

918
01:05:37,136 --> 01:05:39,168
Both: You what?!

919
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:42,973
- Proper grammar is... - this
punk doesn't even have a license.

920
01:05:43,008 --> 01:05:45,241
All right, sir, what I壇 like you to do

921
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,912
is to try to walk this
line here, all right?

922
01:05:47,947 --> 01:05:49,645
- All right.
- Pesky, come here.

923
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,132
You just keep walking.
I'll be right back.

924
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:54,585
We have to call a wagon
to pick this guy up.

925
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,552
This is going to go in our records.

926
01:05:56,587 --> 01:05:59,824
We're gonna be locked up in a cell
with men who've murdered and raped

927
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:01,557
and robbed convenience stores!

928
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:04,829
Will you take a pill or
something? Will you just relax?

929
01:06:04,864 --> 01:06:08,499
Nothing's going to happen
to us. We're juveniLes.

930
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,501
Nice call, dean.

931
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:15,206
All right, Anderson, let's
have a look inside the trunk.

932
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,311
Come on. I ain't got all night.

933
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:22,980
Come on! Come on!

934
01:06:28,686 --> 01:06:31,188
Hi, how you doing?

935
01:06:31,223 --> 01:06:33,691
What the hell is this?

936
01:06:33,726 --> 01:06:36,027
My date?

937
01:06:39,964 --> 01:06:43,134
We got to roll! There's a
riot going on at allied tech!

938
01:06:44,235 --> 01:06:46,270
You just got lucky, pal.

939
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:51,442
Let's go.

940
01:06:53,778 --> 01:06:56,597
- Drunk: Excuse me, officer... 
- yes! Perfect!

941
01:06:56,632 --> 01:06:59,417
See, Les, what did I
tell you? Piece of cake!

942
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:01,550
Shut up, huh? Help me with her.

943
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:03,821
Do something useful in life, would you?

944
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,058
It looks like a line. Oh yeah.

945
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:12,295
Oh, Maserati.

946
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,966
Oh, this is much nicer than mine.

947
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:17,668
Keys?!

948
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:21,470
This chick is no paperweight.

949
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,075
- So where's our next stop?
- There are no stops, dean.

950
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,310
We're going home.

951
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,518
Oh, I知 dead.

952
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:38,289
I'm so dead they're gonna
have to bury me twice.

953
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:41,257
Let's go.

954
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,110
## Back on top in June... ##

955
01:07:43,145 --> 01:07:44,929
looks like I知 in for the night.

956
01:07:44,964 --> 01:07:46,762
## I said that's life... ##

957
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:50,234
- you can't take this car!
- He took our car. We'll take his!

958
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:58,743
- ## But I don't let it get me down... ##
- what a waste.

959
01:07:58,778 --> 01:08:00,778
Now I知 swinging!

960
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,113
Go! Go!

961
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:07,418
## I've been a puppet,
a pauper, a pirate ##

962
01:08:07,453 --> 01:08:11,220
## a poet, a pawn and a king ##

963
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,625
## I致e been up and down
and over and out... ##

964
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:17,460
where the hell am I?

965
01:08:17,495 --> 01:08:19,096
- He's going left!
- I see him!

966
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,968
All: Whoa!

967
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:33,110
- Where the hell's this guy going?
- ## That's life... ##

968
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:34,679
yeah, go, Sammy!

969
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,684
Oh! Oh!

970
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:43,786
- Shit!
- Don't worry about it.

971
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:45,723
I can fix that. It's
only the right side.

972
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:49,358
## Each time I find myself ##

973
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:52,346
## laying flat on my back... ##

974
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:55,325
## I just pick myself up ##

975
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,269
## and get back in the race ##

976
01:08:58,304 --> 01:08:59,670
## that's life! ##

977
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:08,911
my life's no bed of
roses, that's for sure.

978
01:09:08,946 --> 01:09:11,947
People are the problem.
People pushing me around!

979
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:15,184
I don't care what you say to the
guy, just get him to pull over!

980
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:18,856
The man is a drunk lunatic. Don't
you think this is a little dangerous?

981
01:09:18,891 --> 01:09:21,993
You're telling me about dangerous?
Want to know what's dangerous?

982
01:09:22,028 --> 01:09:24,226
Me going home and having
to explain to my father

983
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,031
that this piece of shit is
my grandfather's Cadillac.

984
01:09:27,066 --> 01:09:30,301
Here he is, and you better talk to him.

985
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:34,105
- Be tough!
- Excuse me, sir?

986
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,706
Sir, pardon me. Excuse me?

987
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:39,108
I believe there's been
a slight mix-up here.

988
01:09:39,143 --> 01:09:42,780
It seems you've mistakenly
driven off with our car.

989
01:09:42,815 --> 01:09:46,382
Thank you. Thank you very
much. You're very kind.

990
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:50,388
- What the hell?  - come on,
get the juice- head to pull over!

991
01:09:50,423 --> 01:09:52,523
Sir?

992
01:09:57,895 --> 01:10:01,032
Les, he just vomited in your car.

993
01:10:07,138 --> 01:10:09,106
Oh shit!

994
01:10:15,646 --> 01:10:17,381
Whoo! What airline is this?!

995
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,615
Come on, go! Yeah!

996
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,450
- Come on!
- Shut up, Deano!

997
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:24,488
Hey, check it out. Spongehead's
actually driving straight.

998
01:10:24,523 --> 01:10:26,190
What he do, sober up?

999
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:32,561
Holy shit!

1000
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,899
- He's out cold.
- Oh shit!

1001
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:41,305
CharLes, you take the gas. Deano, you
take the wheel. I'm going out there.

1002
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,274
Wait a minute! No, Les, it's just a car!

1003
01:10:43,309 --> 01:10:46,208
You try telling that to my father!

1004
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:49,413
- Be careful, Les!
- Hold it steady!

1005
01:10:49,448 --> 01:10:52,717
- Dean, hold the car steady!
- Come on.

1006
01:10:52,752 --> 01:10:55,686
Keep it straight, would you?

1007
01:10:58,089 --> 01:10:59,940
Shit.

1008
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:01,757
Stop it.

1009
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:04,295
- You're losing control.
- Les!

1010
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,496
Whoa!

1011
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:09,466
I'm gonna fall! Deano!

1012
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:11,402
- Get away!
- Holy shit!

1013
01:11:11,437 --> 01:11:13,388
Shit! Whoa!

1014
01:11:13,423 --> 01:11:15,339
Deano! Whoa!

1015
01:11:15,374 --> 01:11:17,340
Mister!

1016
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:20,010
Wake up, would you!? Come on.

1017
01:11:20,045 --> 01:11:22,611
Wake up! Please, wake up!

1018
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:25,449
Will you get your
hand off the goddamn...

1019
01:11:25,484 --> 01:11:26,617
shit.

1020
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:30,788
Whoa! Deano, help!

1021
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:33,824
Dean: We're losing him!

1022
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:35,593
Hi, Les!

1023
01:11:44,035 --> 01:11:45,936
God, I hate drunk drivers.

1024
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:53,275
What?! Oh no!

1025
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,079
Watch the road, come on!

1026
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,717
Oh shit!

1027
01:12:01,652 --> 01:12:04,021
No, no!

1028
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:09,987
- Get out of the car!
- You're stepping on my face!

1029
01:13:10,022 --> 01:13:12,056
Oh, you're alive! We
thought you were dead.

1030
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:14,859
Oh my god, did you see what you did?

1031
01:13:14,894 --> 01:13:16,792
Honey, I知 home!

1032
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:18,963
- Who is this guy?
- I don't know.

1033
01:13:18,998 --> 01:13:21,263
Who are you?!

1034
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:24,135
Well, my friend, you're a
little thief. Give me those keys.

1035
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:26,904
Yes, but see, "friends don't
let friends drive drunk. "

1036
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:29,707
You call yourself a friend?

1037
01:13:29,742 --> 01:13:32,441
Look, you were incredible!

1038
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:36,047
You are an animal. I mean,
nobody's going to believe this!

1039
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:39,450
Yeah, not too bad for a kid
without his license, huh?

1040
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:02,206
Les, I gotta tell you,
license or no license,

1041
01:14:02,241 --> 01:14:04,676
that was one intense display of driving.

1042
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:07,045
Yeah, and as far as a first night out

1043
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,347
on the town with a car is concerned,

1044
01:14:09,382 --> 01:14:11,580
that one definitely sets the standard.

1045
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:14,785
Thank god you don't get your license
for a couple of months, buddy.

1046
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,121
What are you going to
tell sleeping beauty?

1047
01:14:17,156 --> 01:14:19,256
I don't know.

1048
01:14:20,391 --> 01:14:22,358
Shh.

1049
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:25,096
- Good night, Les.
- Yeah.

1050
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:26,731
See you later, Les.

1051
01:14:45,316 --> 01:14:47,883
- Robert?
- Mm?

1052
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:50,586
This is it.

1053
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:53,691
- That's nice, honey.
- This is it.

1054
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:56,092
I'm up! I'm up, I知 up!

1055
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:59,261
Okay, do your breathing.

1056
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:01,765
How far apart are the contractions?

1057
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,036
Five minutes? Fine, plenty of time.

1058
01:15:05,071 --> 01:15:08,237
That dream was so bizarre, Les,

1059
01:15:08,272 --> 01:15:10,608
as if I was trapped
in the trunk of a car.

1060
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:13,745
And suddenly the trunk flipped open

1061
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:16,815
and there you were rescuing me.

1062
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:19,815
- So weird.
- Sounds crazy.

1063
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,486
Oh, I know it sounds
unbelievable, but...

1064
01:15:22,521 --> 01:15:25,122
somehow you're always there to hold me

1065
01:15:25,157 --> 01:15:27,909
like you are right now.

1066
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:30,661
I felt so safe and so warm.

1067
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:34,997
I'm sorry I was such a sleepy
- head tonight.

1068
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:37,768
- You must have been so bored.
- No, don't be silly.

1069
01:15:37,803 --> 01:15:40,871
Tonight for me was
like non-stop action.

1070
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:45,574
- When can we go out again?
- Honestly, Mercedes,

1071
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,479
tonight might be the last night
anybody ever sees me alive.

1072
01:15:48,514 --> 01:15:50,481
Why? What happened?

1073
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:54,184
It's a long complicated story.

1074
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:56,287
You don't want to hear about it.

1075
01:15:56,322 --> 01:15:58,356
Does it have a happy ending?

1076
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:01,724
Uh-huh, has so far.

1077
01:16:01,759 --> 01:16:04,161
Hopefully one day I値l get
to tell you how it ends.

1078
01:16:04,196 --> 01:16:06,397
I'll be here.

1079
01:16:14,772 --> 01:16:16,273
Bye.

1080
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:23,646
- Ow!
- The baby?

1081
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:25,349
No, the laces are too tight.

1082
01:16:25,384 --> 01:16:27,585
- Okay...
- Robert!

1083
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,752
Honey?

1084
01:16:29,787 --> 01:16:32,088
Oh wait, let me get my jacket.

1085
01:16:32,123 --> 01:16:34,692
- Where's my jacket?
- Okay, okay.

1086
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:37,345
- Okay.
- Oh, I forgot the bag.

1087
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:39,673
It's okay. I'm gonna wait here.

1088
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:42,238
- Okay.
- Okay, calm down, honey.

1089
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:44,855
- You okay?
- Yeah, I知 fine.

1090
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:47,465
- Ow! Another one.
- Oh no. Okay.

1091
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,041
Okay. Yeah. Put your arm on me.

1092
01:16:53,711 --> 01:16:55,529
Oh man.

1093
01:16:55,564 --> 01:16:57,348
Here we go.

1094
01:17:10,528 --> 01:17:13,764
- Uh-oh. 
- what? What?

1095
01:17:13,799 --> 01:17:16,966
- What?
- Gosh, I知 fine.

1096
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:20,020
- Sorry, I知 fine now.
- What do you mean, you're fine?

1097
01:17:20,055 --> 01:17:23,040
I think it was air bubbLes
from the pickle or something.

1098
01:17:23,075 --> 01:17:26,644
Are you sure? I mean,
the car's right here.

1099
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:28,679
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

1100
01:17:31,282 --> 01:17:33,684
Why is the garage door open?

1101
01:17:33,719 --> 01:17:35,970
Natalie probably left it open.

1102
01:17:36,005 --> 01:17:38,187
No, honey, Natalie took the Audi.

1103
01:17:38,222 --> 01:17:40,992
- Where the hell is the Audi?
- Ow.

1104
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:45,728
Robert!

1105
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:48,432
- What the...
- Robert!

1106
01:17:49,633 --> 01:17:51,402
Honey, keep breathing!

1107
01:17:51,437 --> 01:17:54,105
Whoa! Whoa!

1108
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:27,772
Something wrong with your bed, Les?

1109
01:18:29,807 --> 01:18:33,544
Mind explaining what size
shark was responsible for this?

1110
01:18:35,346 --> 01:18:37,546
- Well... 
- no, I don't want to know!

1111
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:39,548
I don't want to know.
Save it for the judge.

1112
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:42,853
Do you have any idea what
you've done tonight, Les?

1113
01:18:42,888 --> 01:18:44,856
What this means to your future

1114
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:46,789
in this house and on this planet?

1115
01:18:46,824 --> 01:18:49,727
- I have an idea.
- No, you can't possibly!

1116
01:18:49,762 --> 01:18:51,696
You can't even begin to imagine!

1117
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:55,933
We had a college fund set aside for you.

1118
01:18:55,968 --> 01:18:57,900
That's gone now.

1119
01:18:57,935 --> 01:18:59,602
You had free room and board,

1120
01:18:59,637 --> 01:19:02,673
two trusting parents and a social life.

1121
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,640
It's all gone.

1122
01:19:04,675 --> 01:19:08,479
You had a TV, a stereo, a baseball mitt,

1123
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:10,448
a tennis racket, a skateboard,

1124
01:19:10,483 --> 01:19:13,149
a bicycle...
all gone!

1125
01:19:13,184 --> 01:19:16,320
You even had sunlight
and a window in your room.

1126
01:19:16,355 --> 01:19:17,653
Robert!

1127
01:19:17,688 --> 01:19:20,256
Let me tell you something, buddy boy,

1128
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:23,527
you are damn lucky your mother
didn't go into labour tonight.

1129
01:19:23,562 --> 01:19:26,314
Robby, I am in labour!

1130
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:28,675
Damn lucky! What?!

1131
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,967
Honey, you okay?

1132
01:19:31,002 --> 01:19:33,804
- How far apart are the contractions?
- I don't know.

1133
01:19:33,839 --> 01:19:36,040
You don't know? Is it
one minute, two minutes?

1134
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:38,075
- How close?
- Too close.

1135
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,542
No handle!

1136
01:19:39,577 --> 01:19:42,445
No handle. No handle.

1137
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,249
Okay, honey, we'll be in
a hospital in a minute.

1138
01:19:45,284 --> 01:19:47,450
- Sit down. Watch your head.
- Oh Robert.

1139
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:50,087
- Come in the backseat with me.
- No, I can't.

1140
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:52,223
- I have to drive.
- Les can drive.

1141
01:19:52,258 --> 01:19:54,924
What? Les who? Not that Les.

1142
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:58,095
No, he stays here. Rudy, you drive.

1143
01:19:58,130 --> 01:20:01,232
- Rudy, get in the car!
- Dad?

1144
01:20:01,267 --> 01:20:03,067
Dad, let me drive.

1145
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:07,203
I can do it, dad.

1146
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:10,741
Robert, please stay with me. I need you.

1147
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:16,078
- Dad?
- Okay, you drive.

1148
01:20:16,113 --> 01:20:18,349
But try and do it like
you have a license!

1149
01:20:18,384 --> 01:20:20,785
Let me open the door!

1150
01:20:24,155 --> 01:20:27,391
Ew! It smells like puke in here!

1151
01:20:27,426 --> 01:20:30,628
Shut up, Rudy.

1152
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:36,400
- What are you doing?!
- Sorry, it's a red light.

1153
01:20:36,435 --> 01:20:38,601
Are you crazy? There isn't car in sight.

1154
01:20:38,636 --> 01:20:41,706
We're rushing your mother to the
hospital, not to a bridge game!

1155
01:20:41,741 --> 01:20:43,474
Come on, go through it. Go through it.

1156
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:47,677
What are you doing? Come on!

1157
01:20:47,712 --> 01:20:49,478
I'm pushing the gas. It ain't moving.

1158
01:20:49,513 --> 01:20:51,816
Sounds like the transmission.
Try another gear.

1159
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:55,151
- Come on, try low.
- Mom?

1160
01:20:55,186 --> 01:20:57,855
Don't worry, I知 just having a baby.

1161
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:02,293
- What was that?
- Reverse works, dad.

1162
01:21:04,862 --> 01:21:06,495
Honey?

1163
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,864
Let him drive backwards.

1164
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:11,235
Let him drive sideways, I don't care.

1165
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:13,604
Just get me there!

1166
01:21:15,306 --> 01:21:17,239
All right.

1167
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:19,610
- But be careful.
- I will.

1168
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:31,822
- The baby?
- No, the golf clubs.

1169
01:21:31,857 --> 01:21:33,791
Oh, okay.

1170
01:21:41,866 --> 01:21:44,669
Go right! No, left!

1171
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,537
No, go right! No!

1172
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:50,825
What are you doing?
Get off the sidewalk!

1173
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:53,311
Okay, that's it. I'm driving. Pull over.

1174
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:57,515
- Look out!
- Hold it!

1175
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:09,493
What are you doing? Les,
you're going the wrong way!

1176
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:16,600
Look out! Where'd you
people learn to drive?

1177
01:22:16,635 --> 01:22:19,003
Okay, we're good.

1178
01:22:36,053 --> 01:22:37,755
Huh?

1179
01:22:40,858 --> 01:22:43,027
Ha ha!

1180
01:22:43,062 --> 01:22:45,196
Ow! God!

1181
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:49,333
Anderson! Goddamn car!

1182
01:22:57,475 --> 01:22:59,377
- How are you, honey?
- I'm wet.

1183
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:06,183
Slow it down here, buddy! Hey, stop!

1184
01:23:06,218 --> 01:23:08,019
Stop! Stop!

1185
01:23:08,054 --> 01:23:10,187
Stop!

1186
01:23:12,957 --> 01:23:15,693
- This is it, okay.
- Woman in labour!

1187
01:23:15,728 --> 01:23:17,793
Come on, honey, we're here.

1188
01:23:17,828 --> 01:23:20,197
Woman in labour! Woman in labour!

1189
01:23:20,232 --> 01:23:22,533
Come on, honey. Okay, okay.

1190
01:23:22,568 --> 01:23:24,835
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

1191
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:27,071
- Robert...
- come on!

1192
01:23:27,106 --> 01:23:29,538
- Mom?
- Ow!

1193
01:23:29,573 --> 01:23:32,677
Be careful, she's in
labour. Rudy, go with mom.

1194
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:34,543
I'll be right there, honey.

1195
01:23:34,578 --> 01:23:37,682
Come here. I want to talk to you.

1196
01:23:37,717 --> 01:23:40,284
Come here. Come here.

1197
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:42,285
Come here.

1198
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,555
Where did you learn to drive like that?

1199
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:48,509
- I... I guess last night, dad. 
- Yeah?

1200
01:23:48,544 --> 01:23:51,028
Must have been one
hell of a crash course.

1201
01:23:53,798 --> 01:23:55,933
Look, don't worry about grandpa.

1202
01:23:55,968 --> 01:23:57,733
The damage isn't that bad.

1203
01:23:57,768 --> 01:24:00,037
We'll get the car fixed,
maybe he won't notice.

1204
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:02,173
It's slipping!
Look out, the beam!

1205
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,909
- Stand clear!
- Shit!

1206
01:24:05,944 --> 01:24:08,579
I'm losing it. Look out!

1207
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:24,495
Hello?

1208
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:26,630
Hello?

1209
01:24:28,966 --> 01:24:32,401
- Anybody home?
- It's grandpa.

1210
01:24:32,436 --> 01:24:34,737
What are you gonna tell him, dad?

1211
01:24:34,772 --> 01:24:37,975
The truth could kill him. But I
guess he's getting king of old.

1212
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,644
What's everybody sweating about?

1213
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:41,410
He's been away a long time.

1214
01:24:41,445 --> 01:24:44,081
- He'll want to come in, relax.
- Damn it, open up!

1215
01:24:44,116 --> 01:24:45,950
He hasn't seen the twins yet.

1216
01:24:45,985 --> 01:24:47,650
I know my father.

1217
01:24:47,685 --> 01:24:50,488
The last thing he's going to
be worried about is his car.

1218
01:24:51,789 --> 01:24:54,091
- Hi, dad.
- Where's my caddy?

1219
01:24:55,426 --> 01:24:58,362
Les did it! It
was Les. I didn't...

1220
01:25:08,306 --> 01:25:10,157
what in the hell is that?

1221
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:12,009
- Uh...
- hey, um...

1222
01:25:12,044 --> 01:25:13,643
son of a bitch!

1223
01:25:13,678 --> 01:25:16,213
What in the hell is that?!

1224
01:25:16,248 --> 01:25:18,749
It's your car, grandpa.

1225
01:25:29,393 --> 01:25:31,794
- Dad?
- What is it? Grandpa?

1226
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:34,196
What's the matter?

1227
01:25:34,231 --> 01:25:37,800
Dad, what is it? Why are you laughing?

1228
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:40,972
Here, I had a little
trouble with your car too.

1229
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:46,709
My BMW?

1230
01:25:46,744 --> 01:25:49,780
- Son of a bitch!
- Yo!

1231
01:25:51,515 --> 01:25:53,816
Les, you know how you said

1232
01:25:53,851 --> 01:25:55,953
when you got your
license you wanted a BMW?

1233
01:25:55,988 --> 01:25:58,056
Well, here you go. It's all yours.

1234
01:25:58,091 --> 01:26:00,089
Take good care of it.

1235
01:26:00,124 --> 01:26:02,393
Thanks, dad, that's
very generous of you.

1236
01:26:02,428 --> 01:26:04,562
But I don't need the BMW anymore.

1237
01:26:04,597 --> 01:26:08,030
Les!

1238
01:26:08,065 --> 01:26:10,368
I already have a Mercedes.

1239
01:26:12,103 --> 01:26:14,138
Don't wait up, guys!

1240
01:26:15,673 --> 01:26:18,009
## Get outta my dreams ##

1241
