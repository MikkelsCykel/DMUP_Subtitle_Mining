1
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:07,093
...from Uptown, Downtown,

2
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,229
in town, out of town.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,433
We got it going on, 1-4-5,

4
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,068
it's famous, baby,
here we go.

5
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:14,304
It's the world-famous
Brucie B.

6
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:15,777
on the speciaI mix tip

7
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:19,043
for all my playa niggas,
all my niggas gettin' paper.

8
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:21,482
Ladies lookin' good,
fellas, y'all lookin' good.

9
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:25,181
We gettin' money Uptown style,
a'ight?

10
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:29,352
...to my niggas from 1-5-5,
1-1-2, 1-4-9,

11
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:31,156
49 is in the house.

12
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:34,728
# Thinking of a master plan #

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,199
# 'Cause ain't nothing
but sweat inside my hand #

14
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:39,668
# So I dig into my pocket,
all my money's spent #

15
00:00:39,737 --> 00:00:42,228
# So I dig deeper,
but still comin' up with lint #

16
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:44,900
# So I start my mission,
leave my residence #

17
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,910
# Thinking how could I get
some dead presidents #

18
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:47,967
# I need money #

19
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,512
# I used to be a stickup kid #

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,605
# So I think of all the devious
things I did #

21
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:54,549
# I used to roll up, this is
a holdup, ain't nothin' funny #

22
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,247
# Stop smilin', be still, don't
nothin' move but the money #

23
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:00,085
# But now I learn to earn
'cause I'm righteous #

24
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:01,920
# I feeI great,
so maybe I might just #

25
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:04,427
# Search for a 9:00 to 5:00
if I strive #

26
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,429
# Then maybe I'll stay alive #

27
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:08,089
# So I walk up the street #

28
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,564
This is the stage.

29
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,568
# Feelin' out of place 'cause,
man, do I miss #

30
00:01:11,636 --> 00:01:15,333
If you was here,
you was definitely somebody.

31
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:16,668
# And a nice,
big plate of fish #

32
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,902
# Which is my favorite dish #

33
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:21,171
# But without no money,
it's still a wish #

34
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,076
# 'Cause I don't like to dream
about gettin' paid #

35
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:26,207
# So I dig into the books
of the rhymes that I made #

36
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:29,411
# To now test to see
if I got pull #

37
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:31,978
And I was there.

38
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:35,651
Me, Mitch, and Rico.

39
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:37,216
We did our thing, you know?

40
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:40,991
We was living.
We was living that life.

41
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:44,466
So, you know, I'm up at this
birthday party the other day.

42
00:01:44,535 --> 00:01:47,504
You told me about it.
Talkin' about Charlie Rucks?

43
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:48,503
Exactly.

44
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:50,301
Yeah, I couldn't make
that shit.

45
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:52,399
So, I'm up
at that birthday...

46
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,068
I didn't bring him nothin'.

47
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:56,238
So, I see everybody up there
got stuff for him,

48
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:57,678
so I walk up
to the table...

49
00:01:57,748 --> 00:01:59,409
Ain't got no soy sauce
up there, B.?

50
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:01,474
No, they didn't put no fuckin'
soy sauce in the bag, man.

51
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:03,986
Why these Chinese niggas
always doin' this shit, man?

52
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:05,079
Fuck the soy sauce, man!

53
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,783
Mitch, can I tell a story?

54
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:08,552
I walk up to the table, right?

55
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,992
- Chinese niggas...
- Pick up the cake...

56
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:14,395
mush it in his face,
tell him, "Happy birthday. "

57
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:17,559
Niggas at the party
looking at me like I'm buggin'.

58
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:19,626
I showed that nigga
mad love, B.

59
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:21,171
We lookin' at you
like you buggin', man.

60
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:22,227
You buggin', man.

61
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,967
This nigga... thinks it's funny.

62
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,566
You took the whole cake
and mushed it in his face?

63
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:27,576
Whole cake.

64
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:30,512
What's up with this nigga here?
That's love right there, man.

65
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:31,673
Why you doin' that, B.?

66
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:34,309
Why you fuckin' a birthday
party up like that?

67
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:35,579
I know his girI was there.

68
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:38,483
Ace, make that shot again.

69
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:40,490
Five thou
you can't make it again.

70
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:43,493
I ain't gonna take your $5,000,
man. Hold onto your money.

71
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:46,086
Penny-pinchin'
nigga here, man.

72
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:48,358
You know,
he fucks me up, man.

73
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,491
You always trying to save
your dough and shit, B.

74
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:53,298
The thing is, baby, you're
fuckin' with the wrong nigga.

75
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,304
You need to be
fuckin' with me, man.

76
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,101
Give me that bet, man.

77
00:02:57,174 --> 00:02:59,267
Yeah, you got the bet,
Mr. Mitch. What, you drunk?

78
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:01,004
I'm gonna take this nigga

79
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,308
- Yeah, take me Uptown, man.

87
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,493

00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:20,325
But double up.

There go your five.

00:03:22,366 --> 00:03:24,300
Go ahead, Mr. Mitch.

Well, now this nigga feelin'

00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:57,698
Loan your man $ 10 G's, 'cause I
ain't givin' him his food back.

108
00:03:57,768 --> 00:03:59,998
- And no more soy sauce, nigga.

You're a

113
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:10,746
You're a cheap-ass
motherfucker.

114
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,180
This motherfucker

119
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,451
No, I'll go get Aunt June.

122
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,995
N- N-Now, hold up, B. I ain't

I want full blood work, coags.

143
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:42,365
Hey, you okay? Can you hear me?
Huh? Can you hear me?

144
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,669
What's your name, man?
Tell me your name.

145
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:46,869
Tell me your name?
You with me?

146
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,771
All right, now,

00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:55,609

149
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:00,715
Move him, move him.

I see you checkin' out

00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,657
What? Nah.

00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:44,190
Nah, I was just thinking

153
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,666
Yeah, so...

154
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:48,034
so, why you got the "help
wanted" sign in the window?

155
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:51,074
That sign is to make sure
you're handlin' your business.

156
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:53,268
That's whack... basically,
you're making it look like

157
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,107
we ain't taking
care of business in here.

158
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:58,907
"Hey, yo, Mr. Pip, I know you
need help up in this joint. "

159
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:00,712
- Come on, man.
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:03,810
What I need you to do
is make some deliveries.

161
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:05,684
You always got me
making deliveries.

162
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:06,916
Hello?

163
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,686
Cece, my nigga.

164
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,556
All day, every day.
How much you wanna do?

165
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:12,822
Come on, baby, you gonna
get the hair and the nails.

166
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:16,024
Yo, damn, nigga. Every time

167
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,431

168
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,230
Man, why don't you just
put your shit in a bag, man?

169
00:07:19,303 --> 00:07:21,237
Fuck a bag, man.

170
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,569
Just, uh... you worry
about the cleaning and shit,

171
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,698
you know what I mean,

172
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,868
'cause I know you making
money up in this bitch.

173
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:27,968
Can I help you?

174
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,707
Uh, nah, that's cool. My man
Ace Boogie gonna handle that.

175
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,043

176
00:07:32,116 --> 00:07:33,777
No, he on his way out
the door. I'll help you.

177
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:36,945
You can change that, right?

178
00:07:38,622 --> 00:07:41,090
That's a big-ass bill.

179
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:42,455
Hey, you know how it go down.

180
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,585
No, sorry.

181
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:48,965
A'ight, well, um...

182
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,467
why don't you keep the change?

183
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:52,763
Nah, you know what?

184
00:07:52,836 --> 00:07:53,860
Fuck that.

185
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:56,132
Give it to my man,
Ace Boogie, a'ight?

186
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:57,969
He's family, right, baby?

187
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,339
- Hmm.
- Yeah, right, man.

188
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,935
Nah, I'm just saying, I hate
to see Cakes' big brother

189
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:03,070
working in a sweatbox.

190
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:05,342
So, yo, you ever
want to get out, then...

191
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,476
Come on, Calvin.
Calvin. Don't do that.

192
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,644
He's doin' fine.

193
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,052
Yo, baby, what I told you
about runnin'...

194
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,819
Why don't you relax, Doctor?

195
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,292
How you doin', baby?

196
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,022
I'm doin' fine, Mr. Pip.

197
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,030
Yeah, she doin' fine,
thank you.

198
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,464
Hey, yo, Hop Sing, why
don't you keep workin' hard,

199
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:26,435
'cause it's gonna pay off,
you know what I mean?

200
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:28,266
I'm gonna catch you
on the rebound.

201
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:29,430
All right, let's bounce, baby.

202
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,208
His monkey-ass ain't worked
a hard day in his life.

203
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:37,577
That's why he don't know how
to act with all of that money.

204
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:42,578
Think he the king of Harlem.

205
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:46,555
I hope your sister know
with that fooI...

206
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:49,217
it's only a matter of time.

207
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:50,385
A matter of time.

208
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:57,097
Well, congratulations!

209
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:00,830
Good job, and you really put it
away there in that speed round.

210
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:03,498
And now,
last time, you got a car...

211
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,508
All right, now, let me
see what you working with.

212
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,567
Come on.
All right, all right.

213
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,010
It's looking good,
it's looking good.

214
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
- Now, you did this side yet?
- I did.

215
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:14,574
Nah, it don't look like
you did this side. Stop Iying.

216
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:15,777
I did!

217
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,912
Look, first of all, man,
you gotta get you a toothbrush.

218
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,979
You ain't gonna be able to
keep the white bottom clean

219
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:21,149
without it, all right?

220
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:24,194
Secondly, man, tuck
the laces in. You buggin' out.

221
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:26,559
You don't give nobody
a chance to, God.

222
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,655
Give you a chance? You gotta
do it in the beginning.

223
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,563
You don't get the shoelaces
all wet and dirty,

224
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,226
man can't start calling you
a poo putt.

225
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:34,600
You know what I'm sayin'?
All right?

226
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:35,603
All right, man.

227
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,103
Who is it?!

228
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,667
It's Ace.

229
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,576
Hey, Boogie.

230
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,784
- What's up, nigga?
- What's up, man?

231
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,818
- What's up, homeboy?
- I'm chillin', man.

232
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,683
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

233
00:09:50,754 --> 00:09:52,016
Oh, yeah,
before I forget, man,

234
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,818
I need you to do me
a favor if you can, man.

235
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:56,052
Run some clothes down to the
cleaners for me if you could.

236
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,787
- Okay, cool, man.
- That's cool?

237
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,886
I know it's hectic for you
out here and all that.

238
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:02,454
Keisha! Keisha!

239
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,467
- What?!
- This nigga A. here.

240
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:06,935
Hey, Ace.
I didn't know you was here.

241
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,471
Go in the back
and get them clothes for me

242
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:09,767
so he can bring them
to Mr. Pip's.

243
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,774
Nigga, what's wrong
with your big-ass feet?

244
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:13,139
What, man?

245
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,043
Get you in need of some grease
for them whack-ass baby hairs.

246
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:17,205
Shut up.

247
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,646
And tuck in that little butt.

248
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,580
Nobody wants to
see that little butt.

249
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,812
- Whassup, Ace?
- Whassup, little man?

250
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:24,786
Hey, Mitch,
can we shoot some hoops?

251
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,914
I can't, little man. I'm busy,
B. I gotta go to work.

252
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,082
I got you, man.

253
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:29,455
He don't know nothin'
about no hoops.

254
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:30,823
You need to be
comin' to me for that.

255
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:32,885
I'll have you workin' on your
left hand. You'll do nice.

256
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,123
All right, man,
I'll see you later.

257
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,632
You talkin' back.

258
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,467
You just came for the clothes?

259
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:44,098
Nah. Pfft.
What you talkin' about?

260
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:48,036
What's up, man?
How you doin'?

261
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:49,169
Good, baby.

262
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,476
What's up, man?

263
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:56,382
- Everything all right here?
- Yeah, it's good.

264
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,853
Let me see that.
Is this $800?

265
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:08,665
Come here!

266
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:11,599
- How you doing, Mr. Crawford?
- Hey, Ace.

267
00:11:11,668 --> 00:11:13,158
Got your delivery here.

268
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,102
- Everything cool, though?
- Yeah, yeah.

269
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:17,037
Good, all right.
I'll be back.

270
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,938
All right, all right.

271
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,274
Hey, Paisan.
Hey, excuse me, my friend.

272
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,405
You work for
the cleaners, right?

273
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,607
Yeah. Here you go.

274
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:28,207
Could you take some
clothes for me, please?

275
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:29,377
Just a few things.

276
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:31,250
Yeah, I'll be right there.

277
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,221
- Okay.
- Go ahead, man.

278
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,383
Thank you.

279
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,393
Come in!

280
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,292
Come in.
You want something to drink?

281
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,490
A soda?

282
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:43,226
Um... nah.

283
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,701
But I'll take that
laundry you...

284
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,864
Damn.

285

Okay.

286
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:56,207
All right. Oh! I...

287
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,804
Gotta get these clean, too!

288
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,348
What's your name?

289
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,114
Ace.

290
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:06,052
Ace.

291
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:07,613
Aceito?

292
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,623
Yeah.

293
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,557
You live
in the neighborhood, right?

294
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:11,889
Yeah.

295
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:13,520
Look, I gotta get
outta here, man.

296
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,588
- I gotta get back.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

297
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:22,165
Your friend who's the dealer?

298
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:27,734
Take him to a movie.
That's your friend, right?

299
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,210
Yeah.

300
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,337
I'm Lulu.

301
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,348
What?

302
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,180
Lulu.

303
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:37,550
Okay, what kind of name
is that?

304
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,646
I don't know.
It's my name.

305
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:46,491
Show me your left.
Show me your left.

306
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,827
Come on, man.
Anybody could do that.

307
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,834
You think you slick? You trying
to go between your legs?

308
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,166
Come on... Nah, the left!
The left, baby!

309
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,966
Show me the...

00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,405
Terrible. Terrible.

311
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,477
Oh, snap!

312
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,945
Whoo!

313
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,608
I gotta see this!
Yo, that's yours?

314
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,776
Nah, little man, that's ours.

315
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:11,980
- Can I check it out?
- Go check it out.

316
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:12,987
What's up?

317
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,353
What up, baby?
Come on... no, no, no!

00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:15,982
Come on around here, man!

319
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:17,390
Come on, baby,
Stop playing, man.

320
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,156
You know my style, baby.

321
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,924
It ain't my style
to be running around here

322
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:22,487
getting all sweaty
on the court, baby.

323
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,466
So, that's your little
new bike, huh?

324
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:27,628
- It's fly, right?
- Yeah, it's fly.

325
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:30,104
I see your shit shimmering, man,
you know what I'm saying?

326
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:31,663
I see you got the Rolex.

327
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:32,800
You know about this, B.

328
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:35,003
We need to get you one, man,
and stop playing.

329
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:36,670
- No, no, no, no.
- Straight-up pussy magnet, man.

330
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:37,941
You gonna have
no problems, man.

331
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:39,743
- It ain't my flow, man.
- Oh, it ain't your flow.

332
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:42,580
Oh, you too smooth, now?
That's what it is?

333
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,914
Nah, man, it's you.

334
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:44,954
Oh, it's me.

Yeah, you right, man.

336

Making money is me, man.

337
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,053
Nah, I'm just
fuckin' with you, A., man.

338
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,100
Yes, you'll probably have
a whole chain of cleaners

339
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,226
in a hot minute anyway,

340
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,770
Be the George Jefferson
of the ghetto, B.

341
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:05,697
Yeah, nigga's got jokes.

342
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:08,438
In 10 years, me and you

343
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:09,501
10 years?

344
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:13,777
I'm thinking more like
10 days, man. 10 days.

345
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,354
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's reaI money right there.

369
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,716
Try a quick $800 in one day.

382
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:06,588
Hey, Ace.

00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,630
Hey.

00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,501
Calvin.

387
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,470
What's goin' on, baby?

388
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:18,064
You know, we're just gettin'
ready for dinner.

389
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:24,802
I put the tips in the thing.

390
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,885
Hey, how about that?
A number eight.

00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:41,663
Yeah, no problem.

00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,323
Yo, uh...

401
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:02,980
Why don't you go on ahead,
Calvin? She'll be right there.

402
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,787
What's the next product
up to win?

403
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,955
It's a sturdy washer and dryer!

404
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,698
You're stupid.

405
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,464
Whatever!

406
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:33,015
Come on, Ace!

407
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,380
How many times
I gotta tell you

408
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,419
about this boobity-boob
shit playing in the store?

409
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,647
What you want me to do?
Like, not listen to the radio...

410
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:39,654
What?!

411
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,520
I said, half the time,
you ain't even in here!

412
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,991
What you want me to do, sit in
here and not listen to no music?

413
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,994
It don't make no difference
if I'm here or not!

414
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:48,053
It's my rules, my radio,
my store, my music!

415
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:49,928
You know I don't listen
to this shit!

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,490
I... I can't even
understand them!

417
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:53,695
Look, can you even
understand this shit?

418
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,032
It's for my ears.
Yes, I understand it.

419
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,402
Yeah, you can understand
that bullshit,

420
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:58,532
but you can't understand
when I tell you not to...

421
00:17:58,608 --> 00:17:59,870
Ahh.

422
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:02,503
Yeah. That's it.
That's what I'm talking about.

423
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:05,673
You hear that? You hear that?
That's music. That's singing.

424
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:06,943
There's beauty in singing.

425
00:18:07,017 --> 00:18:08,314
That other shit
is just talking.

426
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,376
"Yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak. "

427
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,580
That's what I'm talking about,
you understand what I'm saying?

428
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,089
That's quality shit.

429
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,523
Hello?

430
00:18:16,593 --> 00:18:19,756
Shit, nigga, make it easy
on yourself. I don't know.

431
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:22,593
No, baby, I ain't...

432
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,429
Ain't you sick of

433
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,435
Oh, shit. Ho... oh!

434
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:28,801

- Yeah. Hold on one second.

435
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,305
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

It's that new shit, man. White

441
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:42,411
Hey, Boogie!

What's up, nigga?
You feelin' me, man?

Let me take you for a spin,

00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,961
I gotta go

450
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,935
You think you're the only one

451
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:02,266
I gotta make drop-offs,

00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:05,239
Come on, man, get in, man.

# Pump back the bass,

461
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,642
What's up, niggas?
What's happenin'?

466
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,776

467
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:52,481
Man, I still hope we got
that $5,000 bet happenin'.

468
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,147
- What?
- The Knicks, nigga.

469
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:57,318
- What? What?
- Turn down the boom-ass stereo.

470
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,554
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

471
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:00,721
We still have 5 G's, nigga?

472
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:02,424
You gotta stop acting like
you ain't makin' money, man.

473
00:20:02,499 --> 00:20:03,830
Make it $ 10,000, man.
What's wrong with you?

474
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,992
Make it 10 G's,
you poor-ass nigga.

475
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,899
We gettin' more money than you,
man, you know what I'm sayin'?

476
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,961
I got a G. for every
bump on your face, nigga.

477
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,005
Whatever you want, man.

478
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:11,301
Hey, what's you laughin' at,
man?

479
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:12,841
You need to put your man on.
He look bad.

480
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,843
Tell him to get hit with
an ounce of somethin' somethin'.

481
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:16,435
Yo, this is my Thursday car.

482
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,071
On Saturday, I'm breakin' out
with something new, all right?

483
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,979
- Saturday, report to bridge...
- Yo, man,

484
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:21,209
I am the bridge, man.

485
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:23,309
You report to me, man,
always, man.

486
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:25,513
Hey, none of that shit, man.
You might wanna holler at me.

487
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:28,022
You dumb-ass niggas.

488
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,117
Oh, yeah.
Everybody's chillin'.

489
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:34,026
- Tommy Tom.
- Yeah, what's up, baby?

490
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:36,429
- What's up, man?
- Hey, baby.

491
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,488
My streetside negro.

492
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,694
Taking care of the community?

493
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:41,669
Yes, indeed.
I'm takin' care of you, too.

494
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:44,263
It's all good.

495
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,070
Yep. You're so damn neat
with your money.

496
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,872
Come on, man.
You know me, man.

497
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:50,742
Cleanliness is
next to Godliness.

498
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:53,840
What's up, little niggas?
How y'all livin'?

499
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:04,223
You left this in your pants
last time.

500
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,263
Do you always return everything
you find in the laundry?

501
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,695
Nah.

502
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,630
I didn't think so.

503
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,864
You find something
in there, you keep it.

504
00:21:14,938 --> 00:21:16,405
It's a tip for you.

505
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:18,064
- This?
- Mm-hmm.

506
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:21,076
That's nothing for me.
My job brings me plenty.

507
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:22,771
But you ain't no drug dealer.

508
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:25,809
I'm not?

509
00:21:25,882 --> 00:21:27,975
Moneymakin' Mitch.

510
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:29,643
Tell me somethin' good, baby.

511
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:32,381
It's all good, Ice.

512
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:33,615
I know it is.

513
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,591
Why am I not a drug dealer?

514
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,388
I'm sayin'
I don't see you outside.

515
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,258
The way you dress...
you dress nice.

516
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,456
What about your friends?

517
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:43,328
They dress nice. Fancy.

518
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,799
Tuck them laces in, all right?
Don't be slackin' on that.

519
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:47,496
Yeah, he's your
right-hand man, now.

520
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:50,801
- Next week, nigga.
- Makin' that reaI money.

521
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:53,104
Yeah, but you... you dress
nice-nice, you understand?

522
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:55,940
They dress...
whatever, loud-nice.

523
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,480
Okay. Thank you.

524
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,413
You don't even
got a car, do you?

525
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,075
What do I need a car for?

526
00:22:02,151 --> 00:22:04,176
Family movin' up
in the business.

527
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:07,189
I know
you gonna look after family.

528
00:22:07,257 --> 00:22:09,521
What family
you talking about, Ice?

529
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:12,026
Fuck,
I look invisible, nigga?

530
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:13,528
Did I pass the test, compre?

531
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:14,620
It's not...

532
00:22:14,697 --> 00:22:17,359
it's not a test.
I'm just sayin'...

533
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:18,798
You like money, right?

534
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:21,662
Yeah.

535
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:24,969
I'm broke, baby.
I ain't got no money.

536
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,030
Bullshit.

537
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,542
I see you shinin', nigga.

538
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,840
I can smell a motherfucker
with money.

539
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:33,679
Even Ray Charles could see
you got money.

540
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,011
Dang.

541
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:37,882
Look at this nigga.

542
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,218
Little Sonny and his crew,
the future of our nation.

543
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,019
Ain't that a bitch?

544
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:51,063
Damn, man.

545
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:54,831
You got the John Wayne shit,
man.

546
00:22:54,904 --> 00:22:58,340
Fuckin' gun all up in the
007 compartment, man. Damn.

547
00:22:58,408 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, the way you dress,
nigga,

548
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:02,044
you ain't got to worry
about those cats.

549
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:04,409
You'll be invisible up in
the club.

550
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,072
Exactly.

551
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:08,242
Nah, I'm just
fuckin' with you, bud.

552
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:13,048
What you doin', man?
What's that?

553
00:23:16,092 --> 00:23:17,719
You tell me, man.

554
00:23:19,562 --> 00:23:21,427
It looks like coke, nigga.

555
00:23:26,336 --> 00:23:28,395
You fuck me up, A.

556
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,031
You never say shit, B.

557
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,473
Just come out the blue
with some coke, huh?

558
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:37,512
To tell you the truth, I ain't
fuckin' with coke right now.

559
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,070
The shit
just ain't clickin', B.

560
00:23:39,148 --> 00:23:40,672
You know what you
need to do, man?

561
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,241
You need to fuck with that cat
your sister be talkin' to,

562
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,411
that nigga, Calvin, man.

563
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:45,476
He sells coke.

564
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,785
Nah, I ain't fuckin'
with that nigga, man.

565
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:49,119
Nigga's dumb.

566
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:54,023
Hey, man, what, man?

567
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:55,928
What you mean, "What?"

568
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,796
I'm just tryin' to picture
Mr. Jefferson

569
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:58,993
hustlin' on these streets.

570
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,395
I've seen you roll up
in the black Saab

571
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:04,633
with the gold BBS's, man.

572
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:05,799
I said, "Damn,

573
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,139
this dickety-stick
is really makin' this money.

574
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,475
He's really makin' money,
man," you understand?

575
00:24:10,546 --> 00:24:11,604
Listen, hey...

576
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:14,047
It ain't just about the money.

577
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:15,379
It's not.

578
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:18,716
You know what it's about, man?

579
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:22,246
It's about fuckin' those
skeezers like that right there,

580
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,759
it's about drivin'
these fly-ass cars,

581
00:24:24,827 --> 00:24:28,228
and it's definitely about never
dressin' like a nigga like you.

582
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:29,821
Okay, man.

583
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:32,424
Come on, man. Let's go be stars
up in this joint, all right?

584
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:35,136
Yeah, baby!
Dance it up, y'all!

585
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:37,069
Go on and get out there
and move it!

586
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:41,534
Come on!

587
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:44,910
Come on!

588
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,142
Yeah! This is
all about boogie.

589
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,810
We boogie nonstop.

590
00:24:49,886 --> 00:24:51,581
We at the top.
We got it goin' on.

591
00:24:51,654 --> 00:24:53,849
A'ight, here we go.

592
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:56,551
- What's up? What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.

593
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:58,457
Hey, my man!

594
00:24:58,528 --> 00:25:00,826
Ladies' lookin' good...

595
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,689
Yeah!

596
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:07,930
Mitch was a reaI star...

597
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:12,998
See, when the lights caught him,
he always looked good.

598
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,101
Yo, my man,
Mitch, in the house!

599
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:16,907
Yeah! Lookin' good, King!
I see you!

600
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:18,173
A'ight, here we go!

601
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:21,011
And Mitch got love
from everybody.

602
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:24,281
I mean, everybody.

603
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:17,803
What are you doing?

604
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:20,138
Go to sleep, little man.

605
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:01,501
Lucky, you're up.
You workin' today?

606
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:04,569
You know,
don't call me "Lucky," Ma.

607
00:28:06,182 --> 00:28:07,774
Been a long time since...

608
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,648
I found food stamps
or something like that.

609
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,383
Now, don't forget
when you picked that $ 700...

610
00:28:14,457 --> 00:28:16,755
Ma, that was when I was 12,
you know what I'm sayin'?

611
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:19,454
I'm grown now, and there ain't
a whole lot lucky to do with me

612
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:21,291
getting up and goin' to
work right now,

613
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:23,958
so... I don't wanna be called
"Lucky. " Thanks, Mom.

614
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,524
All right, baby.

615
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:44,584
Guess your sister got to get
a better man now.

616
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:46,815
Boy just got busted
by the cops.

617
00:28:52,161 --> 00:28:54,561
He was dealing right in
front of your building.

618
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,360
Didn't I tell you?

619
00:28:57,433 --> 00:29:00,027
Can't do shit
with that cash now...

620
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:02,536
except hire a lawyer.

621
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:04,436
Did you see it?

622
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,031
Nah.

623
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:08,440
I heard about it
on the way over here.

624
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:11,105
Cops must've been watching
his dumb ass.

625
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:15,278
Yo, chief,
you seen Calvin?

626
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:17,046
Nah, he got locked up.

627
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,019
Yo, takin' his place?

628
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,186
Never mind.

629
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,727
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

630
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:28,491
Hold on one second, man.
What, um...

631
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:30,532
what you lookin' for?

632
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,793
Just one.

633
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,130
A'ight.

634
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:49,715
Fuck, B.

635
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:50,809
One.

636
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,945
You ain't got no bottle?

637
00:29:53,022 --> 00:29:54,956
What? Bottle?

638
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:57,185
What you need
a bottle for, man?

639
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,726
Plastic bottle, whatever?

640
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:02,726
Damn,
this is a big-ass rock, B.

641
00:30:05,234 --> 00:30:06,258
Mmm!

642
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:10,965
All this for a hundred?

643
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,476
Man, this is better than
Calvin's stuff. Word up.

644
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:17,535
Yo, I could hook up
with you later, right?

645
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:19,945
Nah, man, I'm...
across the street.

646
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:22,142
The building
across the street.

647
00:30:22,218 --> 00:30:24,743
All right, G.
Peace out.

648
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:30,248
You know what this is?

649
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:32,055
Yeah. It's coke.

650
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:34,688
Yes,
but that's a kilo of coke.

651
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:37,164
How much is it worth?

652
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:39,133
$25,000.

653
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:40,190
Damn.

654
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:41,201
No "damn. "

655
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,999
Damn, that's damn good, okay?

656
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:44,300
A'ight, I'm sayin'...

657
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:46,466
The shit on the street
is garbage.

658
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:50,137
This crud that's washed
with acetone and kerosene.

659
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:51,839
This is the best product,

660
00:30:51,914 --> 00:30:55,907
and you gonna be the only one
in the street holding this.

661
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,009
$25,000.

662
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:59,179
$25,000 is the street price.

663
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:01,052
Of that, I get $ 18,000.

664
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:03,148
$ 7,000.

665
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:06,023
That's right,
for every key that you move.

666
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:07,494
You know I...

667
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:10,293
I still got my job
at the cleaners, um...

668
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,027
No, it's perfect, man,

669
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,569
because that's how
everybody knows you... as Ace.

670
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:16,796
Forget about heroin.

671
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:19,466
This is the wave
of the future, baby.

672
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:24,605
Crazy, man.

673
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,204
I'm gonna give you...

674
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:29,410
an eighth of a key, okay?

675
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,214
Break it up.

676
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:33,221
Do like you did with the rock.

677
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:38,056
See me in four days, okay?

678
00:31:38,127 --> 00:31:39,219
'Sup, niggas?

679
00:31:39,295 --> 00:31:41,456
How you niggas livin'?
You all a'ight?

680
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,020
Everything good out here?

681
00:31:43,098 --> 00:31:44,190
What's up, baby?

682
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:46,325
Good, good, good.
How you feeI, baby?

683
00:31:46,402 --> 00:31:47,334
Chillin'.

684
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:49,394
Got that money for me, man?
I gotta make moves.

685
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,133
Yeah, I got it,
but not all of it, yo.

686
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:52,731
What you mean,
you ain't finished?

687
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:53,832
I got robbed, yo.

688
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:55,570
Park it around the block!

689
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:56,736
Around the block, man!

690
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:59,440
The fuck you mean you got
robbed, man? Who robbed you?

691
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:01,312
Got robbed, man.
That nigga, Duff.

692
00:32:03,152 --> 00:32:04,619
Nigga Duff?

693
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,882
Let this nigga Duff up on you,
man, and take your shit?

694
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:08,014
And my piece, man.

695
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,489
You had your fuckin' gun
on you, man?

696
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:11,048
What the fuck is
wrong with y'all niggas?

697
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,218
You niggas stand out here

698
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:14,057
like the Three Stooges
of Harlem or somethin', B.?

699
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,858
You gonna let this nigga
come and take your shit?

700
00:32:15,931 --> 00:32:16,989
Aren't you a motherfuckin' man?

701
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:19,728
You wanna let another man
take your shit, B.?

702
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:22,066
You done lost your privilege
of getting any money, man,

703
00:32:22,137 --> 00:32:23,968
untiI you show me
where that man is at.

704
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,564
UntiI you find that man,

705
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:28,769
A'ight? You hear what

706
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:30,869
Now, get the fuck
off my stoop, man.

707
00:32:30,946 --> 00:32:32,914
Go ahead, man.
Go find that man, B.

708
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:35,746
Go find him, B., unless
you like being broke, nigga.

709
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:38,150
Go this way, man.
Hey, my man, go this way, man.

710
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,744
Go that way, man.

711
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:41,790
Them niggas don't seem
to understand me out here, B.

712
00:32:41,857 --> 00:32:43,381
Nobody playing games
on these streets, man.

713
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:45,222
Y'all niggas better hold it down
out here, a'ight?

714
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:47,387
Them niggas gonna be lookin' for
motherfucking work in Queens

715
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:48,555
or some shit like that, man.

716
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:51,191
This is Harlem, man. Y'all
niggas better hold it down, B.

717
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:57,531
Y'all don't know nothin'
about this.

718
00:32:57,606 --> 00:33:00,632
Things really got hot in Harlem
when "Scarface" came to town.

719
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:05,378
It was like niggas love
seein' a poor-ass Cuban

720
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:08,541
just blow up
to be the man all by himself.

721
00:33:13,756 --> 00:33:15,656
You wait for me.
I coming back.

722
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,660
Call police!

723
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:28,597
What the fuck you lookin' at?

724
00:33:32,107 --> 00:33:33,074
Come on.

725
00:33:33,142 --> 00:33:34,905
You wanna fuck with me?

726
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:36,035
Okay.

727
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:39,308
You... cockroaches.
Come on.

728
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:42,978
You wanna play games?

729
00:33:45,754 --> 00:33:47,619
Come on.

730
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:51,191
You wanna play rough?!

731
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,488
Okay.

732
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,155
Say hello to my little friend!

733
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:07,808
You want more?!

734
00:34:17,052 --> 00:34:19,680
Mitch backed up his words

735
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,586
and ended up doing some time.

736
00:34:23,392 --> 00:34:26,293
Now I'm all by myself
in the game,

737
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:28,489
just like Scarface.

738
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:35,059
What's up, old man?

739
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:41,304
What's going on
over here, man?

740
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:42,537
Man, bust it.

741
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:44,340
You ain't taking my messages
or something?

742
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:46,142
Keisha didn't call?

743
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:49,912
I dropped some tickets
behind this counter,

744
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:52,510
and this is what I find.

745
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:55,352
Is this yours...

746
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:57,449
or you keepin' it
for a friend?

747
00:34:57,526 --> 00:35:00,222
Man, it ain't even like that,
Mr. Pip.

748
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,695
Well, then,
what's it like, Ace?

749
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,033
It really ain't none
of your business what it's like.

750
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,638
It's my store.

751
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:18,976
Anything up in here
is my business.

752
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:23,575
You don't have to worry
about that.

753
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:25,517
I'm gonna take that
out of here.

754
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:30,653
I got a life of my own.

755
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:32,421
Oh, check you out.

756
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:35,759
I guess you know somethin' about
the game Calvin didn't, huh?

757
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:38,197
Ace, you better say something
to me if you wanna stay here,

758
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,632
'cause, see, I ain't doing
these type of favors for no...

759
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:42,762
I'm missing one of my tapes.

760
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:44,703
You seen my tape?

761
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:54,475
Yeah, you been wantin'
to get out of here.

762
00:35:56,351 --> 00:35:58,876
Fine, fuck it, then.
Take your ass home.

763
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:06,817
I want my $ 75 on Friday.

764
00:36:08,864 --> 00:36:10,331
What you gonna do with $ 75,
Kingpin?

765
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:14,160
Hey, June.

766
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:16,636
Yeah, hold on a minute.

767
00:36:20,008 --> 00:36:23,102
Hey, Ace. How you doin'?

768
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:24,839
I'm good.

769
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:27,074
Your mama ask you
to come pick up something?

770
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:28,377
Nah.

771
00:36:29,985 --> 00:36:31,782
Oh, so what's going on, honey?

772
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,652
You wanna make some money?

773
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,652
Yeah.

774
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:39,159
Come on in.

775
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:40,490
Yo. Check this out.

776
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,223
How many bottles is this?

777
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:43,457
2,000.

778
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:46,262
Damn. 2,000 bottles?

779
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:48,064
That's a lot of
motherfuckin' bottles, man.

780
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:52,735
$ 100 a bottle, man,

781
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:55,140
this shit ain't gonna
never sell fast enough.

782
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,302
All that for $50?

783
00:36:56,378 --> 00:36:57,845
Yo, man, this shit weak
or somethin', man?

784
00:36:57,913 --> 00:36:59,904
- Don't sell me no...
- Hey, man, you know me, man.

785
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:01,472
This the best product
in town, man.

786
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,710
Don't insult me. Here.

787
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,184
Man, fuck it, man.

788
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:06,312
Give me two of them Jones.
Give me two of them Jones.

789
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:07,582
You trippin'.

790
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:09,681
Yeah, I was trippin', a'ight,

791
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:12,886
but I was gettin' money...
talkin' 'bout reaI money.

792
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:14,622
Bottle this shit up quick, man.

793
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:16,561
See, other dealers
were selling it

794
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:18,463
at the highest price
they could get.

795
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:21,298
I sold it cheaper,
so I was sellin' it faster.

796
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,735
I sold it so cheap,

797
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,898
I started
taking their customers away.

798
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:28,374
See, I was wholesale
on the streets, you understand?

799
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:31,207
Hey, Lucky,
you want something to drink?

800
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,009
Don't call me Lucky, I said.

801
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:34,605
Whatever, Lucky.
What you drinkin'?

802
00:37:34,683 --> 00:37:36,241
Fillin' this all the way up.

803
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:38,149
Now, in the end,
I made more money,

804
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,620
and Lulu always got his return
when he wanted it.

805
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,421
But I wasn't trying to keep shit
all to myself, see.

806
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:46,120
I- I wasn't tryin'
to get on the stage,

807
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:47,958
and I didn't want
people hatin'.

808
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,292
I put people on, understand?

809
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:51,857
Streets was happy.

810
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:53,367
Everybody could eat.

811
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:56,865
Yeah, dealin' was a'ight.

812
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:25,099
Oooh.

813
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:28,899
Put this in there for me, man.

814
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:30,768
Damn, B.!

815
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:39,445
Hey, yo!

816
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:41,038
What you doin', man?

817
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,050
Yo, come on, man.
You watchin' that ass...

818
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:45,450
count that cash so we can
get up out of here, man.

819
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:49,085
In lockup,
brothers always heard

820
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:51,455
what was goin' on
on the outside,

821
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:53,357
especially when
it involve money.

822
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:55,157
And they knew Mitch
was first in line

823
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,697
to get put on when he got out.

824
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:00,626
Have you been
keepin' it tight for me?

825
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:02,431
Yo! Hurry up off the phone,
nigga!

826
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:03,835
Wait.
Hold on a second, B.

827
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:07,671
- Did you hear what I just said?
- What the fuck?

828
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,142
I'm talkin' to you, nigga.

829
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:10,405
Oh, shit!

830
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,468
Yo!

831
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:12,945
Oh!

832
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,118
Come on!

833
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:28,890
10 niggas jumped the nigga,
fams.

834
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,192
10 niggas pounded him out,

835
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:32,233

00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:37,835

839
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:38,873

845
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:48,742
- Hey, but, yo.

846
00:39:48,817 --> 00:39:51,809
What was, um, what was

847
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:54,378

00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:34,753
Oh, yeah?
You from everywhere, huh?

873
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:37,196
It's early.
It's only midnight?

874
00:40:37,265 --> 00:40:38,789
30.

875
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:40,232
Damn.

876
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:46,231
Who that?

877
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:47,240
Hmm?

878
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:48,867
Who's that?

879
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:50,605
I don't know this number.

880
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,840
Oh, you don't know
the number, huh?

881
00:40:54,116 --> 00:40:55,674
Here come the bullshit.

882
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:56,843
Unh-unh.

883
00:40:56,918 --> 00:41:00,445
Can I get
two more grape sodas?

884
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,422
Get on over here.

885
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:04,686
No, don't come over here.
I'm serious.

886
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,887
You got the sauce
all on your cheeks.

887
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,089
Oh, yeah,
now you wanna be all on me.

888
00:41:09,164 --> 00:41:11,689
When we was in the club,
you was dashin' out.

889
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:13,632
What was up with that?

890
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:15,397
What you mean
what was up with me at the club?

891
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,937
The club ain't my scene.

892
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:19,269
I like to go to the club,
take care of my business,

893
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:20,899
talk to the people
I need to talk to,

894
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,341
put it down like that.

895
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:24,276
Everybody checkin' you, checkin'
me, all flashy and shit.

896
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:25,404
That's not my thing.

897
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,675
You're just borin', that's all.

898
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:29,341
That's all.

899
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:34,946
I ain't that boring.

900
00:41:35,023 --> 00:41:36,012
Oooh, oooh.

901
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:37,319
I really ain't that boring.

902
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:38,984
Big shit. What, I'm supposed to
take this and go shopping?

903
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:41,222
If I'm so borin', then,
what...

904
00:41:41,296 --> 00:41:42,854
you know, why you with me?

905
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:45,399
First of all,
I ain't impressed by that.

906
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:48,766
I'm with you
'cause I'm borin', too.

907
00:41:48,837 --> 00:41:50,771
A'ight?

908
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:56,002
Give me that money back
and give me a kiss.

909
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:03,681
Mmm.

910
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:08,913
Word to mother, man.

911
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,855
She's feelin' good.

912
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,120
Word.

913
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:14,321
Yo. Yo, these guys have been
lookin' for you all day.

914
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:18,595
I don't know
these motherfuckers, man.

915
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:19,759
Yo, Ace, right?

916
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,132
Yeah, man.

917
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:23,899
What's goin' on, baby?
Yo, I hear you got that butter.

918
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:25,371
You holdin'?

919
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,668
You know me, man, or somebody?

920
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:28,436
I don't think you know me, man,
you know what I'm sayin'?

921
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,410
I think somebody been misleadin'
you, you know what I mean?

922
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:31,969
Ah, come on, man.
Look at you.

923
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:33,742
Got this European joint
all done up,

924
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:35,339

and everything..

925
00:42:35,417 --> 00:42:36,543
Hey, yo, my man...

926
00:42:36,618 --> 00:42:38,381

927
00:42:38,453 --> 00:42:40,444
We tryin' to build right here
inside of here.

928
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:43,320
I don't know nothin' about what
you talkin' about, understand?

929
00:42:43,391 --> 00:42:44,756
Yo.
We'll meet up again, right?

930
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:46,555
Different time,
different circumstances?

931
00:42:46,628 --> 00:42:49,119
Yeah, maybe it'll be love next
time, you know what I'm sayin'?

932
00:42:49,197 --> 00:42:50,129
A'ight.

933
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:51,961
Maybe.

934
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,227
Corny motherfuckers, man.

00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,735
Got the silent routine,
his boy with him and shit.

936
00:42:57,606 --> 00:43:00,473
Something was up
with those cats.

937
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:03,978
They was either stickup kids
or the feds.

938
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:07,242
Either way,
I wasn't fuckin' with 'em.

939
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:12,911
Hey, yo, Lulu?

940
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:17,182
Moneybags?

941
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:42,777
The messengers.

942
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:46,412
With $2,000.

943
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:48,718
Yes, Pedro.

944
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,054
I know you didn't hear it.
I know.

945
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,889
But...

946
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:54,895
Excuse me, um...

947
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:55,952
What's going on?

948
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,659
Do you know this man?

949
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:00,132
No, um...

950
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:03,137
but I'm here about Lulu.

951
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:06,470
Lulu... uh...

952
00:44:08,877 --> 00:44:12,779
He... somebody killed him.
You know, I found him.

953
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:15,775
Why come here?

954
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,912
Well, it being that,
you know,

955
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:22,513
me and him, we did a lot
of business together, right?

956
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:25,116
So, one time
he brought me here before,

957
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:26,990
so that's why I came here.

958
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,427
Hmm.

959
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:30,828
How much in the bag?

960
00:44:30,899 --> 00:44:32,161
200 long.

961
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:33,792
200?

962
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:35,335
Why didn't you keep it?

963
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,307
Damn.

964
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:42,638
Nah.

965
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:44,770
I ain't like that, man.

966
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:46,643
Know what I mean?
Oh, um...

967
00:44:48,016 --> 00:44:50,507
Eduardo... calm.

968
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,576
Not here, man.

969
00:44:52,654 --> 00:44:54,679
Calm yourself, Eduardo.

970
00:44:54,756 --> 00:44:56,849
What you got there?

971
00:44:57,259 --> 00:44:58,385
What you got there?

972
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,724
It's just some stuff
that I, you know...

973
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:02,990
What?

974
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:04,292
It's Lulu.

975
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,664
Eh?

976
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,696
He likes the rocks.

977
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:13,864
Luis Lujano.

978
00:45:13,942 --> 00:45:17,639
Yeah,
cash is too bulky for him.

979
00:45:17,712 --> 00:45:19,737
ReaI estate and rocks...

980
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:22,146
that's his game.

981
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:25,152
Hmm. So, let me
get this straight...

982
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,314
you just gonna give me
all this stuff.

983
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:30,654
Why? I mean,
it's not my birthday.

984
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,385
I'm saying I sold a lot for him,
you know what I mean?

985
00:45:34,462 --> 00:45:36,396
And, uh...

986
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:39,092
maybe we go on.

987
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,759
Oh.

988
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,962
Can you handle 10 keys
all by yourself?

989
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:47,099
Yeah.

990
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:48,233
Good.

991
00:45:56,017 --> 00:45:58,918
See, the thing
about the game is,

992
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:00,648
the shit don't stop.

993
00:46:00,722 --> 00:46:03,987
You could be hurt,
and it don't matter.

994
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:07,085
Business will still
roll up on you.

995
00:46:13,168 --> 00:46:14,760
Hey, yo. Yo, yo, yo.

996
00:46:14,836 --> 00:46:15,803
What's up, man?

997
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:16,894
Rico buggin' out.

998
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:18,404
Oh!

999
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:19,531
Holy shit.

1000
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:28,079
<i>My nigga.
That's my nigga.</i>

1001
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:35,821
What up, B.?

1002
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:37,914
What's happening?

1003
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:39,425
- What's up?
- You're Ace, right?

1004
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:40,461
Huh?

1005
00:46:40,528 --> 00:46:41,495
Yeah, no doubt, baby.

1006
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:43,087
It's a navy blue Beemer, huh?

1007
00:46:43,164 --> 00:46:44,096
Yeah.

1008
00:46:44,165 --> 00:46:45,564
Doin' your thing, man.

1009
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:46,759

1010
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:48,097

1011
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:49,193
Word.

1012
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,931
Hey, yo, man,

1013
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:53,530
You got any problems, man,

1014
00:46:53,608 --> 00:46:54,802
Yeah, no doubt.

1015
00:46:54,876 --> 00:46:55,843
We'll talk.

1016
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,070
We gonna talk, B.

1017

00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,840
When Mitch get out,

00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,910

00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:07,352

- Yeah!

1023
00:47:08,723 --> 00:47:10,452
Nobody can't hold you.

1024
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:12,288
Listen, give this to Mitch.

1025
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,089
Yeah, that's

00:47:16,264 --> 00:47:18,698
Hey, what you doin'

1028
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:21,361
Y'all doin' things

1029
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:23,768
Check this girI out!

00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:25,305
You all right?

00:47:26,508 --> 00:47:27,975
Yo, baby.

Glad to see you, man.

00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,290
And that's lookin' very fresh.
Very fresh.

1042
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:45,383
Yeah?

1043

1044
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:49,424

1045
00:47:49,497 --> 00:47:50,987
That's my style right there.

1046
00:47:51,065 --> 00:47:52,191
Hold onto that, man.

1047
00:47:52,267 --> 00:47:54,667
It is your style,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1048
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:55,896
Ain't quite my style.

1049
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,904
This nigga here.

1050
00:47:57,972 --> 00:47:59,405
- Little somethin', kid.
- That's my man.

1051
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:01,339
Word, man, word, man.
No doubt.

1052
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:03,309
Yo, but on the reaI...
hey, man.

1053
00:48:03,378 --> 00:48:04,777
You wanna hook a nigga up,

1054
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:07,076
Hook me up with some of them
keys I been hearin' about,

1055
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:08,172
you know what I'm sayin'?

1056
00:48:08,249 --> 00:48:09,477
- I got you, man.
- Back, baby.

1057
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:11,041
You know what I'm sayin'?
Your nigga's back, man.

1058
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,381
- A'ight?
- Let's do this.

1059
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:13,887
- I got you.
- Do this.

1060
00:48:13,955 --> 00:48:16,082
Let's see
what this lookin' like.

1061
00:48:16,157 --> 00:48:18,523
See what the hell's
going on with this here, man.

1062
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:20,424
Let's see
how the engine sounds, Ace.

1063
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:22,793
You understand, making sure
you ain't, you know...

1064
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,932
...to my nigga Mitch back home

1065
00:48:29,003 --> 00:48:31,836
for beatin' that murder rap.
Can't keep a good nigga down.

1066
00:48:31,906 --> 00:48:34,340
Yeah, we get money...
Uptown style, a'ight?

1067
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:36,274
It felt good
to be rollin' through Harlem

1068
00:48:36,344 --> 00:48:38,642
top down
and Mitch at the wheeI.

1069
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:44,047
I just wanted
to get my man set up

1070
00:48:44,118 --> 00:48:46,814
and back where he belong...
on the stage.

1071
00:48:46,888 --> 00:48:48,856
The Maximas, the Jettas...

1072
00:48:48,923 --> 00:48:50,390
don't know how we do the roll.

1073
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,119
We got a lot of things
poppin' off, yo.

1074
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:53,660
We got a lot of things
poppin' off.

1075
00:48:56,931 --> 00:48:58,762
Feelin' good out here.
How you doin'?

1076
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,266
I saw your man, man.

1077
00:49:00,335 --> 00:49:02,803
I talked to your man, um...

1078
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:05,465
Panamanian, Puerto Rican cat.

1079
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,666
Oh, yeah?

1080
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:08,834
Yeah, I seen him.
Talked to him.

1081
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,104
He came up on me.

1082
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:11,611
Oh, uh, Rico.

1083
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
I had a little confrontation
in there, you know.

1084
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:17,011
He definitely did, uh,
come through, man, you know.

1085
00:49:17,085 --> 00:49:19,383
Not sayin' that a nigga
ain't gonna handle

1086
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:21,513
what a nigga gotta handle,
you know.

1087
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:24,387
He definitely did,
but at the same time...

1088
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:27,292
you know, the nigga definitely
did show me some love, so...

1089
00:49:27,362 --> 00:49:29,523
thinkin' that, you know,
it might be good...

1090
00:49:29,597 --> 00:49:31,292
you know, maybe we could throw
him in there somewhere,

1091
00:49:31,366 --> 00:49:32,958
you know, I don't know.
We might be able to use...

1092
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:34,661
you know, it's up to you,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1093
00:49:37,772 --> 00:49:39,205
Hey, Mitch,
how much this cost?

1094
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:41,504
Man, why you worried about
how much those cost?

1095
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,373
You 'bout
to buy a car or somethin'?

1096
00:49:43,444 --> 00:49:44,570
Yo...

1097
00:49:44,646 --> 00:49:46,944
So, when you gonna
take me to the club?

1098
00:49:47,015 --> 00:49:48,175
Come on, little man,

1099
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:50,308
you don't need to be
up in no club.

1100
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:51,647
I just wanna see it.

1101
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,246
Well, Uncle Ice say y'all in
there throwin' your cash around,

1102
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:56,950
lookin' all fly.

1103
00:49:57,025 --> 00:50:00,461
Let me tell you something,
little man... fuck Ice.

1104
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:02,462
Don't be listenin' to Ice.

1105
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,294
You hear what I'm sayin'?
Look at me, man.

1106
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:06,799
Ice ain't no reaI man.

1107
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:08,995
A reaI man
handles his business.

1108
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,197
A reaI man
takes care of his family.

1109
00:50:11,272 --> 00:50:12,705
Ice don't do none of that.

1110
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:13,900
You understand?

1111
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:16,136
The only thing you need to be
concerned with right now

1112
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,472
is going to schooI.

1113
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:19,740
- That's it, a'ight?
- A'ight.

1114
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:21,338
- A'ight?
- A'ight.

1115
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:22,644
- You ready to be a big man?
- Yeah.

1116
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:23,979
Come sit
in the front seat, man.

1117
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:26,043
A'ight?

1118
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,953
Mr. Mitch, man, I've been
lookin' all over for you, man.

1119
00:50:29,023 --> 00:50:30,012
How you doin'?

1120
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:31,251
- I'm chillin'.
- Good.

1121
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:32,293
Life is good, man.

1122
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,123
I can tell.
Cherry Beemer, huh?

1123
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:35,219
This next year's shit?

1124
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:36,354
You know how I do, man.

1125
00:50:36,431 --> 00:50:37,864
Shit is hot right here, man.

1126
00:50:37,932 --> 00:50:40,423
I seen you and A. up at
55th 10, the Porsches up, man.

1127
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:43,095
Happy you back in business, man,
you're doin' your thing, man.

1128
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:45,036
I'm hearin' life is good
for you, too, man.

1129
00:50:45,106 --> 00:50:46,198
You know, cats is tellin' me

1130
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:48,003
you're doin' your thing
on the East Side,

1131
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:50,510
so I guess that situation with
A. is workin' out pretty good.

1132
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:51,909
Listen, man, you know
I'm gonna do my thing.

1133
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,277
I'm gonna eat regardless.

1134
00:50:53,348 --> 00:50:54,838
That don't mean nothing
but trou... I been down in D.C.

1135
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,850
D.C. is definitely
ready for us, man.

1136
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:58,010
D.C. is it.

1137
00:50:58,086 --> 00:51:00,850
I'm tellin' you, man.
Mitch, look at me.

1138
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:01,946
D.C.

1139
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:03,285
D.C. is it.

1140
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:04,757
We need to make that happen.

1141
00:51:04,826 --> 00:51:06,851
Yo, you spoke to A. about that?

1142
00:51:06,928 --> 00:51:09,795
I mean, you know,
I spoke to A., but A. is A.

1143
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:11,422
You know, he runnin' around,
tellin' me

1144
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:13,160
get with him later on...
you know how it is.

1145
00:51:13,234 --> 00:51:15,065
But we need to make
the D.C. thing happen.

1146
00:51:15,136 --> 00:51:16,262
I'm gonna talk to him, B.

1147
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:17,463
I'm gonna talk to him.

1148
00:51:17,538 --> 00:51:19,199
- That's why I love you.
- I'll talk to him.

1149
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:21,002
That's why I love you.
Good lookin' out, man.

1150
00:51:21,075 --> 00:51:22,633

1151
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,007

00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:25,909

1153
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,277

00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:29,339
Little motherfucker

00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:31,351

big-ass head of his, B.

1156
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:33,182
But, Mitch, get with me, man.

1157
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:35,586
D.C. is it, man,
Holler at me, man.

1158
00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:38,251
Rico came through,
acting all excited and all that,

1159
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:40,692
talkin' 'bout he ready
to expand or somethin'.

1160
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:41,922
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1161
00:51:41,996 --> 00:51:43,861
What you think about that, B.?

1162
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:45,796
- Expand like what?
- I don't know.

1163
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,835
I didn't really get to talk
to him too much about it.

1164
00:51:47,902 --> 00:51:49,733
He talkin' 'bout he wanna go
to D.C. or somethin',

1165
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:51,362
he got a connection in D.C.
or somethin'.

1166
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:53,964
No, man. No, man.
I ain't goin' nowhere, man.

1167
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:56,533
That's what I'm sayin'...

1168
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,169
Showin' us love here.

1169
00:51:58,246 --> 00:51:59,474
No doubt.

1170
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,811
Life is good in Harlem, baby.

1171
00:52:01,883 --> 00:52:08,015
# I can feeI it

00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:11,957

00:52:50,665 --> 00:52:53,532
Yo, remember me, junior?

00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:01,569
What's up, baby? You out?

1186
00:53:01,642 --> 00:53:04,702
Yeah, but fuck all that, man.

00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:10,948

1190
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:12,246
This nigga maintaining.

00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:23,626
Walk with me over here, man.

Hey, yo.

Hey, you know
I'm gonna handle this, right?

1199
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,101
I mean, you know how I was.

1200
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:39,942
Yeah, but, you know,
that was then.

1201
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:42,312
Now, see, listen...

1202
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:45,782
Look, I'm gonna set you up

But, um, I'm gonna
let my man work it.

1205
00:53:49,724 --> 00:53:51,351
So, all you gotta do,
Calvin, man,

1206
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:53,154
is just lay low
and make this money.

1207
00:53:53,227 --> 00:53:54,216
Yeah, come on, baby.

1208
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:55,990
You know
I don't relax with the help.

You know how I get down.

And if... I'm sayin',

1212
00:54:03,171 --> 00:54:05,036
Junior doin' his thing.

Just call me "Ace. "

1215
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:10,677
You're about to get your

1228
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:36,301

00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:39,931

1230
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:42,100
Everything ain't all right,

1231
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:43,609
I ain't eatin'!

1232
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:45,168
You ain't eatin'?
What you mean you ain't...

1233
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:46,440
You ain't

00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:47,640
Everybody eats, B.

Man, fuck this nigga, man.

Don't look me in my

1237
00:54:50,918 --> 00:54:52,510
Man, fuck this nigga.

1238
00:54:52,587 --> 00:54:53,952
Fuck this nigga, B.
Turn around. Move up.

1239
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:56,080
Stay still, motherfucker.

1240
00:54:56,157 --> 00:54:57,488
Ah!

00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:04,289
Hey, yo, B...

You're right, you're right,

1247
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:11,265
But that's what the fuck

I'm not gonna let

I wasn't tryin' to get up

1279
00:56:05,726 --> 00:56:07,694
You know, hope there's no hard
feelings or anything like that.

1280
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:09,286
In my part of D.C.,

00:56:09,363 --> 00:56:11,729
it's just not poppin',

1296
00:56:34,522 --> 00:56:38,219
- They're my peoples, man.

1297
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:40,522
Let's take

1298
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:45,263
That's how you fuck, nigga.

00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:01,074
Yeah, yeah.

00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:02,615
Hey, yo, man.

You drawin' too much

00:57:26,273 --> 00:57:27,797

Everybody's gonna eat.

1330
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:45,723
Everybody can be happy.

1331
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:48,956
We don't have to be on
Front Street all the time, baby.

1332
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,521
Okay, take it easy, man.
Keep your voice down, man.

1333
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,692
Niggas ain't gonna talk.

Hey, yo, A., man,

1337
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:04,843
But niggas wanna position
theyselves to make other moves.

1338
00:58:04,912 --> 00:58:07,380
Half of these niggas
wanna be the man "just 'cause. "

1339
00:58:07,448 --> 00:58:10,645
AII I'm sayin', A...

00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,062
Funny-ass nigga, man.

1347
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:31,367
You ain't even seen

1348
00:58:31,439 --> 00:58:33,168
Don't forget to pick up

1349
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,867
Got it right here

1350
00:58:34,942 --> 00:58:36,637
Yo, man, let me talk to

1351
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,234

1352
00:58:38,312 --> 00:58:40,143
...on the roller skates.
Keep it movin'.

1353
00:58:40,214 --> 00:58:41,943
Let's go. Whoo!

1354
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:45,281
You should've said
somethin' to him.

1355
00:58:45,352 --> 00:58:47,684
Yo, what's up with your man?

1356
00:58:47,755 --> 00:58:49,052
Who... Rico?

1357
00:58:49,123 --> 00:58:52,456
No, I'm talking about this kid
you got running my block for me.

1358
00:58:52,526 --> 00:58:55,620
I mean, he's cool and all that.
Don't get me wrong.

1359
00:58:55,696 --> 00:58:57,061
Kind of reminds me of you

1360
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:59,531
when you was out here
runnin' 'round broke.

1361
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,034
But the point is,
I don't fuckin' need him.

1362
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:04,765
You hot.

1363
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:06,636

You just got out the joint,

1365
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:11,307
The cops are watching you.
Yes, you hot.

1366
00:59:11,378 --> 00:59:13,312
Come on, A.,
what you take me for, man?

1367
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,177
Your man Mitch
just got out of jaiI.

1368
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:17,046
Is you schooling him
like this, too?

1369
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,779
I don't have to do that
with him, man.

1370
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,787
Y- You just need
to lay low, man.

1371
00:59:20,855 --> 00:59:22,220
That's all you gotta do.

1372
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:23,779
I'm hookin' you up.

1373
00:59:23,858 --> 00:59:25,450
H- How is you hookin' me up?

1374
00:59:25,526 --> 00:59:26,925
How I'm hookin' you up?

1375
00:59:26,994 --> 00:59:28,928
Nigga, you got money
in your fuckin' pocket?

1376
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:31,089
I'll deaI the block.
It's my block.

1377
00:59:31,165 --> 00:59:32,097
No.

1378
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:33,326
You can't do that,

1379
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,697
'cause if you get
fuckin' busted,

00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,397
You understand that?
And I ain't havin' that.

1382
00:59:38,472 --> 00:59:40,133
You better have this the way

1383
00:59:40,207 --> 00:59:41,174
or you can step.

00:59:41,242 --> 00:59:42,834
Man, fuck him.

I mean, who the fuck is this

1386
00:59:44,345 --> 00:59:46,074
Kermit the Frog-face ass nigga

1387
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:47,307
Co, co, co, co, co.

1389
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,139

1390
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:51,809

with your man, and that's cool.

1395
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:03,262
He's a funny guy

1396
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:07,164
So, I'm gonna step, a'ight?

But I'll see you later.

soldiers if you can't use 'em?

1403
01:00:19,246 --> 01:00:21,840
That's why I'm Rico.
That's why I do what I do, man.

1404
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:31,517
Mmm. What's up, baby?

1405
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:34,459
Nothin'.

1406
01:00:34,528 --> 01:00:36,723
Mm-hmm.

1407
01:00:42,937 --> 01:00:45,132
So, when we gonna
have this kid?

1408
01:00:46,607 --> 01:00:50,270
As soon as you start spendin'
more time with me.

1409
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:53,604
Now you're stressin' me?

1410
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:55,740
Come on, baby.

1411
01:00:55,816 --> 01:00:57,181
It's just...

1412
01:00:57,251 --> 01:01:00,618
this is the last time
we gonna have alone,

1413
01:01:00,688 --> 01:01:02,918
and you just visitin' already.

1414
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,458
Did I say
I was gonna be there?

1415
01:01:05,526 --> 01:01:06,550
Yes.

1416
01:01:06,627 --> 01:01:07,719
Okay.

1417
01:01:07,795 --> 01:01:09,854
Okay.

1418
01:01:11,365 --> 01:01:13,094
It's gonna be fine, baby.

1419
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:18,935
It's gonna be a nice, fine,
boring life.

1420
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,689
Sonny.

1421
01:01:37,758 --> 01:01:39,191
Sonny.

1422
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,887
Sonny, come on.
Get up, man.

1423
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:42,053
What you doin' here?

1424
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:43,721
Huh? What you doin' here?

1425
01:01:43,797 --> 01:01:45,094

1426
01:01:45,165 --> 01:01:46,154
Where's Mommy?

1427
01:01:46,233 --> 01:01:47,427
I think she left.

1428
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:48,763
She left?

1429
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:49,928
Sonny?

1430
01:01:50,004 --> 01:01:52,438
Who you talkin' to?

1431
01:01:54,174 --> 01:01:55,573
Come on, man.

1432
01:01:55,643 --> 01:01:57,838
Go on to the room, okay?

1433
01:01:57,911 --> 01:01:59,902
Go ahead.

1434
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,540
Hey, Sonny, you hear me

01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:15,394
Hmm? You live here?

01:02:15,462 --> 01:02:17,487

You understand that?!

01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:31,710
Hey, baby, you the one

Yo, don't fuckin'

<i>You fucked up!</i>

01:02:52,733 --> 01:02:54,598

a couple bags of groceries

You got a pocketfuI of money!

Oh, that's right.

who's coming to the stage
to represent.

1517
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:14,407
Are y'all ready to rock
or what?!

1518
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:16,801
All right,
without any further ado,

1519
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:18,105
we want to bring

Doug E. Fresh!

01:05:24,685 --> 01:05:28,917
Everybody from the Rooftop
make some noise!

1523
01:05:28,989 --> 01:05:31,685
# I wanted this to be speciaI,
something more #

1524
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:34,090
# Than any other feeling
that you felt before #

1525
01:05:34,161 --> 01:05:37,756
# Pushin' through the doors
I see girls havin' a good time #

1526
01:05:37,831 --> 01:05:39,196
# I might say a rhyme #

1527
01:05:39,266 --> 01:05:41,860
# Old schooI, new schooI
no schooI rule, baby #

1528
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:43,698
# But other than that,
everything is cool #

1529
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,967
# I see guys and girls dancin',
doin' the new dances #

1530
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,235
# Kissin' while
I'm over here romancin' #

1531
01:05:49,309 --> 01:05:50,833
# You ain't sh...
no need to curse #

1532
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:53,607
# Ask me who she is
and let me tell you first #

1533
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,046
# Slow down, be cool,
and don't act ill #

1534
01:05:56,116 --> 01:05:58,880
# I came to have a good time,
party and chill with you #

1535
01:05:58,952 --> 01:06:01,216
# But plans are made to be
broken, smokin' #

1536
01:06:01,288 --> 01:06:04,985
# I'm not jokin', try to dis me
and I will give you a token #

1537
01:06:05,058 --> 01:06:07,185
# We're the type of people
that can't be stopped #

1538
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:09,058
# And no matter what
we're gonna #

1539
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:11,461
# Keep... keep...
keep risin' to the top #

1540
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,329
Let me hear you say
"Ho! Ho!"

1541
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,458
Ho! Ho!

1542
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:15,559
Ho! Ho!

1543
01:06:15,636 --> 01:06:17,035
Ho! Ho!

1544
01:06:17,104 --> 01:06:18,401
Say "Ho! Ho!"

1545
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:19,939
Ho! Ho!

1546
01:06:42,396 --> 01:06:43,328
Ahh!

1547
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:49,158
Make the shot there, baby.
That's all, Mitch.

1548
01:06:49,236 --> 01:06:50,294
Mitch!

1549
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:52,270
Ah, nigga, that's all.
Give me my money.

1550
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:53,772
Bet it right back.

1551
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,535
But double up.

1552
01:06:55,609 --> 01:06:58,169
Right here, man.

1553
01:06:58,245 --> 01:07:00,236
What the fuck you mean?
This is...

1554
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:03,609
I ain't giving him his food.

1555
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:10,387
Hello?

1556
01:07:37,117 --> 01:07:39,483
Get the fuck up, motherfucker!

1557
01:07:40,554 --> 01:07:42,886
Get the fuck up!

1558
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:50,325
What you waitin' for, man?

1559
01:07:50,397 --> 01:07:51,455
Ohh!

1560
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:57,128
Open the fuckin' safe, nigga!

1561
01:07:57,204 --> 01:07:59,468
Do what they say, Ace.

1562
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:02,064
Open up
the motherfuckin' safe, man.

1563
01:08:03,443 --> 01:08:05,104
It's too dark in here, man.
What the fuck?

1564
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:06,304
I can't even see the...

1565
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,575
Yo, get this nigga
some light.

1566
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:22,224
Come on, man.
Open this fuckin' safe.

1567
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:24,320
Yo, Calvin, man,
why you doing this to me?

1568
01:08:24,398 --> 01:08:26,127
- I can tell that's you.
- Well, fuck all that!

1569
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:28,099
Shut the... fuck up!

1570
01:08:28,168 --> 01:08:30,693
Fuckin' asking me "Why this?"
Or "Why that?"

1571
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:32,636
Now, you think I'm playin'?

1572
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:34,105
Leave him alone! Please!

1573
01:08:34,174 --> 01:08:35,698
You think I'm playin'?!

1574
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:38,108
Open that fuckin' safe, man!

1575
01:08:39,846 --> 01:08:41,336
Look at me.

1576
01:08:41,415 --> 01:08:42,939
No!

1577
01:08:43,016 --> 01:08:46,577
Look at me.
I said look at me!

1578
01:08:46,653 --> 01:08:49,884
You think I'm some
Kermit motherfucker now? Huh?

1579
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:51,981
Listen, man,
don't fuckin' do this, man.

1580
01:08:52,059 --> 01:08:54,619
You think I'm fuckin' playin'?
Open the safe!

1581
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:55,787
Hold on, man!

1582
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:59,491
Now, next time
I ain't gonna miss.

1583
01:08:59,566 --> 01:09:00,828
A'ight?

1584
01:09:00,901 --> 01:09:02,664
There ain't even no money
in this safe, man.

1585
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:04,829
There ain't shit in here.
I got 100 grand at the crib.

1586
01:09:04,905 --> 01:09:06,202
Look at this nigga
playing games.

1587
01:09:06,273 --> 01:09:07,570
There ain't no money
in the safe.

1588
01:09:07,641 --> 01:09:10,201
I can't see
with fuckin' blood in my eyes.

1589
01:09:10,277 --> 01:09:11,869
Get his ass up out of here.

1590
01:09:11,945 --> 01:09:13,572
- Fuck!
- Take his ass home.

1591
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:14,944
Clean him up.

1592
01:09:15,015 --> 01:09:16,209
Get up, man!

1593
01:09:16,283 --> 01:09:18,080
Get up, man!

1594
01:09:19,886 --> 01:09:22,377
Get in there, man.

1595
01:09:25,992 --> 01:09:27,926
I told you, I'm not playin'.
Shut the fuck up!

1596
01:09:27,994 --> 01:09:31,020
What's
the fuckin' combination? Huh?

1597
01:09:31,098 --> 01:09:32,725
Shut up with that cryin' shit!

1598
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,666
I'm not trying to hear that!
What's the fuckin' combination?

1599
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:37,294
# It's up to three #

1600
01:09:38,772 --> 01:09:39,932
What...

1601
01:09:40,006 --> 01:09:42,474
M- M-Motherfucker!

1602
01:09:42,542 --> 01:09:44,009
Aah!

1603
01:09:44,077 --> 01:09:46,102
# I'll be yours,
and you'll be mine #

1604
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:30,121
She was 7 pounds...

1605
01:10:30,190 --> 01:10:32,351
and her daddy survived.

1606
01:10:38,431 --> 01:10:41,400
Only God and love
could have kept me breathing

1607
01:10:41,468 --> 01:10:43,766
after all those bullets.

1608
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:48,367
I told myself when I could
breathe without a tube

1609
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:51,467
I was gonna breathe deep.

1610
01:11:00,253 --> 01:11:01,447
What's up?

1611
01:11:01,521 --> 01:11:03,921
Nigga needs some work, man.
What's goin' on?

1612
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,982
Ain't nothin' pumpin'
right now, B.

1613
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,358
Come on, man.
I know y'all got something.

1614
01:11:09,429 --> 01:11:10,555
Fuck, is you deaf, man?

1615
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:12,996
I said we ain't got shit
goin' on right now, B.

1616
01:11:13,066 --> 01:11:15,159
So a nigga's supposed to starve
'cause your man got shot?

1617
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:16,600
- What?
- Damn!

1618
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,365
What's that, partner?

1619
01:11:18,438 --> 01:11:20,303
Calvin must got you niggas
shook.

1620
01:11:20,373 --> 01:11:22,364
Calvin?

1621
01:11:22,442 --> 01:11:24,410
What, you one of Calvin...
what the fuck?

1622
01:11:24,477 --> 01:11:25,808
Is you
one of Calvin's hoes, man?

1623
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:29,677
Get that nigga
out of the car, man.

1624
01:11:29,749 --> 01:11:32,513
Get that bitch out of the car.

1625
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:34,554
- Get the fuck up.
- Shit.

1626
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:36,851
Get up. Do you know
what Calvin did?

1627
01:11:36,923 --> 01:11:38,823
- Come on, man. Don't do this.
- Get the fuck undressed.

1628
01:11:38,892 --> 01:11:40,450
Everything!

1629
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:41,824
What the fuck are you...

1630
01:11:43,797 --> 01:11:45,321
- Your sneakers, too!
- All right, man.

1631
01:11:45,398 --> 01:11:47,525
Next time you talk
about Calvin...

1632
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:49,728
Get off the block!

1633
01:11:49,803 --> 01:11:51,100
With me out the game,

1634
01:11:51,171 --> 01:11:53,731
shit got dry up on the streets
reaI quick.

1635
01:11:53,807 --> 01:11:55,900
Watch your fuckin' mouth
next time!

1636
01:11:55,976 --> 01:11:58,706
And Rico
wasn't showin' nobody love.

1637
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,880
Bum-ass fuckin' bullshit.

1638
01:12:08,188 --> 01:12:11,419
Hey, yo, A.,
niggas get shot every day, B.

1639
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:13,220
You be a'ight, nigga.

1640
01:12:13,293 --> 01:12:14,692
You're tough, right?

1641
01:12:17,597 --> 01:12:19,792
I'm out, Rico.
You understand what I'm saying?

1642
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:21,026
Look at me.

1643
01:12:21,101 --> 01:12:24,161
I've been shot in the head,
baby.

1644
01:12:24,237 --> 01:12:25,795
My body different.

1645
01:12:25,872 --> 01:12:27,863
I'm breathing different.

1646
01:12:27,941 --> 01:12:29,340
You understand
what I'm saying?

1647
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:30,899
The doctor said I wasn't
gonna walk the same.

1648
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:33,639
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm out.

1649
01:12:33,713 --> 01:12:36,341
Yo, A., man,
pull your skirt down, B.

1650
01:12:36,416 --> 01:12:38,008
The streets is missing you, yo.

1651
01:12:38,084 --> 01:12:40,575
Come on, man. What you want...
give all this shit up?

1652
01:12:40,654 --> 01:12:42,349
Yo, A., man,
it's like this, man.

1653
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:44,413
We down
on our last bricks, man.

1654
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:46,925
Shit's drying up out there.
You hear me?

1655
01:12:46,993 --> 01:12:49,257
Niggas ain't eatin'
on the streets.

1656
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:51,388
Everybody gettin' antsy
out there, baby.

1657
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:53,625
I know what floats A's boat.

1658
01:12:55,702 --> 01:12:58,364
Remember this, nigga?

1659
01:12:58,438 --> 01:12:59,564
We can go right around
the corner.

1660
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:00,970
Trying pull over to the side
on the street

1661
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,099
like I'm some kind of hoe.

1662
01:13:02,175 --> 01:13:03,107
You got paper.

1663
01:13:03,176 --> 01:13:05,474
Right here.

1664
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:07,137
- What's poppin', Carmen?
- Aah!

1665
01:13:07,213 --> 01:13:08,737
A'ight, nigga?

1666
01:13:08,815 --> 01:13:10,146
You clean now.

1667
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:11,413
Aah!

1668
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:25,890
That motherfucker's gone.
He's not coming back, B.

1669
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:27,331
I laid the murder game down

1670
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,891
letting niggas know
we not fuckin' around, man.

1671
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:31,961
Let's just cool, yo.

1672
01:13:32,038 --> 01:13:34,302
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

1673
01:13:34,374 --> 01:13:36,638
Do you even know
what you're doing, man?

1674
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:39,144
Don't have the fuckin' cops
coming up in here

1675
01:13:39,212 --> 01:13:42,545
looking for me, man, on account
of some shit you did.

1676
01:13:42,615 --> 01:13:43,582
You understand?

1677
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:44,742
Shit is hot.

1678
01:13:44,818 --> 01:13:47,286
Then you need to give up the
connect and let us handle shit.

1679
01:13:47,354 --> 01:13:49,845
Look, man, we know what's hot
on the streets, man.

1680
01:13:49,923 --> 01:13:53,620
Believe me, man.
We out there e'day.

1681
01:13:53,693 --> 01:13:56,526
But, yo, man, we just got to
take it easy, man. That's it.

1682
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:59,326
I mean, it's like what the fuck
are we waiting for, B.?

1683
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:02,732
You know your connects
on the other motherfuckers.

1684
01:14:02,802 --> 01:14:04,633
We wastin' time.

1685
01:14:04,704 --> 01:14:08,470
And there's crack shit
movin' in.

1686
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:12,369
You know what?

1687
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:14,879
You just need
a little more rest, B.

1688
01:14:14,948 --> 01:14:16,939
Cover up.
Get you some soup.

1689
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:18,006
Some tea.

1690
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:19,381
Come on, man.

1691
01:14:19,452 --> 01:14:21,682
You're talking crazy, B.

1692
01:14:21,755 --> 01:14:23,120
Hey, yo, check here your man.

1693
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:26,283
Give him a thermometer, take his
temperature or something, man.

1694
01:14:26,359 --> 01:14:28,793
I'm outta here, Mitch.

1695
01:14:28,862 --> 01:14:30,454
Peace, baby.

1696
01:14:34,401 --> 01:14:38,303
Still got the flash of that gun
in my head, man...

1697
01:14:38,371 --> 01:14:40,236
that white light.

1698
01:14:40,306 --> 01:14:46,245
And it was like that light, man,
was sayin'...

1699
01:14:46,312 --> 01:14:47,472
"You're dead. "

1700
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:49,481
A., you ain't got to be
thinking about that, man.

1701
01:14:49,549 --> 01:14:51,312
You here. You blessed.

1702
01:14:51,384 --> 01:14:53,716
A'ight, baby?
You blessed.

1703
01:14:53,787 --> 01:14:56,381
Seeing that light
for a long time.

1704
01:14:56,456 --> 01:14:57,753
Gettin' this money.

1705
01:14:57,824 --> 01:14:59,815
Trying to stay, you know,

1706
01:14:59,893 --> 01:15:02,623
trying to stay
up out the light,

1707
01:15:02,695 --> 01:15:05,721
up out the spotlight,
the club,

1708
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:07,767
and all that kind of stuff,
man.

1709
01:15:07,834 --> 01:15:09,233
Trying to hide.

1710
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:13,432
Trying to, you know...

1711
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:15,770
But it's all fake.

1712
01:15:15,842 --> 01:15:18,003
Understand what I'm sayin'?

1713
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:19,238
This life...

1714

You told him not to come here!
What is he supposed...

01:17:37,383 --> 01:17:39,442
Look, I know

1764
01:17:39,519 --> 01:17:41,714
Look, did he tell you anything?
Does he know anything?

No, Mitch! Shit!

Where's all the money

Get away.

1773
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:57,696
Look, he's probably on
42nd Street playing video games

1774
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:59,237
or something like that,

1783
01:18:22,061 --> 01:18:22,993
Who? Who?

1784
01:18:23,062 --> 01:18:25,223
Look, they want $500,000 or they
gonna kill him or something.

1785
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:26,560
That's what they said, man.

01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:28,897

01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:36,841

for Sonny's ransom fee.

1791
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:38,934
Yeah, listen,

1792
01:18:39,012 --> 01:18:41,981
You know what I mean?

1793
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:43,447
You know what I'm saying?

1794
01:18:43,516 --> 01:18:46,508
'Cause this ain't for him, A.
This ain't for him, man.

1795
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:47,610

01:22:48,794 --> 01:22:52,628
Fuck.

1842
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:54,529
They found Sonny?

1843
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,569
No. Not Sonny.

1844
01:22:59,338 --> 01:23:01,704
They found Mitch.

1848
01:23:13,019 --> 01:23:15,817

saying that he was gonna meet up
with Rico that night.

1862
01:24:45,945 --> 01:24:48,311
Good lookin', baby,

1872
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,321
It's gonna be business...

1873
01:25:05,398 --> 01:25:06,524
Ugh!

1874
01:25:06,599 --> 01:25:08,533
What the fuck?

1875
01:25:46,072 --> 01:25:48,870
Hey, yo, A.

1876
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:51,000
What up?

1877
01:25:53,045 --> 01:25:55,013
You a'ight, B.?

1878
01:25:55,081 --> 01:25:57,811
No, man. Fucked up.

1879
01:25:57,883 --> 01:26:02,411
You know I'm fucked up
over this shit, too, B.

1880
01:26:02,488 --> 01:26:05,480
I murdered them niggas
who did that shit to Mitch, B.

1881
01:26:05,558 --> 01:26:06,889
I'm trying to find out.

1882
01:26:06,959 --> 01:26:09,120
I haven't found
any of the damn keys

1883
01:26:09,195 --> 01:26:10,719
in that building with Mitch.

1884
01:26:10,796 --> 01:26:11,990
Keys?

1885
01:26:12,064 --> 01:26:14,931
Yeah, I gave Mitch a set of keys
to get Sonny back, man.

1886
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,764
I know he had the fuckin' keys
in there with him, man.

1887
01:26:17,837 --> 01:26:20,635
Now, you know, I got to get
the money or the keys, man,

1888
01:26:20,706 --> 01:26:22,264
to pay this connect back with.

1889
01:26:25,077 --> 01:26:28,376
Hey, yo, B., why you ain't
callin' me on that shit, B.?

1890
01:26:30,783 --> 01:26:32,683
You know I would have went
with that nigga Mitch

1891
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:34,185
and made that shit happen
for you.

1892
01:26:34,253 --> 01:26:36,118
I know, I know, man.
That's on me. I fucked up.

1893
01:26:38,491 --> 01:26:40,425
You talk to Mitch yesterday?

1894
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:43,428
I ain't talked to Mitch
or see that nigga

1895
01:26:43,496 --> 01:26:45,964
the whole goddamn day
yesterday, B.

1896
01:26:51,737 --> 01:26:53,762
What happened to your face,
man?

1897
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:55,363
What?

1898
01:26:55,441 --> 01:26:57,204
I said, "What happened
to your face?"

1899
01:26:59,145 --> 01:27:00,373
This shit?

1900
01:27:00,446 --> 01:27:03,108
I was fuckin' with this
wild-ass bitch last night.

1901
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:04,581
You know how I play, B.

1902
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,811
That's wild, boy.
You a wild motherfucker, man.

1903
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:08,581
- Yeah.
- You videotape that shit?

1904
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,257
You think you know me
and shit, man.

1905
01:27:12,324 --> 01:27:13,916
I ain't tape that shit
last night, B.

1906
01:27:22,635 --> 01:27:26,366
I kept another set of keys,
understand?

1907
01:27:26,438 --> 01:27:29,430
To sell for when the ransom
was paid.

1908
01:27:29,508 --> 01:27:31,442
Now, look,
the way shit is now, man,

1909
01:27:31,510 --> 01:27:33,205
it's too hot
out on the streets

1910
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:34,974
for me to be caught
with myself

1911
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:37,345
trying to go out there
and conduct something.

1912
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,247
I'm gonna need you
to do me this.

1913
01:27:39,318 --> 01:27:41,343
I want you to sell these keys
for me.

1914
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,615
Give me the money,
I can pay it to the connect.

1915
01:27:43,689 --> 01:27:45,281
You know what I'm sayin'?

1916
01:27:45,357 --> 01:27:48,326
Then I take you in there,
introduce you to the connect.

1917
01:27:48,394 --> 01:27:50,555
So you want me to sell
all the keys?

1918
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:53,097
Yeah. It's like this.

1919
01:27:53,165 --> 01:27:56,259
I been talking to these kids
from out of town

1920
01:27:56,335 --> 01:27:59,270
who say, you know,
they'd take these keys...

1921
01:28:00,606 --> 01:28:03,006
Buy them at a higher price
than what's goin'.

1922
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:07,044
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

1923
01:28:07,112 --> 01:28:09,478
So, you know, all you got to do
is sell them.

1924
01:28:09,548 --> 01:28:11,812
Then you take the extra cheese
off the top.

1925
01:28:11,884 --> 01:28:13,613
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

1926
01:28:13,686 --> 01:28:16,120
Then I can walk away.
We all can walk away set.

1927
01:28:16,188 --> 01:28:18,679
And you're cool with that?

1928
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:23,522
I'm cool.
I'm cool with that.

1929
01:28:23,596 --> 01:28:25,894
I don't believe you, A.

1930
01:28:25,965 --> 01:28:29,332
I mean, you gonna give up
all this shit?

1931
01:28:32,438 --> 01:28:34,531
About how much?

1932
01:28:34,607 --> 01:28:36,598
Yeah, nigga.
I said I was going.

1933
01:28:36,675 --> 01:28:38,142
I wanted out.

1934
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:40,804
Oh, no. I'm gonna need more
than that for sure.

1935
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,340
I wasn't playin' when
I said that. You understand?

1936
01:28:45,417 --> 01:28:46,907
What's up, man? A'ight?

1937
01:28:46,986 --> 01:28:48,010
- A'ight.
- Good.

1938
01:28:48,087 --> 01:28:49,714
Let's go up here.
After you.

1939
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,251
You're crazy, B.

1940
01:28:54,326 --> 01:28:56,351
Nigga fucking giving up.

1941
01:28:56,428 --> 01:28:57,759
I love you, B.

1942
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:01,732
Put it down!

1943
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,268
Fucking gonna give up
all this shit, man.

1944
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:08,066
Freeze!
Put your hands up!

1945
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:10,438
- You a'ight?
- No. I'm fucked up, man.

1946
01:29:10,509 --> 01:29:11,737
Drop the bag!

1947
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,072
Drop the bag!

1948
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:16,205
Anything you need,
let me know, man.

1949
01:29:16,282 --> 01:29:18,443
- Down!
- We need an ambulance here.

1950
01:29:18,517 --> 01:29:21,213
You lookin' to play no ball,
baby?

1951
01:29:23,656 --> 01:29:25,715
Yo, A., call me, B.

1952
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:26,985
Call me, B.

1953
01:29:27,059 --> 01:29:28,526
A'ight?

1954
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:45,876
Yeah, I called him.

1955
01:29:46,645 --> 01:29:48,010
And I gave him the number
of fake-ass deals

1956
01:29:48,247 --> 01:29:50,909
who turned out to be the feds.

1957
01:29:52,985 --> 01:29:55,749
See, I knew Rico's greed
would destroy him

1958
01:29:55,821 --> 01:29:57,721
and set me free.

1959
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,955
I'm sure that he would say
I went out like a punk.

1960
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:07,328
But fuck it.

1961
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:08,764
It's a price I could live with.

1962
01:30:08,834 --> 01:30:10,859
I don't like the motherfucker
anyway. I did it.

1963
01:30:10,936 --> 01:30:12,528
But 25 to life...

1964
01:30:12,604 --> 01:30:13,798
I did that.

1965
01:30:13,872 --> 01:30:15,931
Rico can't live with that.

1966
01:30:16,008 --> 01:30:18,033
I ain't snitchin' on nobody
from Harlem, man.

1967
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,271
I'll give you a couple cats
down in D.C.

1968
01:30:20,346 --> 01:30:22,439
doing they thing out of town,
doing they thing,

1969
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:25,244
but, um, I'm not snitchin'
on nobody in Harlem

1970
01:30:25,317 --> 01:30:30,118
'cause when I come home,
I'm still gonna be the king.

1971
01:30:33,192 --> 01:30:36,127
Meanwhile,
Janet sat by the phone,

1972
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:38,060
but no more calls came.

1973
01:30:42,735 --> 01:30:44,999
Mitch had it right about Ice.

1974
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:49,029
His uncle was the one
not looking out for family.

1975
01:30:49,108 --> 01:30:51,269
His bitterness
towards his nephew Mitch

1976
01:30:51,343 --> 01:30:53,607
was taken out
on his other nephew Sonny...

1977
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:55,613
his own blood.

1978
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:57,114
Stand back.

1979
01:30:57,182 --> 01:30:59,878
Tommy did Ice's dirty work.

1980
01:30:59,952 --> 01:31:03,649
When the ransom money
didn't come,

1981
01:31:03,722 --> 01:31:05,383
he killed Sonny.

1982
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,191
The game was over.

1983
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,784
All right,
you know what I'm sayin'?

1984
01:31:09,862 --> 01:31:12,228
# Throw your hands up #

1985
01:31:12,297 --> 01:31:14,663
# Wave 'em around some #

1986
01:31:14,733 --> 01:31:17,133
# Throw your hands up #

1987
01:31:17,202 --> 01:31:19,500
# Wave 'em around, 'round #

1988
01:31:19,571 --> 01:31:21,732
# If you want a million dollars,
put your hands up #

1989
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:24,241
# If you like sex,
put your hands up #

1990
01:31:24,309 --> 01:31:26,573
# And if you want a million
dollars, throw your guns up #

1991
01:31:26,645 --> 01:31:29,239
# And if you like sex,
pull your nuts up #

1992
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:34,749
Now there's a new game.

1993
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,448
Us old players are gone.

1994
01:31:37,523 --> 01:31:40,390
But you can see our story
on music videos

1995
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:43,758
with prop guns
and fake champagne.

1996
01:31:43,829 --> 01:31:46,195
I guess you don't have to be
somebody no more.

1997
01:31:46,265 --> 01:31:49,723
I guess you can just front
like you somebody you ain't.

1998
01:31:53,405 --> 01:31:54,963
I have a family.

1999
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:59,204
Lulu's bag of diamonds made
a down payment on a new life.

2000
01:32:06,185 --> 01:32:08,415
As my man Mitch would say...

2001
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,114
"Life is good. "

2002
01:32:10,189 --> 01:32:12,487
# Put your hands up,
wave them around some #

2003
01:32:12,558 --> 01:32:14,719
Maybe I will be
the George Jefferson

2004
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:16,624
of the neighborhood.

2005
01:32:16,695 --> 01:32:18,959
# Wave them around, 'round #

2006
01:32:22,234 --> 01:32:24,532
I'll get back to you on that.

2007
01:32:24,603 --> 01:32:27,128
Like "What?"
Looking down here like...

2008
01:32:27,206 --> 01:32:30,107
look at the world like
down here like "What?"

2009
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:31,107
Money, money.

2010
01:32:34,913 --> 01:32:36,380
Action!

2011
01:32:36,448 --> 01:32:38,541
# Put your hands up...
in divorce court #

2012
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:51,493
# Mr. Media Multi, stage
and screen, "Fit" Magazine #

2013
01:32:51,563 --> 01:32:53,394
# The radio, cassettes,
and CDs #

2014
01:32:55,634 --> 01:32:56,623
# Put your guns up #

2015
01:32:56,702 --> 01:32:58,397
# You know I don't tease,
don't say "please" #

2016
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:00,734
# If you want a million dollars,
put your hands up #

2017
01:33:00,806 --> 01:33:03,172

2018
01:33:03,242 --> 01:33:05,676
# And if you want a million
dollars, throw your guns up #

2019
01:33:05,744 --> 01:33:08,076
# And if you like sex,
pull your nuts up #

2020
01:33:08,147 --> 01:33:10,877

01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:13,440

01:33:13,519 --> 01:33:15,987

2025
01:33:20,526 --> 01:33:22,926
