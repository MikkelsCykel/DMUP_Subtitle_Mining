1
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,347
<i>I hope everybody's ready
to have a good time tonight.</i>

2
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:59,518
<i>It's 8:00 pm, Saturday,
and It's still a hot one ...</i>

3
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,756
Detail, attention!

4
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,844
Present arms!

5
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:43,080
ID, please. First Sergeant White,
please proceed.

6
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,168
I believe I will. Thank you kindly.

7
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,974
Now I give you a great general,
a great friend ...

8
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:47,603
''Fighting'' Joe Campbell.

9
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,575
At ease.

10
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:12,544
Thank you. My official retirement
isn't until next week.

11
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:18,383
But this here, now,
tonight, with you ...

12
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,180
... is my real retirement. Because
you and I have known fear together.

13
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,434
Shed blood together.
Battled pain and suffering -

14
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:30,145
- and all of their foot soldiers.

15
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:36,527
We know there's no glamour in death,
and that no one ever wins a war.

16
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,863
That knowledge
will bind us together forever.

17
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:45,160
That, and a love for this country
that no bayonet can pierce, -

18
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,080
- no bullet shatter.

19
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,338
To you.

20
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,484
- Sergeant White here.
- Col. Kent, so drop the accent.

21
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,572
The only thing keeping me alive
is that cheesy Southern accent.

22
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,828
- How's my guest detective doing?
- Bill, I love being undercover.

23
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:33,542
I spent the last two weeks sweating
my ass off in that shitty houseboat.

24
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,046
- You got any sort of time frame?
- I'm meeting Billing tonight.

25
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,884
I'll arrest him
when we make the exchange.

26
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:47,848
- Good enough. Watch your back.
- Thank you. I believe I will.

27
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,981
Oh, man ...

28
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,672
- Out of gas?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:26,094
That's why I'm looking at
a flat tyre with a pair of pliers.

30
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,187
- ''Uh-oh, she's a captain.''
- Uh-oh, she's a captain.

31
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,775
This looks like the work
of ten chimpanzees.

32
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,111
The other nine got bored
and went for a beer.

33
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:49,660
- I have a lug wrench, can I try?
- If you don't, I'll drag you over.

34
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,639
- Get the spare.
- Yes, ma'am.

35
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,989
Golly dang. If you like piña coladas
and getting caught in the rain -

36
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,825
- I'll just have to marry you.

37
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:38,876
You'll have to take this in.
The spare's only good for 30 miles.

38
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,589
If a fella got courageous
and wanted to send you -

39
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:48,385
- a ''thank you'' notion or a basket
of fruit, where might one find you?

40
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,722
- Psy Ops.
- How's that?

41
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,976
Psychological Operations.
I teach there.

42
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,313
What do you teach?

43
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,400
Mostly we fuck with people's minds.

44
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,200
Damn ...

45
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,054
There you go.
Genuine and made in the USA.

46
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:38,101
Give Dalbert and me 100,000 each
and you'll see the guns on Sunday.

47
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,355
You get paid when I get the guns.

48
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:47,819
Listen to me, funny boy. How do
I know you're not an army cop?

49
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:53,116
- I'm a freedom fighter.
- Well, check it out, Dalbert.

50
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:58,121
We got ourselves
Che Fucking Guevara there.

51
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,123
A freedom fighter!

52
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:07,631
Where's your kooky red hat, boy?
All freedom fighters got them hats.

53
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:15,430
- Listen to me, stupid ...
- Dalbert, I think it's Freudian ...

54
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:23,772
- Dalbert, you wanna hear a joke?
- No.

55
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:27,943
How many freedom fighters does
it take to screw in a light bulb?

56
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,405
- I don't know.
- Come on, relax.

57
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,993
He don't sound like
no criminal investigator to me.

58
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,455
You're all right, pal.
I'm sorry about that.

59
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,835
We get a little jumpy
before an exchange.

60
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,754
We'll see you Sunday.

61
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,883
- I'll be there.
- Yeah, you be there.

62
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:58,515
Unclench your ass cheeks, Dalbert,
the scary part is over.

63
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:36,678
You need your oil changed?

64
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:42,518
No. This is a token
of my appreciation.

65
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,402
- These are strange chocolates.
- They're bath products.

66
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,030
- Bath products.
- Bath products?

67
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:03,038
- Should I take a hint?
- No. Everybody likes bath products.

68
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,792
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

69
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,214
- Tell me what you like about them.
- I like the pink soaps ...

70
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:18,804
I like the skin softener, and l
particularly like the bath beads.

71
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:25,477
Sometimes I fill the tub with
skin softeners and bath beads.

72
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:32,025
I light a few candles, put on some
Coltrane and soak my troubles away.

73
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:38,407
Very good, First Sergeant. I levied
an accusation of sexism at you -

74
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,369
- and you took it three times
around the dance floor.

75
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:46,623
Not really. I just dig bath beads.

76
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,377
Well, thank you.
Maybe I'll see you around.

77
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:56,216
- Am I being dismissed?
- Do you mind? I have a ton of work.

78
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,430
No.
I just came by to give you that.

79
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:06,226
Thank you. That was sweet.
How's the tyre?

80
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:11,982
- Still rolling, ma'am.
- I'm glad.

81
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,905
- Well, goodbye, First Sergeant.
- Goodbye, Captain.

82
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:08,914
<i>Gen. Campbell is being considered
for the vice-presidency.</i>

83
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:14,419
<i>Sources say presidential candidate
Bill Post is poised to select him -</i>

84
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:19,424
<i>- as his running mate. Earlier this
year, Campbell spoke at West Point.</i>

85
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:23,929
<i>Meant as a non-partisan appearance,
lt played like a stump speech.</i>

86
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:28,600
<i>Leading this country,
that is your destiny.</i>

87
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,581
Get way over to that car.

88
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:29,174
Take it into the door.

89
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,144
Backing out.

90
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,235
- Snagged.
- On what?

91
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,114
I don't know.
Let's take a look.

92
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,385
Phone call for Paul Brenner.

93
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:16,305
- What did you say your name is?
- Frank White.

94
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,142
- You military?
- I'm a sergeant at the armoury.

95
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:26,940
- CID Agent Brenner!
- Suddenly he's blasting away.

96
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,945
You military boys got stories more
full of holes than a target range.

97
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:36,742
Sorry, Pop. It's Col. Kent.
Is there a Brenner here?

98
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,953
- I'm Brenner.
- I thought you was White.

99
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,499
I'm both.
Skunked you, Chief Yardley.

100
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,504
Hey, Bill. No, it's over.
Billing's dead.

101
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,008
All right, I'll see you there.

102
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:58,430
Hold on, soldier boy.
Tell me about this Mr Billing.

103
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:04,061
Soldier boy?
Okay, Chiefy, if you have to know.

104
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,898
I was planning to arrest him
in the morning.

105
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:12,611
But I guess he got wind
I was with the CID. See you.

106
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,581
- Good morning, sir. Where to?
- Urban Warfare site.

107
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,586
- You have business there?
- Yes, I do.

108
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,189
- Hey, Bill.
- Hello, Paul.

109
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:55,779
What have we got here?

110
00:19:55,988 --> 00:20:02,327
Tortured, raped and murdered.

111
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:12,880
- Who found the body?
- A bomb squad crew doing exercises.

112
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,008
First on the scene
was a PFC Robbins.

113
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:20,470
- Is he a suspect?
- She, so I sincerely doubt it.

114
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,312
Six of my boys are securing
the scene. Nothing's been touched.

115
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,789
Oh, no ...

116
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,506
- What is it?
- I met her the other day.

117
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,928
Damn ...
What a shame.

118
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:04,264
Lovely lady.

119
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:11,355
All right, let's see.
We got some rigor here.

120
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:18,445
Petechial haemorrhaging,
which is consistent with asphyxia.

121
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,199
Strangulation, you think?

122
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,161
I'm assuming that,
but there's no tear in the panties -

123
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,332
- and no obvious sign of semen.

124
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,626
- Is that hers?
- Yeah.

125
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,181
- Why is she here?
- HQ called her.

126
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:52,145
- Rape counsellor. Sarah Sunhill.
- The victim can't use counselling.

127
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:57,234
She's also a rape investigator.
She was on her way to an assignment.

128
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,196
- She agreed to stay on for this.
- Aren't we lucky?

129
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:11,415
Get Forensics, talk to Cal Seaver.
Get a 50-yard grid around the body.

130
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:16,420
Make resin casts of the boot prints.
Let's see who was here, and when.

131
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:21,133
We also need Capt. Campbell's
personal and medical records.

132
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:25,721
- I already did that.
- Thank you.

133
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:31,143
- Sarah Sunhill, Paul Brenner.
- And book Sgt. Dalbert Elkins.

134
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,354
He's the one
who started the arms deal.

135
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:40,194
She walked barefoot from here
to where she died.

136
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,156
There's smudge marks on her heels
and the asphalt. Where did she live?

137
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:48,327
- Where's Victory Gardens?
- Off-post.

138
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:52,831
- I have to go there.
- I'll have the chief meet us there.

139
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,251
I don't want to work with Yardley.

140
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,841
You can't search a civilian house
without a civilian search warrant.

141
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,803
You need civilian authority.

142
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:12,935
- We protect Brenner from himself.
- Does she have family here?

143
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,897
- Of course.
- I suggest you notify them.

144
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:27,741
- You're kidding, right?
- Kidding about what?

145
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:33,914
It's Elisabeth Campbell.
She's his kid.

146
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:37,334
- I thought you knew.
- No, I didn't.

147
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,713
The general's daughter.

148
00:23:56,228 --> 00:24:00,399
- What are you doing?
- I feel queasy.

149
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,778
- Well, hop on, I'll burp you.
- Drive the car, Paul.

150
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:10,617
- I thought you were queasy.
- Drive the car, Paul.

151
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:21,044
- I don't want this to be awkward.
- Why would it be awkward?

152
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,630
- You're pouting.
- This is not pouting.

153
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:29,261
- Okay, sulky petulance, then.
- Wrong again.

154
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:34,892
I'm just thinking about Brussels.
We'll always have Brussels.

155
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,437
- Where?
- The capital of Belgium.

156
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,565
Why?

157
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:46,987
Why is it the capital,
or why will we always have it?

158
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:51,492
Why was she murdered?

159
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,748
Profit, revenge, jealousy,
conceal a crime, avoid disgrace -

160
00:24:57,956 --> 00:25:01,084
- or homicidal mania.
Right there in the manual.

161
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,112
Oh, boy ...

162
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,705
Hello,
we're here to see the general.

163
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:43,293
I'm Capt. Elby, the general's aide.

164
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:47,881
Col. Fowler, the general's adjutant,
will take you in. Please wait here.

165
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,428
- He's cute.
- Oh, please ...

166
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,974
He probably practises his salute
in the mirror ...

167
00:25:57,182 --> 00:26:01,645
Please, come in,
and thank you for coming.

168
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:14,283
General,
the ClD investigators are here.

169
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:18,954
Warrant Officers
Paul Brenner and Sarah Sunhill.

170
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:24,293
- Our deepest condolences.
- Very sorry for your loss, sir.

171
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,755
Thank you.
Please, be seated.

172
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:41,476
First, I want you to know
you have my full co-operation -

173
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:45,230
- and the co-operation
of everyone on this base.

174
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:50,235
- You understand the time element?
- Time element? No, sir.

175
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:54,406
After 36 hours, the FBI will send in
a task force to investigate.

176
00:26:54,615 --> 00:27:00,245
The general can keep a lid on it
through tomorrow.

177
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:06,210
Once the FBI moves in, the media
will be all over. My daughters ...

178
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:13,800
They'll turn Capt. Campbell's death
into a goddam circus.

179
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,640
- We'll do everything we can, sir.
- I'm sure you will.

180
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:27,064
Let me be blunt. You'll have to
decide on this one, Paul.

181
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:30,275
Are you a soldier or a policeman?

182
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:36,532
- I'm a soldier, sir.
- I'm counting on it.

183
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:46,041
- Sir, I met your daughter.
- Really? When was that?

184
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,381
It was just a coincidence.
She helped me change a tyre.

185
00:27:54,049 --> 00:28:00,097
She could do almost anything.
Her mother was the same way.

186
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,767
Fix a tyre,
bake a hell of a Key Lime pie.

187
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:07,813
Speak five languages.
Extraordinary woman.

188
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,692
Two extraordinary women.

189
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,240
Goddam waste.

190
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:28,792
If there's anything else
we can do for you at this time ...

191
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,129
Just ...

192
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:39,303
- Just find the son of a bitch.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,436
Sir ...

194
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:53,901
When I enlisted I was under-age.
They sent me straight to Vietnam.

195
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:58,405
You were my commander.
You were a captain.

196
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:02,159
And I was so scared.

197
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:07,789
One day, when I was on watch,
you came by and you saw the fear.

198
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:12,794
You said, ''Where are you from?''
I said, ''Boston.''

199
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:16,965
You said, ''Did you know that
last night Boston won -

200
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:22,888
- against St Louis
in the sixth game of the series?''

201
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:30,604
I knew then
that I was going to get through it.

202
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:37,277
- Boston lost that series.
- Yes, but I made it home.

203
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:44,576
We'll find the son of a bitch, sir.

204
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,591
Mr Brenner ...

205
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,682
I understand
you have special arrest powers, -

206
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,646
- but I'd like you to notify me
before you arrest anyone.

207
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:14,815
Why is that, sir?

208
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:21,071
We don't like our personnel arrested
by outsiders without our knowing.

209
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,991
There are three ways
of doing things:

210
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:28,996
The right way, the wrong way
and the army way.

211
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:34,543
See that, in doing it your way,
you don't forget about the army way.

212
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:03,947
<i>Our job at Psy Ops is to blunt
the enemy's will to fight.</i>

213
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:08,410
<i>You must know
the hablts of the enemy, -</i>

214
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,955
<i>-the anxieties and fears,
to determine vulnerability.</i>

215
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:16,251
<i>To engage the enemy,
you must know him inside out.</i>

216
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,256
<i>You must fill him wlth fear.
And not just fear of dying.</i>

217
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:25,010
<i>Fear of grotesque wounds
is more terrifying.</i>

218
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,138
''Grotesque wounds''.

219
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,767
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

220
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:38,982
Might I ask what you are doing
in Capt. Campbell's office?

221
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:45,531
- That depends on who you are.
- Colonel Robert Moore.

222
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:50,661
Capt. Campbell's commanding officer.
And you are ..?

223
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:56,708
Criminal lnvestigation Division.
Sunhill and Brenner.

224
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:04,216
- And you're investigating ..?
- The murder of Capt. Campbell.

225
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:11,181
And now that we know who you are,
we'll need to speak to you, Colonel.

226
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:17,020
I just have ...
I have a meeting.

227
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:21,525
We can file Col. Moore
under ''last to know''.

228
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:30,784
- Are you married?
- None of your business.

229
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,211
She wasn't a hypochondriac,
she didn't dye her hair -

230
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,090
- and she keeps her method
of birth control somewhere else.

231
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,427
Or she required her men
to wear condoms.

232
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:53,015
Haven't you heard they're
in fashion again because of disease?

233
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:57,895
Nowadays you have to boil people
before you sleep with them.

234
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:06,153
My ... This was one
squared-away soldier.

235
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:12,284
Equally prepared for a military ball
or the next war in the jungle.

236
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:21,043
<i>Liz, hi. Pick up, It's Robert.</i>

237
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:25,631
<i>I haven't heard from you,
so call me, please.</i>

238
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,384
Robert.
Surprise, surprise ...

239
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:45,984
Paul.

240
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:49,738
Move aside. Man with a gun.

241
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:27,359
There's nothing here. Let's go.

242
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:54,595
There's a false wall.

243
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:22,206
This is it.

244
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,170
Oh, God ...

245
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,313
What have we got here?

246
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:51,318
Ten bucks says these are not
the lost ''Honeymooners'' episodes.

247
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:52,212
Well, how she died does appear
to be linked to how she lived.

248
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:59,178
We need to hold on to these tapes
until we need them.

249
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,514
We send this all to the ClD lab -

250
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:06,810
- and take our chances
with the local police.

251
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:12,733
- Is this Paul Brenner speaking?
- Career army officer, not the cop.

252
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:17,946
- Her killer might be on that tape.
- This evidence can ruin lives.

253
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,492
lncluding the general's.

254
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:28,373
We take the tapes, use them when we
need them, let ClD do theirjob -

255
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:32,961
- and keep all non-military
out of this. Okay?

256
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:40,052
Okay.
I'll call Kent.

257
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:45,265
- All right. Here.
- Thanks.

258
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,121
The phone's down.
I'll use the cell in the car.

259
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:50,956
Paul? Paul!

260
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:06,180
- Did you make out a face?
- Flat, steel, used to clear snow.

261
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:08,682
Come on!

262
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:12,436
Did you marry that guy
you were seeing on the side?

263
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:17,232
- This isn't exactly the time ...
- Humour me. I'm near concussed.

264
00:39:17,566 --> 00:39:22,654
- Did you or did you not marry him?
- I was seeing you on the side.

265
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:27,242
Fine ...
So how is the boy major?

266
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:33,415
He was annoyed when I saw him
in Brussels with a gun in his hand.

267
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,878
Make a hole!

268
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:46,345
ldentification, please.

269
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:52,601
- You're working on the murder case?
- Yes, and this is my father.

270
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:19,169
- What happened to you?
- I went off-post without authority.

271
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:22,297
- Per your request.
- Is this her entire record file?

272
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:27,636
- That's it. Come up with anything?
- Just a preliminary suspect list.

273
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:30,848
- Already? Who?
- Everyone.

274
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:35,143
- You ought to start getting alibis.
- Okay, how about you?

275
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:39,606
Home in bed when the tower called.
Where were you last night?

276
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,237
- I was busy killing someone else.
- A likely story. And you?

277
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:53,579
I worked on my report until midnight
and then I went home.

278
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,290
- No witnesses.
- Pathetic, the both of you.

279
00:40:56,498 --> 00:41:00,043
If you'd invited me up to your room,
we'd have an alibi.

280
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:04,214
I would rather be a murder suspect.

281
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:09,219
- Don't encourage her.
- By the way, Cal Seavers here.

282
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:14,558
Don't say anything about his hair.
He doesn't have any.

283
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:21,023
- Cal, shouldn't you wear a hat?
- What the hell happened to you?

284
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:26,111
Not everybody loves me as much
as you do. This is Sarah Sunhill.

285
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,491
The entire world walked around
this body. There's 50 boot prints.

286
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:35,913
- Have you found the clothes yet?
- No. I found us an empty hangar.

287
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:40,000
- Good. Have everything taken there.
- Any trace of semen?

288
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:46,757
I can't find any. The coroner will
run vaginal, oral and anal swabs.

289
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:51,970
- It is a strange rape.
- Why do you say that?

290
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:57,392
Our guy wasn't just a rapist,
he was a premeditated killer.

291
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:02,814
He set up a rape kit, tent pegs
and rope, and he used it.

292
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,360
There are no signs of a struggle.

293
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:10,656
She was strong, but there's
no dirt under her fingernails.

294
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:16,578
And how did he hold a gun and tie
the ropes? Unless he wasn't alone.

295
00:42:16,912 --> 00:42:20,249
What are those marks on her cheeks?

296
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:27,756
Those were tears. The panties under
the rope to protect her neck ...

297
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:31,802
What's a little rope burn
if you're going to kill somebody?

298
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:36,807
- Sunhill's good.
- Oh, yeah. Sunhill has spoken.

299
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:46,585
- Could you see the body from here?
- No, but I saw the headlights.

300
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:50,631
- The headlights?
- I hated that it was her.

301
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:55,636
- You knew her, then?
- No, but ...

302
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:01,266
Capt. Campbell was real good
to female enlisted.

303
00:44:02,017 --> 00:44:07,314
- How so?
- She organised meetings for us ...

304
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:14,404
There's a lot of shit,
if you're a woman in the army, -

305
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:20,035
- that you got to put up with. Some
people don't like that we're here.

306
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:25,249
But Capt. Campbell encouraged us ...

307
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:29,962
- I'm sorry.
- You're allowed to cry.

308
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:36,301
Didn't you think the headlights were
someone coming home or something?

309
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,847
Sometimes
people go out there to fuck.

310
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:45,686
Pardon my French.

311
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:49,857
But that's what I thought
the first time.

312
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,819
The first time I saw the headlights
was at 03:00.

313
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:58,198
They went away,
then they came back at 03:30.

314
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:03,120
Then they went away again
and came back at 04:00.

315
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,748
Thank you.

316
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:16,341
What's going on, Bill?
What are you doing here, Yardley?

317
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:21,555
- You got a lot of explaining to do.
- What is your official business?

318
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:28,645
My official business here is to ask
why MPs are hauling furniture -

319
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:32,191
- out of an off-post residence
belonging to a murder victim.

320
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:38,864
The family of the deceased asked me
to transport those items here.

321
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:44,703
Remind me to call Gen. Campbell and
suggest that I transport the items.

322
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:49,082
- Jesus, Paul ...
- You know what you need, Chief?

323
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,587
A pair of mirrored sunglasses
for you and the little one.

324
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:55,881
That would really
complete the picture.

325
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:06,600
So, did you ever marry
Major What's-his-name with the gun?

326
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,228
Yes, I did.

327
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:15,776
Congratulations. I'm very happy
for you and wish you both the best.

328
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:19,238
- I filed for divorce.
- Good.

329
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:34,127
Thank you.
Two club sodas, please.

330
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:50,602
- You should see her records.
- There's your new boyfriend.

331
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:55,607
Valedictorian in high school. Super
athlete. West Point, like her dad.

332
00:46:55,816 --> 00:47:00,112
There's a guy who knows
how to have a good time.

333
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,532
Paul, look at me.

334
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:09,496
I think something happened there.
She went to shit her sophomore year.

335
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:11,790
She barely got through school.

336
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:17,087
She got a degree,
but she was never quite the same.

337
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:27,931
- I thought you hated these places.
- Yes, but the murderer may be here.

338
00:47:28,265 --> 00:47:32,519
Sitting all smug and shiny,
until we walked in.

339
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:36,482
Now, maybe he's a little less smug
and a little less shiny.

340
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:40,152
And that's pretty cool.
Don't you think?

341
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:48,577
And you? I hope Brussels wasn't
the last time you had a woman.

342
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:53,999
You avoided a confrontation with
my fiancé, like I wasn't worth it.

343
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:58,295
He threatened to kill me. Discretion
is the better part of valour.

344
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:02,132
- Weren't you decorated for valour?
- Oh, please ...

345
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:07,262
Sometimes you have to fight for
what you want ... if you want it.

346
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:13,519
I was decorated for charging up
a hill that I didn't need or want.

347
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:17,147
Besides, I don't remember getting
any encouragement from you.

348
00:48:17,356 --> 00:48:21,735
Maybe I wanted you
to take me away from him.

349
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:26,323
That's telepathy, not communication.
Let's talk about this next week.

350
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:29,868
- Just one more thing.
- Is this next week?

351
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:36,333
You're such a sharp detective, but
you don't know a thing about women.

352
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:44,883
You know, you're very cute
when I'm mad at you.

353
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:51,682
However, if you'll excuse me, I'll
take my anger out on someone else.

354
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:13,996
- Ridiculous behaviour earlier.
- We didn't let you see it coming.

355
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:17,332
Liz was my protégée.
At least, I like to think she was.

356
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:20,544
We were very close.

357
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:24,840
- Please, sit down.
- You worked together regularly?

358
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:31,388
- Absolutely.
- Did you play together?

359
00:49:32,764 --> 00:49:35,350
What a truly excellent question.

360
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,355
That's one of the things
we teach here at Psy Ops.

361
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:44,860
Threatening quietly. Think of the
echoes inherent in those four words.

362
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:49,031
''Did you play together? ''

363
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:52,868
Did you go out with her?
Did you fuck her?

364
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:57,581
Did you love her? If you did, did
you love her enough to murder her?

365
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,627
I meant, did you play
golf or tennis or something?

366
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:05,714
- No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

367
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:10,594
Now we both know we're smart guys.
Do you think I'm involved in this?

368
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:15,807
- One way or another, yes, I do.
- I happen to know a good attorney.

369
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:20,604
Two problems: First, the obvious.
There are no good ones.

370
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:24,691
Second, you're not a civilian.

371
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,737
You have no right to an attorney.
You have no right to remain silent.

372
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:32,282
If you don't co-operate,
I'll put you in jail.

373
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:36,870
- You see what you're doing here?
- Looking for answers.

374
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,373
But how?

375
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,669
You're trying to make me like you.

376
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:48,048
And you know what?
It's working. I do.

377
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:55,013
Do you see what I'm trying to do?
I'm trying to make you like me, too.

378
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:58,684
- Do you like me yet?
- Why did you strangle her?

379
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:02,855
Wrong, sorry.
Not up to your standards.

380
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:07,860
- Did you go to college?
- What do you think?

381
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:16,076
- I think you did not.
- Did I make a mistake in grammar?

382
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:21,081
Even if you had, I wouldn't be
rude enough to point it out.

383
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:26,086
You have this chip on your shoulder.

384
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:31,008
A big one. Makes you good
at yourjob, though, I imagine.

385
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:35,679
Holds you in good stead when you see
those commissioned officers -

386
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:40,684
- just waiting for you,
the scoundrel in the rumpled suit, -

387
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,729
- to bring them down. Am I right?

388
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:47,691
No, I'm just here to kick ass.
Sleep till noon.

389
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,031
And you cover your inadequacies
by condescending to the more robust.

390
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,284
- How am I doing?
- Not bad. Robust, even.

391
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:02,372
- When did the event transpire?
- 04:00, we think.

392
00:52:02,581 --> 00:52:07,377
- My segueway back to the case.
- Subtle. Where were you?

393
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:12,508
- Snug in bed.
- With the wife, girlfriend, hooker?

394
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:18,222
I'm divorced. I have no girlfriend,
I live alone and don't use hookers.

395
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,809
I actually have
absolutely no alibi whatsoever.

396
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:28,565
- Does that make me a killer?
- It makes you lonely and unpopular.

397
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:33,362
Very good.
Condescending and clever.

398
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:36,156
No, thank you.

399
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:42,120
You called her machine. You were
concerned. Jealousy, perhaps?

400
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,414
Perhaps not.

401
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:52,339
Liz was my friend. I hadn't
heard from her in a couple days ...

402
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:55,968
Was she involved with anyone?

403
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:59,096
You mean sexually?

404
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:04,017
She was seeing a civilian.
A fellow named Yardley.

405
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:08,814
Police Chief Yardley?

406
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:11,400
No ... No.

407
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:16,613
The son. His deputy. Wes.

408
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,116
Wes. Okay.

409
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:22,661
They'd been seeing each other
off and on.

410
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:28,709
It's obvious you were very close
to her. What does ''very'' mean?

411
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:32,379
It means ... very.

412
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:39,052
I was Liz' mentor.
There was a trust.

413
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:42,472
She was a passionate young woman, -

414
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:48,937
- but had I ever
taken advantage of that -

415
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:53,942
- I would have lost the trust.
Did I kill her? Of course not.

416
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:59,990
Did I love her?
I loved her very much.

417
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:06,580
Make of that what you will.

418
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:29,728
- This is what made him famous?
- Yeah, the Ledgeworth City riots.

419
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:34,191
The whole city was in chaos.
The general quelled it.

420
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:39,321
Then he brought in his own daughter
to prove it was safe.

421
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,406
She looks terrified.

422
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:52,751
- Excellent work.
- I'm heading down to the morgue.

423
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:57,756
- The report should be in. Coming?
- I have to talk to Cal first.

424
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:04,555
- So how's Moore?
- Complicated.

425
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:10,686
Cal, we got the dog tag report.
The prints belong to someone else.

426
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:15,816
- Who's that?
- Robert Moore.

427
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,622
Smells good.

428
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:41,133
- What are you doing here?
- I came to ask a question, Bobby.

429
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:44,261
And the question is?

430
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:51,894
Why were you so stupid as to
leave your fingerprints everywhere?

431
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:57,191
- You panicked.
- I teach panic, remember?

432
00:55:57,399 --> 00:56:02,404
Obviously I didn't plan for things
to work out this way. Paul ...

433
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:08,869
I so enjoy it when you take
the liberty of calling me Bobby.

434
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:11,705
We're still trying
to outsmart each other.

435
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:17,628
Obviously, I cannot tell a lie and
say I know nothing about all this.

436
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:24,635
I also, sadly,
cannot tell the truth.

437
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,554
Silence won't save your ass.

438
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:31,600
My ass is already in a sling,
is it not?

439
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,270
You mean the sex tapes?

440
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:48,200
You're good.
You're good ...

441
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:52,871
Great question.
Almost any answer incriminates me.

442
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:58,836
So let's cut the bullshit. We both
know I'm pretty much destroyed.

443
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:03,715
Can you think of any reason why
Liz should be destroyed with me?

444
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:08,929
Can you? I can't, Paul.

445
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:17,896
I watched the two of you
on one of her tapes.

446
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:27,072
I don't think so. Bluffing is the
last desperate act of the weak.

447
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:31,994
I'll not help you ruin that girl.
She's suffered enough. Leave it.

448
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:35,831
I'm all you've got.

449
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:41,378
- Wrong again. Hello, Captain.
- Hello.

450
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:45,424
Capt. Goodson is my lawyer.

451
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:49,720
- What you want to say to him ...
- ... I'll say to him.

452
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:55,851
- You can't bully my client.
- You're under arrest, Bobby.

453
00:57:56,059 --> 00:58:01,190
Conduct unbecoming an officer,
accessory after the fact, -

454
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,193
- conspiracy,
making false statements.

455
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:10,365
And you're close to non-compliance
with procedural rules.

456
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:20,667
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Just taking another look.

457
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:43,816
Was the bag
with the victim's clothes -

458
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:49,029
- going to be picked up
by her killer or by a third party?

459
00:58:49,238 --> 00:58:56,328
<i>- Five Charlie, do you copy?
- This is Five Charlie.</i>

460
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:10,092
Maybe she was here
for a secret rendezvous.

461
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,136
A tryst.

462
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:17,391
Maybe the rape fantasy
was part of the thrill.

463
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:22,604
We all know she had a predilection
for the gamier side of sex.

464
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:30,445
Did she pick a public place because
it presented an element of..?

465
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:51,717
Hold that bitch down!
Let me get in there.

466
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:58,807
This is the army, so tell Brenner
you don't shit on your brothers.

467
00:59:59,016 --> 01:00:04,104
Rape investigator, huh?
Want to know what it feels like?

468
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:09,318
Maybe it'll make you better
at yourjob.

469
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,928
Number five.

470
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:41,767
- Got yourself a colonel this time?
- Shut up, Elkins.

471
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:49,149
You were acting as her shrink,
were you not?

472
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,405
The Elisabeth I met
was not the woman on the tape.

473
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:59,076
There's a direct connection,
isn't there?

474
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:05,415
Are you going to pull
my fingernails out now?

475
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:24,601
What happened sophomore year
at the Point?

476
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:38,574
Murder or accessory to murder!
Either way, you get burned.

477
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:42,244
Nobody's going to bail you out.

478
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:45,372
It was awful.

479
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:53,380
It was awful. Go ahead.

480
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:59,761
- She cheated, she lied, what?
- Worse.

481
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,973
- Drugs.
- Worse.

482
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:05,392
Rape.

483
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:17,279
- Worse.
- What's worse than rape?

484
01:02:18,322 --> 01:02:23,744
When you find that out,
you'll know everything.

485
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:53,440
Tell me
what the hell happened, Bill.

486
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:57,528
The MP says he was ordered to leave
his post. No record of the call.

487
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:02,115
- I'm going to take it further.
- I'm pulling up, talk to me later.

488
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:07,204
- She's fine.
- Who did it?

489
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:25,889
Stupid, Elby. Take off identifying
jewellery before an attack.

490
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:30,769
What are you talking about?
I was in the ''O'' club all night.

491
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:33,689
She's crazy, and you're crazy.

492
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:40,279
Sorry about that. You just can't
get good Styrofoam these days.

493
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:46,410
Let's change the subject. What can
you tell me about Capt. Campbell?

494
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:51,832
She was raped and killed.
You know what rape usually is?

495
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,502
It's a woman
who changes her mind afterward.

496
01:03:57,462 --> 01:04:02,050
Would you classify your relationship
with her as an intimate one?

497
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:06,138
- You mean, was I fucking her?
- Yeah, that is what I mean.

498
01:04:06,346 --> 01:04:09,766
Yeah, I was.

499
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:14,354
I only took it for sport fucking.
I didn't think she'd tell him.

500
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:19,776
The bitch told the general. She's
a freak, and that's what freaks do.

501
01:04:19,985 --> 01:04:25,824
- Were the general and her close?
- No. You like your dad?

502
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:29,369
He was a drunk and a gambler.
I worshipped him.

503
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:32,414
I think I've said enough.

504
01:04:34,082 --> 01:04:38,462
Co-operate, and maybe
we'll keep it out of the report.

505
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:46,261
With Elisabeth gone, the general has
a clear field to settle some scores.

506
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:52,518
And I'll be given
the opportunity to resign.

507
01:04:52,726 --> 01:04:54,937
Maybe I can save my marriage.

508
01:04:55,145 --> 01:05:00,442
Great, a Mrs Elby. What does she do,
aside from waking up and screaming?

509
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:04,613
- What do you mean, settle scores?
- I am done talking to you!

510
01:05:04,822 --> 01:05:10,452
We just got started. I'll charge you
for the assault on Agent Sunhill.

511
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,789
See how you like 40 years
of sport fucking in prison.

512
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:19,962
Okay, dare me.

513
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:24,550
Go ahead, motherfucker, dare me.
I'm going to ask you one more time.

514
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:29,429
- What do you mean, settle scores?
- Okay, okay ...

515
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:40,816
When she was alive -

516
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:46,864
- he couldn't touch her
without embarrassing himself.

517
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:50,492
He couldn't touch any of us -

518
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:54,580
- because he knew
she would spill all.

519
01:05:54,788 --> 01:06:02,713
How would it look? The general's
daughter, banging his whole staff.

520
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:08,844
- Everybody. At least, most of them.
- What about the sheriff's son?

521
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:11,889
No, that was just for show.

522
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:18,145
She pulled a military train that
went through the general's staff, -

523
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:21,899
- the Judge Advocate,
and people like me in key positions.

524
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:24,485
What about Col. Fowler?

525
01:06:24,693 --> 01:06:29,072
He once told me
he knew all about this.

526
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:34,077
And that I was part of the problem.
I think he meant that he wasn't.

527
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:38,457
- What do you think about this?
- I think it's insane.

528
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:42,419
Elisabeth once told me -

529
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:47,633
- she was conducting a field
experiment in psychological warfare.

530
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:51,303
And that the enemy was Daddy.

531
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:58,894
- You okay?
- I've been better.

532
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:04,733
I know. Most of them are married,
it's grounds for court martial ...

533
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:09,530
Their lives are over. But it's
a hell of a motive for murder.

534
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:14,743
- Our suspect list is multiplying.
- Now we know who's on the tapes.

535
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:20,582
Yeah, a bunch of creeps
risking it all for a piece of patch.

536
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:26,004
Sorry, I get back on the base and it
dredges up my alpha male behaviour.

537
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:33,095
- What's next, lighting your farts?
- Maybe, after we see more.

538
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:39,143
Where is he?

539
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:43,230
- Bill, where's Moore?
- He was released.

540
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:47,067
- Restricted to quarters.
- On whose orders?

541
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:53,657
Mine. It looked like he was having
a coronary. His lawyer complained.

542
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:58,954
He's a murder suspect!
His prints were all over the tags.

543
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:05,961
You never informed us. He was held
for conduct unbecoming, not murder.

544
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:07,629
I had no choice.

545
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:49,129
Moore?

546
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:26,041
I'm going in.

547
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:20,345
Oh, my God.

548
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:54,546
The organics on Elisabeth Campbell
came back. There's no sign of rape.

549
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:58,217
- What are your thoughts on this?
- Apparent suicide.

550
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:01,845
Close contact wound ...
and I don't buy it.

551
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:05,724
I'll check his hands
for gunpowder residue.

552
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:10,938
I'll let you know
if I find any inconsistencies.

553
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,775
Col. Kent!

554
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:23,951
Were you aware of Capt. Campbell's
extracurricular activities?

555
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:28,956
- How do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

556
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:40,008
There were rumours, innuendo.
I always took it as false bravado.

557
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:43,679
Soldiers bragging,
and that sort of thing.

558
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:47,641
There was more to it than that.

559
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,144
Mr Brenner.

560
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:57,317
We'll meet with the general about
releasing the official findings.

561
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:02,322
- What are you talking about?
- Moore was overwhelmed with guilt.

562
01:12:02,656 --> 01:12:09,204
We need to close up shop. We'll give
a statement about Moore's suicide.

563
01:12:09,955 --> 01:12:16,503
You don't understand. This is my
investigation, and it's still open.

564
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:22,342
Who the hell do you think you are?
It's over. Over!

565
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:27,973
- You'd better think of your career.
- You'd better think of yours.

566
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:35,189
You're running a lunatic base here.
You want to mess with me, Colonel?

567
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:39,443
Let's start gauging away.

568
01:12:44,573 --> 01:12:47,993
You've been warned.

569
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,251
Move out.

570
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:01,673
What are you doing here, Yardley?

571
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:05,928
Shouldn't you be out
night-sticking the coloured folk?

572
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,681
Wait in the car,
I want to talk to him.

573
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:13,852
Your son Wes,
we've got to speak to him.

574
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:19,274
He was involved with the victim,
but you neglected to mention it.

575
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:22,402
He was on duty when it happened.

576
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:25,656
We got tapes of his radio calls.

577
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,744
Just the same,
we'll be in touch.

578
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:35,040
- Good night.
- Asshole.

579
01:13:44,216 --> 01:13:49,304
- What is that?
- The gods have smiled on you.

580
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:55,561
It's a West Point psych report
and pages from her medical file.

581
01:13:55,769 --> 01:13:59,648
- What does it say?
- It says we're going to West Point.

582
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:13,912
Yes?

583
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:18,500
- Brenner and Sunhill, sir.
- Come in.

584
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:22,880
And talk loud.
Terrible thing for a shrink to lose.

585
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:27,259
Can't hear my patients half
the time. Considering my patients, -

586
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,970
- maybe it's a blessing.

587
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:34,349
Col. Slesinger ... Do you prefer
being called Colonel or Doctor?

588
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:39,271
I prefer Donald. And I'm assuming
you didn't fly here to bullshit.

589
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,608
No, sir.
It's what I told you on the phone.

590
01:14:42,816 --> 01:14:48,655
And I told you I can't talk about
Capt. Campbell. Nothing has changed.

591
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:53,118
- You were her psychiatrist?
- And a poor one, at that.

592
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:58,665
And she was at the end of her
sophomore year when she came to you.

593
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:04,796
- She was in a serious depression.
- I take it she's in trouble again?

594
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,133
- Not now.
- That's good.

595
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:13,555
Well, she's too young to be dead ...

596
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:25,359
She was strangled, sir.
Mock raped and then strangled.

597
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,249
Goddammit! Goddammit!

598
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,794
I couldn't help her.

599
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:48,924
I tried, but I couldn't unlock her
enough to trust me.

600
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:53,387
But I still can't talk about her.

601
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,891
No, you can't.

602
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:02,479
- But you're angry, yes?
- Of course.

603
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:06,650
Sometimes when I'm angry
I talk to myself out loud.

604
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:12,281
Do you ever do that,
just sort of rant?

605
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:20,080
Yes, sometimes.

606
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:27,171
If you were to rant, and we
happened to be in the vicinity ...

607
01:16:27,504 --> 01:16:31,133
- Free country.
- My thoughts exactly.

608
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:37,514
She sets the place on fire.

609
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:40,434
Top woman here.

610
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:45,856
Pretty as hell. Outdoes most
of the men in the training runs.

611
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:50,736
<i>At the end of her sophomore year-</i>

612
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:54,281
<i>- there was a big night exercise.</i>

613
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:58,660
<i>There must have been
thousands involved.</i>

614
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:06,710
<i>Lizzy got separated from her group.</i>

615
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:15,469
<i>Found herself wlth about
a half a dozen men.</i>

616
01:17:26,939 --> 01:17:32,778
<i>A very dark night. Not only
were the men unknown to her, -</i>

617
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:36,114
<i>- but they were also
wearing camouflage.</i>

618
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:43,497
They raped her almost to death.
Raped her all night long.

619
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:47,376
<i>Taking turns.</i>

620
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:50,087
<i>Stripped her.</i>

621
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:53,298
<i>Spread-eagled her.</i>

622
01:17:58,637 --> 01:18:04,768
<i>Nailed her to the earth with
tent pegs. Had a whale of a time.</i>

623
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:15,529
Threatened to kill her
if she talked.

624
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:20,117
Tied her underwear
around her throat?

625
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:17,257
<i>Lizzy was hospitalised.
Treated for venereal disease.</i>

626
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:21,094
<i>Treated for pregnancy.</i>

627
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:44,159
By the time I got to her,
she had gone away inside.

628
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:49,581
- Never let me get close.
- Who were they? I need a name.

629
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:53,961
No. Sorry. Medical ethics.

630
01:19:57,714 --> 01:20:02,386
I'm going to finish my work here.
I can't tell you what to do ...

631
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:07,808
But you better go back to my office.
The key's under the mat.

632
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:13,230
In her file, you might find
a notation with a man's name on it.

633
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:19,403
It might be worth your while.
It's up to you. Free country.

634
01:20:23,574 --> 01:20:25,742
Sorry I couldn't help.

635
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:37,546
Beginning our descent
to Fort Benning, ma'am.

636
01:20:55,481 --> 01:20:59,109
Now, ranger! Let's go!

637
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:03,197
Female on the floor!

638
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:15,375
- Capt. Bransford?
- That would be me.

639
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:21,757
What can I do for you, honey?
Better yet, what can you do for me?

640
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:26,345
Well, dear, you can ask
these other men to excuse us.

641
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:29,681
Yeah, that's a CID badge
you're looking at.

642
01:21:35,938 --> 01:21:39,691
Looks like I picked
the wrong woman to ''honey''.

643
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,737
I'm Sarah Sunhill,
I'm a rape investigator.

644
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:46,782
We need to talk about
Elisabeth Campbell.

645
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:51,662
Liz and I were classmates
together at the Point.

646
01:21:51,995 --> 01:21:57,501
I only have one question:
How scared are you right now?

647
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:04,299
I'm sorry, Miss Sunhill. Is it
possible you're in the wrong place?

648
01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:10,013
Your heart's racing a little faster.
There's a ball in your throat.

649
01:22:10,222 --> 01:22:14,101
- I think that's enough.
- You can sit your ass back down.

650
01:22:20,649 --> 01:22:22,651
I know you weren't the leader.

651
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:28,282
- I don't know what you mean.
- You're too weak to have been.

652
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:33,579
You're just a guy who's got by
on his smile and his charm.

653
01:22:33,787 --> 01:22:37,749
- You could never lead a rape.
- That's good to know.

654
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,712
Elisabeth was murdered 36 hours ago.

655
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,466
Staked out with tent pegs
and strangled.

656
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:49,428
So I'm going to ask you again:

657
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:52,890
How scared are you right now?

658
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:58,103
- I was here on the post, lady.
- But you were there for the rape.

659
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:02,483
- You can't prove shit.
- Dr Slesingers records say I can.

660
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:07,154
Okay, I went to see Slesinger.

661
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:12,075
And I told him a story
that I had heard.

662
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:15,704
That's what his records say.
It was just a story.

663
01:23:16,038 --> 01:23:20,709
Somebody else's story.
And that's it. Understand?

664
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:37,184
- What is that?
- What does it look like?

665
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:43,774
It looks like underwear.
Women's underwear.

666
01:23:43,982 --> 01:23:49,488
Amazing scientific changes
in the last few years, Captain.

667
01:23:49,822 --> 01:23:54,493
Certain fields,
it's been incredible.

668
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,787
- If you say so.
- Like DNA.

669
01:23:56,995 --> 01:24:01,083
If it's there, it's there forever.

670
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:05,254
But then,
you probably already knew that.

671
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:07,631
Those are hers, aren't they?

672
01:24:18,267 --> 01:24:21,728
I tried to stop it.

673
01:24:21,937 --> 01:24:26,316
I did everything I could.
But they hated her.

674
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:29,111
They hated her so much.

675
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:34,449
They hated that she was smarter than
them, that she had to squat to piss.

676
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:39,329
I tried to save her,
but I couldn't make them stop.

677
01:24:40,706 --> 01:24:43,208
Who were the others?

678
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:45,794
<i>It was my recon squad.</i>

679
01:24:46,003 --> 01:24:51,008
Their names are in the yearbook.
Liz was my friend.

680
01:24:55,512 --> 01:25:02,186
Thank you for your co-operation.
Someone from CID will be in touch.

681
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:10,527
What are you doing?
What about the DNA?

682
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:15,115
What DNA?
I bought those an hour ago.

683
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:17,910
So long, honey.

684
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:48,148
<i>- That's a positive match?
- It's only a partial print.</i>

685
01:25:48,357 --> 01:25:52,736
<i>But it's definitely Fowler's,
and it's right next to the body.</i>

686
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:57,115
We only have today,
then the Feds will be all over us.

687
01:25:59,535 --> 01:26:03,997
- I got a lot on my plate just now.
- I just want to thank you.

688
01:26:04,206 --> 01:26:07,751
For leaving the medical records
in the car.

689
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:13,924
- Did he instruct you to do it?
- Not in so many words.

690
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:18,929
I knew his wishes. Anything to help.
You know how much he loved her.

691
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,975
- Not as much as he loved you.
- What do you mean?

692
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:29,857
The way you came in that night,
the extra care in making dinner.

693
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:32,568
- What do you plan on doing?
- Not a thing.

694
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:37,072
Other than to say I'm sorry
and ask for your help.

695
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:42,995
- What do you need to know about?
- The recreation of the rape.

696
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:47,791
- I suppose that's what it was.
- Was it Moore's idea to do this?

697
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,296
- To cleanse her of her past?
- Jesus, no. She thought it up.

698
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:58,552
- He couldn't talk her out of it.
- He felt so bad he killed himself?

699
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,138
We both know
that's not how it happened.

700
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:05,100
That's where they screwed up,
whoever did this.

701
01:27:05,309 --> 01:27:08,437
They didn't know about Bob and me.

702
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:13,650
Bob could never have killed himself.

703
01:27:13,984 --> 01:27:17,112
These types don't understand that.

704
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:20,240
Affairs of the heart
are beyond them.

705
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:26,371
Okay, so he staged this thing.
Tied her up, got rid of her clothes?

706
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:29,833
And he had to call the general,
play him the tape.

707
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:32,002
The tape?

708
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:51,730
General ... Brenner.

709
01:28:02,783 --> 01:28:06,620
Paul, come in, please.

710
01:28:10,582 --> 01:28:14,545
Just wanted to say goodbye, sir.
I'm leaving in the morning.

711
01:28:14,878 --> 01:28:19,550
I'm leaving tomorrow, too.
I'm taking Elisabeth to Michigan -

712
01:28:19,758 --> 01:28:23,512
- to be buried next to her mother.

713
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,225
Thank you for everything you did.

714
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:31,645
I understand
you're still going into politics?

715
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:34,773
The jury's still out. We'll see.

716
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:42,406
When you thanked me for what
I had done, what I wanted to say -

717
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:46,034
- was I really didn't do anything.

718
01:28:46,243 --> 01:28:49,997
Not anything right. I did
a lot of things that were wrong.

719
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:55,210
You're not responsible for Moore's
death. You followed your instincts.

720
01:28:55,544 --> 01:28:58,964
I'd like to talk about that, sir.

721
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:03,552
- We all know Moore did it.
- Then we're all in agreement.

722
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:10,017
But what if it wasn't one car three
times, but three different cars?

723
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:15,230
What difference does it make,
since Moore is dead?

724
01:29:15,564 --> 01:29:21,069
It got me thinking about
your daughter, and what she taught.

725
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,659
''Mostly we fuck with
people's minds,'' she said.

726
01:29:28,494 --> 01:29:32,539
Thank you, Brenner.
You can go now.

727
01:29:35,042 --> 01:29:37,669
- Tell me about the rape.
- But she wasn't raped.

728
01:29:37,878 --> 01:29:40,380
It was just made to appear that way.

729
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:44,968
The rape at West Point.

730
01:29:45,177 --> 01:29:48,514
It was kept confidential
for the good of the academy.

731
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:53,727
And the army.
And it was best for Elisabeth.

732
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:59,358
- You were in Germany?
- Berlin. I was stationed there.

733
01:29:59,566 --> 01:30:04,655
- I came back as soon as I heard.
- You went straight from the plane?

734
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:07,991
- Of course.
- No meeting first?

735
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:18,627
- Mr Brenner is very well informed.
- It was in her psych records, sir.

736
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:21,964
It didn't happen that way.

737
01:30:22,172 --> 01:30:28,137
George, he's right.
The meeting did come first.

738
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:34,268
It was seven years ago.
The details get confusing.

739
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:38,647
It was nothing. A quick briefing
in a hotel near the Point.

740
01:30:38,856 --> 01:30:44,695
General Sonenberg.
He was very sympathetic.

741
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:50,033
I want justice for my daughter.

742
01:30:50,242 --> 01:30:55,038
I would give anything if this
had never happened. But it did.

743
01:30:55,247 --> 01:31:01,795
I'm telling you the reality of the
situation. We'll never find them.

744
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:08,469
But we do know that a co-ed academy
is a good and necessary call.

745
01:31:08,677 --> 01:31:11,805
Better one unreported
and unvindicated rape -

746
01:31:12,014 --> 01:31:15,476
- than to shake the foundations
of West Point.

747
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:21,732
To cast suspicion on a thousand
soldiers who did not gang-rape her.

748
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:26,111
All we have to do
is convince your daughter -

749
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:32,242
- that she, the Academy,
the army and the cause of equality -

750
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:37,873
- would be best served if she
just forgot about the whole thing.

751
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:41,752
These are the times we live in, Joe.

752
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:46,423
He was right.
If it had gone public, -

753
01:31:46,757 --> 01:31:52,262
- it would have permanently
damaged women in the military.

754
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:58,310
- It would've destroyed West Point.
- Is that what you told Elisabeth?

755
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:02,606
Not in so many words, no.

756
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:08,529
She was in no condition
to understand that then.

757
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:11,865
I simply tried to tell her
that I loved her.

758
01:32:15,536 --> 01:32:17,913
I loved her very much.

759
01:32:18,664 --> 01:32:25,003
Daddy loves you.
And he's so proud of you.

760
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:31,051
Rest now.
Try not to think about it anymore.

761
01:32:32,636 --> 01:32:37,307
Listen to me.
I only want what's best for you.

762
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:46,191
Trust me.
Do you? Like you always did?

763
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:53,282
Then don't ever think about
any of this again.

764
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:59,830
I know. It's an awful thing.
A terrible, terrible thing.

765
01:33:00,164 --> 01:33:05,586
But thinking about it won't help it.
So ...

766
01:33:07,963 --> 01:33:12,468
Close your eyes.

767
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:15,679
It never happened.

768
01:33:15,888 --> 01:33:19,850
None of this ever happened.

769
01:33:45,834 --> 01:33:48,337
Not my finest hour.

770
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:52,925
You were just doing what you said,
trying to protect her.

771
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:56,345
I did what I had to.

772
01:33:56,553 --> 01:34:00,641
What I thought best
for everyone concerned.

773
01:34:00,849 --> 01:34:06,271
Nothing else could've been done.
They never would have found them.

774
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:12,945
- Here you are, sir.
- What is that?

775
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:21,078
The names of the perpetrators,
found with a minimum of trouble.

776
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:27,543
- That's just brilliant.
- Each man will get 20 years.

777
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:31,588
- I think you'd better go now.
- Fine.

778
01:34:31,797 --> 01:34:37,010
We'll deal with the phone call issue
tomorrow, before your flight.

779
01:34:38,178 --> 01:34:40,347
What phone call issue?

780
01:34:40,556 --> 01:34:45,978
I have reason to believe Moore
phoned you the night of the murder.

781
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:50,357
Why would he have done that?

782
01:34:50,691 --> 01:34:55,988
I think the whole recreation
of the rape was Elisabeth's idea.

783
01:34:56,321 --> 01:35:02,244
You were going into politics. Maybe
she thought it was her last chance.

784
01:35:02,452 --> 01:35:07,166
She got Moore to put her in the
same position that the rapists did.

785
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:13,213
You weren't in Germany. She wanted
you to see what you covered up.

786
01:35:13,422 --> 01:35:18,093
- That never happened!
- A gift from Moore's lawyer.

787
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:23,432
<i>Dad, this is Elisabeth. I need to
discuss something urgent with you.</i>

788
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:27,686
<i>Meet me at the mount site
no later than 03:30 hours.</i>

789
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:31,440
<i>I have an answer to your ultimatum.</i>

790
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:37,404
You can't argue with a recording.
I'm sure it was part of her plan.

791
01:35:37,613 --> 01:35:41,033
What does she mean by an ultimatum?

792
01:35:41,366 --> 01:35:43,452
I gave her two options:

793
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:49,082
Resign her commission,
or agree to some sort of therapy.

794
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:55,756
If she rejected both, I'd instruct
the staff judge advocate -

795
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:59,176
- to draw up charges
for a general court martial.

796
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:06,058
- That must seem callous to you.
- You drove out to the mount site?

797
01:36:06,809 --> 01:36:10,437
Of course. I needed an answer.

798
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:17,444
Here's the answer
to your damn ultimatum.

799
01:36:17,653 --> 01:36:21,698
Do you see what they did to me?
Do you see?

800
01:36:21,907 --> 01:36:28,497
Don't turn away. Come closer.
See what they put me through!

801
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:32,876
What the fuck
do you hope to accomplish?

802
01:36:33,085 --> 01:36:39,007
There's a rope around my neck.
Strangle me or cover it up again.

803
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:43,720
Have you gone
completely out of your mind?

804
01:36:43,929 --> 01:36:46,098
It happened.

805
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:51,228
It happened!
I want to hear you say it happened!

806
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:56,525
I don't give a damn what
happened to you seven years ago.

807
01:36:56,733 --> 01:37:00,904
Whatever hurts you
makes me stronger.

808
01:37:01,655 --> 01:37:05,492
You can't hurt me anymore.

809
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:11,039
- We're even.
- That's fine with me.

810
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:15,919
You never helped me!

811
01:37:16,128 --> 01:37:19,256
Daddy, please don't go.

812
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:22,926
Come back. Please.

813
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:25,304
Please ...

814
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,268
Daddy ...

815
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:44,072
So you were in the second car.

816
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:50,245
Which means Col. Fowler
must have been in the third.

817
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:56,710
You couldn't expect a man
to deal with his own child.

818
01:37:56,919 --> 01:38:01,089
She was screaming
such vituperations at him.

819
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:05,886
Of course not.

820
01:38:06,094 --> 01:38:10,557
So he called me.
And he asked me to deal with it.

821
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:16,939
I went ... and I found her dead.

822
01:38:19,942 --> 01:38:23,612
- You found her dead?
- Of course.

823
01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:29,535
But you will never get me
to testify against the general.

824
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:31,745
What?

825
01:38:31,954 --> 01:38:36,834
I've been by Joe Campbell's side
too many times.

826
01:38:38,210 --> 01:38:43,215
Looked death in the face with him
too many times.

827
01:38:43,423 --> 01:38:48,720
- I'll not back down now.
- What are you talking about?

828
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:52,683
It wasn't like
she didn't give him reason.

829
01:38:53,016 --> 01:38:58,730
- George, for Christ's sake!
- And when we realised ...

830
01:38:59,773 --> 01:39:03,944
... she was fucking everybody ...

831
01:39:04,278 --> 01:39:09,700
... from Bill Kent to Jake Elby,
it was too late for official action.

832
01:39:10,409 --> 01:39:12,077
Col. Fowler!

833
01:39:12,411 --> 01:39:16,165
You'd have to ask for
all their resignations.

834
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:21,587
- Strangulation, you think?
- And then resign ourselves.

835
01:39:21,795 --> 01:39:25,424
You need civilian authority.
What happened to you?

836
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:33,557
- You had no choice, sir.
- You think I killed my daughter?

837
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:40,981
- It'll die with me, Joe.
- You sorry son of a bitch!

838
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:43,984
- Bill, where's Moore?
- He was released.

839
01:39:49,615 --> 01:39:52,743
Cal, it's me.
Let me speak to Sunhill.

840
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:58,165
She got in an hour ago,
then went out to the crime scene.

841
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:02,461
She took the big dog with her.
Capt. America himself.

842
01:40:02,669 --> 01:40:07,132
<i>Kent. It was his idea.
He wants you to meet him there.</i>

843
01:40:07,466 --> 01:40:10,469
Of course he does.

844
01:40:26,527 --> 01:40:29,655
Sunhill!

845
01:40:33,116 --> 01:40:38,205
We've been through this place
a dozen times before.

846
01:40:45,212 --> 01:40:50,092
- Paul?
- Sure, sure ... Paul.

847
01:40:53,554 --> 01:40:56,765
The three of us need to go back
to your office and talk.

848
01:40:57,724 --> 01:41:04,606
Why don't we talk here, if we have
anything important to talk about?

849
01:41:04,815 --> 01:41:07,818
I thought you'd pin it on Moore
and move on.

850
01:41:09,403 --> 01:41:14,700
- Oh, God.
- I forgot you were a nasty rat.

851
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:19,621
- Just goes to show you.
- Why did you do it?

852
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:24,084
Why?
You tell me, you're the expert.

853
01:41:24,293 --> 01:41:28,881
She gave it out all over the post.
The one man who cared about her, -

854
01:41:29,089 --> 01:41:32,968
- the one willing to risk it all,
is the person she doesn't want.

855
01:41:33,177 --> 01:41:36,722
And that's because
she couldn't want anybody.

856
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:48,192
I just wanted to be with her.
She owned my heart.

857
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:54,948
<i>She tormented me.
She became my obsession.</i>

858
01:41:57,659 --> 01:42:01,747
<i>So I followed her,
and found her on the range.</i>

859
01:42:01,955 --> 01:42:03,707
<i>On display.</i>

860
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:09,046
- Elisabeth?
- Get the fuck out of here.

861
01:42:10,714 --> 01:42:14,134
He'll come back. You can't be here.
You'll ruin it all.

862
01:42:15,928 --> 01:42:21,433
- What's all this about?
- Did my father send you?

863
01:42:21,767 --> 01:42:26,772
- Did he send you to shut me up?
- No.

864
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:32,069
Well, this time I won't be quiet.
This time I'll tell everything.

865
01:42:32,277 --> 01:42:38,742
About him, about you.
I'll tell your wife, your kids ...

866
01:42:40,953 --> 01:42:44,373
Don't touch me!
Get your hands off me!

867
01:42:50,963 --> 01:42:53,340
You repulse me! You're a disgrace!

868
01:42:53,549 --> 01:42:58,470
You're not a soldier. You're not
even a man. You're just a fuck.

869
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,473
I fucked you!

870
01:43:08,355 --> 01:43:10,649
Oh, Christ!

871
01:43:29,334 --> 01:43:33,088
Bill, let's get going.
Come on.

872
01:43:39,344 --> 01:43:42,139
I'm all yours, Paulie.

873
01:43:42,347 --> 01:43:47,561
Before you come closer, don't you
want to know where you're standing?

874
01:43:47,769 --> 01:43:51,857
- Where am I standing?
- In a minefield.

875
01:43:52,065 --> 01:43:56,445
I buried some Bouncing Betties.
Anti-personnel.

876
01:43:56,653 --> 01:44:02,367
You're reasonably safe,
but little Miss Can't-be Wrong ...

877
01:44:03,202 --> 01:44:05,913
She's deep in the hurt locker.

878
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:11,543
You remember how the Betty works?
First man trips the primary, -

879
01:44:11,877 --> 01:44:16,340
- the rest of the column walks into
the blast. Heads, limbs ...

880
01:44:16,548 --> 01:44:18,842
Backtrack.

881
01:44:19,176 --> 01:44:22,596
What shrapnel does
to flesh and bone ...

882
01:44:22,805 --> 01:44:25,724
- Sarah, you're fine.
- God!

883
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:35,526
- Scared you, didn't I?
- You're an asshole, Kent!

884
01:44:35,859 --> 01:44:38,654
Come on, Bill, it's over.

885
01:44:39,404 --> 01:44:40,948
Yeah, it's over.

886
01:44:45,869 --> 01:44:48,163
But not the way you think.

887
01:45:16,942 --> 01:45:21,405
Attention!
Present arms!

888
01:45:29,037 --> 01:45:32,666
<i>The human eye
can distinguish 16 shades of grey.</i>

889
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:36,128
<i>A computer,
analysing a fingerprint, -</i>

890
01:45:36,336 --> 01:45:40,924
<i>- can distinguish 256 shades
of grey, which is impressive.</i>

891
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:44,052
<i>The human heart,
mind and soul, however, -</i>

892
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:49,766
<i>- can distinguish an infinite number
of emotional and moral shadings.</i>

893
01:45:49,975 --> 01:45:56,982
<i>In Psy Ops we deal with the blackest
of black and the whitest of white.</i>

894
01:46:01,028 --> 01:46:03,655
At ease, soldier.

895
01:46:09,912 --> 01:46:14,500
- Is Col. Fowler coming?
- He's taking much-needed R&R.

896
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:20,839
He's a good man.
A good man and a good soldier.

897
01:46:21,048 --> 01:46:25,636
Sometimes the lines get blurred,
but when push comes to shove ...

898
01:46:25,844 --> 01:46:30,015
- He'll do what needs to be done.
- And what is that, sir?

899
01:46:30,766 --> 01:46:36,271
Say Moore called him,
and that I was never out there ...

900
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:41,693
He'll do that for me,
even if it means his career.

901
01:46:41,902 --> 01:46:48,158
Like a good soldier.
Nothing is gained by my involvement.

902
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:54,623
A letter of commendation
will be inserted into your file.

903
01:46:54,832 --> 01:47:00,170
In recognition of
your exemplary work on this case.

904
01:47:06,844 --> 01:47:10,806
Remember when I asked you
if you were a cop or a soldier?

905
01:47:11,014 --> 01:47:17,563
You're a soldier, Paul.
And a damn fine one.

906
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:29,366
General Campbell ...

907
01:47:30,826 --> 01:47:35,414
- You're wrong. I'm a bad soldier.
- Oh? And why is that?

908
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:38,625
You really don't get it, do you?

909
01:47:38,959 --> 01:47:44,882
The only mind Elisabeth
wanted to fuck with was yours.

910
01:47:45,841 --> 01:47:50,721
- And you still don't get it.
- I've done nothing wrong.

911
01:47:53,557 --> 01:47:58,979
- You killed her.
- What did you say?

912
01:48:00,314 --> 01:48:06,570
Seven years ago, when you told her
to forget about it, you killed her.

913
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:13,452
- Kent killed her.
- He just put her out of her misery.

914
01:48:15,662 --> 01:48:20,542
I once asked Moore what was
worse than rape. Now I know.

915
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:23,462
Betrayal.

916
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:28,884
I loved Elisabeth, but there were
larger issues to consider.

917
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:34,515
You traded her trust
for your career. You made a deal.

918
01:48:34,848 --> 01:48:38,477
You kept silent,
and they gave you another star.

919
01:48:38,685 --> 01:48:45,567
I'm going to say in my report
that you left her out there to die.

920
01:48:47,653 --> 01:48:51,824
- You don't have the balls.
- Oh, you're wrong, sir.

921
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:58,413
- That's just about all I have left.
- You can kiss your career goodbye.

922
01:48:58,622 --> 01:49:04,128
I'll have you court-martialled, sir.
Conspiracy to conceal a crime.

923
01:49:38,871 --> 01:49:44,376
When this all started, I told you
we'd find the son of a bitch, sir.

924
01:49:45,544 --> 01:49:50,632
I never expected that
the son of a bitch would be you.
