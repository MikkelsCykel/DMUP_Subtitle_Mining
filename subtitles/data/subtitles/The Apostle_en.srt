- They put a thief on each side of Jesus.
- Yeah!

5

- Yes, Lord.

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,377
"Praise the name of the Lord. "
One on the right hand and one on his left.

Glory to God!

8
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:41,735
The Bible tells me,
praise the name of the Lord.

9
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:45,851
Tells me they spit on him.
Praise the name of the Lord!

10
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:49,255
- Can you say, "Yeah, Lord"?

13

- They nailed nails...
- Yes, Lord.

14
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,975
...in his hands, sisters and brothers.
- Yes, Lord.

15
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:06,489
For you and I.
They put nails in his feet for you and I.

16
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:10,371
- They pierced him in the side for you and I.
- Yes, Lord.

17
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,807
They put thorns about his head for you and I.
- Yes, Lord.

18
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:16,928
- Can you say, "Yeah, Lord"?
- Yeah, Lord.

Glory to God!

28
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:48,808
Jesus said blessed are those
that haven't seen, and believed.

29
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:59,048
Blessed is those that haven't seen.
Thank you, Lord.

30
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,404
Thank you, Lord. And they still believe in him.

I don't know how many's
in that car there.

46
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:27,844
There's three there, one there
and I guess there's two in this one.

47
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,242
Pretty sad. I hate this.

48
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:35,202
Like that little dog,
you never know who he belongs to.

49
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:40,959
Little puppy. Where you been?
You belong to this car or that one down there?

50
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:45,079
I like that kind of little dog.
Smart little dogs.

51
00:03:45,286 --> 00:03:47,846
Sugar is a good little thing.

52
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,879
Grab a handful of sugar,
a lot of hot peppers.

53
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:55,079
Mama, wait now. Hold on. Hold on, Mama.

54
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:03,205
I'll pull up just here.

55
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:06,602
- Oh, Lord, Sonny.
- Just hush now.

56
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,485
You stay put, Mama.

57
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:15,199
You stay put.

58
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:35,399
I was just running down there.
I got to the car and she tried to follow me back.

59
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:42,475
Then I go get the man, told him to come out.
For years they thanked me for it.

60
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:03,192
"Therefore when I passed by thee
and saw thee polluted in thine own blood,

61
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:08,759
I said unto thee
when thy wast in thy blood, live.

62

"Yea, I said unto thee
when thy wast in thy blood...

64
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,794
<i>Live, live.</i>

65
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,069
Son, can you hear me?
I'm going to help you.

66
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,477
I'm a minister of the Lord.
The Lord loves you and I love you.

67
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:39,231
If you can't answer, just nod.
If you can't nod, just think it.

68
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,114
Answer me in your mind
and in your heart.

69
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:50,237
If the Lord were to call you right now,
would you be ready?

70
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:53,430
Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ
as your saviour?

71
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:59,395
Are you ready for him? Are you ready
to follow and accept him this very instant?

72
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:06,435
If you open your heart, he will stand with you
whether you go home or stay with us.

73
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:10,346
If it isn't your time,
he'll stand by you and your wife.

74
00:06:10,557 --> 00:06:13,549
He'll deliver you through
this entire ordeal.

75
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,634
Listen to me.

76
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:21,114
There are angels even in this automobile
at this precise moment.

77
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:25,553
He has sent his angels
here to watch over you.

78
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:28,714
Do you accept him here today?

79
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:33,193
Y- ye...

80
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:37,823
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Hey, mister. You have to get out of there.

81
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:41,948
You can't be in there.
Hear me? Let's go.

82
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:47,467
When an ambulance gets you, the Lord's
gonna have a flock of angels to lead you.

83
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:51,553
You've taken the Lord,
he's gonna go all the way with you.

84
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:55,190
You both are his champions here today.
Praise God!

85
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:00,469
Thank you, sir.

86
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:07,428
Don't have to thank me, son.
Thank the Lord and saviour, Jesus Christ.

87
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,510
You're in his hands now.

88
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:16,470
Bless you both. "Wherever two or more
are gathered in my name, there will I be also. "

89
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:20,347
Mister? I'm sorry,
you've got to go back to your car.

90
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:22,747
- You're not allowed here.
- I understand.

91
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:28,343
I guess you think
you accomplished something in there?

92
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,588
- I know I did.
- Go on.

93
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:33,942
I did not put my head
through that window in vain.

94
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,506
- How would you know?
- I'll tell you.

95
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:41,580
I'd rather die today and go to heaven
than live to be 100 and go to hell.

96
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,466
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir. It is.

97
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:50,266
Hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
that reigneth in the Book of Revelation.

98
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,938
Glory!

Mama, we made news
in heaven this morning.

106
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,066
- What?
- Two young people, their lives ahead of them.

107
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:24,420
One may live, one may die. I don't know.
Touch and go.

- Let's pray for them, Mama.
- My Lord.

Pray with me, Mama.
Just sing a prayer, Mama.

00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:33,366
Mama, I can't take you with me,
so get on back in your chair.

150
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:38,968
I know you died and gone home to heaven.
I hope you hear me. You be good.

151
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:43,885
I'll call you tonight.
I can't take you with me, OK?

152
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:47,813
All right? Yeah, Mama?

153
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,842
Hug St Peter's neck for me.

154
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:57,764
Bye, Mama. Kiss an angel for me.
I'm going to hit the road.

155
00:11:57,974 --> 00:11:59,965
Got to go to work.

156
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:09,445
Jessie, I'll call, see if you want to fly
to Little Rock, drive back with me and Joe.

157
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:14,329
I have my Women's Aglow meetings, so...
Maybe. You call me?

158
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:20,449
- See you in a few weeks. Horace, bless you.
- Bye, Sonny. Have a good trip.

159
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:23,883
Learn the books of the Bible.
Let me hear them.

160
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:26,401
- You!
- No, you say them.

161
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:31,606
Say it! Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua... You!

162
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,451
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,

163
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:37,610
First and Second Samuel, First and Second
Kings, First and Second Chronicles,

164
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:42,441
Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms,
Proverbs et cetera, et cetera.

165
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:45,119
And on into Revelation.

166
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:57,242
I may be on the Devil's hit list,
but I'm on Jesus' mailing list.

167
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,409
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil

168
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,248
for thou art with me. "

169
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,843
Why do I say this? Because
we got Holy Ghost power here today.

170
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,598
I got a sea of his son's blood
wrapped around my body.

171
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,881
Can everybody say
we got Holy Ghost power in this tent?

172
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,762
Say it again! Holy Ghost power!

173
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:22,564
- Holy Ghost power! I said Holy Ghost power!
- Yeah!

174
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,044
Power to change you
when you don't want to be changed.

175
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:29,718
Power to remake you
when you don't want to be remade.

176
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,318
Shout hallelujah! Hallelujah!

177
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:35,484
Hallelujah!

178
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:37,201
Hallelujah!

179
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:41,241
We got Holy Ghost power!

180
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,926
Hallelujah!

181
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:47,837
The Devil thought he had the keys.

182
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:52,882
But Jesus went to hell.
He made a house-call on the Devil.

183
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,123
He took him off of his throne.

184
00:13:55,326 --> 00:14:00,719
Did a backflip over the Devil
and stripped him of all of his power.

185
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:04,475
And came out of hell
with the keys to the kingdom.

186
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:09,198
We got the keys to the kingdom!

187
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:15,235
We got the keys to the kingdom!

188
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:18,801
- Hallelujah!
- How about it, sister?

189
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:23,764
Come on and shout "Holy Ghost"!
Shout "Holy Ghost"!

190
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:27,195
Holy Ghost! The Holy Ghost!

191
00:14:27,404 --> 00:14:29,918
Shout "Holy Ghost"!

192
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:36,962
<i># I have decided to follow Jesus

193

<i># No turn around, no turn around d</i>

195
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,918
- Who's the King of kings?
- Jesus.

196
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:50,274
- Before Abraham was, was who?
- Jesus!

197
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:53,156
- Who's the first and the last?
- Jesus.

198
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:57,116
- I'm on the Devil's hit list. Who's by my side?
- Jesus.

199
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:00,120
- Who's the lily of the valley?
- Jesus.

200
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:04,110
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, who is by my side?

201
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,836
- Jesus.
- Come on and say "Jesus", beloved.

202
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:10,921
- Jesus.
- If I wake up in hell, who do I look up to?

203
00:15:11,122 --> 00:15:14,830
- Jesus.
- Shout it loud and say "Jesus"!

204
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,271
- Jesus.
- I can't hear you.

205
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,756
- Jesus!
- Jesus!

206
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,111
- Jesus!
- Jesus!

207
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,437
His name is Jesus.

208
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:26,074
Jesus.

209
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:30,068
A handclap for Jesus. Come on,
everyone. Give me a handclap.

210
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,316
Yea, though I walk...

211
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,715
...through the valley
of the shadow of death,

212
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,036
I will fear no evil...

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,276
...because I'm walking with Jesus.

214
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,277
I walk with Jesus. I talk with Jesus.

215
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:46,516
I walk with Jesus. I shout with Jesus.

216
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:50,678
I walk with Jesus. I stomp with Jesus.
We stomp all together.

217
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,794
<i>We stomp on the Diablo. I want to
walk with you and stomp with you.</i>

218
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:06,187
Yes. Thank you.

219
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,275
Thank you, Jesus.

220
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:10,309
Thank you, Lord.

221
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:12,713
Thank you. Oh, yes.

222
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:17,830
Come on, Joe! Joe!

223
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,670
- Joe, come on. We've got to go now.
- What's going on?

224
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,072
OK. I'm coming.

225
00:16:27,357 --> 00:16:29,790
Let me in. You trying to kill me?

226
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:32,590
What's going on?
We're going the wrong way.

227
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:37,711
If someone's in my bed that's supposed
to be there, we'll be back in 24 hours.

228
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:41,795
- You mean Jessie?
- Yeah. My sweet wife Jessie. You bet.

229
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:44,429
I'll call you in the morning.

230
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,507
Jessie?

231
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:02,868
Jess.

232
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:11,306
<i>...are charged by almighty God

God has put us in a position of legal...</i>

234
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,271
Sonny.

235
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,465
What's that?

236
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:46,782
Go back to sleep.

237
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,023
OK.

238
00:17:57,551 --> 00:18:00,224
- It was nothing.
- Nothing.

239
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,309
"Thou shalt not kill. "

240
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:42,378
- Sonny! Dammit, Sonny!
- No!

<i>Saint Paul said...</i>

242
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:55,386
I appreciate your friendship, Joe.
I really, really do.

243
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:03,783
Sit tight in case I start
choking this woman to death.

244
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,341
If I do, you'll know it. You hear?

245
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:13,937
What are we going to do
about this, Jessie?

246
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:17,343
Give me some kind of answer. What?

247
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:20,264
I just want out of all this, that's all.

248
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:25,823
- Out of what? This marriage?
- Yeah.

249
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,621
I have to think about that.

250
00:19:29,825 --> 00:19:32,737
- There's not a lot for you to think about.
- Yeah?

251
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:37,176
I want to get on with it.
And keep your hands where they are.

252
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,375
- Don't.
- What?

253
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:44,180
What do you want to get on with?

254
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:47,933
- My life.
- That's it.

255
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,452
Well, I'll tell you something.

256
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:55,212
I might make a little noise
about all this, you know that.

257
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:58,460
- I imagine you will.
- Nobody better mess with my children.

258
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:02,576
Especially any puny-assed
youth minister, you hear me?

259
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:04,659
Nobody will.

260
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:06,853
I assure you of that.

261
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:10,452
I wouldn't make too much over this,
if I were you.

262
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:15,895
I know as much about what you have done
as you think I do, you know that.

263
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,852
I guess I do.

264
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:20,892
- Yeah.
- What?

265
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,615
No. It's OK. Hold on.

266
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,937
It's OK, baby.

267
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:31,856
Would you get down on your knees with me
just this last time?

268
00:20:32,061 --> 00:20:34,893
- Come on, Jessie.
- Why, Sonny?

269
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,011
I want...

270
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,495
I want us to pray together.

271
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:47,492
For understanding and possible future
reconciliation for us and our son and daughter.

272
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,372
- No. It's not the time.
- Jessie, come on.

273
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:53,616
- I don't want to pray with you today.
- Next week?

274
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,377
No.

275
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:57,137
All right.

276
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,815
We'll see.

277
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:04,615
Boy, you're something.

278
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:13,251
We've never had a problem
we haven't been able to solve.

279
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,690
- He's given me my answers.
- Who's given you answers?

280
00:21:17,898 --> 00:21:20,457
- The Lord.
- Our Lord has?

281
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:25,007
- Yeah.
- Are you sure it was the Lord talking?

282
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:29,688
We've prayed since before we were married.
My knees are worn out over us.

283
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,695
I don't want to live like this any more.

284
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:36,206
Because of my wandering eye
and wicked ways?

285
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,565
It goes beyond just that.

286
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:44,928
I have a wandering bug in me
because I love to evangelise.

287
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:51,324
But I love my wife and family.
Always have, always will. I love my wife.

288
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:58,363
I love my beauties, my babies.

289
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:00,691
Look at me, Jessie.

290
00:22:00,895 --> 00:22:03,728
You know I love you. You know that.

291
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,490
Yeah. I do.

292
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,491
Yeah.

293
00:22:14,774 --> 00:22:16,173
Don't.

294
00:22:20,534 --> 00:22:23,969
God bless you. You're going to need it.

295
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,245
I'm with you all the way.

296
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:34,049
If you hadn't led me to the Lord,
who knows what jail I'd be in?

297
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,289
- I ain't going to let you forget that.
- I appreciate it.

298
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:43,169
- You hear me now, don't you?
- What do we have here, Joe?

299
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,288
- Morning.
- Hi, Sonny.

300
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:53,848
What's going on?
Whose funeral have we got to attend to?

301
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:59,489
- Don't tell me it's mine.
- I don't know how to begin this.

302
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:02,728
Open your mouth and get to it.
That's the best way.

303
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:07,004
Seems that Sister Jessie
don't want you among us any more.

304
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:13,479
She's gonna take the church from you through
proper channels. That's why we're here.

305
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,321
How come I knew that?

306
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,359
How come I knew that? Let me sit down.

307
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,958
I tell you...

308
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:32,642
How come I knew that?
I was just there. You're all here.

309
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:36,319
I was just there
and you're here already.

310
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,884
She wanted it to come from
some portion of the church body.

311
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:43,000
She did? I see.

312
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:47,238
- She can't do that. You know she can't.
- She can.

313
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:51,839
I imagine she can do about anything
she wants. Can't she, Brother Edwards?

314
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:55,881
- It all happened too quick.
- You're telling me.

315
00:23:56,087 --> 00:24:01,366
It seems that a proper church vote was taken
according to the church by-laws

316
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:04,479
and laws of Texas
for non-profit organisations.

317
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:09,237
- You helped set it up.
- When was the vote taken? I wasn't there.

318
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:12,040
The day before
yesterday is what we were told.

319
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:14,885
- And we're sorry.
- It's just such a shock.

320
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:20,365
I don't know what else to say.
I just don't know what else to say.

321
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:28,118
You've delivered your message.
I've received it. Thank you very much.

322
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:34,764
Somebody has taken my wife.
They stole my church.

323
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:37,604
That's a temple I built for you.

324
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:42,116
I'm gonna yell at you
'cause I'm mad at you. Take it!

325
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:46,875
Give me a sign or something.
Blow this pain out of me.

326
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:52,204
Give it to me, Lord. If you won't
give me back my wife, give me peace.

327
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:57,682
Give it to me! Give it to me!
Give it to me! Give me peace.

328
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:01,637
I don't know who's been fooling
with me - you or the Devil.

329
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:05,199
I won't bring the human into this.
He's just a mutt.

330
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,156
I'm confused. I'm mad.

331
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:12,992
I love you, Lord, but I'm mad at you.
I am mad at you!

332
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:20,359
Deliver me tonight, Lord. Should I lay hands
on myself? What should I do?

333
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:25,113
I know I'm a sinner and a once-in-a-while
womaniser, but I'm your servant.

334
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:30,236
Since I was a little boy. You brought me back
from the dead. I'm your servant.

335
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:36,357
What should I do? I've always called you
Jesus. You've always called me Sonny.

336
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:41,111
What should I do, Jesus?
This is Sonny talking now.

337
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,069
All right.

338
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,032
You let me down,
now heal this broken heart.

339
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,230
<i>- Hello?
- Miss Dewey.</i>

340
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:00,988
<i>It sounds like you've got a wild man
over there hollering.</i>

341
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,633
<i>Who is that? Is that your son?</i>

342
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,795
That is my son.

343
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,912
I tell you, ever since
he was a little bitty boy,

344
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,908
he sometimes talks to the Lord
and sometimes he yells at the Lord.

345
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:20,067
<i>- Tonight, he happens to be yelling at him.
- Could you tell him to talk softer?</i>

346
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,829
<i>People got to get their sleep.
Do you know what time it is? Hello?</i>

347
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,507
I'm calling you, Jesus. Talk to Sonny.

348
00:26:28,717 --> 00:26:34,394
You don't talk to Sonny tonight,
it seems like. But I can't...

349
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:41,147
- I reckon you didn't sleep much.
- I ain't slept for 48 hours.

350
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:44,746
- I was yelling at God till sun-up.
- You got the Pentecost croup?

351
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:47,345
And how! Yeah!

352
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:57,313
- Why are you going where you're not wanted?
- They can vote me out but not lock me out!

353
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,712
These people love me.

354
00:27:01,395 --> 00:27:03,909
<i># Let me hear you say "yeah"
# Yeahl</i>

355
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:05,628
<i># Yeahl
# Yeahl</i>

356
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:14,513
<i># Say "yeah"I Say "yeah"... I
# Yeahl Yeah... I</i>

357
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:21,831
<i># He's all right
# He's all right</i>

358
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,386
<i># He's all right...</i>

359
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,826
I love you.

360
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:37,026
He's all right. He's all right.

361
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:50,704
He's all right.

362
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,064
He's all right.

363
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:03,343
I love you.

364
00:29:11,107 --> 00:29:13,621
God loves you, Sonny!

365
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:21,256
- What happened, Sonny?
- I'm no longer your local pastor.

366
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:26,142
- You sure showed them with that $50 bill.
- It was a $100 bill.

367
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:28,735
- What you going to do?
- I don't know.

368
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:33,382
A lot of people will go with you. I know I will
if you start your own church.

369
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:39,058
This was my own church, sister.
This was my own church.

370
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:43,144
- God go with you.
- I love you and the Lord loves you.

371
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:44,937
Praise God.

372
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:49,342
Pastor, they can't vote you out
of the church. Your body's the temple.

373
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:53,139
God's walking up and down the avenues
of your soul. Romans 8:28.

374
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:57,383
God said all things work together.
Be encouraged, Pastor, in Jesus' name.

375
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,498
You can do it!

376
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:16,696
Go on, Bobby! Way to go!
Let's go, Bobby.

377
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:19,419
Keep your eye on the ball.

378
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:23,652
Bobby!

379
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,892
Keep your eye on the ball.

380
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:35,412
Yeah! Hit that ball!

381
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:38,897
Come on, Bobby!

382
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:41,171
I wish you hadn't come here.

383
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:47,058
I've come to see my beauties,
Mrs "Jesus, He's All Right" Dewey. OK?

384
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,131
- Everything all right?
- Everything's in order, Rodney.

385
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,657
I'll go get him. Y'all stay here.

386
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,459
Right on, your highness. Right on.

387
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:09,292
- You feel all right?
- As good as I've ever felt in my life, Rodney.

388
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:12,059
Sonny, why don't you stay here?

389
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:14,329
My name's not Rodney.

390
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,451
I want to see my beauties, if you don't mind.

391
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:24,614
Sonny, I'm really and truly sorry
about what's happened. I really am.

392
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:27,252
Why don't you butt out of here

393
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:33,851
before I take my boot and tear you
another asshole right where your nose is at?

394
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:35,649
Right?

395
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:42,205
- Sonny, there ain't no call for that kind of talk.
- We'll see about that. Let's go home now.

396
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:46,854
- I'm sorry to break up the party here. Let's go.
- Don't you...

397
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:50,091
- Give me that.
- Sonny, don't...

398
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:54,213
- One for the road, Rodney.
- What's the matter with you?

399
00:31:54,416 --> 00:31:58,295
- Sonny!
- Let's go home now.

400
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:02,693
- You're evil!
- Let's go home.

401
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:06,126
- Horace!
- You want to go with me?

402
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:09,850
Give me a kiss, baby. Come on.

403
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,684
Mercy, Lord.

404
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:24,091
In the name of Jesus...

405
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:28,849
In the name of Jesus.
Hallelujah!

406
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:31,329
Praise life.

407
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:45,602
- Sonny.
- Joe. I've done it this time.

408
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:49,010
- What happened?
- I let that sucker have it.

409
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:53,091
- How bad?
- I beat him like a one-legged stepchild.

410
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:56,568
- Is he hurt bad?
- Yeah. I imagine. Bad enough.

411
00:32:56,772 --> 00:33:01,482
- What happened?
- I think he might be on the road to glory.

412
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,081
I've got to go. I'll miss my beauties.

413
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:06,327
- Give them my love.
- You bet.

414
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:09,329
Check on Mama.
I can't tell her what I've done.

415
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:14,047
- I sure hope to see you soon.
- I don't know. I've got to go.

416
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:17,004
- God bless you.
- God bless you. Love my neck.

417
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:24,202
- God bless you. You're the best.
- How am I gonna get in touch?

418
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,881
I'll call you every night collect.
I love you, son.

419
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,399
I love you, too, Sonny.

420
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:03,158
"I sent an angel before thee
to keep thee in the way

421
00:34:03,368 --> 00:34:08,122
and to bring thee into the place
which I have prepared. " "Amen. "

422
00:34:44,765 --> 00:34:47,154
Holy! Holy!

423
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:50,357
Glory! Yes, sir. Thank you.

Adis, amigo. Hello, Jesus.

00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,279
That's it.

426
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:20,355
Pre-heaven addresses.
2120 and a half on the move.

427
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:24,641
Zip code non-existent.

428
00:35:24,842 --> 00:35:26,798
That's it.

429
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:31,200
All right. Whithersoever thou leadest,
I will follow.

430
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:33,233
Thank you.

431
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,751
Yes, sir.

- Morning, my friend.
- Good morning.

435
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,955
- Do you catch freshwater mullet out of here?
- Sometimes. I caught a few.

436
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,196
- I catch more catfish.
- I see.

437
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,075
Do you mind if I sit here
for a while with you?

438
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,554
Oh, no. Go ahead.

439
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,635
You see...

440
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:26,153
I'm on my journey.

441
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,431
Satan... Satan's driven a big wedge...

442
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,628
...between me and my family, you see?

443
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,147
It's... I tell you!

444
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:45,551
- You got any children?
- Yes, sir, and eight grandchildren beside.

445
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:49,553
I reckon you know what it means

446
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:54,706
to face the possibility
of losing everybody and everything.

447
00:36:56,356 --> 00:37:02,704
It hasn't ever happened to me, no sir,
but I can still relate to that.

448
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,591
Yeah!

449
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:29,547
Would you mind if I stayed around here
a day or two to rest a while

450
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:33,110
and to see whatever
the Lord has for me next?

451
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:37,307
- Would you mind that?
- You have no place to go?

452
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:42,428
Not that I know of yet, but the Lord's
leading me and he's talking to me. He is.

453
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:49,949
- You sound like a preacher.
- Well, yeah.

454
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:56,069
I've been a minister of the Lord since
I was 12 years old, back when God called me.

455
00:37:56,273 --> 00:38:02,950
I do have a pup tent in the back
that my grandchildren play in sometimes.

456
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:07,782
- Could you use that?
- I'll sleep in any pup tent, any time, anywhere.

457
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:13,782
- I appreciate it. It's a mansion on a hill.
- Praise the Lord. It's yours.

458
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:27,900
Dear Father in heaven, we thank you
for this food that we're about to receive. Amen.

459
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,387
<i># It might bring me poverty...</i>

460
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:45,660
<i>#...It may be filled
with flame or flood...</i>

461
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:11,184
Glory.

462
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:27,499
<i>I feel as if I have crucified Christ
afresh in what I have done.</i>

463
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:30,379
<i>Adultery is a demonic oppression.</i>

464
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:34,135
<i>As we seek the deliverance needed
from such iniquity</i>

465
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:38,021
<i>I know that never will I be touched
or weakened by it again.</i>

466
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:40,786
<i>Never, till the day I die.</i>

467
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:45,905
<i>As thou know, O Lord,</i>

468
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:51,782
<i>once one has nullified the work
of the cross, iniquity sets in.</i>

469
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:02,017
- Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning.

470
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:05,978
- I left some breakfast on the table for you.
- No, sir.

471
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:09,574
I started my fast after supper
last evening, but thank you.

472
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,742
I'll be back about noon.
You want some dinner then?

473
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,696
No, sir.

474
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,777
<i>I am chagrined of my sin</i>

475
00:40:21,983 --> 00:40:24,781
<i>and at this time, even as I pray,</i>

476
00:40:24,983 --> 00:40:30,262
<i>I ask for the strength to carry on
the work of the ministry in this holy temple.</i>

477
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:35,377
<i>I also beseech you at this time
to let the sorrow end here,</i>

478
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:38,619
<i>that the broken-hearted may be bound up.</i>

479
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:41,894
<i>I pray with all the fervency
I possess and cherish</i>

480
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:45,174
<i>that you find it in your supreme
and holy power</i>

481
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:48,100
<i>to forgive us for our deeds</i>

482
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:51,020
<i>and to let us carry on your work.</i>

483
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:55,339
<i>In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ. Amen.</i>

484
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,418
<i>And Amen.</i>

485
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,408
Jesus! Jesus!

486
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,373
<i>I've always called you Jesus.
You called me Sonny.</i>

487
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,571
<i>Now heal this broken heart.</i>

488
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,533
<i>Don't let her have them kids, now.</i>

489
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,176
<i>- You fight for those children, Sonny.
- Mama!</i>

490
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,816
<i>Sonny, I don't want to pray
with you any more.</i>

491
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:31,049
<i>Sonny, I really and truly am sorry
about what's happened, I really am.</i>

492
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:33,852
<i>I just want out, that's all.</i>

493
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:51,733
With great humility,
I ask permission to be accepted

494
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:56,010
as an apostle of our Lord and saviour
Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

495
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:58,173
With your gracious permission,

496
00:41:58,377 --> 00:42:03,450
I wish to be baptised
as an apostle of our Lord.

497
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:06,216
I therefore, without witnesses,

498
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:11,092
baptise myself in the name
of the Father,

499
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,526
and of the Son

500
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,613
and of the Holy Ghost.

501
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:19,770
Take him, Lord, he's your servant.

502
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,047
And in the name of Jesus.

503
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:36,563
I have a first cousin who's a retired pastor.
He fasts once a year.

504
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:41,165
I understand. He's a good man.
Where does he reside?

505
00:42:41,374 --> 00:42:45,208
He resides in a place
called Bayou Boutté.

506
00:42:45,414 --> 00:42:48,690
- Where's that? Texas?
- It's in Louisiana.

507
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:52,852
- South of here a few hours.
- What's his name? Maybe I heard of him.

508
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:59,128
- His name is Charles Blackwell.
- Charles Blackwell? I never heard of him.

509
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:03,087
I know a lot of preachers,
but I don't know Charles Blackwell.

510
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:06,648
Yes, sir. Praise God.
You're a blessed man.

511
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:15,408
<i>Thank you, Lord. I'm your apostle
from now till the end of eternity.</i>

512
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:21,129
<i>Ever since the day you rung my bell
when I was 12 years old I've been with you.</i>

513
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:25,449
<i>Sometimes I zigzagged off course,
more zagging than zigging.</i>

514
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:31,362
<i>I'm with you now in
a straight line for ever. I'm your apostle now.</i>

515
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:36,246
In the name of Jesus,
you don't have to go back in there.

516
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,728
- Say 21 times, "Jesus will save me. "
- Jesus will save...

517
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,969
Hey, wait! 21 times.
Don't go back in there now.

518
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,082
Hey! You have Holy Ghost power!

519
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,680
<i># I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord</i>

520
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:57,326
<i># I'm a soldier in the army</i>

521
00:43:57,529 --> 00:44:01,488
<i># I'm a soldier in the army of the Lord</i>

522
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:05,567
<i># I'm a soldier in the army</i>

523
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:09,886
<i># I believe I'll die
# In the army of the Lord</i>

524
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:15,116
<i># I believe I'll die
# In the army of the Lord</i>

525
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:18,126
<i># Hallelujahl Hallelujahl d</i>

526
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:25,163
Glory! Glory!

527
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:40,316
You do it your way, I do it mine,
but we get it done, don't we?

528
00:44:48,926 --> 00:44:50,598
Yeah.

529
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:53,316
Bayou Boutté.

530
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,357
- How you doing?
- Real good.

531
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,523
Lord, I'm yours.

532
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:14,680
Which way you going?

533
00:45:14,884 --> 00:45:17,523
You lead. I follow.

534
00:45:17,724 --> 00:45:21,842
Every step of the way. Yes, sir.

535
00:45:23,843 --> 00:45:26,482
Amen. Lead me on.

536
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,753
Yes, sir.

537
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:37,241
Excuse me.
Do you have a hotel-motel around here?

538
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,115
A bed and breakfast, anything like that?

539
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:46,079
There used to be a motel called the Red Apple
Restaurant. I don't think it's there any more.

540
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:53,750
What's your problem there?

541
00:45:55,081 --> 00:46:00,030
- Well, I set the points.
- What about them?

542
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:03,039
Well, I set them and I set the floater.

543
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:06,313
- But it's got to be something else.
- Screwdriver.

544
00:46:06,521 --> 00:46:10,479
You've probably got a vacuum down there.
Let's see.

545
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,309
Your breaker plate's not advancing, see.

546
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,159
- See that tube? You know what that's for?
- What?

547
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,230
It's messed up. You got to clean it, snip it,
then put it back in and your problem's solved.

548
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,318
- Yeah. Right there.
- I appreciate it.

549
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,035
I knew it was right in there,
but thank you.

550
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,594
My pleasure. Yes, sir.

551
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:38,474
How's it coming along, Sam?
You got that figured out?

552
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:44,753
Well, you had a small malfunction in your
distributor. We're going to fix it good as new.

553
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:49,748
That's great. Looks like we've found
a new mechanic. What do you say?

554
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:52,756
- I'm ready if you are.
- You serious?

555
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:58,111
If you are. Give me the parts, I'll build
any vehicle you want from the ground up.

556
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,911
- Where you from?
- See where I'm standing?

557
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:05,235
That's where I'm from.
I've got a little bit of everywhere in me.

558
00:47:05,437 --> 00:47:08,395
Sounds like my first two wives.
You get around, huh?

559
00:47:08,597 --> 00:47:14,671
Yeah. I've been to every state except for
Alaska, and a few foreign countries as well.

560
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:18,425
- Including Mississippi.
- Mississippi!

561
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:24,347
I'll talk with my partner. He knows more
about the cars than I do. Check you later.

562
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:36,709
Any of you know of a Reverend C Charles
Blackwell, might live around here?

563
00:47:38,595 --> 00:47:42,189
- I think down that way, sir.
- This way? Thank you.

564
00:47:51,194 --> 00:47:54,311
Pardon me, does C Charles Blackwell
live this way?

565
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:58,950
- He lives on the next block.
- This way? Thank you. Appreciate it.

566
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:01,713
The house with the pretty flowers.

567
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,148
- Yes, sir?
- Are you Reverend C Charles Blackwell?

568
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,625
- Yes, sir.
- I'm the Apostle EF.

569
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,503
The Lord sent me to have
fellowship with you.

570
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:55,942
If you could spare a minute of your time,
I'd greatly appreciate it.

571
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:59,983
- Come on in.
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

572
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,579
I dreamed that I'd be meeting a man
such as yourself.

573
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:13,816
The Lord told me to come right to you,
and when he talks to me, I always listen.

574
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:16,781
- Yes, sir. I see.
- There you go.

575
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:21,459
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
- You don't have to get up. You're welcome.

576
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:31,378
In my dream, it appeared that I'd talk to you
about starting a church joint.

577
00:49:31,587 --> 00:49:36,058
Talking never hurt nobody
so I thought we might examine the subject,

578
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:38,735
reflect on it, you know.

579
00:49:38,947 --> 00:49:43,622
Yes. Well, pastor,
I don't minister no more.

580
00:49:43,826 --> 00:49:46,579
I'm in touch with some of my people

581
00:49:46,786 --> 00:49:50,825
but most of them have joined
with other churches.

582
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:55,941
I see. Well, if I was to get
with some of those people

583
00:49:56,146 --> 00:49:59,615
and they were willing
to start a new temple, small,

584
00:49:59,825 --> 00:50:03,784
would you be willing to come
and help me in the community?

585
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:06,738
There is a possibility.

586
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:11,496
I don't preach no more.
I had two heart attacks in six months.

587
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:16,983
When I get up on that pulpit
and the spirits start moving in me, praise God,

588
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:21,223
I wouldn't hold back,
and I can't do that no more.

589
00:50:21,424 --> 00:50:25,337
- Amen.
- I got to take everything a little calmer.

590
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:29,138
- Pray to God!
- But I'll pray on it.

591
00:50:30,503 --> 00:50:35,623
You might consider it,
because I've set up temples all over.

592
00:50:37,103 --> 00:50:41,619
Tell me something.
Why should I trust you?

593
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:44,973
Lord knows what you
could have been or done.

594
00:50:45,182 --> 00:50:48,777
We got to look out for the Devil.

595
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:53,100
If he robbed you of your babies,
he could rob somebody here of their babies,

596
00:50:53,302 --> 00:50:56,692
especially if he followed you
from wherever you come from.

597
00:50:56,902 --> 00:51:00,211
Boy, I get it. Right on.

598
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:05,131
Now, you say God led you to me
and not to anybody else?

599
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:08,741
Yes, sir. I do believe that.

600
00:51:11,221 --> 00:51:14,816
If he led you to me,
I could accept that.

601
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:20,140
If he didn't, I'll find out. He's going to
let me know one way or the other.

602
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:25,698
If he did, I'd want to be with you, wouldn't I?
Then I'd be with him, right?

603
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,973
In other words, if he's leading you,
he got to lead me too.

604
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:37,939
You put that a lot better than I can,
that's for sure. Yeah.

605
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:40,209
I'll tell you what.

606
00:51:40,419 --> 00:51:45,651
I'm going to keep my eye on you.
And the Lord keeps his eye on both of us.

607
00:51:45,858 --> 00:51:49,646
And we all three keep our eye out
for the Devil, all right?

608
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:04,007
Hey, what's happening?

609
00:52:13,017 --> 00:52:16,804
Good morning.
I'm Apostle EF. I'm here to see Elmo.

610
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:19,735
Hey, you. I'm Toosie. Welcome to KBBR.

611
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:24,566
I'll just buzz him for you.
He may be on the air at the moment.

612
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:27,529
- You can sit down.
- That's all right. No.

613
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:32,445
- Can I get you some coffee?
- No, thank you. Working hard?

614
00:52:32,655 --> 00:52:35,123
Hardly working!

615
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:40,932
- They're slave-drivers, are they?
- Well, no. They keep me busy.

616
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:44,411
<i>- There's lots of lulls, too.
- What you got, Toosie?</i>

617
00:52:44,615 --> 00:52:47,367
Mr EF's here to see you.

618
00:52:47,574 --> 00:52:50,771
<i>- The Apostle. Send him up.
- Just go on up.</i>

619
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:52,726
I'll see you in a bit.

620
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:56,051
- It was good to meet you.
- Yeah. Ditto.

621
00:52:58,494 --> 00:53:03,089
<i># Ooh, that's why I need ya
Ooh, that's why I love ya</i>

622
00:53:03,293 --> 00:53:08,242
<i># Ooo... that's why I need ya
Da da da</i>

623
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:12,210
- Sir.
- Apostle. How you been?

624
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:15,166
- Good morning.
- Pull up a chair.

625
00:53:15,373 --> 00:53:19,888
- What can I do for the Apostle?
- How did you know I was an apostle?

626
00:53:20,092 --> 00:53:23,687
- News spreads. What can I do for you today?
- I'll tell you.

627
00:53:23,892 --> 00:53:30,730
I'd like to get on the radio to promote
a church I'm trying to get going for the Lord.

628
00:53:30,932 --> 00:53:35,766
Have you had any religious spots
that you sold to preachers to air on?

629
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:39,486
- You bet I have.
- So, how did it work out?

630
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:44,481
I've had a number of preachers.
Some good and some not so good.

631
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:49,002
- How so?
- Well, some have been all right.

632
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:52,805
- Others skipped town before they paid me.
- Is that right?

633
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,164
So it's got to be a pay-before-you-pray deal.
That's what I tell everybody.

634
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,042
There haven't been many lately.

635
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,764
It's a pay-before-you-pray.
That's for those looking to pass through.

636
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:07,279
- I don't blame you.
- One other thing.

637
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:13,325
No fancy stuff. Only the King's English.
No speaking in tongues over these airwaves.

638
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:18,603
- I can understand that.
- What kind of preacher are you, anyway?

639
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:22,687
Well, I can preach on the Holy Trinity,

640
00:54:22,888 --> 00:54:27,279
Old and New Testament, hell, resurrection.
You name it, I can do it.

641
00:54:27,488 --> 00:54:32,039
I can preach on the Devil backwards
and forwards, anything, but no tongues.

642
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:34,477
That sounds good.

643
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:39,681
<i>We'd have to get some money in here
while you got the word out over the air.</i>

644
00:54:39,887 --> 00:54:42,117
<i>Absolutely, make ends meet.</i>

645
00:54:42,327 --> 00:54:46,718
- It's Elmo's place.
- Elmo, he's all over, isn't he?

646
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:50,361
He's something!

647
00:54:50,566 --> 00:54:53,797
He's got his fingers
in almost everything, I guess.

648
00:54:55,686 --> 00:54:59,156
- That's your house?
- Yes, sir. That's it.

649
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:02,358
Where did you learn about cars?

650
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:06,638
From my brother. He used to race them
out at Fresno, California.

651
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:11,999
Anything I know, he taught me.
My brother Robbie, he really is an expert.

652
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:16,118
That ain't no race car or nothing,
but that's it, right there.

653
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:19,635
Looks like you could get someplace
in a hurry in it!

654
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:24,554
It ain't going nowhere right now.
It's just pretty much sitting there.

655
00:55:24,764 --> 00:55:28,916
- I plan to get it... It's got a 350 in it and...
- Looks good.

656
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:32,594
- Looks like you know what you're doing.
- I've been trying.

657
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:37,274
- I've been working for about four years.
- By the way, I'm the Apostle EF.

658
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:39,997
- People do call me EF.
- I'm Sam, EF.

659
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:43,991
- I'm not going to put you out, staying?
- I got plenty of room.

660
00:55:44,203 --> 00:55:47,957
Don't even worry about that.
It's just me, so you're welcome.

661
00:55:48,163 --> 00:55:52,121
I want to paint it black
and everything, but...

662
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:53,755
Do you like it?

663
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:58,035
<i>Lord, I'm not mad.
I'll never be mad at you ever again.</i>

664
00:55:58,242 --> 00:56:01,837
<i>I know you're leading me.
You led me right to Sam.</i>

665
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:07,434
<i>He's a nice little fella. I know you love him
just as I know you love me.</i>

666
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:09,916
<i>So whithersoever thou leadest,</i>

667
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:12,271
<i>I will follow.</i>

668
00:56:13,281 --> 00:56:15,192
There she is.

669
00:56:15,401 --> 00:56:19,758
I pastored here over 27 years
till my health broke down.

670
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,960
Where has everybody gone to? Your flock?

671
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,630
They're all spread out or gone on.

672
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,830
I don't know if you'd be interested in it.
It's just a thought.

673
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,792
I want it.

674
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,638
I'd fight ten men over it. I would.

675
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,591
Glory!

676
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:46,270
Let me tell you something. Hold on now.

677
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:48,788
Here's what I'm going to need.

678
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:51,995
All right, now.

679
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,632
Resurrection time.

680
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:58,831
I need about 29,
30 gallons of white paint,

681
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:01,393
five gallons of another colour for trim.

682
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:04,829
I need cement, glass, mortar, sand,
you name it.

683
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:08,632
And a fair amount of material
for the roof, obviously,

684
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:10,748
but we'll get her done.

685
00:57:10,957 --> 00:57:13,391
I can get her done. Yes, sir.

686
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:18,193
It'll come out of my first two pay cheques.
Third, if necessary.

687
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:23,265
- There ain't no rent, 'cause it belongs to me.
- Well, bless you.

688
00:57:23,476 --> 00:57:26,229
There are a few
back taxes due, that's all.

689
00:57:26,436 --> 00:57:31,351
Really? Well, I can get another job.

690
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:36,869
- I can set these churches up in my sleep.
- You move faster than any man I've seen.

691
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:42,229
When I was young, I'd tell everybody
I quit school because I didn't like recess.

692
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:44,391
I did, yeah.

693
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:48,309
Now, this is something here.

694
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:50,426
Let's see, now.

695
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,944
You got a good
foundation here. Yes, sir.

696
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:56,987
Inside... You got no lock.

697
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:00,948
Hold on now.

698
00:58:02,554 --> 00:58:06,024
I could do some
shouting in here! Yes, sir.

699
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:11,671
This is a shouting church. I'm going to shout
something for the Holy Ghost.

700
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:16,185
Well, that'll do me just fine,
if you're sure.

701
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:19,749
- I'm positive.
- That'll do me fine.

702
00:58:19,953 --> 00:58:23,662
Bless you. You're a good man.
Glory be to God!

703
00:58:23,873 --> 00:58:27,023
Praise him. Glory! Praise him.

704
00:58:27,232 --> 00:58:28,585
Glory.

705
00:58:30,112 --> 00:58:32,785
God bless you. Have a good day.

706
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:39,143
- Snow cone?
- We don't have no snow cones.

707
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:43,390
Snow cones are down the street! Hold on.
Here you go.

708
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:45,786
There you go. Lollipop.

709
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:49,107
Snow cones!

710
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,779
Good amigo, friend, Joe.

711
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:37,503
<i>- Sonny. How's it going?
- Good.</i>

712
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,984
<i>- So?
- Horace ain't doing too good.</i>

713
00:59:41,188 --> 00:59:45,863
- Do you hold it against me?
- No way. I'd have done the same thing myself.

714
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:52,176
- I want you to be all right 'cause I love you.
- He's still in a coma?

715
00:59:52,387 --> 00:59:57,460
The whole church is praying for him
round the clock in one-hour shifts.

716
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:01,375
The police have questions?
Maybe I shouldn't call you.

717
01:00:01,586 --> 01:00:04,942
Maybe for a while.
They asked me a bunch of questions.

718
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:09,583
I told them I didn't know where you are,
which is the truth.

719
01:00:09,786 --> 01:00:13,824
Joe, how come I haven't been able
to get hold of Mama?

720
01:00:14,025 --> 01:00:17,574
I tried quite a few times
and there's no answer.

721
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:22,859
I've been meaning to tell you.
Your mother's been in the hospital.

722
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:27,740
- I didn't know how to get hold of you.
- What's wrong, Joe?

723
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:32,176
I don't know, Sonny. Something to do
with her kidneys, I think.

724
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:36,343
What's the telephone number?
What hospital is she in?

725
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:40,059
I can't give you the number.
You can't be calling.

726
01:00:40,264 --> 01:00:43,494
Them switchboards,
the police is all over them.

727
01:00:43,703 --> 01:00:48,777
- OK. Would you go visit her for me, Joe?
- I visit her every day.

728
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:52,453
- I will continue to.
- Yeah.

729
01:00:52,663 --> 01:00:55,223
I'm going now. I love you, son.

730
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,936
<i>- You toeing the line?
- Yeah. I am.</i>

731
01:00:58,142 --> 01:00:59,575
<i>God bless you.</i>

732
01:01:03,142 --> 01:01:07,340
Getting back at me, Lord, ain't you?
Getting back at me.

733
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:10,454
Forgive me, Mama.

734
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:25,776
Reverend Blackwell, I'd like to start
an orphanage. What do you think?

735
01:01:25,981 --> 01:01:31,418
- One thing at a time, Apostle.
- I know. Maybe a year from now.

736
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,770
I'd like to do something
for the fatherless.

737
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,373
When Satan robs you of your children
it makes you want to help others.

738
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:43,812
It all takes money. We'll get there.
It all takes time.

739
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:48,171
We'll create a little interest on the radio.
Elmo's going to plug us.

740
01:01:48,379 --> 01:01:51,337
- And we have a newspaper, don't we?
- Yeah.

741
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:56,454
Extra! Extra! Read all about it.
The Holy Ghost man is here right now.

742
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:59,695
The Jesus people is here! Yeah!

743
01:01:59,898 --> 01:02:02,696
The Lord's moving in me,
telling me things.

744
01:02:02,898 --> 01:02:06,174
What do you think, baby?
The Lord's moving in me.

745
01:02:06,378 --> 01:02:08,289
Telling me things.

746
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:13,414
- Lean on that brush, Sam.
- I'm leaning.

747
01:02:13,618 --> 01:02:17,007
I'll tell you, we'll have dinner on the ground,
play softball.

748
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:21,415
I pitch a mean curve ball.
Play the Methodists. Sell some tickets.

749
01:02:21,617 --> 01:02:26,213
- Get some good publicity.
- Don't get so far ahead of yourself.

750
01:02:26,417 --> 01:02:31,444
We'll show the community
that the Holy Lord is here to stay.

751
01:02:31,656 --> 01:02:34,454
- Praise God.
- Can't get rid of him.

752
01:02:34,656 --> 01:02:35,930
Lord.

753
01:02:36,136 --> 01:02:41,927
I'm preaching like I'm going to war
this morning. I've got on my war clothes.

754
01:02:42,136 --> 01:02:46,925
I'm a genuine Holy Ghost Jesus-filled
preaching machine here this morning.

755
01:02:47,135 --> 01:02:50,764
I'm a genuine Holy Ghost Jesus-filled
preaching machine here this morning.

756
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:54,172
If God be for us, who can be against us?

757
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:57,765
He's God here in this radio station.
He's God in Georgia.

758
01:02:57,975 --> 01:03:03,765
He's God in Tennessee. He's God
at the front door. He's God in the 7-Eleven.

759
01:03:03,974 --> 01:03:08,365
And yea, though I walk,
I say yea, though I walk

760
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:13,728
through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil for thou are with me.

761
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:18,165
Why do I say this?
Because I got Holy Ghost power here today.

762
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:22,286
We're going to have a Holy Ghost explosion
and short-circuit the Devil.

763
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:26,042
The Holy Ghost is
our power line to heaven.

764
01:03:26,253 --> 01:03:29,404
In days of old,
Moses went up into the mountain.

765
01:03:29,613 --> 01:03:33,491
When he got up in the mountain,
high on the mountain,

766
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:36,843
our Lord God above
gave him ten commandments.

767
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:40,806
Not 11, 12, 13 or 14.
He gave him ten commandments.

768
01:03:41,012 --> 01:03:45,642
And the 11th commandment,
"Thou shall not shout" does not exist.

769
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:54,445
Hallelujah! How did I do?

770
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:59,600
It seems you did fine to me.
I've never heard anyone speak like that.

771
01:03:59,811 --> 01:04:04,008
- You never did? Praise God.
- Preachers I heard, they just talk.

772
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:09,000
- I was fascinated by it.
- When we're ready, come over to our church.

773
01:04:09,210 --> 01:04:13,203
You won't see nobody sitting on their hands,
will you, Brother Blackwell?

774
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,162
Not too many.

775
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:18,281
- I don't believe in going to church in a morgue.
- I can believe that.

776
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:20,684
We're not the frozen children.

777
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:27,403
Seriously, I'd like to get you out
to dinner sometime before church.

778
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:33,444
That way you won't get scared off.
I promise I'll be quiet at you across the table.

779
01:04:33,648 --> 01:04:36,003
- OK?
- Well, that might be nice.

780
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:39,200
- We'll see.
- Well, I'm getting back to work.

781
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,763
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

Revelation! Glory.

- Revelation! Glory. We're on fire for Jesus.
- Revelation!

01:05:36,204 --> 01:05:38,718
We're on fire for Jesus.

794
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:51,201
How's that?

795
01:05:53,963 --> 01:05:56,921
What do you think you're going to have?

796
01:05:57,123 --> 01:06:00,399
Give me a chance to read the menu.

797
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:04,118
- I know what I'm going to have.
- What?

798
01:06:04,323 --> 01:06:07,837
I'm going to have me
some of these Gulf shrimps.

799
01:06:09,362 --> 01:06:11,751
I guess I'll have the same.

800
01:06:11,962 --> 01:06:14,351
- Sure?
- Yeah. That'll be fine.

801
01:06:15,202 --> 01:06:16,840
Good.

802
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:22,595
What?

803
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:24,359
Nothing.

804
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:33,840
Whatever possessed
you to move down here?

805
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:38,909
My husband got a good offer
on the offshore boats.

806
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,318
Your husband?
That's the end of this deal, isn't it?

807
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,912
No. We're kind of separated
at the moment.

808
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,953
Lord, please let it work in my favour!

809
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:54,992
Yeah. Have any kids?

810
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,828
I have two boys.
They stay with my mother.

811
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:03,635
- Where at?
- Bowling Green, Kentucky.

812
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,513
- You ask a lot of questions.
- Do I?

813
01:07:07,718 --> 01:07:09,948
I guess I do. Yeah.

814
01:07:10,438 --> 01:07:13,669
I evangelised there a time or two.

815
01:07:13,878 --> 01:07:18,668
Yeah, there were a lot of preachers
come through when I was a girl.

816
01:07:18,878 --> 01:07:22,916
I could have been one of them,
but it's been a while.

817
01:07:26,117 --> 01:07:29,666
- Do you have any children?
- I have a boy and a girl.

818
01:07:29,877 --> 01:07:32,710
My beauties. I call them my beauties.

819
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:36,227
- Where do they live?
- A long way from here.

820
01:07:36,437 --> 01:07:39,030
Same as yours. Yes, ma'am.

821
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:43,792
Yep. Do you miss your babies a lot?

822
01:07:43,996 --> 01:07:46,032
Yes, I do.

823
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:49,990
They're not exactly babies
any more, but...

824
01:07:51,356 --> 01:07:52,993
...yes, I do miss them.

825
01:07:56,515 --> 01:07:58,983
So...

826
01:08:01,155 --> 01:08:04,704
You think I'm a good date?
What do you think?

827
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:08,384
- What do you mean?
- How am I doing so far?

828
01:08:08,594 --> 01:08:11,506
- You're not supposed to ask that.
- Aren't I?

829
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:17,869
No. You're supposed to let the evening
develop and draw your own conclusion.

830
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,065
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

831
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:30,065
Well, I wouldn't have gone out with you
if I'd been thinking...

832
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:40,342
Thank you.

833
01:08:44,232 --> 01:08:46,302
Now, hold on a minute.

834
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:52,070
Dear Lord, thank you for this food
we're about to receive.

835
01:08:52,272 --> 01:08:56,230
Thank you for the fellowship
between a good woman and a good man.

836
01:08:56,431 --> 01:08:59,548
We thank you for the day in Jesus' name.
Amen.

837
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:02,629
Amen.

838
01:09:02,831 --> 01:09:04,867
Now you can eat.

839
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:17,989
You've got...

840
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:22,305
- I'm a big pig.
- No.

841
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:28,061
<i>When I was really young, my mother
would sing I Love To Tell The Story.</i>

842
01:09:28,269 --> 01:09:32,581
That's always been a favourite
of my family as well.

843
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:39,103
<i># I love to tell the story

844
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,821

846

01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:53,899

848
01:09:54,108 --> 01:09:55,460
Yeah.

849
01:09:56,507 --> 01:09:59,419
- Well...
- What do you think?

850
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:02,141
This going to be it?

851
01:10:02,347 --> 01:10:05,180
- I have to think about it.
- Yeah.

852
01:10:05,387 --> 01:10:08,106
- I told you we're separated.
- Yeah.

853
01:10:08,307 --> 01:10:12,822
I can't see you any more.
This is the end.

854
01:10:13,026 --> 01:10:15,586
I told you we'd see.

855
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:18,823
Silly! I've had a real nice time.

856
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:22,738
- Did you really?
- Real nice. Yes, I did.

857
01:10:24,586 --> 01:10:26,735
Come here. Come over here.

858
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:32,495
Come here.

859
01:10:34,305 --> 01:10:36,375
Give me a hug!

860
01:10:36,585 --> 01:10:40,658
I can have a hug at least, can't I?

861
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:43,583
Of course you can!

862
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:48,015
Sweet thing.

863
01:10:49,304 --> 01:10:51,181
Yeah. OK.

864
01:10:55,144 --> 01:10:57,452
I had a super time.

865
01:10:58,263 --> 01:11:01,494

- We'll see.

He is co-pastoring
with the Reverend C Charles Blackwell.

892
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:43,041
You're not only safe in his hands,
but you are truly in God's hands

893
01:14:43,249 --> 01:14:47,161
<i>on this day of worship in Bayou Boutt
near Pecan Island, Louisiana.</i>

894
01:14:47,368 --> 01:14:50,519
<i>Remember, for one month,
for both Sunday services,</i>

895
01:14:50,728 --> 01:14:55,404
<i>the Apostle EF will pick you up
at the spot designated for each of you.</i>

896
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:58,122
I don't want you running.
Take your time.

897
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:02,525
I want you to act right on that bus,
you hear me?

898
01:15:02,727 --> 01:15:06,242
We're going to praise the Lord. I don't want
to have to get disruptive,

899
01:15:06,447 --> 01:15:08,085
to have to whup you.

900
01:15:09,407 --> 01:15:12,319
We're going to praise the Lord,
have a good time.

901
01:15:12,527 --> 01:15:16,406
<i>You'll also receive a small rose
of Sharon from the Apostle himself.</i>

902
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:19,757
<i>Those who play, please bring
your instruments. God bless you.</i>

903
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:23,561
- Morning. How are you doing, Apostle?
- Here's a rose of Sharon.

904
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:26,234
Praise God. Thank you.

905
01:15:26,446 --> 01:15:29,438
- What's your name, sister?
- Sister Johnson.

906
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:33,160
- Good morning, Sister Johnson.
- God bless you, brother. How you doing?

907
01:15:33,365 --> 01:15:35,356
- You boys ready for church?
- Yes, sir.

908
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:39,604
They're ready for church.
They've been getting ready all the morning.

909
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:43,994
Yes, sir. They're twins. They're
double trouble and double blessings.

910
01:15:44,205 --> 01:15:46,275
Wait for me!

911
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:51,080
Lord Jesus, you were able to stop him.
Thank you. Hallelujah. Glory to God.

912
01:15:51,284 --> 01:15:54,117
- Wait! Here I am!
- We're waiting for you.

913
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:55,962
Thank you, Jesus.

914
01:15:56,164 --> 01:16:01,602
- Here's a pretty rose of Sharon for you.
- Thank God for you! Hi, Brother Blackwell.

915
01:16:01,804 --> 01:16:06,035
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you. Going to church.

916
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:36,834
Hey, ma'am. How you doing? Welcome to
One Way Road To Heaven. Come in.

917
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,797
Living God. Thank you.

918
01:16:41,521 --> 01:16:44,274
- Sammy, how are you?
- Real good.

919
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:48,679
Come on, boys. Let's go now.
Go to your grandma.

920
01:16:48,881 --> 01:16:52,668
- Come on in.
- Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Apostle.

921
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,678
- I got you there in one piece!
- Praise God!

922
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,873
- Welcome to One Way Road To Heaven.
- Praise God.

923
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,469
Always a pleasure.

924
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:10,469
Apostle, I know what you're thinking.

925
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:15,833
Whenever you've been on the radio,
most of the white people think you're black.

926
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:21,317
Most coloured people know you ain't black,
but they like your style of preaching.

927
01:17:21,518 --> 01:17:26,308
- What you see is what we get.
- What we got, the Lord sent.

928
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:29,271
I'll see you in a minute. Thank you.

929
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:30,957
Yeah.

930
01:17:35,157 --> 01:17:39,196
"He whom God has sent
speaketh the words of God. "

931
01:17:39,397 --> 01:17:42,195
Yeah. John 3:34.

932
01:17:52,716 --> 01:17:55,913
- We're going to have church this morning.
- Oh, yes.

933
01:17:56,116 --> 01:18:00,667
Let's hear somebody say, "We're going
to have church here this morning. "

934
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:05,074
We're going to have
church here this morning.

935
01:18:05,276 --> 01:18:07,072
Yes, Lord.

936
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:11,268
Let's put our hands together
and welcome Jesus Christ into our church.

937
01:18:11,475 --> 01:18:13,352
This is his home.

938
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,227
This is his home.

939
01:18:15,435 --> 01:18:19,428
If this isn't his home,
we'd better go and lock this place up.

940
01:18:19,635 --> 01:18:24,503
We'd better always be ready
to make God welcome in our house of worship.

941
01:18:24,714 --> 01:18:29,105
- 'Cause this is his home. Glory be to God.
- Amen!

942
01:18:29,994 --> 01:18:33,748
I'm not going to take any offerings.
That'll be next week.

943
01:18:33,954 --> 01:18:36,592
I won't pass the collection plate today.

944
01:18:36,793 --> 01:18:41,662
But when I do, if you bring ten dollars,
you give me one for the church.

945
01:18:41,873 --> 01:18:45,104
Ten potatoes, you give one potato.
Ten pigs, one pig.

946
01:18:45,313 --> 01:18:47,304
Ten per cent.

947
01:18:47,513 --> 01:18:51,869
Here's what I want you to do.
Open your Bibles. You brought your Bibles?

948
01:18:52,072 --> 01:18:56,304
Open your Bibles to the 150th psalm,
the last psalm there is.

949
01:18:56,512 --> 01:19:00,903
We're going to praise him.
The 150th psalm says, "Praise ye the Lord. "

950
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:04,787
"Praise God in his sanctuary.
Praise him in the firmament of his power. "

951
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:08,825
- Praise him.
- "Praise him for his mighty acts. "

952
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:12,944
"Praise him according
to his excellent greatness. "

953
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,904
"Praise him with the sound
of a trumpet. "

954
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:19,387
Do we have a trumpet here today?
We got a trumpet?

955
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:21,468
Amen.

956
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:31,546
We have a trumpet!

957
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,503
Thank you, sir. That's great.

958
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:40,944
"Praise him with a harp. "
I don't think we've got a harp here.

959
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:43,709
"Praise him with a timbrel. "

960
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:47,822
- Hallelujah!
- I guess that's what you call a timbrel.

961
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:50,021
I love it, I love it.

962
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:54,380
"Praise him with stringed instruments
and organs. " We got no organ player.

963
01:19:54,588 --> 01:19:58,376
Do we have a stringed instrument?
Come on, son!

964
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:02,824
Praise him, brothers.

965
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:11,860
Praise him!

966
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:15,858
- Out of the mouth of babes.
- Amen.

967
01:20:16,627 --> 01:20:18,697
Yes, Lord.

968
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:21,057
Glory. Glory be to God.

969
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:28,063
OK. That's enough. Thank you.

970
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:29,699
That's enough.

971
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:36,464
Reach over and hug somebody's neck and
say, "I love you and the Lord loves you today. "

972
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:41,455
Don't be strangers. We're all in the house
of Jesus. Nobody's going to bite you.

973
01:20:41,665 --> 01:20:43,735
I love you and the Lord loves you.

974
01:20:43,945 --> 01:20:46,937
- I love you, Grandma.
- I love you, sister.

975
01:20:47,905 --> 01:20:51,261
- I love you and the Lord loves you.
- Lord loves you, too, sweetie.

976
01:20:56,824 --> 01:20:59,384
Let's everybody come up and join hands.

977
01:21:00,504 --> 01:21:05,294
Let's form a little Holy Ghost circle.
We're small but we're powerful.

978
01:21:05,504 --> 01:21:09,053
- Say, "We're small but we're powerful. "
- We're small but we're powerful.

979
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:13,415
- Yes, Lord.
- Wherever two or more...

980
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:16,820
Welcome to the radio station KBBR
in Bayou Boutté, Louisiana.

981
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:20,698
The Apostle EF and his glorious choir
are going to sing for us.

982
01:21:20,903 --> 01:21:25,976
I'm going to fly away. I've got me
my own airplane. I'm going to take off.

983
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:29,333
I'm not going to Jackson, Mississippi
or Chicago, Illinois.

984
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:34,013
I'm not going to Paris, France.
I'm going down that runway to heaven.

985
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:37,976
I'm going to say,
"Get out of the way, moon and stars.

986
01:21:38,182 --> 01:21:42,220
"I'm on my way to heaven. " Come on!

God, it's a miracle.
Where did this come from?

996

Happy Thanksgiving!

Thank you, brothers. God bless you.

That's real good. The kids are good.

1020
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:46,480
How come they call you EF?
You ain't got a whole name?

1021
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:48,884
Well...

1022
01:24:50,689 --> 01:24:54,159
Maybe I do. Maybe I don't. How are you?

1023
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:59,318
I just came to see what was going on.
Them kids friends of yours?

1024
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:02,645
They're just children of the Lord,
put it that way.

1025
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,157
We are Jesus' church.
They're Jesus' children.

1026
01:25:05,368 --> 01:25:09,077
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir. Can you take your hat off?

1027
01:25:09,288 --> 01:25:13,440
I'm sorry. Standing in the house
of the Lord with my hat on.

1028
01:25:13,648 --> 01:25:15,842
Can I do anything for you?

1029
01:25:16,047 --> 01:25:19,926
I'm just kind of curious
why they call you EF. I don't know.

1030
01:25:20,127 --> 01:25:24,643
That's no concern of anybody's
but mine and the Lord's.

1031
01:25:24,847 --> 01:25:28,476
If you'd like to discuss
this outside, that's fine.

1032
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:31,837
- You going to preach to me?
- No, sir. I'm not.

1033
01:25:32,046 --> 01:25:35,482
- What's your problem?
- I don't have no problem. You do.

1034
01:25:35,686 --> 01:25:38,883
I don't think working
for the Lord is a problem.

1035
01:25:39,086 --> 01:25:43,523
If you want to come back into our church
as a gentleman, that's all right.

1036
01:25:43,726 --> 01:25:45,682
Otherwise, just go home.

1037
01:25:45,886 --> 01:25:49,195
I ain't going into any church
with anybody named EF.

1038
01:25:49,405 --> 01:25:54,035
- I don't want to sit with a bunch of niggers.
- Just get on out of here.

1039
01:25:54,245 --> 01:25:56,679
I'll leave when I choose to, Mr EF.

1040
01:25:56,885 --> 01:26:01,117
Come round to the other side, buddy.
Let's see what you're made of.

1041
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:05,920
- Want the Lord to watch me kick your ass?
- I don't need the Lord.

1042
01:26:30,603 --> 01:26:36,154
- Can you believe this?
- Ever seen a preacher hit anybody like that?

1043
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:42,321
Take your hat and get out
of here. Get on out.

1044
01:26:42,522 --> 01:26:46,037
- I don't want to see your face again.
- I'm going to come back.

1045
01:26:46,242 --> 01:26:50,712
- You'll get the same thing again, won't you?
- We'll see about that.

1046
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,829
I appreciate your support. It's not the Christian
thing to do. You should turn the other cheek.

1047
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:16,917
If you do, somebody's going to take your
church. Nobody's going to take my church.

1048
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:21,753
- I love this church.
- It's yours.

1049
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:26,396
More than I do myself.
Nobody's going to destroy it.

1050
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:29,909
- Somebody give me an amen!
- Amen.

1051
01:27:42,478 --> 01:27:47,677
<i># I love to tell the story</i>

1052

1063
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:16,066
Here we go again.

1064
01:29:16,272 --> 01:29:19,070
- Yeah.
- All right.

1065
01:29:19,272 --> 01:29:24,391
At least tonight,
I'm going to walk you to the front door.

1066
01:29:25,631 --> 01:29:28,225
I am. Right up on the front porch.

1067
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:32,669
Yes, ma'am.

1068
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:36,105
- Yep.
- Well...

1069
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:43,101
So... you think I'm intense, do you?

1070
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:46,347
- A little.
- Yeah?

1071
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:50,668
Well, I fit in pretty good, though,
don't you think?

1072
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:53,588
I don't always have to talk of the Lord.

1073
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:56,940
I think about him a lot.
I'm not like other preachers.

1074
01:29:57,149 --> 01:30:02,746
I'm trying to say I'm a man. You're
a woman. I feel comfortable with you.

1075
01:30:04,469 --> 01:30:07,983
- And I like you.
- Well, I like you.

1076
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:11,906
- You do understand me?
- Yes. I do.

1077
01:30:14,268 --> 01:30:16,224
You hear me? Mm-hm.

1078
01:30:16,948 --> 01:30:18,461
Come here.

1079
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:26,340
Come on, woman. Come on.

1080
01:30:39,866 --> 01:30:42,255
Now, what does EF stand for?

1081
01:30:43,866 --> 01:30:47,302
- What do you want to know for?
- Because.

1082
01:30:49,106 --> 01:30:51,336
Let me come in and I'll tell you.

1083
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:53,820
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1084
01:30:56,425 --> 01:30:59,895
- Next time.
- Maybe there won't be a next time.

1085
01:31:00,105 --> 01:31:02,539
Listen to me, Toosie.

1086
01:31:03,905 --> 01:31:08,739
All I need is somebody to hold on to
at this time in my life.

1087
01:31:08,944 --> 01:31:12,300
That's why I want to come in. You understand?

1088
01:31:15,064 --> 01:31:16,861
Next time.

1089
01:31:17,064 --> 01:31:18,941
Yes, ma'am.

1090
01:31:24,703 --> 01:31:26,500
I got to go!

1091
01:31:26,703 --> 01:31:28,694
You're too much.

1092
01:31:30,223 --> 01:31:32,293
Can I go with you?

1093
01:31:32,503 --> 01:31:34,334
Next time.

1094
01:31:49,382 --> 01:31:52,499
Call me Sonny. Everybody calls me Sonny.

1095
01:31:59,381 --> 01:32:02,418
I'm going to have to, Joe, somehow.

1096
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:06,978
<i>- You'd better do it soon.
- I don't know how, but somehow.</i>

1097
01:32:07,341 --> 01:32:10,332
<i>She needs you pretty bad.</i>

1098
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:15,489
<i>I've been visiting her most every day.
She asks for you a lot.</i>

1099
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,976
<i>Sometimes she thinks I'm you
and calls me Sonny.</i>

1100
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,570
<i>I'm going to try to make it.
Tell her to hold on.</i>

1101
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:27,534
<i>I will, brother.
Be very careful, whatever you do.</i>

1102
01:32:27,739 --> 01:32:33,848
<i>Tell her that I built the prettiest little church
this side of heaven out in the wild wood.</i>

1103
01:32:34,059 --> 01:32:35,572
<i>Tell her that.</i>

1104
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:42,371
Tell her the bad boy done it again.
I can't make it.

1105
01:32:42,578 --> 01:32:46,571
I'm going to try, but tell her to hold on.

1106
01:32:47,578 --> 01:32:50,012
<i>OK, Sonny. I will.</i>

1107
01:32:50,218 --> 01:32:52,368
Bye, buddy. I love you.

1108
01:33:08,577 --> 01:33:13,604
A spare tyre without a jack
is like a church without Jesus.

1109
01:33:13,816 --> 01:33:16,967
- Is this what you're looking for?
- Where was that, Sister Delilah?

1110
01:33:17,176 --> 01:33:21,169
- Underneath the seat.
- Give it to me. Glory! Thank you.

1111
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:25,927
Amen! Everybody give a handclap to Jesus.

1112
01:33:26,135 --> 01:33:29,286
He speaks to me, talks to me most of the time.

1113
01:33:29,495 --> 01:33:34,694
You probably never hear 'cause you run your
mouth all the time. You never hear anything.

1114
01:33:34,895 --> 01:33:37,932
Sister Johnson, you'd better get off the bus.

1115
01:33:38,135 --> 01:33:43,731
If you don't, Apostle EF won't be able
to jack it up high enough to put the spare on.

1116
01:33:43,934 --> 01:33:47,722
Ladies, the Lord's not going to take
to all this nit-picking.

1117
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:51,244
- I ain't saying nothing.
- Nothing from nothing leaves nothing.

1118
01:33:51,454 --> 01:33:54,446
Come on. Off the bus.
We're going to jack it up.

1119
01:33:54,654 --> 01:33:59,408
I don't like this nit-picking and yelling
at each other. It's the Sabbath day. Come on!

1120
01:33:59,613 --> 01:34:02,923
Let's give a big handclap for Jesus Christ.

1121
01:34:03,133 --> 01:34:07,251
- Sister Johnson, come over here.
- Praise the Lord. Hallelujah!

1122
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:11,924
I want you to love this woman's neck.
Make up. No more fighting.

1123
01:34:12,133 --> 01:34:17,331
<i># At the church, O Lord

1126

<i>And this is radio station KBBR.</i>

1127
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:48,923
We're live from the One Way Road
To Heaven holiness temple

1128
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:52,327
out on Highway 10, north of town -
old Highway 10.

1129
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:56,159
Today's the one-month anniversary
of the first service the church held.

1130
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,964
That first service was mighty slim -
seven, eight people.

1131
01:35:00,169 --> 01:35:03,684
It's grown in one month.
The grounds are full of people.

1132
01:35:03,889 --> 01:35:08,485
I can see kids playing with Frisbees,
kick balls, baseballs, softballs.

1133
01:35:08,689 --> 01:35:11,601
- We've got an old-fashioned sack race.
- Get set, go!

1134
01:35:11,809 --> 01:35:13,844
Let's see if we've got a winner!

1135
01:35:14,048 --> 01:35:19,076
We've got chicken. We've got a cake auction.

1136
01:35:19,288 --> 01:35:22,121
2.95, 3.95, 4.95.

1137
01:35:29,287 --> 01:35:32,643
- You've got to put a little weight on.
- Oh, yes!

1138
01:35:37,127 --> 01:35:41,166
- It's a glorious day! Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, it is.

1139
01:35:59,246 --> 01:36:05,115
We could have used you this morning
for a bit of bus transportation. Welcome.

1140
01:36:10,885 --> 01:36:14,719
- I told you I'd come back.
- You did. You told me that.

1141
01:36:14,924 --> 01:36:20,396
If you'd like to join in the auction,
we have some fair homemade cakes and pies.

1142
01:36:20,604 --> 01:36:25,359
- You're welcome to bid.
- We ain't here to bid on no cakes and pies.

1143
01:36:25,564 --> 01:36:28,556
What are you here for, then, cowboy?

1144
01:36:28,764 --> 01:36:32,199
- You'd better step out of there.
- Stand your ground, Apostle.

1145
01:36:32,403 --> 01:36:35,475
- Why?
- I'm here to take that church of yours out.

1146
01:36:35,683 --> 01:36:39,392
- No, sir.
- I'm bringing it down. We don't want it here.

1147
01:36:39,603 --> 01:36:43,994
Nobody goes anywhere
and that house of God stays right where it's at.

1148
01:36:44,203 --> 01:36:47,956
- Amen.
- Glory to Jesus.

1149
01:36:48,162 --> 01:36:50,722
Now, what you got to say for yourself?

1150
01:36:50,922 --> 01:36:55,518
You can say "amen" all you want to,
but I'm taking that church out.

1151
01:36:55,722 --> 01:36:58,794
See this? You see it?

1152
01:36:59,002 --> 01:37:03,631
- Yeah. I see that book.
- I'll open it up to the 91 st psalm.

1153
01:37:03,841 --> 01:37:09,916
"He that dwelleth in the place of the most high
shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. "

1154
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:18,833
If you go to that church,
go over that holy book first.

1155
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,918
If you do,
I don't want to sit where you're sitting.

1156
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:26,511
- Apostle, maybe I'd better call the police.
- Don't call the police.

1157
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,473
We and the Lord will handle it.

1158
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:34,355
He's going to strike you down on a Sunday
afternoon like you've never been struck.

1159
01:37:34,559 --> 01:37:36,470
- Do I hear an amen?
- Amen!

1160
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:38,874
Don't you threaten me like that.

1161
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:41,274
- You move that Bible!
- No, sir.

1162
01:37:41,479 --> 01:37:45,870
- I want you to move it right now.
- No, sir.

1163
01:37:46,998 --> 01:37:49,432
- God's on our side.
- I hear somebody say "amen".

1164
01:37:49,638 --> 01:37:52,436
- Amen.
- Who's with us right now? The Holy Ghost.

1165
01:37:52,638 --> 01:37:54,390
Amen!

1166
01:37:54,598 --> 01:37:58,227
- Pick that Bible up right there.
- I can't do that.

1167
01:37:58,438 --> 01:38:02,316
The book stays where it's at.
Did I hear someone say "amen"?

1168
01:38:02,517 --> 01:38:05,270
- Amen.
- Glory. Hallelujah.

1169
01:38:07,517 --> 01:38:11,510
We have Holy Ghost power here right now.

1170
01:38:11,717 --> 01:38:16,268
I can pick a Bible up myself.
Don't start your preacher stuff with me.

1171
01:38:16,477 --> 01:38:21,186
No weapon formed against us
shall prosper. Hallelujah! Amen!

1172
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:24,115
- Glory to God.
- Don't look at me like that.

1173
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:29,913
I know what you're trying to do
and you think I can be had, don't you?

1174
01:38:34,955 --> 01:38:37,708
Nobody moves that book.

1175
01:38:37,915 --> 01:38:41,669
I can move it just as quick as you can.

1176
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,388
No, sir.

1177
01:38:50,954 --> 01:38:54,469
- Everybody say, "Nobody moves that book. "
- Nobody moves that book.

1178
01:38:54,674 --> 01:38:57,029
Say it one more time.

1179
01:38:57,234 --> 01:39:00,192
And a third time. And a fourth time.

1180
01:39:00,394 --> 01:39:04,306
- "Nobody moves that book. "
- One more time.

1181
01:39:04,513 --> 01:39:06,310
No, sir. Nobody.

1182
01:39:17,233 --> 01:39:19,951
I know why you came here.

1183
01:39:20,152 --> 01:39:25,385
You didn't come to knock my church down.
You came for another reason.

1184
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,186
- I came to knock your church down.
- No, sir.

1185
01:39:28,392 --> 01:39:30,542
Yes, sir. I did.

1186
01:39:31,512 --> 01:39:34,981
You ain't going to knock it down.
I want you to know that.

1187
01:39:35,871 --> 01:39:41,503
Folks, I'm just having a hard time. I'll position
myself where I can hear a little better.

1188
01:39:41,711 --> 01:39:43,429
There it is.

1189
01:39:47,351 --> 01:39:50,581
I didn't come to knock your church down.

1190
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:55,739
Yes, sir. I know.
That's why I'm kneeling with you.

1191
01:39:55,950 --> 01:40:01,468
I'll pray with you if you want me to.
I'll do anything you want me to do.

1192
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:04,138
'Cause I know you're a good man.

1193
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,941
I know it.

1194
01:40:06,149 --> 01:40:09,824
The young man's not nearly as angry.

1195
01:40:10,029 --> 01:40:15,228
- In fact, I believe he has a tear in his eye.
- Amen.

1196
01:40:15,429 --> 01:40:20,980
If you reach out,
the Lord will accept you here today.

1197
01:40:21,188 --> 01:40:25,306
If you reach out,
he'll accept you here for evermore.

1198
01:40:25,508 --> 01:40:30,628
He will love you for ever,
even as we in this church love you now

1199
01:40:30,828 --> 01:40:32,819
and for evermore.

1200
01:40:33,028 --> 01:40:35,462
- Do I hear somebody say "amen"?
- Amen.

1201
01:40:36,187 --> 01:40:40,100
This may be the very first conversion
we've had over the airwaves.

1202
01:40:40,307 --> 01:40:42,184
Amen.

1203
01:40:42,387 --> 01:40:44,901
In fact, I'm sure that it is.

1204
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:49,660
- I'm embarrassed.
- You don't have to feel embarrassed.

1205
01:40:49,867 --> 01:40:56,180
- I feel embarrassed by it.
- I was a worse sinner than you were.

1206
01:40:56,386 --> 01:41:01,221
This is an incredible sight. I'm being as quiet
as possible not to disturb this moment.

1207
01:41:01,426 --> 01:41:07,102
This is an important moment in this young
man's life, more than he can realise.

1208
01:41:07,305 --> 01:41:09,375
Go ahead, brother. Cry.

1209
01:41:09,585 --> 01:41:15,979
I'll cry with you. Does somebody say
"The Holy Ghost is here right now"?

1210
01:41:16,185 --> 01:41:19,222
- The Holy Ghost is here right now.
- Say it again.

1211
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:24,942
- The Holy Ghost is here right now.
- We love the Holy Ghost.

1212
01:41:25,144 --> 01:41:27,612
Wonderful Jesus!

1213
01:41:27,824 --> 01:41:29,655
Victory is ours today.

1214
01:41:29,864 --> 01:41:34,654
<i># Victory is mine
Victory is mine</i>

1215
01:41:34,864 --> 01:41:39,778
<i># Victory today is mine</i>

1216
01:41:39,983 --> 01:41:45,341
<i># I told Satan, "Get thee behind"</i>

1217
01:41:45,543 --> 01:41:50,094
<i># Victory today is mine</i>

1218
01:41:50,783 --> 01:41:56,379
<i># Joy is mine
Joy is mine</i>

1219
01:41:56,582 --> 01:42:01,451
<i># Joy today is mine</i>

1220
01:42:01,662 --> 01:42:07,259
<i># I told Satan, "Get thee behind"</i>

1221
01:42:07,462 --> 01:42:11,739
<i># Joy today is mine</i>

1222
01:42:11,941 --> 01:42:16,457
<i># Happiness is mine
Happiness is mine...</i>

1223
01:42:17,061 --> 01:42:22,215
This is an absolutely incredible day.
I don't know what to say.

1224
01:42:22,421 --> 01:42:25,492
I absolutely don't know what to say.

1225
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:30,774
For those of you who know me,
for me to be speechless...

1226
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:35,098
Well, you'd better mark
this on your calendar.

1227
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:39,053
<i># Love is mine
Love is mine</i>

1228
01:42:39,259 --> 01:42:43,889
<i># Love today is mine</i>

1229
01:42:44,099 --> 01:42:49,617
<i># I told Satan, "Get thee behind"</i>

1230
01:42:49,819 --> 01:42:53,573
<i># Victory today is mine d</i>

1231
01:42:53,778 --> 01:42:56,815
Let's praise him today. Jesus Christ!

1232
01:42:59,818 --> 01:43:02,571
Doesn't working here tire you out
for preaching?

1233
01:43:02,778 --> 01:43:08,648
I only work part time, but if I get tired
the Lord gives me energy if I need it.

1234
01:43:08,858 --> 01:43:12,896
- When I need it.
- You sure got a lot more than I do.

1235
01:43:13,097 --> 01:43:18,490
It's the Lord working through me. Praise God.
Don't you ever forget it.

1236
01:43:36,536 --> 01:43:39,130
Harry, tell the boss I quit.

1237
01:43:39,336 --> 01:43:41,326
What's up?

1238
01:43:41,535 --> 01:43:46,734
Not much. I'll never serve nothing
through that window ever again.

1239
01:43:48,655 --> 01:43:55,093
That's why I'm a mystery,
why I come out of the blue, out of nowhere.

1240
01:43:56,574 --> 01:44:01,329
Being here may be the best thing
I've ever done in my life thus far.

1241
01:44:03,974 --> 01:44:06,852
What you going to do?

1242
01:44:08,694 --> 01:44:11,207
What do you want me to do?

1243
01:44:11,413 --> 01:44:14,530
Whatever you want to do. We love you.

1244
01:44:16,293 --> 01:44:19,683
You've helped many people in the town.

1245
01:44:23,853 --> 01:44:26,491
Yeah, well...

1246
01:44:26,692 --> 01:44:28,808
Amen.

1247
01:44:29,012 --> 01:44:31,207
Yeah. Amen.

1248
01:44:35,372 --> 01:44:37,727
If and when they come...

1249
01:44:39,772 --> 01:44:44,083
...I want you to take my gold, my watch,
my jewellery, hock them.

1250
01:44:44,291 --> 01:44:48,921
Get every penny you can
to help this ministry stay alive.

1251
01:44:49,131 --> 01:44:51,247
I love this little church.

1252
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:57,639
And... Hey! You never know how long
the Lord's going to let you hang around.

1253
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:02,047
Well, we don't. No.

1254
01:45:03,690 --> 01:45:06,921
He places us where he wants us to be

1255
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,122
in all times and in all places.

1256
01:45:10,330 --> 01:45:12,320
You believe that?

1257
01:45:12,529 --> 01:45:14,804
Amen, brother. I do.

1258
01:45:15,009 --> 01:45:16,522
I do.

1259
01:45:17,329 --> 01:45:21,800
For $7.95, you can receive
one of these beautifully hand-painted scarves

1260
01:45:22,009 --> 01:45:24,284
from Bayou Boutté, Louisiana.

1261
01:45:24,489 --> 01:45:28,606
The Apostle EF, that's me,
will personally bless these scarves.

1262
01:45:28,808 --> 01:45:32,005
You can slip it under your pillow
and sleep more peacefully.

1263
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:35,439
- Glory be to God.
- $7.95.

1264
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:41,479
- Draw me a cross.
- OK.

1265
01:45:42,767 --> 01:45:47,397
<i>...blessed... the Apostle EF...
don't wait.</i>

1266
01:45:49,527 --> 01:45:56,160
<i>Send it to this station... The One Way Road
To Heaven... Bayou Boutt, Louisiana.</i>

1267
01:45:56,367 --> 01:45:59,517
Don't wait, because
we don't have many left.

1268
01:45:59,766 --> 01:46:03,554
You've been very generous.
In fact, we've gained momentum...

1269
01:46:08,046 --> 01:46:12,597
<i>Louisiana state police for Bayou Boutt,
homicide. How many I direct your call?</i>

1270
01:46:12,806 --> 01:46:16,514
- Let somebody say "amen".
- Amen.

1271
01:46:16,725 --> 01:46:20,434
We're going to need a baby Jesus,
if we have any volunteers.

1272
01:46:20,645 --> 01:46:23,682
We could always use a doll of some type.

1273
01:46:23,885 --> 01:46:27,878
And those who want to be Wise Men
report to Mother Blackwell.

1274
01:46:28,085 --> 01:46:31,838
- She's directing the Christmas pageant.
- Amen.

1275
01:46:32,044 --> 01:46:35,354
After the first of the year,
we have a little surprise.

1276
01:46:35,564 --> 01:46:39,000
We're going to have a marriage workshop.

1277
01:46:41,084 --> 01:46:48,194
Brother Blackwell will preside 'cause he's more
successful than I was in my experience!

1278
01:46:48,403 --> 01:46:51,076
Brother Blackwell has
a word to say here.

1279
01:46:51,283 --> 01:46:58,394
Apostle, we feel that if Las Vegas can build
those casinos that tear up marriages

1280
01:46:58,603 --> 01:47:02,834
then we ought to be able to build
a humble temple

1281
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:06,034
where we can try to save
and salvage those marriages.

1282
01:47:06,242 --> 01:47:10,076
Hallelujah. No tag-team parenthood here.

1283
01:47:10,282 --> 01:47:13,513
Glory be to God. Hallelujah.

1284
01:47:17,641 --> 01:47:19,154
Who's that?

1285
01:47:19,361 --> 01:47:22,671
We'll be with you in a minute,
after the service.

1286
01:47:22,881 --> 01:47:26,954
You can sit tight for a while
and you might learn something.

1287
01:47:27,161 --> 01:47:29,833
You know, carry on. OK.

1288
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,951
Now...

1289
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,279
Yes, sir.

1290
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,916
Sorry about this.

1291
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,829
- It's all right.
- It's... Just a minute.

1292
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:51,238
We're going to open this meeting
to testimonies.

1293
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:56,559
Before we get to the main floor,
I want my little friends to say something.

1294
01:47:56,759 --> 01:48:02,116
These wonderful children are an important
part of our church, these young people.

1295
01:48:02,318 --> 01:48:05,515
- Do you have something to say, son?
- Thank you, Jesus.

1296
01:48:05,718 --> 01:48:08,152
Thank you, Jesus.

1297
01:48:08,358 --> 01:48:10,428
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Right on.

1298
01:48:10,638 --> 01:48:12,594
Thank the Lord.

1299
01:48:14,278 --> 01:48:17,587
Good boy. Everybody say,
"Thank you, Jesus. "

1300
01:48:17,797 --> 01:48:22,234
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Out of the mouth of babes. Glory.

1301
01:48:23,357 --> 01:48:27,509
- Sister Delilah.
- Glory to God tonight.

1302
01:48:27,717 --> 01:48:32,995
I'd like to give God glory for all he's doing
and thank him for being so real tonight.

1303
01:48:33,196 --> 01:48:37,155
I've been married twice
but both of my husbands have gone on.

1304
01:48:37,356 --> 01:48:41,554
But I dare to let that stop me
because Jesus lives in me.

1305
01:48:41,756 --> 01:48:44,953
Glory to God. Hallelujah.
Thank you, Jesus, for being so good.

1306
01:48:46,156 --> 01:48:50,114
I found this beautiful black penny
on the ground the other day.

1307
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:54,388
The Lord said, "You have the power to call
the things that are not

1308
01:48:54,595 --> 01:48:56,187
to become the things that are. "

1309
01:48:56,395 --> 01:49:01,753
I said, "Lord, this penny is the down payment
on my house and my car. "

1310
01:49:01,954 --> 01:49:04,912
Glory to God! He's real tonight. Isn't he real?

1311
01:49:05,114 --> 01:49:07,150
He's real. Glory to God.

1312
01:49:13,674 --> 01:49:15,153
Oh-oh.

1313
01:49:15,354 --> 01:49:18,789
Equal time! Sister Johnson.

1314
01:49:18,993 --> 01:49:22,952
I praise God tonight.
I praise you for being in the midst.

1315
01:49:23,153 --> 01:49:26,350
And all the congregation of believers.
I'm saved tonight.

1316
01:49:26,553 --> 01:49:31,024
I'm sanctified. I'm Holy Ghost-filled.
I'm fire baptised.

1317
01:49:31,233 --> 01:49:34,781
My husband ran off with another woman.
Yes, he did.

1318
01:49:34,992 --> 01:49:40,146
I'm here to tell you if I ever do it again,
I'm going to check out his credentials.

1319
01:49:40,352 --> 01:49:44,709
He's going to have to be saved, sanctified
and Holy Ghost-filled.

1320
01:49:44,912 --> 01:49:50,463
- Glory to his name.
- Thank God and thank you, Sister Johnson.

1321
01:49:50,671 --> 01:49:54,346
Glory to God. Sammy?
Anything to say, Sammy?

1322
01:49:56,271 --> 01:49:58,865
I'm happy to be here.

1323
01:49:59,071 --> 01:50:02,984
And I'm happy
that everybody else is here, too.

1324
01:50:03,191 --> 01:50:08,503
Thank you so much. And now we have
Mr Elmo of KBBR. Mr Elmo.

1325
01:50:08,710 --> 01:50:12,225
Well, Apostle, I guess I'm thankful

1326
01:50:12,430 --> 01:50:15,547
that God sent you to my station.

1327
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:20,698
I'm thankful that there were people listening.
I'm thankful to be anywhere!

1328
01:50:20,909 --> 01:50:23,469
- We're a good team, aren't we?
- That's right.

1329
01:50:23,669 --> 01:50:26,024
Glory be to God.

1330
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:29,460
Yes, indeed. Elmo's very
helpful in this area.

1331
01:50:29,669 --> 01:50:35,903
Brother George has been preparing something
on the horn. He's a wonderful musician.

1332
01:50:36,108 --> 01:50:39,862
He's going to play
one of these wonderful religious songs.

1333
01:50:40,068 --> 01:50:42,866
OK, George. Take it away.

1334
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:50,218
It's all right.

1335
01:51:32,345 --> 01:51:34,734
Learn your ABC.

1336
01:51:34,945 --> 01:51:39,813
A, acknowledge that you're a sinner.
B, believe in Jesus Christ.

1337
01:51:40,024 --> 01:51:42,458
C, confess that you're saved.

1338
01:51:42,664 --> 01:51:46,452
Confess it to others.
Shout it in the hills and valleys.

1339
01:51:46,664 --> 01:51:51,100
If you keep your eye on Jesus,
he'll keep his eye on you.

1340
01:51:51,303 --> 01:51:55,979
As you can't escape the gaze of a picture
on the wall, his eyes will follow you,

1341
01:51:56,183 --> 01:51:58,174
the eyes of Jesus Christ.

1342
01:51:58,383 --> 01:52:00,658
Whithersoever thou leadest
I will follow.

1343
01:52:00,863 --> 01:52:03,331
I am with you always.
Everybody say "always".

1344
01:52:03,543 --> 01:52:04,532
Always!

1345
01:52:04,743 --> 01:52:07,495
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

1346
01:52:07,702 --> 01:52:10,580
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1347
01:52:10,782 --> 01:52:16,812
When I turn, he turns. When I jump
up and down, Jesus jumps up and down.

1348
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:23,017
Somebody give me an amen. Somebody.
Glory. Glory be to God on high.

1349
01:52:23,221 --> 01:52:26,099
He backs me up here tonight.

1350
01:52:26,301 --> 01:52:31,295
Grab somebody, look them in the eyeballs,
say, "Jesus is here right now. "

1351
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:34,618
Jesus the same yesterday,
today, for ever.

1352
01:52:34,821 --> 01:52:37,892
Any time you think
the Devil's getting ahead of you

1353
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:40,660
say, "Get thou behind me, Satan.
Don't push. "

1354
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:43,374
- Somebody say "get". Get behind me!
- Get!

1355
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:47,175
The Lord don't want me drinking
because he's got his eye on me.

1356
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:50,656
You can't hide the bottle
if he's got his eye on you.

1357
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:54,374
The Lord don't want me to go dancing.
He's got his eye on me.

1358
01:52:54,579 --> 01:52:57,218
The Lord don't want me sinning.

1359
01:52:57,419 --> 01:53:01,890
He's got his everlasting eye on me and you
because he loves you and me.

1360
01:53:02,099 --> 01:53:06,695
How do we know he loves us
from now until the end of eternity?

1361
01:53:06,899 --> 01:53:10,811
How do we know that?
Because! Because! Because!

1362
01:53:11,018 --> 01:53:14,010
Because! Because!

1363
01:53:15,338 --> 01:53:18,887
Because he sent his only begotten son,

1364
01:53:19,098 --> 01:53:22,806
put him in a tabernacle of clay
so we could recognise him.

1365
01:53:23,017 --> 01:53:27,169
He came to save us.
He came to save us.

1366
01:53:27,377 --> 01:53:30,608
He could have called on how many?

1367
01:53:30,817 --> 01:53:36,289
How many? How many angels?
How many angels?

1368
01:53:36,497 --> 01:53:39,647
He could have called on 10,000 angels.

1369
01:53:39,856 --> 01:53:42,450
10,000.

1370
01:53:43,616 --> 01:53:47,894
But he came to save us.
He took our place.

1371
01:53:48,096 --> 01:53:52,886
He hung on a tree so we wouldn't have to.
That cruel tree.

1372
01:53:53,096 --> 01:53:57,134
He died so we could be saved.
It's free but it ain't cheap.

1373
01:53:57,335 --> 01:54:01,248
Am I right here this evening?
Glory be to God on high.

1374
01:54:01,455 --> 01:54:04,208
- Somebody give me an amen.
- Amen.

1375
01:54:04,415 --> 01:54:06,929
Glory be to God on high.

1376
01:54:10,494 --> 01:54:13,167
Let me ask you something.

1377
01:54:13,374 --> 01:54:16,889
- Do you want it? I know I want it.
- I want it.

1378
01:54:17,094 --> 01:54:21,645
Once you've felt 300 or 400 volts
of the Holy Spirit, you're going to want it.

1379
01:54:21,854 --> 01:54:25,732
Do you want to get plugged in?
Do I hear somebody say "amen"?

1380
01:54:25,933 --> 01:54:29,164
- Amen.
- You might get three in the one.

1381
01:54:29,373 --> 01:54:34,572
The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
That's a mighty hot charged baptism!

1382
01:54:36,533 --> 01:54:40,445
If you want it, go for it. Be saved.

1383
01:54:40,652 --> 01:54:43,962
If God sent his only son, it's worth it.

1384
01:54:44,172 --> 01:54:48,688
- You want to be on the Devil's hit list?
- No!

1385
01:54:48,892 --> 01:54:53,283
- Then you'd better get on Jesus' mailing list.
- Yes!

1386
01:54:53,492 --> 01:54:57,484
Put all the elements of the Devil
behind you. Work on it.

1387
01:54:57,691 --> 01:55:01,969
Get rid of the combined satanic forces
and get right with God here tonight.

1388
01:55:02,171 --> 01:55:06,642
This ain't no petty subject.
This is the Holy Ghost power!

1389
01:55:06,851 --> 01:55:10,240
Get the Holy Ghost power
and the Holy Ghost explosion.

1390
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:14,523
We're going to short-circuit
the Devil tonight.

1391
01:55:14,730 --> 01:55:18,166
You Devil get behind me. You stay there.

1392
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,726
You stay there. You stay there, Devil.

1393
01:55:21,930 --> 01:55:23,522
You stay there.

1394
01:55:23,730 --> 01:55:26,846
Oh, my, my, my...

1395
01:55:27,049 --> 01:55:30,724
We're going to be with Jesus tonight.
Oh, my, my, my...

1396
01:55:30,929 --> 01:55:34,080
We're going to be with Jesus tonight.

1397
01:55:34,289 --> 01:55:40,444
- Say, "We're going to be with Jesus tonight. "
- We're going to be with Jesus tonight.

1398
01:55:41,248 --> 01:55:47,005
Let those people on Pecan Island hear you.
We're going to be with Jesus tonight.

1399
01:55:49,568 --> 01:55:51,524
Sh... sh... sh... sh...

1400
01:55:54,088 --> 01:55:55,726
Sh... sh... sh... sh...

1401
01:55:58,167 --> 01:56:02,285
Look at these beautiful little hands.
Look at them.

1402
01:56:02,487 --> 01:56:08,084
Imagine a nail piercing the palm
of this child's hands.

1403
01:56:08,287 --> 01:56:11,165
Then picture the nails going
in an old board.

1404
01:56:11,367 --> 01:56:14,756
If you were to take two boards
and nail them together?

1405
01:56:14,966 --> 01:56:19,915
I don't have that much love in me
to do this to my son. Do you?

1406
01:56:20,126 --> 01:56:23,198
I don't have that much love in me.

1407
01:56:23,406 --> 01:56:26,875
- But God does.
- Amen.

1408
01:56:27,085 --> 01:56:29,280
God does.

1409
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:40,277
Bless you. Thank you.

1410
01:56:40,485 --> 01:56:46,241
Put your hand over your heart, with the other
hand reach out and touch somebody.

1411
01:56:46,444 --> 01:56:51,837
The Holy Ghost can and will enter you,
but there's another side of this issue.

1412
01:56:52,044 --> 01:56:57,675
On the other side of the Holy Ghost explosion
is a still small voice,

1413
01:56:57,883 --> 01:57:01,319
the still small voice of Jesus within you,
in your heart,

1414
01:57:01,523 --> 01:57:04,242
talking to you, leading you.

1415
01:57:04,443 --> 01:57:07,674
This powerful quiet force

1416
01:57:07,923 --> 01:57:13,633
can penetrate the most callous
and hard-hearted atheist you'd want to meet.

1417
01:57:13,842 --> 01:57:18,962
The only place that the still and small voice
of Jesus Christ can't enter

1418
01:57:19,162 --> 01:57:23,758
is into the heart of any man or woman
who says, "No, you cannot come in. "

1419
01:57:23,962 --> 01:57:27,841
"You cannot enter here... tonight. "

1420
01:57:29,121 --> 01:57:31,681
- I ain't going to say that.
- Lordy.

1421
01:57:33,081 --> 01:57:35,470
- Lordy.
- Amen.

1422
01:57:35,681 --> 01:57:38,912
I want every head bowed,
every eye closed.

1423
01:57:42,561 --> 01:57:44,630
If anyone wants to come forward

1424
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:51,234
and accept our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ
as his personal saviour, let him do so now.

1425
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:56,672
- Once you're saved, it's a done deal.
- Oh, yes.

1426
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,234
Can you say, "I'm ready tonight?"

1427
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:03,398
For any mother, son or daughter
who wants it, it's here tonight.

1428
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:06,955
Jesus is here.
It's a one-way road to heaven.

1429
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:11,156
Jesus is waiting.

1430
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:16,432
And the Holy Ghost conductor
is calling, "'Board! All aboard!"

1431
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:25,509
<i># Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling</i>

1432
01:58:25,718 --> 01:58:28,949
<i># Calling for you and for me</i>

1433
01:58:29,158 --> 01:58:33,753
<i># See all the portals
He's waiting and watching</i>

1434
01:58:33,957 --> 01:58:37,586
<i># Waiting, oh, sinner come home</i>

1435
01:58:37,797 --> 01:58:43,906
<i># Come home, come home</i>

1436
01:58:44,117 --> 01:58:49,270
<i># Ye go where thee come home</i>

1437
01:58:49,476 --> 01:58:54,425
<i># Preciously, tenderly, Jesus is calling</i>

1438
01:58:54,636 --> 01:58:58,834
Sammy, my heart's broke for joy tonight,
Sammy.

1439
01:58:59,036 --> 01:59:01,390
My heart's broke for joy.

1440
01:59:02,875 --> 01:59:04,786
Come here, son.

1441
01:59:06,315 --> 01:59:10,627
You've come to accept the Lord Jesus Christ
as your personal saviour?

1442
01:59:10,835 --> 01:59:15,589
Are you ready to follow and accept him
at this very instant?

1443
01:59:15,794 --> 01:59:17,750
He's ready for you.

1444
01:59:17,954 --> 01:59:23,711
Saint Paul says any man who accepts
Christ as his saviour is a saint.

1445
01:59:23,914 --> 01:59:27,463
You're a saint here tonight, Sammy.
You're going to heaven.

1446
01:59:27,674 --> 01:59:31,825
I'm going to jail.
You're going to heaven.

1447
01:59:32,033 --> 01:59:34,786
- I love you, son.
- I love you, too.

1448
01:59:38,073 --> 01:59:41,509
Glory be to God on high.

1449
01:59:42,833 --> 01:59:45,905
Let's give the Lord God on high
a big handclap.

1450
01:59:46,113 --> 01:59:49,661
We have a new member
of Christ in our midst.

1451
01:59:55,832 --> 01:59:59,950
<i>d... come home</i>

1452
02:00:00,152 --> 02:00:09,423
<i># Preciously, tenderly,
Jesus is calling</i>

1453
02:00:09,631 --> 02:00:16,742
<i># Calling for you and for me</i>

1454
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:19,145
Glory. We love you.

1455
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:21,739
How many believe
I preached here tonight?

1456
02:00:21,950 --> 02:00:24,305
- Yeah!
- Glory.

1457
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:33,382
I'm going to have to leave you now.

1458
02:00:33,589 --> 02:00:37,548
Satan is calling me into the arena
one more time.

1459
02:00:37,749 --> 02:00:42,869
I may never see you much more again,
but I love you one and all.

1460
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:47,903
I just want to say before I leave,
I've told you in the past,

1461
02:00:48,108 --> 02:00:53,307
some people get on the aeroplane,
they fly to Jackson, Mississippi.

1462
02:00:53,508 --> 02:00:57,501
Others fly to London, England,
some to Chicago, some to Dallas, Fort Worth.

1463
02:00:57,708 --> 02:01:02,736
But I've got my own little aeroplane.
Some day, I'm going down that runway.

1464
02:01:02,947 --> 02:01:07,782
I'm not going to Jackson, Mississippi,
to Philadelphia or London, England.

1465
02:01:07,987 --> 02:01:12,697
I'm going yonder to heaven and I'm going
to say, "Get out of the way, moon. "

1466
02:01:12,907 --> 02:01:17,503
"I'm on my way to heaven. "

1467
02:01:20,106 --> 02:01:23,781
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1468
02:01:23,986 --> 02:01:30,983

1469

02:01:50,024 --> 02:01:53,221
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1474
02:01:53,424 --> 02:02:00,057
<i># I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away</i>

1475
02:02:00,264 --> 02:02:03,734
<i># When I die, Hallelujah, by and by</i>

1476
02:02:03,944 --> 02:02:07,822
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1477
02:02:08,023 --> 02:02:15,338
<i># I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away</i>

1478
02:02:15,543 --> 02:02:19,218
<i># When I die, Hallelujah, by and by</i>

1479
02:02:19,423 --> 02:02:22,892
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1480
02:02:23,102 --> 02:02:28,130
<i># I'll fly away,
O glory, I'll fly away...</i>

1481
02:02:28,502 --> 02:02:30,811
You're under arrest for first-degree murder
at Fort Worth.

1482
02:02:31,022 --> 02:02:35,060
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you.

1483
02:02:35,261 --> 02:02:40,972
You have the right to an attorney. If you can't
afford one, one will be appointed. Understand?

1484
02:02:41,181 --> 02:02:43,820
- Yes, sir.
- Place your hands on the car, sir.

1485
02:02:44,021 --> 02:02:46,091
Spread your legs for me?

1486
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,379
Place your right hand behind your back.

1487
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:58,619
Sammy, the jewellery's for the church.
Take it in to Reverend Blackwell.

1488
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:03,894
- Yes, sir.
- Keep the church going as long as we can.

1489
02:03:06,939 --> 02:03:10,852
Sammy, go back in there
where you're needed.

1490
02:03:11,859 --> 02:03:15,818
- My Bible's for you, son. That's for you.
- Watch your head, sir.

1491
02:03:17,019 --> 02:03:21,648
- You are Euliss F Dewey, aren't you?
- Don't say that name too loudly.

1492
02:03:26,538 --> 02:03:30,577
Yes, sir. I'm your man. I'm also
the Apostle EF, but I'm your man.

1493
02:03:30,778 --> 02:03:35,010
I'm from a long line of Deweys.
My granddaddy was Black Jack Dewey,

1494
02:03:35,218 --> 02:03:39,290
a professional blackjack player,
a card sharp, before he got saved.

1495
02:03:43,017 --> 02:03:48,375
I didn't think you still drove Fords. I thought
you'd switched to Chevys like in Texas.

1496
02:03:48,577 --> 02:03:52,251
Maybe it's the other way round. Well...

1497
02:03:52,456 --> 02:03:57,610
Right to remain silent?
Seems like I always got something to say.

1498
02:03:57,816 --> 02:03:59,852
I do a lot of talking.

1499
02:04:00,056 --> 02:04:04,208
<i># Just a few more happy days and then</i>

1500
02:04:04,416 --> 02:04:08,203
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1501
02:04:08,415 --> 02:04:12,806
<i># To a land where joy shall never end</i>

1502
02:04:13,015 --> 02:04:16,166
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1503
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:25,930
<i># I'll fly away,
O glory, I'll fly away</i>

1504
02:04:26,134 --> 02:04:30,525
<i># When called on high,
Hallelujah, by and by</i>

1505
02:04:30,734 --> 02:04:37,367
<i># I'll fly away</i>

1506
02:04:38,653 --> 02:04:41,804
- Before Abraham was who?
- Jesus.

1507
02:04:42,013 --> 02:04:44,811
- Who was our alpha and omega?
- Jesus.

1508
02:04:45,013 --> 02:04:47,732
Yea, though I walk through the valley,
who walks with me?

1509
02:04:47,933 --> 02:04:51,084
- Jesus!
- Who lays down with me?

1510
02:04:51,293 --> 02:04:52,567
Jesus!

1511
02:04:52,773 --> 02:04:56,287
- If I ascend to heaven, who will I talk to first?
- Jesus!

1512
02:04:56,492 --> 02:04:59,006
- Who is our heavenly father's son?
- Jesus!

1513
02:04:59,212 --> 02:05:02,363
- Who was sent on Earth to save us?
- Jesus!

1514
02:05:02,572 --> 02:05:06,611
- Who is my Lord and saviour?
- Jesus!

1515
02:05:06,812 --> 02:05:08,927
- He is our what?
- Jesus!

1516
02:05:09,131 --> 02:05:10,928
- Again!
- Jesus!

1517
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:13,167
- One more time.
- Jesus!

1518
02:05:13,371 --> 02:05:16,522
- If I walk down the street, who walks with me?
- Jesus!

1519
02:05:16,731 --> 02:05:19,529
In New York City,
who'll I meet in Times Square?

1520
02:05:19,731 --> 02:05:21,050
Jesus!

1521
02:05:21,251 --> 02:05:24,640
- If I jump, who jumps with me?
- Jesus!

1522
02:05:24,850 --> 02:05:27,967
- If I walk through the valley, who's with me?
- Jesus!

1523
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:30,320
- Say it again.
- Jesus!

1524
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:32,680
- One more time.
- Jesus!

1525
02:05:32,890 --> 02:05:34,448
- And?
- Jesus!

1526
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:37,483
- The father sent his son. What was his name?
- Jesus!

1527
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:39,725
- What's his name again?
- Jesus!

1528
02:05:39,929 --> 02:05:44,047
- One more time.
- Jesus! Jesus!

1529
02:05:44,249 --> 02:05:47,844
- Again.
- Jesus! Jesus!

1530
02:05:48,049 --> 02:05:51,598
- Who's our Lord and saviour?
- Jesus!

1531
02:05:51,809 --> 02:05:54,481
- Who do we love more than anything?
- Jesus!

1532
02:05:54,728 --> 02:05:56,923
Who was Mary's own darling?

1533
02:05:57,128 --> 02:05:58,481
Jesus!

1534
02:05:58,688 --> 02:06:02,601
