00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,528
Once in a great while, mankind unlocks a secret so profound...

2
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:40,028
that our future
is altered forever.

3
00:00:40,128 --> 00:00:43,262
Fire. Electricity.

4
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:46,229
Splitting the atom.

5
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:51,895
At the dawn of the 31st century,
we unlocked another.

6
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:56,929
It had the potential to change
humanity's role in the universe.

7
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:00,163
We called it the Titan project,
and it was a testament...

8
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:03,363
to the limitless power
of the human imagination.

9
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,462
Perhaps that is what
the Drej feared most,

10
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:11,663
for... it brought them down
upon us without warning...

11
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:14,596
and... without mercy.

12
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:19,464
Cale, that day, the day
the Drej descended from the sky,

13
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:23,465
the only thing that mattered
was keeping you safe.

14
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,329
Perfect !

15
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,464
Hey, stop !
Come on !

16
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,298
- Cale, are you all right ?

17
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:59,299
I'm okay.

18
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:03,097
Dad,
my invention broke.

19
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:08,031
Well, then, we'll fix it together,
but not today, Cale. We have to go now.

20
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:26,797
Dad, where's
everybody going ?

21
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,465
We're leaving too.
We all have to go somewhere safe.

22
00:02:31,565 --> 00:02:37,332
Professor Tucker ! Professor Tucker !
The Drej have reached the global defense system !

23
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:41,365
Come on, son.
Will we get the people away in time ?

24
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:44,798
- Not if we sit here talking, sir.
- I wanna drive.

25
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,365
- When you're older, kid.
- I'm older than four.

26
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,533
- Hang on !

27
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,200
Whoa !

28
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,232
- Please proceed to your designated-
- Is the Titan prepped for launch ?

29
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:04,932
- Just waiting for you, sir !
- Intelligence says the Drej
don't know the Titan's location,

30
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,766
or we would've
been hit already.

31
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:09,433
Let's pray
they're right !

32
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,334
Enemy warships
have entered our solar system.

33
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,798
Are we going in that ?

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,398
- Wow !
- Cale,

35
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,666
I have to go
on a different ship.

36
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,567
- I have to go away for a while.

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,033
No, Dad ! No !

38
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:35,234
- Tek is going to look after you.
- But I wanna go with you !

39
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:38,466
- Sir-
- I know.
It's not safe where I'm going.

40
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,800
- Sir ! Professor !
- All right, I'm coming !

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,734
Cale, here. Take this.
As long as you wear it, there's hope.

42
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:53,635
- I will see you again. I promise.
- Okay.

43
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:58,334
- No, it's not okay ! It's not okay !

44
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,401
- Tek, keep him safe !
- Daddy !

45
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,935
- Korso, go !
- Come back !

46
00:04:08,702 --> 00:04:13,336
- Evacuate ! Evacuate !
- Godspeed, Sam Tucker !

47
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,833
Attention, pilots. Drej Stingers are-

48
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:19,067
This is Tucker.
Bring me down.

49
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,267
Attention, pilots.

50
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,535
Drej Stingers are attacking
the escape vehicles.

51
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:32,203
Okay. Are we all here ?
Bobby, buckle up.

52
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,969
- Now, Sam. Now !
- Go, Dad ! Go !

53
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:45,803
- Get out of there. Get out of there !
- Come on.

54
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:59,807
# Lose my head to the chemical freeway #

55
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:05,138
# Comin' up on overload
Losing sure is easy, so I am no more #

56
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:08,639
# But I'm not broken #

57
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:12,272
# In my dream, I win #

58
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:16,206
# Out here, I'm nothing #

59
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:19,840
# A cosmic castaway #

60
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,373
# In my head I'm a chemical dreamer
Speed up to the burn out mode #

61
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:27,806
- # Comin' up to fifth dimension
Beautify, don't crucify me #

62
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,707
- # So I need no mindgame
poisoning my lonely soul #
- Eat this.

63
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:34,707
- # Losing sure is easy
so I am no more #

64
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:38,708
- # But I'm not broken #

65
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,973
# In my dream, I win #

66
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:45,840
- It's lunch. One hour for lunch.
- # And I take over #

67
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:49,740
# 'Cause I'm no loser #

68
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,074
- # And I'm in and you're not #
- Whoo ! Whoo-hoo !

69
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,442
# Bad dreams don't stop #

70
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:01,073
# But I'm all screwed up #

71
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:04,840
# A cosmic castaway, yeah #

72
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,607
# A cosmic castaway, yeah #

73
00:08:08,707 --> 00:08:11,575
# A cosmic castaway #

74
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:25,775
- How ya hittin' 'em, Chowquin ?

75
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,942
- Hey- Chow- Chowquin.
- Wait.

76
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,875
Hey, it's me. It's Cale, all right ?
I'm not with those losers.

77
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,775
Humans wait.

78
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,043
- Uppity Earth scum.

79
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,575
- Guess you're stuck with us losers.
- Don't count on it.

80
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:48,442
- You wait in line, pal.
I'm takin' the express.
- # Cosmic castaway #

81
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,043
- # Yeah #
- Go through the docks,
you'll get yourself killed.

82
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:55,244
Coward. You know, the odds of a ship
docking are a thousand to one.

83
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:58,175
- # Yeah, a cosmic castaway #

84
00:08:58,344 --> 00:08:59,475
- And that would be the one.

85
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:19,075
Wow.

86
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:21,976
- Hi.

87
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,443
Mm-hmm.

88
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,245
Hey, wh- Hey !

89
00:09:34,278 --> 00:09:36,176
Wow.

90
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,876
- We're locked down, Captain.

91
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:43,444
All right. Keep her hot.
I'll be in touch.

92
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,811
- How you doin' today ? Workin'
hard, are you ? Bon appetit.

93
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:50,345
Next ! Keep the line moving.
Here you go.

94
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:54,176
- Akrennian Beetle Sushimi.
- You got ketchup ?

95
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,043
Ketchup ? Ketchup ? You don't need
ketchup. Please, next. Move along.

96
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:01,477
He's a disgrace.
Those dirty humans.

97
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,144
Ketchup ! Boy, some nerve,
human. Nice head, human.

98
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:09,144
I'm not askin' that much.
I'd just like them to kill my food
before they serve it to me.

99
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,710
- You know, I do an honest day's work.
I want already dead food.

100
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,311
- Mm.
- Is that too much for a fellow to ask ?

101
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:20,412
- Do you hear a crackling sound ?
- And what was up with Chowquin ?

102
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:24,479
- You should've seen him.
- Ha-ha, not much chance of that.

103
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:28,813
- He was so out of control,
treatin' me like I'm some kind of-
- Human ?

104
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:31,246
Don't start with
that solidarity thing again.

105
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:36,511
- If you would study
human history as you've been instructed,

106
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:41,246
you might realize you're not
alone out there, and you'd be
better prepared for the future.

107
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:45,547
- Well, I'll tell you somethin'
about your famous future.
- Mmm.

108
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:50,247
Every day I wake up, it's still the
present, the same grimy, boring present.

109
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,578
I don't think
this future thing exists.

110
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:56,912
- Do you hear a crackling sound ?

111
00:10:59,012 --> 00:10:59,846
- Here we go.

112
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:05,246
- We gotta get outta this dump.
- Hold on, everybody ! I got it !

113
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,712
Please don't panic.
Just think of it as floating time.
Two seconds. Everybody calm.

114
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:16,546
Ah. Just needed some love.

115
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,947
Let's get back to eatin' baby.

116
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:28,114
Okay. Well, I'm full.

117
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,046
Ohh.

118
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:50,647
- Hey, Cale.

119
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:55,647
- Firrikash. Po, how's it floatin' ?

120
00:11:56,347 --> 00:12:01,414
- You pulled a nasty stunt back there.
- We don't like your attitude.

121
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,249
- You've been a little uppity.

122
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:09,314
Up-Up- Is that so ? Well.
I'm gonna have to work on that.

123
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:29,348
- You wanna hunt humans, just remember:
We travel in packs.

124
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,115
- What are you doing ?
- It's commonly known as helping.

125
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:35,516
Yeah ? Well, what for ?

126
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,183
Sometimes, kid, people
just help each other out.

127
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,750
- Oh, right.

128
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,315
So you're gonna tell me
you don't want something in return ?

129
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:50,349
- All right. Maybe I do.
- What a shock.

130
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:54,882
I want you to risk your life.
I want you to give up everything
you have to join the mission,

131
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:59,216
where you'll face terror and torture
and possibly gruesome death.

132
00:12:59,316 --> 00:13:02,350
And I would
wanna do that because... ?

133
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,382
Because... it's worth it.
Because... the human race needs you.

134
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:11,883
Maybe you haven't
had a look around lately, but
there aren't many of us left.

135
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:15,150
At the rate we're going, they'll be
reading about us in textbooks...

136
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,451
- and displaying our bones
in alien museums.

137
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:24,650
- Yeah, well, having your planet
blown up can have that effect on a species.

138
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:30,017
But maybe I've been wrong all
these years, and it took your
inspiring speech to make me see it.

139
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:33,751
You've really changed me.
It's beautiful.

140
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,784
I think we've gotta hug.

141
00:13:35,884 --> 00:13:40,683
- Oh, man.
They've really ground you down.
- Hey, get this straight.

142
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:43,583
I don't even know you.
I don't want any part of your mission,

143
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:48,184
- and I don't need your help
with these oversized morons.

144
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:50,484
Oh, okay.

145
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:58,118
- I think he called you morons.

146
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:01,250
- Whoa !
- Korso.

147
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,451
Captain, this is Akima.
We are not alone.

148
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,284
Are we in good company ?

149
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,785
That's a negative,
Captain.

150
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:14,952
I think we've fallen in
with a very bad crowd.

151
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:20,118
Roger that.
Let's prep for departure.

152
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:26,619
Tek, I need to be scarce
for a while.

153
00:14:27,119 --> 00:14:28,752
- You don't know the half of it.
- Ha-ha.

154
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:32,086
Are you still bothering people ?
Hey, go away.

155
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:37,684
Great job with the kid, Tek.
He's a charmer.

156
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:40,918
I expected you to take him
off my hands a lot sooner.

157
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:44,485
- Tek, hey, wait.
Who is this ? You know him ?
- Joseph Korso.

158
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,686
- I was with your father
on the Titan project.
- My father.

159
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:52,653
- I don't have a father.
You brought this guy here ?

160
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:56,085
- Yes.
- I don't understand. Why ?

161
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:58,718
You still got that ring
your father gave you ?

162
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,885
- Give it to me.
- Hey, give it back !

163
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,052
- Cale-
- Shh.

164
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:08,453
- Ahh.

165
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,120
Ah. Here.

166
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,786
- Put it on.
- Hmm.

167
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,686
- How did- How did you-
- It's a storage device.

168
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:26,688
It's genetically encrypted to your
father, and therefore, to you.

169
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,855
It's a map, Cale.

170
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:32,822
It can tell us
where your father hid the Titan.

171
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:36,186
That's why I've spent
the last 15 years lookin' for ya.

172
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,887
That ship means everything.
Humanity depends on you finding it.

173
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:45,488
Me ?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

174
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:49,088
Me ? No, no, no.
I'm not- Tek, listen,

175
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,822
there must
be someone better.

176
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:55,387
It's time, Cale.
It's time to stop running.

177
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,721
- Well, actually,

178
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:01,554
I think it's time
to start.

179
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:07,255
Drej.
What do they want ?

180
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:11,721
They want you, kid.
Same way I want you, only dead.

181
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,021
How do you know
they want me dead ?

182
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,856
I'm convinced.

183
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,088
We gotta get
to the kitchen.

184
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,088
- Korso, the gravity drive !

185
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:44,789
- You ready ?
- Tek, I'll lead you in.

186
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:48,790
- I'll stay here.
- Tek, you can't.

187
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,388
Take care of the kid.
He's not all grown up yet.

188
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:55,456
- No, no, no, no. You're coming.
- Go, Cale. I'll read about you.

189
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:58,222
Follow me !

190
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:02,890
Whoa !

191
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,791
- Well, this would be good
if we had any baking to do.

192
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:11,056
Oh, my food !
You guys are- You're terrible.

193
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:14,789
You're unsanitary.
Ooh, I hope that they catch you,

194
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:17,657
and I'll testify against you,
and you'll never get out of jail.

195
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:22,424
- Hey, you'll get
all the ketchup you want.

196
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:25,658
- Drej ! Ooh, I gotta go now.
- Follow ugly !

197
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:29,089
Oh, great. Yeah, no one would ever
think of looking for us in the vent.

198
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:31,089
Go !

199
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,758
- Go ! Go !

200
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:44,092
He's the big- I'm not supposed to be here !
Come on ! I'm just a cook !

201
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:48,157
How do I get out of here ? How do I get
out ? Why is this happening to me ?

202
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,358
Stupid- Please- Stupid- No !

203
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:55,391
Hi. They went right down there.
They came into my kitchen and-

204
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,692
Bull's-eye.

205
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:08,357
We gotta
get outta here.

206
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:10,357
Go !

207
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,792
Go ! Run !

208
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:30,558
- Over.
- Huh ?

209
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:33,491
- Maybe next time, kid.
- Hey, I can fly it too.

210
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,326
- It won't start.

211
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:40,026
I got an idea.

212
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:46,392
Give it a shot.
Whoa !

213
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,027
Ow !

214
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:00,027
- Hang on, kid. I'm comin'.

215
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,594
Heads up !

216
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,761
They're
locking down the doors !

217
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:22,593
- Not going forward. Going up.
- Up ?

218
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:29,126
Move it !

219
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:47,828
- You should brace yourself.
- Uh, yeah. I'm feeling that.

220
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,560
Eject. Hey, where's the eject ?
Cale ? Cale ?

221
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:02,495
This model does
have eject, right ?

222
00:20:11,662 --> 00:20:12,930
And you were worried.

223
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:15,429
What do you mean, "were" ?

224
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:20,594
- Akima, we need a pickup here.
- A little late for that.

225
00:20:20,694 --> 00:20:24,495
- I'm right
above you. Can you get to me ?
- Not enough time.

226
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:28,462
Not-Not-
Not a lot of time.

227
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,862
- Exhale.
- You gotta be kidding.

228
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,363
- Exhale.
- Oh, no, no, no, no !

229
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:16,729
# Comeback down to Earth, oh, yeah #

230
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:21,397
# Comeback down to Earth
Comeback down to Earth #

231
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:25,064
# Oh, yeah
Comeback down to Earth #

232
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:28,097
- Is it dead ? Can we eat it ?

233
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:31,298
No, it's not dead.

234
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:34,730
Who are you ?
Go away.

235
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:38,497
- Hey, what's going on ?
- Preed, you're in my light.

236
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,931
Ah, such motherly concern
for the subject.

237
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:47,098
- Why am I naked ?
- Why, you positively glow
with maternal warmth, Akima.

238
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,865
It's very fetching.
I must have you.

239
00:21:50,365 --> 00:21:53,797
- In your dreams.
- Akrennians don't dream, remember ?

240
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,531
- They don't bathe much, either.
- I'm still naked here.

241
00:21:57,031 --> 00:22:01,098
I hadn't noticed. Now, hold still, or
you'll lose something really important.

242
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:05,766
- Hand me the probe.
- The probe ? Uh,
wh-where does the probe go ?

243
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:10,330
You know, I'm really feeling
much better. Aah ! Hey !

244
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,864
This is just great.
Cross half the galaxy,

245
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:15,897
nearly get our butts
shot off by the Drej,

246
00:22:15,997 --> 00:22:18,632
just so we can
rescue the window washer.

247
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:22,465
Hey, for your information, I happen
to be humanity's last great hope.

248
00:22:22,565 --> 00:22:25,899
- I weep for the species.
- You're fine.

249
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,798
I mean, I'm the guy with the map here.
This is big medicine, right ?

250
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:33,564
Big medicine ? Let me see.

251
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:37,065
This is really it ?
This can save us ?

252
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:40,966
Huh ? Yeah, I guess.

253
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:47,467
- Do you know what this means ?

254
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,999
Um, I'm really wanting those pants
right about now.

255
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:53,799
Akima, my pet, if the boy isn't
at death's door,

256
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,900
Korso wants Gune to check the map
so we can set a course.

257
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,601
Do you mind ?
Are we through pawing ?

258
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:03,601
- This is the Valkyrie,
not a singles bar.
- We're done.

259
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:08,165
You know,
I never said I was gonna help you guys.
We never even addressed what's in it for me.

260
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,365
- Why, you get to be a hero.
- A hero ? Come on.

261
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:16,433
I mean, there must be something on the
Titan worth selling or trading or-

262
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:21,067
What ? We're gonna risk our necks
to help a bunch of Drifter Colony bums ?

263
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,666
- Where are my pants ?

264
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:29,466
- Guess where Akima grew up.
- Drifter Colony ?

265
00:23:29,566 --> 00:23:35,201
- Yes. The boy learns.
- Wait. What's your-

266
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:40,468
Preed, wait up ! Look.
Where's Korso ? I wanna talk to him.

267
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,767
I believe he's in Navigation.
We're headed there now.

268
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,068
- You wanna watch
who you're steppin' on.

269
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:53,468
Or you'll what ?

270
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:58,236
- Ah, the lovely and talented Stith.
This is Cale.

271
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,303
- You remember- Cale.
- No, no, no, no, no. Cannot talk.

272
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:04,866
We lost targeting on one
of our aft gun turrets again !

273
00:24:04,966 --> 00:24:07,334
What ? Think
this is a pleasure cruise ?

274
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:12,568
She's a sweet little thing.
Weapons specialist.
Normally, she's very good-natured.

275
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:17,136
Great !
Things aren't bad enough !

276
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:20,736
- Tools all over the floor !
- Fight the good fight, precious.

277
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:24,834
Preed, I'll kill you. Okay ?
I will kill you.

278
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:28,802
I am educated and well-read !
I am not a mechanic !

279
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:33,369
- I have my pride ! - Gune ? Guney ? Are you in there ?

280
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:36,803
...by the acceleration, multiplied
by the coefficient of the friction...

281
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,870
and apply necessary force.

282
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,935
- Gune ?
- Ooh.

283
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:45,102
- Look at that.
- Does this look familiar ?
Do you know what it is ?

284
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:51,670
- Neither do I. I made it
last night in my sleep. Apparently, I used Gindrogac-
highly unstable.

285
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:55,404
- Gune.
- I put a button on it, yes.

286
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:59,703
I wish to press it, but I'm not sure
what will happen if I do.

287
00:25:00,135 --> 00:25:04,735
- Let me see, now. Three, five,
twenty-two, seventy-four,

288
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,735
- eleven-

289
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:09,303
- No. No-no-no-no. Careful.

290
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:14,404
- It's perfect.
- Ho, yes !

291
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:17,237
- Hey.
- Perfect ! You fixed it !

292
00:25:17,337 --> 00:25:20,369
- So, where are we now ?

293
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:24,469
We are here, right here-
Bellasan Quadrant.

294
00:25:24,969 --> 00:25:30,404
About three million keks from Tau 14.
Why ? Are you homesick ?

295
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,171
- Gotta have a home for that.
- Mmm.

296
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:37,870
Translucent bipedal
mesomorphic embryonic male.

297
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,904
Yes, yes, yes. This is all very
fascinating, but take a look at this.

298
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:45,504
- It's a map. Can you read it ?
- Can I read it ?

299
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:48,439
Of course I can read it.
Yes. Hmm.

300
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:51,005
- So, what do you see ?
- Ah !

301
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:54,872
- Yes, this is Pl'ochda.

302
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:59,270
- And this- this-
this is... Solbrecht !

303
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,270
And this- And this-
And this- What is this ?

304
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,938
- That's, uh- That's lunch.
- What's lunch ?

305
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:08,771
- Mmm.

306
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:13,939
Spaghetti derivative, meatballs- sort
of, anyway- and Caldoch droppings.

307
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,271
- Who ate it before you did ?
- Hey, hey !

308
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:20,605
Ahh !

309
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:24,205
- Tell you a secret. This guy's nuts.
- I'll tell you another.

310
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:27,472
He's never wrong.
Where are we going, Gune ?

311
00:26:27,572 --> 00:26:32,373
Ahh, the broken moon
of Sesharrim.

312
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,405
Only 13,000 keks away.

313
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:37,038
- Have Akima lay in a course.
- We're on our way.

314
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:53,571
- What's on Sesharrim, anyway ?
- The Gauol, an ancient race.

315
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:56,305
- Great.
- This isn't a joyride, kid.

316
00:26:56,405 --> 00:27:00,573
When the Drej destroyed Earth,
they figured life adrift in space...

317
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:04,239
would break us down,
wipe us out.

318
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,974
Do you really want
those vile creatures to be right ?

319
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:15,473
- Just lay down and die ?
- A little late.

320
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:20,674
About 15 years too late
to save the humans. But it's not
like we didn't have a good run.

321
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:24,474
It's not about a good run.
It's about our survival.

322
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:29,108
See, the Titan was truly visionary,
the most advanced ship in the universe.

323
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:34,506
That ship has the power to reunite
the human race, to give us a home.

324
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:38,274
And the only way to find it
is in your hand.

325
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:41,874
So, you're really
counting on me, then ?

326
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:45,275
- We all are.
- Well,

327
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,342
if I don't like
the way things are going,

328
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:52,074
I'll show you how much
like my father I really am.

329
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,740
I'll leave.

330
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,908
Ahh, no place to
set down on the island.

331
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:18,276
Land on that coral reef.

332
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:29,442
We'll take the sled,
see if we can locate the Gauol.

333
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,175
- Preed, you and Gune watch the ship.
- Watch the ship ?

334
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:36,609
- And keep the engines hot.
- Oh, yes. They'll be nice and toasty.

335
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,710
- Hmm.
- I'm not keen on the Drej catching me
with my trousers down.

336
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:45,077
Welcome to Planet Sesharrim, Cale.

337
00:28:45,177 --> 00:28:48,074
- It stinks.
- Hydrogen trees.

338
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:51,809
Clip one of those,
and we'll be blown to steaming bits.

339
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:56,676
Hello ? Anybody here ?

340
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,043
We're looking
for the Gauol.

341
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:02,177
Now, what exactly
do the Gauol look like ?

342
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:05,175
Don't know.
They don't get out much.

343
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,876
We have a kid with a map here
that you guys should know about.

344
00:29:29,677 --> 00:29:33,111
I think we know
what happened to the Gauol.

345
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:37,045
Open fire on five.

346
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:41,545
- We'll clear a path to the sled.
Everybody ready ?

347
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:44,476
- One, two-

348
00:29:44,676 --> 00:29:48,411
Wait. No, no.
Stop.

349
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:52,244
- I think they are the Gauol.

350
00:29:57,478 --> 00:30:00,212
Ahh.

351
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:06,078
Over here !

352
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:08,345
Quick little devil.

353
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:11,045
- Okay, all I have to do is tap
into the central computer,

354
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,145
and we can figure
the departure protocols.

355
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:17,079
- Yes. Making progress.
Yes, I'm making progress.

356
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,680
Huh ? Wait, wait.

357
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,244
- Hmm.

358
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:25,345
Ooh. Hmm.

359
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:53,213
The moon, the moon, the moon. Right,
yeah. That's how we knew to come here.

360
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:56,980
My father made a map
with that moon on it.

361
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,445
Now, why ? Is the ship
hidden there ?

362
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:07,047
Ohh.

363
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:11,348
- Oh.

364
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,180
Hmm. Ahh.

365
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:30,548
It must be somewhere
in the Andali Nebula.

366
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:34,915
We did it, kid.

367
00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:38,180
The Titan is as good
as ours.

368
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,980
He must have been here, standing here.
Right here.

369
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,647
- Who ?
- My father.

370
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:51,815
Go !

371
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,714
Let's move it !

372
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,715
We've gotta
get to the beach !

373
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:35,348
- Akima !

374
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:56,083
- Why aren't they shooting at Cale ?
- They want him alive.

375
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,683
Come on, guys.
Pick it up. Pick it up.

376
00:33:15,783 --> 00:33:17,784
Nice catch.

377
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:29,318
Pull up ! Pull up !

378
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:01,452
Preed, come in !
Preed, where are you ?

379
00:34:01,552 --> 00:34:03,719
- Hold on !

380
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:09,084
- Preed, come in !

381
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:12,985
- Preed !

382
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:20,319
Preed, Preed, Preed ! Aren't you
supposed to be watching for the Drej ?

383
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:24,387
Yes, caveman, that's right.
Drej bad. We good.

384
00:34:24,486 --> 00:34:27,684
- Now, go look at
something shiny for a while.

385
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:30,285
- How's this ?

386
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,619
- Well, you'd better look again !

387
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:37,419
Drej !

388
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,219
- Aah !

389
00:35:01,287 --> 00:35:03,688
Captain, we're on our way.
Where are you ?

390
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:06,352
We're in the
hydrogen trees being chased by the Drej.

391
00:35:06,652 --> 00:35:08,987
- See if you can spot them, quick !
- Look there !

392
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:14,754
- Akima !
- Hang on !

393
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,153
Nice move.

394
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:32,720
Get down !

395
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:40,622
Come on.
Show yourselves.

396
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,021
- Get down !
- Cale !

397
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:49,854
- I got 'em.

398
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:54,088
Whoa !

399
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:57,089
Preed, look !
There they are !

400
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,987
Oh, no.

401
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:08,089
- Hang on, Akima !

402
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:12,689
Don't shoot !

403
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:15,390
Don't shoot !
They've got Cale !

404
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:23,987
Gune, calculate their trajectory.
Stith, take weapons.

405
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:27,022
- Let's get on it, people.
- Oh, nice job covering our butts, Preed.

406
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:30,389
- You're the weapons expert.
- What were you doing ? Taking a nap ?

407
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:34,123
Enough ! Okay,
the Drej took Cale.

408
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:36,956
But they are not
gonna get away with it.

409
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,222
Well, let's quit running
our collective mouths and go get him.

410
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:45,689
Our only chance to locate them
is to track Akima. Stith, get on it.

411
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,590
Hmm.

412
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,124
They're gonna use you to figure out
where the Titan is.

413
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:01,056
Probably just blow it up,
too, when they find it.

414
00:37:01,156 --> 00:37:05,990
- Yeah, well, who's to say
it would've worked, anyway ?
- Who's to say it won't ?

415
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,491
Maybe Korso will get
to the Titan first.

416
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:13,391
Why do you care so much
about that thing ?

417
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:17,356
I was raised
around people.

418
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:20,956
"Drifter Colony bums",
I believe, is the term.

419
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:28,057
I barely remember Earth, but the older
ones used to tell us about it...

420
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:31,191
so it would never
be completely lost.

421
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:35,090
No matter how hard things got-
and they were hard-

422
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,257
those memories
kept us going.

423
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,791
Once, we had a home.

424
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:46,791
The Titan is our chance
to find one again.

425
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:53,092
I guess that's how
I ended up here.

426
00:37:53,192 --> 00:37:57,491
What are they afraid of ? So what did
the human race ever do to the Drej ?

427
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:01,692
- It's not what we did. They're afraid
of what we might become.
- Hmm.

428
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:05,092
Yeah, well, looks like
we're becoming extinct.

429
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:56,393
- Cale, you okay ?

430
00:38:58,293 --> 00:38:59,594
- Akima !

431
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,494
Cale !

432
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:06,694
- Cale !
- No ! Stop !

433
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:13,628
Leave her alone !

434
00:40:16,495 --> 00:40:18,129
Akima !

435
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:22,863
No !

436
00:40:49,462 --> 00:40:54,430
Akima's signal is
getting stronger. I think it's
coming from the slave cages.

437
00:40:56,597 --> 00:40:59,031
- A Drej pod. What's in it ?
- A human.

438
00:40:59,131 --> 00:41:01,598
- She's mine. I saw her first.

439
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,162
- Pretty.

440
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:09,596
Ah. All right.

441
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:15,364
- I'll take out the guard.
- Easy, big girl.
This requires cunning and deception.

442
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,764
- Hello.
- Ah.

443
00:41:18,464 --> 00:41:20,864
Uh, I'm an Akrennian trader.

444
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:25,263
I wonder if we might sneak
a peek at the new shipment
before they go on the market ?

445
00:41:25,763 --> 00:41:29,063
- You're not allowed.
- Traditionally, no.
You're absolutely right.

446
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:32,664
But you see,
I need a new slave rather badly.

447
00:41:32,798 --> 00:41:35,832
- Stop fidgeting, worm !

448
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:39,399
And I can't wait till auction.
I have to be on the shuttle.

449
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,431
I have an appointment
to have my ear shaved.
It has to be booked months in advance.

450
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:47,398
- You see my problem.
- Hmm.

451
00:41:47,098 --> 00:41:50,565
You're lying. He's not a slave,
and you're not traders.

452
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,599
- But-
- He doesn't carry himself
like a slave.

453
00:41:52,699 --> 00:41:55,632
- Look at the way he stands.
Probably ex-military.
- How-

454
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:58,300
Akrennian traders always threaten before
they ask a favor. It's tradition.

455
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:01,398
- And your robes are made
out of bedspreads.

456
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:06,964
- Ah. - Just out of curiosity,
did we have a plan "B" ?

457
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,931
- Hmm. An intelligent guard.
Didn't see that one coming.

458
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:04,633
Whoa.

459
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,200
- This is it.

460
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,501
- Are you in there ?

461
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:03,869
Well, if it isn't the captain.
What kept you ?

462
00:45:26,905 --> 00:45:31,204
Do you see anything ? It was really
small, like a cocoon or something.

463
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:33,904
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. No. Mmm.

464
00:45:34,005 --> 00:45:36,705
I do see something.

465
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:39,905
Oh, no. Just a Drej ship.
Drej !

466
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:42,805
- What ? Where ?
- I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it.

467
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,804
- Korso, we have a problem.
You'd better get up here.

468
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:48,804
- I'm here. I'm here.
What's the problem ?

469
00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:51,804
- Stith, let's go.
- All right. All right.

470
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:54,638
- I've locked on to him, sir.
- Gune, look out for his buddy.

471
00:45:54,738 --> 00:45:58,638
- There's only one.
He's all alone. Just one.
- Three, five, twenty-two-

472
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:01,972
- Three, five, twenty-two,
seventy-four, eleven.

473
00:46:02,806 --> 00:46:06,038
- Cale !
- Die, Drej scumball !

474
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:08,405
Oh, don't-
No, don't shoot. Oh, guys-

475
00:46:08,538 --> 00:46:10,605
- Come on. It's me !
- It's Cale !

476
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,605
- Cale !
- Stith, hold your fire !

477
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,406
- Oops.

478
00:46:17,506 --> 00:46:20,340
Akima,
open the cargo bay.

479
00:46:32,406 --> 00:46:33,606
Cale !

480
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:41,808
- Ah ! The boy is not dead.
This is cause for happiness.
- Hmm.

481
00:46:42,707 --> 00:46:45,472
So, um- how did you escape ?

482
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:49,373
- He got lucky.
- You know, we were just
about to rescue you.

483
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,306
- Yeah ? Well, thanks.

484
00:46:52,406 --> 00:46:56,907
- Anytime.
- Look, uh, they copied the map.

485
00:46:57,007 --> 00:47:00,308
- I'm sure they're heading
for the Titan now.

486
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:03,806
They won't find it.
Stations, people.

487
00:47:04,806 --> 00:47:08,006
Yes. Going, going.

488
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:11,940
Akima ?

489
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:16,174
Uh, um, what happened ?
How'd you get back ?

490
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:19,708
I got picked up with the trash.
Luckily, Korso got there...

491
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:23,707
before I ended up as a door prize
in some alien freak show.

492
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,342
I guess I owe him one.

493
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:34,242
You know, we both
got real lucky back there.

494
00:47:34,742 --> 00:47:37,676
- But the next time around-
- Cale.

495
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:41,341
Come on.
Gune needs a hand.

496
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:45,774
- Yes, the map is good.
The map is different.

497
00:47:45,874 --> 00:47:48,508
- Yes, the map is clear.

498
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:52,775
- Yes, it's very, very clear.
- Ooh. Take it easy.

499
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:56,376
Hmm. This outer marking
is pulsing.

500
00:47:56,476 --> 00:48:01,941
- Ah, the distal Phalangial Meridian.
- Gune, what do you make of it ?

501
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:05,908
Past outer quadrant.

502
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:11,109
This is the Ice Rings of Tigrin.
Right here. Hmm.

503
00:48:11,709 --> 00:48:15,443
- Easy to get lost in there.
- Good hiding place.

504
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:39,075
What ?

505
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:43,743
- Wakeangels.

506
00:48:44,143 --> 00:48:48,576
They follow ships into deep space,
glide on the energywake.

507
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:52,411
- They're supposed to be good luck.

508
00:48:53,944 --> 00:48:55,942
They're like... ghosts.

509
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,909
Sit down. Why don't
you give 'em a run ?

510
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:03,011
- You sure about that ?
- 'Course I'm sure.

511
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:05,444
Okay.

512
00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:08,778
# It's my time to fly #

513
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:12,012
# I'm proving ground
tonight #

514
00:49:12,112 --> 00:49:16,943
# I'll try to be the best
that I can #

515
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:20,144
Yeah. You got it.
Open her up.

516
00:49:20,244 --> 00:49:24,545
- Give these angels something to chase.
- All right.

517
00:49:24,678 --> 00:49:26,678
Try this, guys.

518
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,879
# It's my time to fly #

519
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:33,977
# My father will be
with me tonight #

520
00:49:34,077 --> 00:49:36,144
# Ooh #

521
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:40,277
# We're right on target #

522
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:43,411
# It's my time to fly #

523
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:48,145
# My father will
be with us tonight #

524
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:50,911
# A chance tonight #

525
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,778
# To victory #

526
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,912
# Dreams become reality #
# Reality #

527
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:03,879
# It's my time to fly #

528
00:50:03,979 --> 00:50:07,247
# My father will be
with me tonight #

529
00:50:07,347 --> 00:50:13,079
# Ooh, I'm right on target #

530
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:16,413
# It's my time to fly #

531
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:19,979
# My father will be
with us tonight #

532
00:50:22,779 --> 00:50:25,447
# It's my time to fly #

533
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:28,747
# My father will be
with me tonight #

534
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:34,578
# Ooh, we're right on target #

535
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:38,312
# It's my time to fly #

536
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:41,447
# My father will be
with me tonight #

537
00:50:41,547 --> 00:50:43,614
# Ooh #

538
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:46,781
# I'm right on target #

539
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:54,646
- Thank you.
- I knew you could handle this old bird.

540
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:57,380
No, I mean-
I mean, thank you for-

541
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,580
Thank you for trying to find me.
It's more than my father ever did.

542
00:51:02,214 --> 00:51:05,415
Your father was a great man,
Cale.

543
00:51:07,248 --> 00:51:09,113
- He would've been proud of ya.

544
00:51:09,547 --> 00:51:13,014
- You really think so ?
- Trust me.

545
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:17,148
Thanks. Thanks.

546
00:51:22,615 --> 00:51:24,949
You know, I-
I miss him.

547
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,781
Me too.

548
00:52:26,482 --> 00:52:28,582
Akima ?

549
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:34,350
Akima ? Huh ?
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.

550
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:40,018
- In or out ?
- Huh ? Oh, uh, in.

551
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:48,516
Uh, what's going on ?
Do you know why we stopped ?

552
00:52:48,649 --> 00:52:51,283
Pit stop for the basics.
Drifter Colony's the best place...

553
00:52:51,383 --> 00:52:57,151
to pick up plasmapacks,
fuelcells, frozen burritos.

554
00:52:57,251 --> 00:53:01,316
Listen. I need
to talk to you, and-

555
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:04,550
Where'd you get all this junk ?

556
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,384
Not junk.

557
00:53:09,284 --> 00:53:12,784
Why don't you come with me ?
I'll show you.

558
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:22,049
So, we're gonna barter this stuff
for more of that Earthjunk ?

559
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:27,250
Don't you get it, Cale ?
That junk is all that's left
of the place we came from.

560
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:31,418
It reminds us of
all the things we miss.

561
00:53:31,518 --> 00:53:35,918
Mm, miss. Like those frozen burritos
you were talking about.

562
00:53:36,618 --> 00:53:38,751
- At least they don't
jump off your plate.

563
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:41,551
You think this is some game ?
Did you forget the plan ?

564
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:46,518
I get you the Titan;
I get rich. We had a deal, right ?

565
00:53:46,618 --> 00:53:50,452
- How dare you try
to cut me out like that ?

566
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:58,151
Yeah ? Do as you please, and
guess what. You'll retrieve nothing.

567
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:02,686
You don't have the whole map.
The kid's got it. And I've got the kid.

568
00:54:02,786 --> 00:54:05,252
So you keep your drones
off my back,

569
00:54:05,352 --> 00:54:08,120
or so help me,
I'll rip his heart out.

570
00:54:09,386 --> 00:54:11,620
Cale, come on.

571
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,954
Going somewhere ?

572
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:20,785
Look what I've found:
two little birdies itchy to fly.

573
00:54:20,918 --> 00:54:24,353
- How long were they standing there ?
- Long enough.

574
00:54:24,486 --> 00:54:26,920
You lied ?

575
00:54:27,052 --> 00:54:29,820
Everything you said ?
Everything you told me ?

576
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:33,520
Not everything.
Your father hid his ship,

577
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,219
then the Drej killed him,
all because he couldn't face the truth.

578
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:43,120
- Yeah ? What is the truth ?
- That the human race is out of
gas. It's circlin' the drain.

579
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,653
It's finished.
The only thing that matters
is grabbin' what you can...

580
00:54:46,753 --> 00:54:49,654
before somebody else
beats you to it.

581
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,888
No, I don't believe that !

582
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:56,987
Then you're even more like
your father than I thought. A fool.

583
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,920
- Cale !

584
00:55:07,088 --> 00:55:08,689
- Akima, come on !
- Stop them.

585
00:55:14,653 --> 00:55:17,520
Stay on 'em.
I'll lock it down.

586
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:24,254
- Hurry !
- Go ! Go !

587
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:35,454
- Akima ! Akima ?

588
00:55:52,388 --> 00:55:56,656
Let's go.
We got a ship to find.

589
00:55:57,256 --> 00:55:58,689
Let's get airborne,
now.

590
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:01,456
- Where's Cale and Akima ?
- They're not coming.

591
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:03,623
- Why not ?
- Because they're afraid.

592
00:56:03,723 --> 00:56:07,224
Afraid ? What exactly are they afraid of ?

593
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:12,221
They're afraid of what might happen
if my command was ever questioned.

594
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:13,421
- Get it ?

595
00:56:13,521 --> 00:56:16,655
- Got it.
- You got a problem with that ?

596
00:56:17,655 --> 00:56:19,455
No.

597
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,857
- Why they not say good-bye to Gune ?

598
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,524
- Go get a blanket, quickly.
She needs warmth.
- Something to keep her warm.

599
00:56:42,624 --> 00:56:44,024
You, go get a doctor.

600
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:46,522
- Yeah. Hurry.
- Cover her.

601
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,622
- Yes, yes.
- What did you tell him ?

602
00:56:48,722 --> 00:56:50,956
I asked him
to bring corn liquor.

603
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:53,090
No. Really,
I don't need it.

604
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,858
Ha ! Not for you.
For boy.

605
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,024
- Me ?
- He pass out soon.

606
00:56:59,324 --> 00:57:02,925
- She'll be fine. She just
needs rest. Don't worry.

607
00:57:03,325 --> 00:57:05,256
She'll be fine.

608
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,823
Hey !

609
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:25,456
It's his favorite thing in the world-

610
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:27,657
that stupid ball.

611
00:57:27,757 --> 00:57:30,158
It was our dad's
back on Earth.

612
00:57:30,558 --> 00:57:32,158
Every time
he kicks that thing,

613
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:34,891
my brother thinks
he's in a big grass field.

614
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:37,059
That's some imagination.

615
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:42,724
Yeah, well. - There. He had
a little help. See what I mean ?

616
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,192
That's him - our dad.

617
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:50,692
That's where my brother
got the idea.

618
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:52,826
Hmm.

619
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:55,292
Here on the colony,
most people got to shut their eyes...

620
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:59,227
to see anything other
than rusted spaceship hulls.

621
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:01,457
Not my brother.

622
00:58:03,991 --> 00:58:05,691
Later.

623
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:22,759
- Hey. Sleeping Beauty.
- How long was I out ?

624
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:25,726
Not long.
A few hours.

625
00:58:26,526 --> 00:58:29,660
Korso and Preed. I can't believe it.

626
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,960
How long before
they reach the Titan ?

627
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,394
They won't.
We're gonna beat them to it.

628
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:40,559
Akima, we're gonna
stop them.

629
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,059
Was I seriously injured
back there or something,

630
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,460
'cause, funny, I thought you just said
we're gonna stop them ?

631
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,227
- That's right.
- Cale, we're in the middle of nowhere.

632
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:57,761
There's just the two of us,
and, oh, yeah - we don't have a ship.

633
00:58:57,862 --> 00:59:00,293
- Oh, we've got a ship.
- Really ?

634
00:59:00,393 --> 00:59:03,093
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd like to see this... ship.

635
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:05,593
Check it out.

636
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:10,260
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes!

637
00:59:14,695 --> 00:59:18,693
Well, she's been a great house,
but I don't think she'll fly.

638
00:59:22,427 --> 00:59:25,761
Well, she's still got her ionic
vacuum drive. Those never drain.

639
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:29,128
- This thing's a wreck.
- I can fix it, but do you think-

640
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:31,228
Don't worry.
I can fly it.

641
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:34,129
Good, 'cause
we launch yesterday.

642
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:38,295
# I've gotta get away from here #

643
00:59:38,895 --> 00:59:42,028
# It couldn't be too soon #

644
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:46,028
# 'Cause I've seen the stars
for you and me #

645
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:50,730
# Like rockets
to the moon #

646
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:55,293
# You take me everywhere
that I've never been #

647
00:59:55,827 --> 01:00:00,928
# Show me the meaning
of what life had to give #

648
01:00:00,962 --> 01:00:03,795
# I don't know
what to say #

649
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:09,496
# I think that maybe
I'm in over my head #

650
01:00:09,596 --> 01:00:14,395
# Stuck in the bed
somethin' she said #
- Ow !

651
01:00:14,495 --> 01:00:19,662
# Makes me think
that I'm in over my head #

652
01:00:19,762 --> 01:00:21,996
# Over my head #

653
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:24,996
T-minus ten, nine,

654
01:00:25,096 --> 01:00:28,030
eight, seven,

655
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,097
- six, five,
- Well, we're good to go.

656
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,529
- four, three,
- Let's hope she starts.

657
01:00:33,629 --> 01:00:35,529
- two,
- Oh, she'll start.

658
01:00:35,629 --> 01:00:38,863
- one, zero.
- Yeah, right.

659
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,865
- She'll start.

660
01:00:47,965 --> 01:00:50,699
Uh, I'd lean back
if I were you.

661
01:00:53,198 --> 01:00:55,296
- Should I get out and push ?

662
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:10,497
- Told ya.
- Okay. You did your job.
Now let me do mine.

663
01:01:36,832 --> 01:01:39,398
These collisions keep slowing us down.

664
01:01:39,499 --> 01:01:44,233
- So where is it ?
- My scanners are picking up
a veritable cornucopia of... nothing.

665
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,130
Just find it !
Gune, are you sure about that map ?

666
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:52,231
You give me map. I follow map.
What more can Gune do ?

667
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:57,098
- If Professor Screwloose over there
led us off course, I'm going to-
- Hold it !

668
01:01:57,198 --> 01:01:59,032
- What is it ?
- A ship. Three keks east.

669
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:03,232
- Drej ?
- No. Human craft, heading
for the break zone. Moving fast.

670
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:06,067
- How fast ?
- I'd say recklessly fast.

671
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:09,131
- Akima.
- Ah, good !

672
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:12,066
Akima. Cale.
I- I hail on communicator.

673
01:02:12,198 --> 01:02:14,199
No hailing.
Just follow them.

674
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:18,233
Okay. I follow, but I plot
new route through safer quadrant.

675
01:02:18,966 --> 01:02:21,600
- If we-

676
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,100
- We're going to follow them,

677
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,966
and we'll run silent.

678
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:39,267
The reflections
are throwing my readings off.

679
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:45,265
Uh, Akima, I think
we're getting closer.

680
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:52,000
- Cale ! It's Korso.
- Huh ?

681
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,234
- He's right behind us.
- What ?

682
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:01,934
We've got to lose him.

683
01:03:11,934 --> 01:03:16,402
- We'll never find them in there.
- We're going in.

684
01:03:20,835 --> 01:03:24,000
- Stith, where are they ?
- I can't get a reading.

685
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,301
There's too much ice,
too much interference, Captain.

686
01:03:30,802 --> 01:03:33,301
- Captain.
- Whoa !

687
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,068
A heat signature.
I see them !

688
01:04:02,168 --> 01:04:04,135
- Where are they ?
- Behind us !

689
01:04:22,536 --> 01:04:25,003
- No !

690
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,005
Where is he ?

691
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:37,138
I- I don't know.

692
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:47,903
- What ?
- Well, we found them, Captain.

693
01:04:48,003 --> 01:04:50,470
No more heat readings.
All gone.

694
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:55,337
Until they make their move,
we stay here.

695
01:05:11,238 --> 01:05:15,305
- They're moving out, I think.
- Now we've got 'em.

696
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,972
- I can't move. They'll see us.
- Maybe that's exactly what we want.

697
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:37,637
A reading !
Yeah. They're right in front of us.

698
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,638
You're not gonna
get past me, kid.

699
01:05:40,738 --> 01:05:44,471
- There, Captain !
- That's right, Cale. Keep coming.

700
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:46,905
Closer.
They're getting closer !

701
01:05:47,205 --> 01:05:49,539
There she is, Captain.

702
01:05:51,706 --> 01:05:54,304
No. There, Captain.

703
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:58,038
Which one ?

704
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,172
Look !
They're behind us now !

705
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:23,406
- Ready lasers !
- I'm on it !

706
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:30,408
I need one clear shot.
Don't lose 'em.

707
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,074
- Ice ! Turn back !
- No way.

708
01:07:02,174 --> 01:07:05,341
- We'll never make it through.
- We don't have a choice.

709
01:07:06,442 --> 01:07:09,406
- Akima ! Uh-
- Yes, Cale ?

710
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,007
- Pull up !
- Shut up !

711
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:27,109
Let's not
do that again.

712
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:37,275
Hold it.
Look there.

713
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:46,708
Akima, turn around.
Turn around !

714
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:26,141
That's it.

715
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:35,010
Wow. Have you ever
seen anything like it ?

716
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:38,476
Once.

717
01:08:57,345 --> 01:09:02,410
- What exactly are we looking for ?
- This ship's gonna
help us save mankind.

718
01:09:02,509 --> 01:09:06,678
- What exactly are we looking for ?
- Not a clue.

719
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,678
DNA coding.

720
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:13,445
"Mammal.
Tursiops truncatus."

721
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:15,679
The bottle-nosed dolphin.

722
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:19,013
These are animals-
or- or they will be.

723
01:09:22,043 --> 01:09:26,077
"Leopard.
Papilio glaucus."

724
01:09:26,811 --> 01:09:29,944
Swallowtail butterfly.
It's all here.

725
01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:35,045
- Cale ?
- I'm over here !

726
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:40,377
Look at this.

727
01:09:44,444 --> 01:09:46,644
Dad.

728
01:09:56,213 --> 01:09:59,445
I could never have done anything
like this when I was your age.

729
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:02,246
- I wonder who you take after ?

730
01:10:27,046 --> 01:10:29,113
Hey.

731
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,847
- The Titan. Quick.
- Ready to go, Captain.

732
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:48,981
You two stay here.
Preed and I can wrap this up.

733
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:53,448
- But- Here. Hold on to this
in case there's any trouble.

734
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:56,946
Hmm.
N-N-N-N-No.

735
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,414
Those two are
becoming a problem.

736
01:10:59,947 --> 01:11:02,514
- We need to take care of it.

737
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:05,181
I'm one step
ahead of you.

738
01:11:07,148 --> 01:11:11,915
- Watch the ship.
I always watch the ship.
- No, this just doesn't feel right.

739
01:11:12,016 --> 01:11:14,879
- I wanna go ! I wanna go !
- Captain said stay.

740
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,813
It's Captain I don't trust.

741
01:11:17,913 --> 01:11:21,314
Hmm. You know,
you may be right. Come on.

742
01:11:23,114 --> 01:11:23,848
- Stith here.

743
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:27,849
- Stith,
is Gune right there with you ?
- Yeah.

744
01:11:27,948 --> 01:11:31,548
- Then please tell him good-bye
for me, won't you ?
- What ?

745
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,748
- Gune !

746
01:11:34,847 --> 01:11:38,747
- I knew it ! I knew it ! - Get out of there !

747
01:11:55,215 --> 01:12:01,483
- Cale. If this message has-
- Dad ?

748
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,750
If this message has been activated,
then I have died before finding you.

749
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,951
I hope
you can forgive me...

750
01:12:08,051 --> 01:12:10,981
for breaking my promise
to see you again.

751
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:13,715
What I wouldn't give
to see you now.

752
01:12:13,815 --> 01:12:18,849
I can't change the past, Cale,
but I hope I can give you a future.

753
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:24,849
This ship has the power
to create a planet,

754
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:28,050
to create a new home.

755
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:32,049
Your ring would have activated
the transformation sequence,

756
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:35,416
but the Titan's power cells
were drained in the escape.

757
01:12:35,516 --> 01:12:40,216
They are unable
to fuel the transformation.

758
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,384
It is up to you
to restore their power.

759
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,618
After that,
the procedure is simple.

760
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:50,683
- He always did talk too much.

761
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,917
- Oh !
- Ah-Ah-Ah.

762
01:12:56,251 --> 01:13:00,985
Korso, don't do this.
This ship is all we have left.
Doesn't that mean anything to you ?

763
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:03,752
Sorry, kid.
World blowing up changes a man.

764
01:13:03,852 --> 01:13:07,016
- Look. The Drej-
- See, you can't beat the Drej.

765
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,416
No one can.
They're pure energy.

766
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:13,517
Face it, Cale.
You've lost.

767
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:17,584
- Actually, you all have.

768
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:20,618
Captain, if you'll relieve yourself
of your firearm-

769
01:13:22,118 --> 01:13:24,651
- You backstabbing-
- Well, I learned from the best.

770
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:28,451
But it wasn't just the money
the Drej were offering.

771
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:31,117
It was the health plan
that came with it.

772
01:13:31,517 --> 01:13:36,385
They'd let me live provided
I kill all of you before they get here.

773
01:13:37,986 --> 01:13:40,286
They should be here shortly.

774
01:13:51,653 --> 01:13:55,352
- Gune ? Gune ?

775
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:58,820
- Gune !

776
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:05,385
- Gune, are you all right ?
- I'm- I'm all right f-for business.

777
01:14:05,485 --> 01:14:09,586
- Gune.
- I'll just take a little nap...

778
01:14:09,686 --> 01:14:15,419
since I'm so- very sleepy.

779
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:18,219
Ahh.

780
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:21,121
- Preed, you can't trust the Drej.
- Akima.

781
01:14:21,253 --> 01:14:26,086
Oh, stop ! There's nothing more
tiresome than last-minute heroics !

782
01:14:42,753 --> 01:14:46,354
- Captain ? Mm. Oh.

783
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,355
- Hide 'n' seek, is it ?
Or should we play...

784
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,355
search and destroy !

785
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:57,955
- Preed !
- Ah !

786
01:15:09,487 --> 01:15:13,555
- Give me the ring.
- Aw. You're not gonna shoot me, kid.

787
01:15:35,689 --> 01:15:39,321
- Cale !
- Ah. Aah !

788
01:15:43,788 --> 01:15:47,156
Hold on !
Oh !

789
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:50,489
You can let go, kid.
I wouldn't blame you.

790
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:53,856
No ! I'm not
gonna let go !

791
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:01,688
- Korso !

792
01:16:06,256 --> 01:16:08,255
- Cale ! The Drej !

793
01:16:15,724 --> 01:16:17,422
- You okay ?

794
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:20,389
- Yeah.

795
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:37,323
- Let's not panic.
- We've gotta get out of here
before the Drej arrive.

796
01:16:37,456 --> 01:16:42,023
- No, I think we're gonna stay right here.
- Right here is about to be blown apart.

797
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:44,358
- This could be a good thing. Wait.
- Come on, Cale !

798
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:46,825
Wait.
We can make this work.

799
01:16:48,992 --> 01:16:52,225
- What did Korso say about the Drej ?
- That you can't beat them.

800
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:55,023
Right !
Because they're pure energy.

801
01:16:55,123 --> 01:17:00,223
If I can reroute the system to use Drej
energy, that would start the reactor.

802
01:17:02,424 --> 01:17:07,358
The energy relays are linked to these
circuit breakers, so this should do it.

803
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:13,723
- Yes !
- Are you sure this will work ?

804
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:19,325
Come on !
I can fix this !

805
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:22,858
I need to get outside.
Can you and Stith cover me ?
I- I just need a little time.

806
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,859
- How much time ?
- Uh, a few hours !

807
01:17:25,959 --> 01:17:28,759
What can you do
in a few minutes ?

808
01:17:41,659 --> 01:17:44,726
- Here they come.
- Not if I can help it.

809
01:17:52,658 --> 01:17:55,491
- Cale, you're
a sitting duck up there.
- I'm all right.

810
01:18:05,059 --> 01:18:07,227
- Oh !
- Come on !

811
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:14,226
Whoo !

812
01:18:14,259 --> 01:18:18,660
- Oh, fantastic.
I only have two guns left.
- Let's make 'em count.

813
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:22,060
- Akima, I can't shake 'em.
- I've got him.

814
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:32,693
Ah ! I'm out !

815
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:38,260
Let's do this ! Whoo !

816
01:18:42,394 --> 01:18:47,759
- Well, guys, it's been fun.
- A little help here, Akima. Whoa !

817
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:53,660
- Cale !

818
01:18:53,794 --> 01:18:57,227
I finished my nap !

819
01:18:59,594 --> 01:19:03,595
- Gune !
- Who's your daddy ?

820
01:19:03,695 --> 01:19:06,294
Gune's your daddy !

821
01:19:08,627 --> 01:19:11,194
Oh, no ! No, no, no, no !

822
01:19:11,294 --> 01:19:14,361
Oh !

823
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:18,628
- Cale, are you all right ?
- I'm pinned.

824
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:21,529
- Stith, who's outside with Cale ?

825
01:19:22,762 --> 01:19:25,128
- Hi, kid.
- It's Korso !

826
01:19:28,061 --> 01:19:30,228
You'll never get a cleaner shot, Korso.

827
01:19:39,163 --> 01:19:42,230
Maybe we can beat 'em
after all.

828
01:19:45,228 --> 01:19:47,494
Go ahead.
I'll cover you.

829
01:19:47,794 --> 01:19:51,828
Yeah, yeah. Right.

830
01:20:05,729 --> 01:20:08,029
Okay.

831
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:11,629
- Oh, great.

832
01:20:14,696 --> 01:20:18,197
- Fry, Drej !
- Ah !

833
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:26,196
They're leaving.

834
01:20:29,897 --> 01:20:33,331
Uh-oh.
We got a problem.

835
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,065
Go. They're
joining the mother ship.

836
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:41,895
- But the breaker !
- Cale, she's preparing to fire !

837
01:20:42,395 --> 01:20:45,763
- You can't stay out here.
- I'll take care of it, so let's move.

838
01:20:50,264 --> 01:20:52,131
Go on. Get out of here.

839
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:54,797
Cale, where are you ?

840
01:20:54,898 --> 01:20:57,564
Go. It's better this way.

841
01:20:57,664 --> 01:21:00,063
Uh-

842
01:21:16,732 --> 01:21:19,531
Here they come again.

843
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:34,266
Come on.
Faster. Faster.

844
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:38,764
Come on.

845
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,671
This is amazing.

846
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:44,738
I know.

847
01:24:45,138 --> 01:24:47,236
What are
you going to call it ?

848
01:24:47,336 --> 01:24:51,004
I think
I'll call it... Bob.

849
01:24:51,404 --> 01:24:54,570
- Bob ?
- You don't like "Bob" ?

850
01:24:54,670 --> 01:24:56,671
You can't
call a planet "Bob".

851
01:24:56,771 --> 01:25:00,238
Oh, so now you're the boss.
You're the king of Bob.

852
01:25:00,372 --> 01:25:03,272
- Well, no, but-
- What ?

853
01:25:03,372 --> 01:25:05,270
Can't you just
call it Earth ?

854
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:10,437
Well, no one said
you had to live on Bob.

855
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,105
I'm never...

856
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,605
calling it that.

857
01:26:45,207 --> 01:26:47,307
# Ohh, oh, oh #

858
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:50,708
# Ohh, oh, oh, oh #

859
01:26:50,808 --> 01:26:53,475
# Ohh, oh, oh #

860
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:55,475
# Ohh, oh, oh, oh #

861
01:26:55,575 --> 01:26:58,473
# Take the path
of least resistance #

862
01:26:58,573 --> 01:27:01,374
# Into the great unknown #

863
01:27:01,474 --> 01:27:05,774
# No directory assistance #

864
01:27:05,874 --> 01:27:09,808
# Now you're on your own #

865
01:27:09,908 --> 01:27:13,109
# But if you're looking
for a new world #

866
01:27:14,376 --> 01:27:19,807
# Just open up your eyes #

867
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:25,841
- # Because it's not quite paradise #
- # No #

868
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:28,175
# But it sure feels like home #

869
01:27:28,275 --> 01:27:31,442
# Not quite paradise #

870
01:27:31,542 --> 01:27:35,608
# And we can rent to own #

871
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,241
# It'll be all right #

872
01:27:38,341 --> 01:27:43,942
# No, it's not quite #

873
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:49,110
# Paradise #

874
01:27:50,243 --> 01:27:52,577
# Tomorrow's an illusion #

875
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:55,642
# And yesterday's a dream #

876
01:27:55,742 --> 01:27:59,776
# Today is absolution #

877
01:27:59,876 --> 01:28:03,810
# But you gotta let it be #

878
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:07,311
# And if you're looking
for the answer #

879
01:28:08,644 --> 01:28:14,142
# It's right before your eyes #

880
01:28:14,275 --> 01:28:20,176
- # Although it's not quite paradise #
- # No, oh, no, oh #

881
01:28:20,276 --> 01:28:22,243
# But it sure looks like home #

882
01:28:22,276 --> 01:28:25,777
# Not quite paradise #

883
01:28:25,877 --> 01:28:29,777
# And we are not alone #

884
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:32,876
# It'll be all right #

885
01:28:32,976 --> 01:28:38,444
# No, it's not quite #

886
01:28:38,743 --> 01:28:44,210
# Paradise #

887
01:28:44,311 --> 01:28:46,811
# Somewhere
from the edge of time #

888
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:49,878
# When the poets gather
words don't rhyme #

889
01:28:49,978 --> 01:28:52,610
# I'll call you up and say #

890
01:28:52,743 --> 01:28:55,777
# We made it okay #

891
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:58,278
# Somewhere
in the back of your mind #

892
01:28:58,378 --> 01:29:01,144
# When you see your demons
come to life #

893
01:29:01,245 --> 01:29:03,979
# And the world
just fades away #

894
01:29:04,078 --> 01:29:07,679
# You know it's okay #

895
01:29:10,877 --> 01:29:13,010
# Ohh, oh, oh #

896
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:16,444
- # Ohh, oh, oh, oh #
- # It's gonna be okay #

897
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,178
# Ohh, oh, oh #

898
01:29:19,278 --> 01:29:21,412
# Ohh, oh, oh, oh #

899
01:29:21,712 --> 01:29:25,212
- # Okay #
- # Oh, oh, oh #

900
01:29:25,345 --> 01:29:27,245
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

901
01:29:27,345 --> 01:29:30,477
- # Okay #
- # Oh, oh, oh #

902
01:29:30,811 --> 01:29:32,211
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

903
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:37,346
- # But it's not quite paradise #
- # Oh, no #

904
01:29:37,446 --> 01:29:39,513
# But it sure feels like home #

905
01:29:39,613 --> 01:29:42,112
# Not quite paradise #

906
01:29:42,913 --> 01:29:44,380
# We'll make this place
our own #

907
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,778
# Not quite paradise #

908
01:29:48,879 --> 01:29:50,979
# We can rent to own #

909
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:54,113
# Not quite paradise #

910
01:29:54,213 --> 01:29:55,813

911

- # Not quite paradise #

913
01:30:06,414 --> 01:30:11,712
- # No, no, yeah #
- # Not quite paradise #

914
01:30:29,713 --> 01:30:32,313
# Now we've traveled far #

915
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,781
# But are we any nearer #

916
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:40,448
# There's a feelin'
we're reaching for #

917
01:30:40,547 --> 01:30:43,781
# In the fields
where it all began #

918
01:30:44,879 --> 01:30:47,414
# Listen, do you hear #

919
01:30:48,547 --> 01:30:51,648
# I thought I heard a promise #

920
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:55,381
# But that empty feeling grows #

921
01:30:55,481 --> 01:30:59,116
# And I'm scared
that I will forget #

922
01:30:59,516 --> 01:31:01,715
# But I #

923
01:31:02,516 --> 01:31:05,780

924
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:09,947
# Look around and around #

925
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,248
# There's people
still hanging on #

926

I'm the one #

927

change a cold world #

933
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:44,082
# I don't expect
that you'd understand #

934
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:47,516
# When you look
at this empty land #

935
