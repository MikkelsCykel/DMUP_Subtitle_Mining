1
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,460
Get out of here!
Get off!

2
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,540
Excuse me.

3
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,380
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

4
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,140
I was expecting
to be met.

5
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,580
Good morning,
Truscott.

6
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,380
I am Belansai.

7
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,140
Welcome
to our country.

8
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,300
He's a bright chap.

9
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,500
He'll be the head man
of his Longhouse in two years.

10
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,340
John Truscott.

11
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,460
Henry Bullard.

12
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,580
I'm the governor
of this district,

13
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,740
but you just
think of me as God.

14
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,780
Hop aboard.

15
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,140
You've got far too good
a degree for this job.

16
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,900
What are you running away from?
Your debts?

17
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,420
Your family?
Or a woman?

18
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,260
No, no debts.
No woman.

19
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,180
My mother
died two years ago.

20
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,380
My father was killed
at Passchendaele, so...

21
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,820
Well, why in God's name
are you here?

22
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,180
My father was
a district officer out here.

23
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,140
William C. Truscott?

24
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,980
Ahhh.

25
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,540
He'd drawn up a plan
to bring education to the Iban

26
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,460
which the governor general
had approved,

27
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,300
but then he had
to go back to the war...

28
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
and it never happened.

29
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,100
And you've brought
this plan with you, have you?

30
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,780
Yes, I think it's our duty
to educate primitive people.

31
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,260
God, you sound
a sanctimonious little prig.

32
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,820
Still, you're young.

33
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,660
Sarawak'll knock
it out of you.

34
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,340
Famous,
you lazy bastard!

35
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,300
Look at the state
of this place.

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,180
Bring Truscott tea and gadgets
double quick.

37
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,780
Come on.
Chibi, chibi, chibi.

38
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,060
It's got bugs in there.

39
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,260
He's the best cook
in Sarawak.

40
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,620
Though strictly speaking
he's still on parole.

41
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,780
What did he do?

42
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,740
Oh, he hacked some damn fool
rickshaw driver to death.

43
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,420
But you should
taste his meringues.

44
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,540
- Shouldn't he be in--
- Now, tomorrow,

45
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,340
you've an invitation
from your local Longhouse,

46
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,060
the Gawa Kenyalong.

47
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,740
So Belansai'll
pick you up.

48
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,740
The feast to honor
the war god

49
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,540
where they take the giant hornbill
statue down from the rafters.

50
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,180
Oh, God.

51
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,580
You read-- books.

52
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,260
I'm afraid they insist
upon it at university.

53
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,100
Do they?

54
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,620
Has it come
to that now?

55
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,020
Yes, I'll--

56
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,100
I'll see you
in a day or so.

57
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,700
Excuse me.

58
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,660
Excuse me.
Excuse me...

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,780
What's my job?

60
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,340
This is my father,
Melaka.

61
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
He is head man
of the Longhouse.

62
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,860
This is rice wine.

63
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,540
Ah. Um...

64
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,660
I won't drink
on duty, thanks.

65
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,780
To refuse is an insult.

66
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,820
Left, right.
Left, right.

67
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,460
It's chibi,
chibi, chibi!

68
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,380
It is a... very ancient
tribal dance.

69
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,060
Oh, no, um... no.

70
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,380
Very kind
of you to offer,

71
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,100
but I think I'll give it
a miss this time round.

72
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,940
You must make us
entertainment.

73
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,660
A song? A dance?

74
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,980
A poem?

75
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Perhaps all three.

76
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,780
"The sand of the desert
is sodden red,

77
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,100
Red with the wreck
of the ranks that broke.

78
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,780
The Gatling's jammed
and the Colonel dead,

79
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,260
And the regiment blind
with dust and smoke.

80
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,740
The river of death
has brimmed his banks,

81
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,620
And England's far
and honor's a name,

82
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,020
But the voice of a schoolboy
rallies the ranks,

83
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,380
'Play up!

84
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,380
Play up
and play the game!'"

85
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,500
" Da-dum-dum-dum "

86
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,740
" Da-da-da-da,
Dum-dum-dum-dum "

87
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,860
" Da-da-da-da "

88
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,180
Oh, Truscott, you are very
funny Englishman.

89
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,620
Excuse me.
What's going on?

90
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,980
The dancing is over.

91
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,780
We go to sleep now.

92
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,580
You deliberately dropped me
in it, didn't you?

93
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,660
You know I made a complete
fool of myself?

94
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,580
They like a man
who makes them laugh.

95
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,500
Iban society is based
on heavy drinking,

96
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,500
violent sport
and practical jokes.

97
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,700
Just think of it as
English public school

98
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,220
without the buggery.

99
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,500
I'm on a mission to civilize,
not to entertain.

100
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,860
The mining concessions
at Kera Pulau

101
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,100
have been trespassing
outside their boundaries.

102
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,860
Your local Longhouse

103
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,500
got to some Chinese miners
before I did.

104
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,780
You're going to have
to bring in their heads.

105
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,460
What?

106
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,020
Well...

107
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,540
we limit the areas where
the mining concerns can--

108
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,820
No, no, no.
You said...

109
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,740
you said "their heads."

110
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,660
Well, yes.

111
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,340
The Iban have
cut them off.

112
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,420
What?

113
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,580
Ahh.

114
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
My dear.

115
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,700
This is Selima.

116
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,940
She's going
to live with you.

117
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,260
As what?

118
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,460
Uh... she performs
wifely duties.

119
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,660
Oh yeah?
What... sewing?

120
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,980
She performs wifely duties
in the bedroom.

121
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,660
- For God's sakes, man.
- I sleep with you.

122
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,180
We expect you to know
the language within six months.

123
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,820
Selima's what's known around here
as a "sleeping dictionary."

124
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,060
Sleep...

125
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,300
My mother was also
sleeping dictionary.

126
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,460
That's why I speak
the King English.

127
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,340
There's nothing like bed
for learning a language.

128
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,580
It's the only reason
I speak Portuguese.

129
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,420
No, look, poor girl.

130
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,340
- She was just-- picked?
- I pick you.

131
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,940
And she's really choosy.

132
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,900
She turned down
my last two cadet officers.

133
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Listen, your contract
forbids you

134
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,060
to marry
for three years.

135
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,820
Three years can be
very lonely.

136
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,100
And after three years?

137
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,460
We'll probably all be dead,
so why worry?

138
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,620
Oh, dear.

139
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,340
Listen...

140
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,100
you'll go home
on leave to England

141
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,420
and you'll come back with
a rosy-cheeked little wife.

142
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,540
Selima will go home
to her Longhouse

143
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,220
speaking
fluent English.

144
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,740
Oh, damn it, man,
it's worked for centuries.

145
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,860
There's no reason
why you should be different.

146
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,420
No, I'm sorry, no. No.

147
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,180
I know you think
I'm just some young idiot,

148
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,860
but if I don't follow what
I think's right, what else is there?

149
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,380
Then you'd better find another way
to learn the damn language.

150
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,900
Because if a so-called
educated man

151
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,260
can't speak the language
of the people he governs,

152
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,180
he's no right to be here!

153
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,460
Fine, maybe she can stay as...
just a dictionary?

154
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,220
- If she doesn't mind, that is.
- What?

155
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,020
Mind not sleeping with you?
I'm sure she'll survive.

156
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,220
She said yes.

157
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,380
What else did she say?

158
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,220
You'll have to learn Iban
and find out, won't you?

159
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,740
I'd stand back
if I were you.

160
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,740
Ha ha!

161
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Ants.

162
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,260
Yes, ants.
Thank you very much.

163
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,100
Good night.

164
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,740
You say no,
she get very angry.

165
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,860
Rain always stop
in morning.

166
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,180
Sleep tight and don't
let the bedbugs bite.

167
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,180
Chinese heads
as per request.

168
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,220
Thank you.

169
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,420
As you know, the Longhouse
will be fined.

170
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,100
Beyond that, there will
be no further action.

171
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,460
Monkey heads.

172
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,780
We make a joke on you.

173
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,540
Maybe I'll make
a joke on you

174
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,940
and bring a detachment
of colonial police up the river.

175
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,740
I want those heads delivered
to my bungalow by tomorrow morning

176
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,220
or I will confiscate your--

177
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,540
your pigs.

178
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,100
Master?

179
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,060
I bring you someone.

180
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,060
This is Jasmine.

181
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,540
He is assistant chef.

182
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,620
What do we need
an assistant chef for?

183
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,060
- He assist you.
- Me?

184
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,740
He assist you in...

185
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,460
private way.

186
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,420
Is this one of your relatives?

187
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
No, no, no.
He very clean.

188
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,620
He come from
Englishman on coast

189
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,260
who too old
for all that now.

190
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,660
What?

191
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,780
Oh, good God.
Get him out of--

192
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,020
No, get him out now!

193
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,860
- But, master--
- Get him out of here!

194
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,860
And Selima,
bring me a whiskey.

195
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,540
What are you doing?!

196
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,700
I'm not servant.

197
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,860
Fine.
You don't have to be a servant.

198
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,940
You're fired!
Dismissed!

199
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,740
You cannot fire me because
I am not yours to fire.

200
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,780
I fire you.

201
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,060
You are dismissed.

202
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,700
Make no attempt
to follow me.

203
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,420
- What are you doing?
- I live here now.

204
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,740
You can't live there.

205
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,020
Then I will live
in the jungle.

206
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,180
I like the jungle.

207
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,100
No, listen. You must go
back to the Longhouse.

208
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,940
They will
laugh at her.

209
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,100
They will say she choose you
but you no have her.

210
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,980
- Is that true?
- No.

211
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,540
They will say you
not sleep with her

212
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,900
because she too
pig ugly.

213
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,740
Listen, I don't
think you're ugly.

214
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
I think you're
very beautiful.

215
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,860
I don't sleep with you
because of my beliefs.

216
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,140
Because... the spirits
of my country forbid it.

217
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,460
You want to sleep with me
but you forbid by your spirit?

218
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,460
Yes, you could say that.

219
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
I will go to my tree now.

220
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,380
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

221
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,060
Perhaps we could
have another try.

222
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,100
If you're willing
to re-employ me, that is.

223
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,780
I will give you
one more chance.

224
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,460
Hey!

225
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,140
I want a word
with you.

226
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Last night you got
completely drunk again.

227
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,060
My other masters,
they fine me

228
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,980
one week pay
if I blind drunk,

229
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,180
two week pay if I blind,
legless drunk.

230
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,700
I blind drunk two time
a month regular,

231
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
so very cheap cook.

232
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,420
Fair enough.

233
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,620
Wait.

234
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,340
Do you play croquet?

235
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,060
No.

236
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,460
Help me reload,
would you?

237
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,500
I'm clearing the jungle
for a croquet lawn

238
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,900
for when Cecil,
my daughter, comes out.

239
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,340
It's much quicker than
a working party from the jail.

240
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,660
Aggie Bullard,
Henry's wife.

241
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,580
You must be Truscott.

242
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,940
How are you getting on
with Henry's damn fool tests?

243
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,340
I think next
I have to wrestle a crocodile.

244
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Sleeping dictionary
shaping up all right?

245
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,820
Truscott!

246
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,500
Us women don't know anything
about all of that.

247
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,940
- Truscott!
- And for heaven's sake,

248
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,340
bed her or the Iban'll think

249
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,300
there's something wrong
with you down below.

250
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,140
Excuse me.

251
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,820
Re-group!

252
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,340
Sorry?

253
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,220
You're not picking up
the language very fast, are you?

254
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,220
And where are those
Chinese heads?!

255
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,340
You are in the bathroom.

256
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,860
I am in...?

257
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,100
the bedroom.

258
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,660
What do I do?

259
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,300
I...

260
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,420
I say good night
to my father.

261
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,460
Where do you go?

262
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,820
Bedroom.

263
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,780
Bedroom...
bedroom.

264
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,180
W-what next?

265
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,380
I-I go to sleep.

266
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,020
Do English people
have dreams at night?

267
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,220
Sometimes, yeah.

268
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,100
Are we really
that strange?

269
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Have you ever
sleep with a woman?

270
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,060
I won't
till I get married.

271
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,580
That's our way.

272
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,100
But when you marry
you'll be very bad at sex

273
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,860
and your wife
will be unhappy.

274
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,620
I'll take evening classes,
I promise.

275
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,100
I've never met anyone...

276
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,180
even a little like you.

277
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,220
Whyever did you
choose me?

278
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,020
Your dance is not
the dance of an Englishman.

279
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,060
Good night.

280
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,420
Yes.

281
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,100
I thought you didn't like
our education.

282
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,980
You want to educate us
like your father did?

283
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,060
You were educated because
you're the chief's son.

284
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,820
Shouldn't others have
the same opportunity?

285
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,580
William, William,

286
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,620
Henry, Henry,
Richard, John, Henry,

287
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,460
Edward, Edward,
Richard, Henry,

288
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Henry, Edward,
Edward, Richard,

289
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,060
Henry, Henry, Edward--

290
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,780
Mary, Elizabeth,
James, Charles,

291
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,980
Charles, James, William,
George, George, George, George,

292
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,980
William, Victoria,
Edward, George, Edward, George.

293
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,380
The kings of England.

294
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,620
And why do I need
to know that?

295
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,740
The mission school
tries to turn us

296
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,500
into little Englishmen.

297
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,260
They didn't do a very good job
with you, did they?

298
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,060
You missed Queen Anne,
by the way.

299
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,660
You missed King Stephen.

300
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,940
I hear when you were young,

301
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,620
you were a champion at
the underwater battles.

302
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,980
When I was young?

303
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,700
I am still champion
of 1 0 Longhouses.

304
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,980
Yes, they say you can
beat any girl on the river.

305
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,180
Will you
challenge me then?

306
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,660
How you--
how you do that?

307
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,780
Some Englishmen

308
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,060
can breathe underwater

309
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,420
through their ears.

310
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,300
I wonder if I might
have a word about...

311
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,180
those heads.

312
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,300
It's lovely
workmanship.

313
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,940
I'll add those
to the collection.

314
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,060
The ants eaten
your dinner jacket yet?

315
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,660
I think there's
an arm or two left.

316
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,740
Good.

317
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,980
My daughter Cecilia
is arriving for Christmas.

318
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,260
First class honors degree
at Oxford.

319
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,460
You'd like her.

320
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,900
Come to dinner.

321
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,380
Oh!

322
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,420
How drunk is he?

323
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,620
Blind, legless, daft,
sick, smelly drunk.

324
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,660
My mother
read that to me.

325
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,020
My father
read it to me.

326
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,620
Do you remember
your father?

327
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,700
He go back to England
when I am four.

328
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,460
My dad died
when I was four.

329
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,940
"Deep, deep
beneath the sea

330
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,180
where the water is
clear as purest glass

331
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,540
Iies the palace
of the Sea King.

332
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,700
There behind its...
walls of coral

333
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,940
and roof of cockleshells
lives a little mermaid."

334
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,660
You can read English.

335
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,220
I remember it
by my heart.

336
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,460
I made him read it
many time.

337
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,180
Write a word from it.

338
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,620
"Deep."

339
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,380
Now you.

340
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,100
"Hand."

341
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,700
"Arm."

342
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,380
Neck.

343
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,460
Lips.

344
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,420
Breast.

345
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,180
I-I'm sorry.

346
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,020
That was too quick,
wasn't it?

347
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,420
You teach me English,
I'll teach you this.

348
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
School is not finished.

349
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,500
Not quite the education
my father had in mind.

350
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,420
Why do you always go?

351
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,100
For sleeping dictionary,
it is proper.

352
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,500
For the Iban,

353
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,700
if a man and a woman wake up
together five nights in a row,

354
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,180
they are engaged.

355
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,540
You don't want that,
do you?

356
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,780
Cecilia's got a degree
in anthropology, you know?

357
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,380
She did her thesis
on the Iban.

358
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,860
- Really?
- Mmm.

359
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,700
Why did you choose
the Iban to study?

360
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,380
I lived here until I was five.

361
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,340
Till Mother and Father
couldn't stand me any longer

362
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,700
and shipped me off to school.

363
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,820
But I always
remembered them.

364
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,340
The way you'd never see them arrive,

365
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,980
but then suddenly there they'd be,
standing beside you

366
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,340
as if they'd
been there since...

367
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,620
time began.

368
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,580
Although, for them, of course,
time only began 53 years ago.

369
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,540
- Really?
- Yes, the year Krakatoa exploded.

370
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,420
- That's their year zero.
- Is that true?

371
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,180
How the deuce
do you know that?

372
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,060
- Well, I listen.
- Do you now?

373
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,460
Well, I can't wait to get
stuck in and meet the Iban.

374
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,420
Shipperly's taken over
from Teague--

375
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,260
chap I told you about.

376
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,380
Went doolally
and ate his own toes.

377
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,060
I'll tell you something
I bet you don't know.

378
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,380
Back in Victorian times,
the young officers coming out here

379
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,700
were given a young woman
from the local head-hunting tribes

380
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,660
to share their bed...

381
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,620
so they could learn
the language quickly.

382
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,380
I hardly think so, darling.

383
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,020
Now you are having us on,
aren't you?

384
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,700
No, that's true.

385
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,340
I've heard tell of it
from a very old Iban.

386
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,820
- See?
- Well...

387
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,420
if it did exist,
I'm sure it was purely

388
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,620
a matter of convenience
and no...

389
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,460
higher feelings
were involved.

390
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,260
- Don't see why.
- Surely you can't seriously believe

391
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,940
that a primitive
head-huntress

392
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,020
and an English officer
could experience love.

393
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,460
Not love, maybe,

394
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,540
but I'm sure they could
feel a great deal.

395
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,100
Whatever an Englishman felt,

396
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,140
he would never
let that get in the way

397
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,060
of his duty
to the local people.

398
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,060
My Iban wouldn't
think less of an officer--

399
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,620
"My Iban"?
They're not your Iban.

400
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,340
They might be God's,
but they're certainly not yours.

401
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,780
We've got enough bloody dictators
in Europe, thank you.

402
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,940
- All I'm saying--
- And all I'm saying,

403
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,820
is that an English officer

404
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,980
would never let
his country down.

405
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,980
Nor his family.

406
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,140
Would he, Truscott?

407
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,380
No, sir.

408
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,540
So is she pretty?

409
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,460
Well, she's fairly pretty.

410
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,420
But does she have wings?

411
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,100
What happened to
the spirits of your country?

412
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,420
They grew old and tired and packed
their bags and left for England.

413
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,420
This is a land dispute
between two Longhouses.

414
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,260
It's fiendishly
complicated.

415
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,540
You must be sick of me
following you around.

416
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,180
No, I know how
interested you are.

417
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,500
At least this time we escaped
the dreaded Shipperly.

418
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
He's harmless, but...
he's like all men

419
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,700
who've been to an all-male
school and college.

420
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,260
The only women they're comfortable
with are their mothers.

421
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,180
He talks to me like
I'm a Labrador.

422
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,580
I went to an all-male school
and an all-male college.

423
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,940
Then something
must've changed you.

424
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,340
Well...

425
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,900
yes.
Being out here, I imagine.

426
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,340
So have you
sorted out this dispute?

427
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,060
Yes, I think so,
yes.

428
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,020
See, it's impossible
to sort out the argument.

429
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,500
So if I decide
for one side or the other,

430
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,980
it'll just seem
unfair to them.

431
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,900
Pull!

432
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,300
Would you mind?
That's it, perfect. Thank you.

433
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,220
Thank you.

434
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,700
Isn't she amazing?

435
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,580
What did she say?

436
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,060
There's not a precise
English translation for that one.

437
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,300
Cecil, these children
love having their photo--

438
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,220
She's wonderful.
I wish I looked like her.

439
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,260
Hands higher, please.

440
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,500
That's it.
Perfect.

441
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,900
Cecil, I don't think
she wants her photograph taken.

442
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,140
- Just a couple more.
- Truscott!

443
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,940
Go and see what's happening
down there, will you?

444
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,020
Ask her to keep up
that fierce expression, please.

445
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,740
- Cecil--
- Truscott!

446
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,220
I told you to go and see
what the devil's happening!

447
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,380
She won't understand.

448
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,100
She's Yakata.

449
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,180
You can tell by
the turquoise bracelet.

450
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,900
I studied them.

451
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,340
She was bleeding
through her skin.

452
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,140
Come away
and wash your hands.

453
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,180
There's a dozen more dead bodies
turned up at Laksai,

454
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,860
50 miles out
of their territory.

455
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,500
I'd better go up river
and have a look, hadn't I?

456
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,220
No, you hadn't!

457
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,860
It's dangerous enough up there
without an epidemic.

458
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,740
That's my job.

459
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,180
They'll have your head
as soon as look at you.

460
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,820
Besides he doesn't
speak the language.

461
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,980
Well,
I'll take Selima.

462
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,540
She speaks
half a dozen languages.

463
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,260
And Belansai, no one's
going to tangle with him.

464
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,300
Send that idiot Shipperly.

465
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,380
A few poisoned darts
might liven him up.

466
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,700
I'll set out
tomorrow morning, shall I?

467
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,540
Aggie,
I can't send Shipperly.

468
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,420
You said yourself
the man's an idiot...

469
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,300
If you're about to be killed,
at least stay for dinner.

470
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,700
Terrific girl, Cecil.
Isn't she?

471
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,580
Absolutely, yeah.

472
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,820
If you want a child
properly educated,

473
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,660
you've got to send them
back home.

474
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,500
But you can't be
in two places at once.

475
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,060
And I thought
it was my duty...

476
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,500
to stay with Henry.

477
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,180
Yes.

478
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,340
But they've done
a terrific job on her.

479
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,220
We're delighted.

480
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,500
She knows
all sorts of things.

481
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,300
And it means she's turned out
very self-sufficient, very capable.

482
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,340
Exactly the sort of girl
one wants to marry out here,

483
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,420
not some flimsy little miss
who's never left England.

484
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,460
And of course...

485
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,860
she's ever so fond of you.

486
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,580
Well, she's lovely,
like you say.

487
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,940
But I'm not sure
that I...

488
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,380
Love her?

489
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,180
I don't think I knew what love
was when I was your age.

490
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,940
I don't suppose you do.

491
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,780
Well, what is it like?

492
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,940
Well, it's, um...

493
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,020
it's companionship,

494
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,780
fellow feeling.

495
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,500
Now listen,

496
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,060
you want these schools
for the Iban.

497
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,060
Henry'll help you.
I'll see to that.

498
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,060
So...

499
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,340
what do you say?

500
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,900
I'm not really sure.
This is all rather sudden.

501
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,620
Don't take too long
thinking about it.

502
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,420
Neville's asked her
to marry him.

503
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,900
She'll be gone by the time
you get back from your trip

504
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,660
and you won't see her
for two years.

505
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,620
I'm sorry about
this afternoon.

506
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,900
I should have
stopped her sooner.

507
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,780
Selima?

508
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,620
You had other lovers
before me, didn't you?

509
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,420
Did you and they
have what we have?

510
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,340
Yes.

511
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,380
They were men
like you.

512
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,340
But...

513
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,940
I thought we had
something special.

514
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,260
No, we fuck, that's all.

515
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,220
You're angry?
You're not telling the truth.

516
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,500
I'm angry, that's why
I'm telling the truth.

517
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,340
Half my blood is English.

518
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,060
That is more than
your king and queen,

519
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,100
but for you,
that is not good enough.

520
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,500
So Iban I'll be.

521
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,460
Rule me if you must,
but nothing else.

522
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,580
Go ahead.
Do your sex.

523
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,260
Don't mind me.

524
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,580
"Hands higher.

525
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,620
That's it.

526
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,580
Perfect."

527
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,620
"Dear Cecil,

528
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,300
Everything is going
very well.

529
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,980
We've reached the edge
of Yakata country.

530
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,900
Belansai calls them
'the invisible people.'

531
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,740
And even the Iban admit

532
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,380
they can blend into the jungle
like no one else.

533
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,500
They're fierce warriors,

534
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,420
but they live
as one big family.

535
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,940
Sharing is so much a part
of their way of life

536
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,620
that they have no word
for 'thank you.'

537
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,060
I look forward to seeing you
when I finally come home on leave.

538
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,540
I'll finish
this letter later."

539
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,180
It's not like any disease.

540
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,140
It's not famine--
there's rice in the huts!

541
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,220
It's a white man with a rifle--
aiming at you.

542
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,900
Listen...

543
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,300
He's gone now.

544
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,500
Thank you.

545
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,860
Can you track him?

546
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,820
- My God.
- What?

547
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,980
I think this could be
a new species.

548
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,820
It's like the buffalo leech,
but bigger.

549
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,900
Would you mind just
getting it off my back?

550
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,180
I don't want to hurt it.

551
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,540
Maybe they'll name it
after you, sweetheart.

552
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,900
Can you remember where
you were when it bit you?

553
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,860
No.

554
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,820
No, I can't remember where I was
when it bloody well bit me,

555
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,220
because I was in the middle
of the bloody jungle,

556
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,140
which looked like every other
bit of bloody jungle,

557
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,740
full of bloodsucking,

558
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,380
bloodthirsty,
bloody little bastards!

559
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,100
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Bullard.

560
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,740
Idiot.

561
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,740
They come across the mountains
from Dutch Borneo.

562
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,780
- Very difficult journey.
- That's pure silver.

563
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,700
They'll be making
a fortune.

564
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,780
And it looks like they don't want
any other Europeans to know.

565
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,940
Me get sickness.

566
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,020
They go away.

567
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,380
You'll be all right.

568
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,900
We'll take you down the river
in the morning.

569
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,380
They say you brought
the illness.

570
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,300
The Dutchmen told them.

571
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,900
What did you say?

572
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,860
I told them
you are a god

573
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,900
and will cure them.

574
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,940
Oh. Good.

575
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,580
Ask them if they
will eat with us.

576
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,020
The Yakata don't grow rice,
do they?

577
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,620
So they must have
traded for it.

578
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,700
The bastards.

579
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,500
The bastards! They wanted
to clear the mining area,

580
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,820
so they put poison
in the rice!

581
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,900
- Do we die?
- No.

582
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,740
No, it's a slow-working poison,
so it looks like disease.

583
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,460
So, my English friend...

584
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,860
do we arrest the miners?

585
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,340
What will the Yakata do
if we tell them?

586
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,060
Kill them all.

587
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,860
Tell them.

588
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,020
Explosie.

589
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,260
Explosie.

590
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,340
When I found you
lying there,

591
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,620
suddenly everything
became clear.

592
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,820
I want to stay
with you forever...

593
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,140
if you'll have me.

594
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,500
Where shall we run?

595
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,220
Run?

596
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,500
We can cross
into Dutch Borneo.

597
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,700
There's no need for that.
I love Sarawak.

598
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,060
But they'll stop us.

599
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,740
Oh, for God's sake,
the English aren't barbarians.

600
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:02,820
I'll sort it out.
Trust me.

601
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,020
I'll sort everything out,
I promise.

602
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,500
I know
my own people.

603
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,420
You want to marry her.

604
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,980
We say we've a right to be here
because we're a civilizing force.

605
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,540
How can we let our officers
sleep with the local women,

606
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,700
and not marry them?

607
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,860
You're not the first,
you know.

608
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,980
Let me tell you something.

609
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,300
25 years ago,

610
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,700
I was a young idiot.

611
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,020
She was called Ipoh...

612
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,940
and I loved her.

613
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,980
But I made my decision,

614
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,940
and I never saw her again

615
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,060
until the day she died.

616
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,420
- You don't regret that?
- I did what was right!

617
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,860
I did my duty,
and so will you!

618
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,340
No.
No, I won't.

619
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,980
It's a good thing your father
didn't think that at Passchendaele!

620
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,940
Is it?

621
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,420
Maybe then he wouldn't
have drowned in a shell hole

622
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,620
so some senile old general
could get a knighthood!

623
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,540
God, you self-righteous
little prick!

624
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,380
- You'll do what I say!
- You let me--

625
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,180
Bit of
an administrative crisis.

626
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,060
Yes, I know
what's happened.

627
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,980
Everybody does!

628
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,420
I'd like a word
with you in private.

629
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,380
Selima...

630
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,940
The English have
sent word.

631
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,940
If you won't
give him up,

632
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,580
they'll charge him with
the murder of the white miners.

633
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,940
- Did you tell them?
- No!

634
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,180
They will charge me
as well.

635
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,020
That's why my father
asks you.

636
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,860
Look, there's a way
of doing things,

637
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,380
and if you change it,
our little world falls apart.

638
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,220
- You're the one that told me--
- For goodness sake!

639
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,940
Give her up and Henry'll send
you home on a year's sick leave.

640
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,340
You can come back
as if nothing happened.

641
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,860
Refuse and you'll spend
the next 1 0 years rotting in prison.

642
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,460
And then
we'll deport you

643
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,940
and you'll never see Sarawak,
or her, again.

644
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,900
You can't do that.

645
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,780
You broke the law.

646
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,780
You can't go around
murdering white men

647
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,540
just because you think
they deserve it.

648
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,780
He could hang you
for that.

649
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,860
But you'd ignore it
if I do as you want?

650
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,260
You've a choice.

651
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,340
Make your mind up.

652
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,660
- I want to see her.
- Send her a letter!

653
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,220
You've taught her
to read, haven't you?

654
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,940
Stop him!

655
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,580
Idiot.

656
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,540
Selima?

657
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,940
Selima!

658
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,900
Where is she?

659
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,380
It's all arranged,
isn't it?

660
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,020
- Isn't it?!
- It's not as I thought.

661
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,700
Th-there's difficulties.

662
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,100
Help me!

663
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,940
I'm ordering you
to help me!

664
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,020
You swore
it would all work out.

665
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,380
Truscott, I am getting extremely
fed up with you.

666
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,540
I'm too old to run through
the bloody jungle all night!

667
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,740
Just give her up now.

668
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,540
- This is your last chance.
- No!

669
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,540
Say you'll give him up.

670
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,900
You know what'll
happen otherwise!

671
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,940
Once I start this,
it can't be stopped.

672
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,020
John Truscott,
I charge you--

673
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,140
- I'll do it.
- No, no.

674
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,500
I'll marry
at the Longhouse.

675
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,700
I told you
it's not possible.

676
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,300
So?

677
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,740
Do you give her up?

678
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,620
I do.

679
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,180
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

680
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,340
You may kiss the bride.

681
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,980
Ready!

682
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,460
We'll remember this song.

683
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,020
Always.

684
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,020
There is something
I should say.

685
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,820
I know about your
sleeping dictionary.

686
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,260
At least, I presume
you had one.

687
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,820
Father thinks we women
don't find out about such things.

688
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,260
But anyway,
I don't mind.

689
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,300
I know how things
are done out there.

690
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,740
And the good thing is...

691
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,500
at least you'll know what to do
because I'm damned if I do.

692
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,380
What happened to her?

693
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,980
Oh, she married Belansai.

694
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,940
Your father
wrote me a letter.

695
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,980
Was that before you
proposed to me, or...

696
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,460
Oh...

697
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,660
No, I think it
must have been afterwards.

698
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,300
Here we go, then.

699
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,300
"Dear Henry,

700
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,420
I talked things over
with Cecilia again,

701
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,540
and we have decided
to return to Sarawak.

702
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,460
She wants to be with you,

703
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,220
and I would be a coward not
to finish the work I started.

704
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,580
I think the only way forward
is to wipe away

705
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,060
the last couple of years
and start life afresh.

706
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,420
I'm determined to make
your daughter happy.

707
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,180
Yours sincerely,
John Truscott."

708
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,140
" East of the sun "

709
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,580
" And west of the moon... "

710
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,980
I thought I'd organize
a welcoming committee.

711
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,020
They're wonderful.

712
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,140
Welcome back to hell.

713
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,260
Shipperly.

714
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:00,940
Weather forecast
for the next...

715
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,260
1 0,000 years
is too bloody hot.

716
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,460
Ah.

717
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,820
"...of the moon. "

718
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,180
You're looking at
the first Iban class,

719
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,340
the first Iban school.

720
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,580
Your dad would be proud.

721
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,900
If he saw the Iban choosing what
they were taught, he'd have a fit.

722
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,780
For heaven's sake, he wanted
to teach them Latin and Greek.

723
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:29,220
You know, I actually wasn't
going to mention this for a while,

724
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,740
but I wondered if you might
like to do some teaching?

725
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,020
Ow!

726
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,060
What in the world?

727
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:07,820
I thought
that's what you wanted.

728
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,060
I thought that's
what she would have done.

729
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,340
Neville told me
about you and her.

730
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,420
Have you seen her
since we got here?

731
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,540
No!

732
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,620
No, not since...

733
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,340
a year ago, or more.

734
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,020
He said she and her husband
had a little boy.

735
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,700
Apparently
they're very happy.

736
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,340
I want us to be happy.

737
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,500
Then why aren't we?

738
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,900
It's her, isn't it?

739
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,180
Yes.

740
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,300
She's very beautiful.

741
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,780
Isn't she?

742
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,100
In her own way, yes.

743
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,620
- What's that?
- It's Famous, blind drunk.

744
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:15,100
In fact, blind, legless,
daft, sick, smelly drunk

745
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,500
by the sounds of things.

746
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,660
You've got to fire him.

747
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,500
Cecil...

748
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,580
he's been with me
since I arrived.

749
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,540
He doesn't like me.
He preferred her, I can tell.

750
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,780
Hello?

751
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,540
Who's this?

752
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:49,500
This is your new cook.
Henry sent him.

753
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Mrs. Truscott
tell Mr. Truscott...

754
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,060
- to give me the boot.
- Thank you, Famous.

755
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,340
Thank you.

756
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,180
Did you do that?

757
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,540
Famous, take her into
the kitchen and clean her up.

758
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,700
You do not do that.

759
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,380
You treat her
with respect.

760
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:18,460
We're not all in love with our
sleeping dictionaries, you know.

761
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,620
Tipong!

762
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,780
What did you say to her?

763
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,300
Oh, I told Tipong that
if you hit her again,

764
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,220
she should wait
till you're asleep,

765
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,300
then cut off your testicles
with a kitchen knife.

766
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,900
They're very good at
that kind of thing, the Iban.

767
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,420
Probably wouldn't
even wake you. Now--

768
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,460
Henry sent me.

769
01:06:57,460 --> 01:07:00,660
We've got to unbugger up
your last month's work.

770
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,020
Cecil--

771
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,500
you know, I would have
made her happy.

772
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,180
I told him we'd
remember this song.

773
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,460
Don't be so pathetic.

774
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,340
You should forget all about
this love business.

775
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,420
Marriages work
far better without it.

776
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,020
You should concentrate
on the school.

777
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,260
You like that.

778
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,900
He just needs
a little time.

779
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,220
When was the last time
he slept with you?

780
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:41,420
When was the last time
he even touched you?

781
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:46,100
That's how you judge men.

782
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,820
Hello, darling.

783
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:56,900
Good evening,
Mrs. Bullard.

784
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,380
You will excuse us,
won't you?

785
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,700
You kissed me just to get one over
on my mother, didn't you?

786
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,620
No. No, of course not.

787
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,300
Take one more reading
before we go leave.

788
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,340
Right.

789
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,340
- Is the baby mine?
- Oh, yes.

790
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:16,260
And are you open
to bribery?

791
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,380
Oh, very much so.

792
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,700
So you'll arrange
for us to meet?

793
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,460
I am one step ahead.
I already make inquiries,

794
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,300
and she will not see you.

795
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,780
So you tell her Tipong
has been beaten again

796
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,300
and needs her help.

797
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,540
Shipperly?

798
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,940
Shipperly I will send
on a vital mission somewhere.

799
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,060
Somewhere famed for the size
and quantity of its tiger leeches.

800
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,260
Please.

801
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,100
I want to see
my son.

802
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,620
I don't understand "son."

803
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,380
My child.

804
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,060
Child?

805
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:16,580
You understand perfectly.
He was born nine months ago.

806
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:20,420
I don't understand
English anymore.

807
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,620
My son. You have my son.
His name is Mandar.

808
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,540
I left him on the veranda.
I was frightened of Neville.

809
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,820
I'll get him!

810
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,540
You can have one minute,

811
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,140
but they'll kill me
if they see us together.

812
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,460
Selima, stay!

813
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:54,020
For how long?
Forever?

814
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:57,620
I didn't know they were going to
treat us like that, I'm sorry.

815
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,860
I don't know
what to say.

816
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,180
He's Belansai's son now.

817
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,820
He marry me even though
he knew I was pregnant.

818
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,900
"Deep, deep beneath the sea...

819
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:22,060
where the water is clear
as the purest glass,

820
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,900
there lies the palace
of the Sea King.

821
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:29,060
And there, behind
the walls of coral,

822
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:31,580
and beneath its roof
of cockleshells

823
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,380
Iived the little mermaid."

824
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,100
So, Truscott.

825
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,180
Is there some good news
you're not telling us?

826
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,220
I presume you've
impregnated my daughter.

827
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,540
Oh... no.

828
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,860
Not yet.

829
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,260
It's just in case.

830
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,180
Let me tell you why
I stayed here with Henry,

831
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,700
and let Cecil grow up alone.

832
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,820
I told you it was duty.

833
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:37,140
I told myself it was duty,

834
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,300
but it wasn't duty.

835
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,140
I never dared
leave Henry alone...

836
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:45,540
for fear he'd go back
to his native girl.

837
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,020
So be warned.

838
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:58,740
I won't let that...

839
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,900
wreck another generation.

840
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,980
- John!
- Ah!

841
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:16,460
They've cornered him--

842
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,500
at the Longhouse loft
at Baritsai.

843
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:23,100
The damn fool!

844
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,420
I hoped he'd run over
the mountains to Dutch Borneo.

845
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,660
You caused all this!

846
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:33,260
Now we're going to have
to execute him.

847
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,100
One of the best men
I know.

848
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,980
Well, you can
damn well be his judge.

849
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,620
He had no choice.

850
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:42,700
I know that!

851
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:45,140
I know that.

852
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:48,300
But he tried to kill
a colonial official

853
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,700
and that has to mean death.

854
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,980
Even though the colonial
official in question

855
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:57,260
deserved having his throat cut
for sneaking around with his wife!

856
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,540
It wasn't her I was seeing,
it was my son!

857
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,500
My son, who you
never told me about!

858
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,460
Am I supposed to pretend
he doesn't exist?

859
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,580
Yes, you are!

860
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:07,860
For the rest of your life.

861
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,020
Yes.

862
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,180
Have you--?

863
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,860
Another daughter?

864
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,460
Yes.

865
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,620
The daughters
of sleeping dictionaries

866
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:32,340
become sleeping
dictionaries.

867
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:37,100
I thought
you were kind,

868
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,260
that you'd
treat her well.

869
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,860
Not quite as well as you ended up
treating her, of course.

870
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,380
And she doesn't know?

871
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,100
No.

872
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,500
I told her mother
to tell her

873
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,340
that I was
back in England.

874
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,980
It's normal.

875
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,420
This way is best.

876
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,500
Aggie--

877
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,260
it wouldn't be
fair on her.

878
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,620
I did my duty.

879
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,420
At least I didn't
kill anyone!

880
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,300
Belansai,

881
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:27,900
was it your intention
to kill me,

882
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,940
or just to wound me?

883
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,620
To kill you.

884
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,260
But did you
come to kill me?

885
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,700
Or did a sudden madness
seize you?

886
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,660
I came to kill you.

887
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,060
Belansai...

888
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,420
tell the court why
you had to try to kill me.

889
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,580
The court will adjourn
and pass sentence tomorrow.

890
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,540
- What are you doing?
- He saved my life.

891
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,500
Yes, and what a shame
that was.

892
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,980
Don't think you're going to sentence
him to anything except death.

893
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,900
You do that, and I'll just
step in and overrule you.

894
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,260
You understand me?
You'll have achieved nothing!

895
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:55,620
Leave her alone!

896
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,380
Go on, get back!
Move! Move!

897
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:29,980
Be upstanding.

898
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:32,580
This court is
now in session.

899
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:39,700
This court
is in session.

900
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,980
Belansai Ringan,

901
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:59,220
this court finds you
guilty of attempted murder.

902
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,260
Due to the lack of
mitigating circumstances,

903
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,460
I have no alternative
but to sentence you to death.

904
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,540
Tomorrow morning
you'll be taken from the jail,

905
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,900
and hung from your neck
until you are dead.

906
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,820
May God have mercy
on your soul.

907
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:34,380
Do they have to make
such a bloody noise

908
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,460
building a scaffold?

909
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,540
And it's all because
of that damn fool Truscott.

910
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,660
It'll do him good.

911
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,060
Now he's seen the consequences,
it'll settle him down.

912
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,420
But Cecilia said
she saw them talking.

913
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:49,700
- Surely we ought to--
- Do as little as possible.

914
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,660
He did what you asked him to,
today, didn't he?

915
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,980
- Hmmm.
- He's like you, Henry,

916
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:59,260
when it comes to what
really matters, he always gives in.

917
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:01,540
Now have another drink
and go to bed.

918
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:02,540
Hmmm.

919
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,140
You've no reason
not to take it.

920
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,220
Well, we're going to have
to run away together now.

921
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,100
Steamer leaves
tomorrow at dawn.

922
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,100
I'll leave at dusk, I'll be there
by 3:00 a.m. at the latest.

923
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,820
You won't come.

924
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,820
They'll find out. They'll say you
must be an Englishman.

925
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:06,900
And I'll tell them
that I'd rather have you

926
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,260
than a country,
or a language,

927
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:11,220
or a history.

928
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,340
I can't prove it,
but I know what you've done.

929
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,300
And I'm going to treat you
as if you had done it!

930
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,020
Have you
anything to say?

931
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,620
You're a bloody disgrace!

932
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,380
If it wasn't for Cecil,
I'd put you in there!

933
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:48,740
Get out to the dam
and do something useful!

934
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,180
Go on.

935
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,140
You won't get
any sense out of her.

936
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,500
Listen, you're not welcome
at the Longhouse,

937
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,820
and you're certainly
not welcome here.

938
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,820
So Shipperly--
Neville--

939
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,540
has very kindly agreed to take you
on as a sleeping dictionary.

940
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,140
I presume you'd prefer that
to a spell in prison.

941
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:35,980
Off we go, then.

942
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,860
It was wonderful
at the school today.

943
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,380
I tried teaching in Iban.

944
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,700
And I thought I said
cooking yams-- "patanta"

945
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,540
but actually I said "matanta--"
cooking your lover.

946
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,900
They laughed and laughed.

947
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,980
And... now I'm going
to have to tell you.

948
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:18,420
I'm pregnant.

949
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,620
Doctor Smith came
from Miri today and...

950
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,820
there's no doubt about it.

951
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,860
Your face.

952
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,940
You look so happy.

953
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:35,900
Well, of course I'm happy.

954
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,940
I know I shouldn't
really say this...

955
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,540
but I nearly
gave up on us.

956
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:51,060
But I didn't.
And I'm so glad.

957
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,900
Shall we open
that bottle of champagne?

958
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:16,100
"Leeches."
Hmmm?

959
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,500
"Jungle."

960
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:25,460
"Fucking jungle."

961
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,300
"Fucking jungle...

962
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,100
full of prick-teasing,
little brown savages."

963
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,580
There she is,
swearing like a trooper

964
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,540
blood everywhere,
the cook-turned-midwife screaming,

965
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:45,380
- "Push, lady, push!"
- Henry completely useless.

966
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,420
Shouting to nobody
in particular:

967
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,220
"Why didn't we get her
downriver before the monsoon? "

968
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:53,420
And then in walks
this clouded leopard.

969
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,060
It was attracted
by the blood, you see.

970
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,500
However,
not really dangerous.

971
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,580
He starts shooting
anyway.

972
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,820
Bullets flying everywhere,
except anywhere near the leopard.

973
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,780
- In the middle of all this uproar--
- Out I pop.

974
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,420
Yes, bright pink.

975
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,140
And even then, she was
the loudest thing in the room.

976
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,180
She was wonderful,
wasn't she?

977
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,540
It was wonderful for us,
the first five years

978
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:22,060
before we had to--
you know, send you home.

979
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,500
Yes. She was wonderful,
wasn't she?

980
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,740
How many glasses of champagne
have you had, Daddy?

981
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:30,220
Oh, come on,
if a man can't celebrate...

982
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:34,180
Listen, I prayed that
this would happen for both of you.

983
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,940
It'll make
all the difference.

984
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:39,820
Look at him.

985
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:42,100
He's still in shock.

986
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,380
Get baby and go!
I catch you up!

987
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:18,300
It is for me, isn't it?

988
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,580
Why haven't you finished it?

989
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:38,420
Because nothing
I could think of seemed...

990
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,580
enough.

991
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,180
Tonight I've been
watching you,

992
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:49,420
trying to make myself
believe you were happy.

993
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:52,940
Because I was so determined that
this would finally do the trick...

994
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,220
that this would
make us be in love.

995
01:26:56,220 --> 01:26:59,220
I did love seeing you
so happy.

996
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,700
I saw that, but...

997
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,580
it's not enough, is it?

998
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,820
You know...

999
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,740
I think you probably know my mother
and father better than I do.

1000
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:14,620
You've spent more
time with them.

1001
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,740
Five. I was...

1002
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:20,620
five when I was shipped off
back to school in England.

1003
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:24,420
Some mothers came with
their children, but not mine.

1004
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,980
She never even
came home for Christmas.

1005
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:29,820
She wouldn't let Daddy
out of her sight.

1006
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:38,620
So when you asked me
to marry you, I thought,

1007
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,580
"Here's someone
who's chosen me.

1008
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:45,780
Not someone who's lumbered with me
and has to pretend to love me,

1009
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:48,540
but someone
who really wants me."

1010
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:53,780
But all the time
you loved someone else.

1011
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,740
If it hadn't been for her,

1012
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,940
we could've been happy enough,
couldn't we?

1013
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,780
No, it's all right.
You don't have to lie.

1014
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:08,340
And anyway, I'm not prepared
to settle for "happy enough."

1015
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,860
Not anymore.

1016
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,300
I want--

1017
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,460
I want what
you and her have.

1018
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,180
Now go.

1019
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,500
I want you to go.

1020
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,180
Anyway, you've left
something of yours behind.

1021
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:53,580
I won't say anything to Mother
and Father till the morning.

1022
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,180
It's better this way.

1023
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,100
Psst. Psst!

1024
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,460
She think you not coming.

1025
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:16,340
She not catch boat.
She making a run for Dutch Borneo.

1026
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:18,820
Head for old mine.

1027
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,020
You do realize
I can't let you go.

1028
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,380
You might need this.

1029
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,620
My second present.

1030
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:15,020
You know?

1031
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:16,980
I guess eventually.

1032
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:37,140
Seems I only
ever get to say goodbye.

1033
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,780
Come on.

1034
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,260
I do hope you're
not incorruptible.

1035
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,780
They're both headed
over the mountains.

1036
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,660
I have a party
ready to follow them.

1037
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,620
Have you?

1038
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:21,620
There's no whiskey trees
in the jungle, you know.

1039
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,700
Henry, she tried
to kill Shipperly.

1040
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,980
- That's a hanging offense.
- I can't spare the men.

1041
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,220
Do you care nothing
for your daughter?

1042
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:43,980
I care a great deal...

1043
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:45,780
for them both.

1044
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,340
Cecil, tell him.

1045
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:54,780
I don't want John hurt.

1046
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,700
Or my sister.

1047
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,820
He said go after them.

1048
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:24,060
Come along, idiot.
What are you waiting for?

1049
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:04,740
Stay here.

1050
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:17,660
Selima!

1051
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,020
Selima!

1052
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,260
Selima!

1053
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:15,180
Afternoon.

1054
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:18,940
I thought you'd
turn up eventually.

1055
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,700
Handcuff yourselves
to the pole.

1056
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:28,580
Come on! We don't want to wake
the baby up, now do we?!

1057
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,620
Do it properly,
Truscott.

1058
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:52,460
I've thought a lot
about the order of this.

1059
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,380
But I reckon...

1060
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,980
rape Selima,

1061
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:59,300
kill baby,

1062
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,540
kill Selima...

1063
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,740
kill you.

1064
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:28,420
Jam, did it?

1065
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,540
Eeny...

1066
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,620
meeny...

1067
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,020
minie...

1068
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:44,020
mo.

1069
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:21,100
"The witch said
to the little mermaid,

1070
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,740
'Why do you want to take human form
and walk upon the land?'

1071
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,100
'Because I love him.

1072
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:31,300
He is always in my thoughts

1073
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:34,060
and I would place
my happiness in his hands,'

1074
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,180
replied the little mermaid."

1075
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:04,060
They sing because
they move on tomorrow.

1076
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:06,860
Make a new village
a day's journey from here.

1077
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:10,580
They want us
to come with them.

1078
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,580
Then we must go.

1079
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:17,100
If we go,
you will have nothing.

1080
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,500
I'll have this.

1081
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,260
I'll have you.

1082
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,380
So shall I tell them
we'll come?

1083
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,420
Tell them.

1084
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:42,420
