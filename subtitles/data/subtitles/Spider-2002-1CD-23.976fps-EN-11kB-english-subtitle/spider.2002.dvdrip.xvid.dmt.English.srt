1
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,210
Down there, isn't it?
Just don't know.

2
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,250
What's it say...

3
00:07:04,288 --> 00:07:07,687
Miss... Miss Wilkinson...

4
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:14,127
Mr Cleg, I presume?

5
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,687
I'm Mrs Wilkinson.

6
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,927
Come in.
We've been expecting you.

7
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:26,807
Wait here, Mr Cleg.
While I fetch me keys.

8
00:08:34,204 --> 00:08:37,244
Good evening to you, sir.

9
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:42,083
You're familiar with the scorpion, I take it?

10
00:08:43,043 --> 00:08:44,923
no... no

11
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:46,843
Not from Africa then.

12
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:50,683
I had you down as
an old Africa hand

13
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:52,883
no.

14
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,363
Africa...

15
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:02,563
Now there's a dark continent for you...

16
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:07,962
I knew a man once,
who'd been told never to go bare foot because of the...

17
00:09:07,962 --> 00:09:10,762
... scorpion.

18
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,642
ah, getting aquainted with the residence
Mr Cleg.

19
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:19,442
Good. This is Terrence,
but I'm afraid we are not to be trusted.

20
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:21,362
Are we Terrence?

21
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:25,162
now...
lets get you upstairs.

22
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:28,522
out of those wet things.

23
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,521
got out of bed
in the middle of the night,

24
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,281
put his shoes on.

25
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:48,961
put his shoes on...

26
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,041
stung by a scorpion.

27
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,920
sleeping in one of the toe caps.

28
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,800
Died in agony.

29
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,440
17 hours...

30
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,559
take these Mr Cleg.

31
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,479
come.

32
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:04,518
Your room, Mr. Cleg.

33
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,714
Oh... not undressed yet?

34
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:23,114
here...

35
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,314
very well then Mr. Cleg.

36
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:32,514
I'll leave you to your own devices.

37
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:13,467
Kitchener Street

38
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:16,707
Spleen Street

39
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,907
home to...

40
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:25,427
you're not a good survivor...

41
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,387
I'll run away... I'll run away
and down a canal

42
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:36,706
and down a canal... Kitchener Street

43
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,626
My mum

44
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:58,825
Wakey, wakey, Mr. Cleg.

45
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:10,145
Not in bed, please.

46
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,784
I trust you slept well sir.

47
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:40,544
The bed in this house has a curious...

48
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,223
... character.

49
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:47,303
But one does grow used to it after...

50
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:50,863
... just a few years.

51
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:56,703
I will not... I will not be here that long.

52
00:16:57,623 --> 00:17:00,743
Nor did I expect to be, but...

53
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:03,623
... it is a loud world.

54
00:17:04,263 --> 00:17:06,503
and this... is an Island.

55
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:10,302
But... an Island sir...

56
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:13,102
... ruled by a tyrant queen.

57
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:19,382
Has the power to send any one of us
back to where we came from.

58
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,862
the assylum, I mean.

59
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:25,702
Terrence, waxing already?

60
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:30,142
Perhaps you'd share
your thoughts with me sometime.

61
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:33,061
Mr. Cleg?

62
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,221
How much shirts are you wearing?

63
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,101
One, two, three...
four?!

64
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,981
Now really
is this absolutely necessary?

65
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,821
Oh... indeed it is madam.

66
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:49,501
clothes maketh the man...

67
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:57,100
the less there is of the man,
the more the need for clothes.

68
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,890
Brilliant.

69
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:27,169
Wing of a seagull

70
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:33,649
It... could have gone nowhere else.

71
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:47,048
Are you making progress?

72
00:24:31,484 --> 00:24:33,364
What's you doing?

73
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:35,284
Making something.

74
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:38,004
Making something...

75
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:41,004
Aren't you clever.

76
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:42,964
You're so good with your hands.

77
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:47,323
- This is for you.
- for you... for you.

78
00:24:57,403 --> 00:25:02,163
you run down the 'Dog' that's a good boy,
tell you father his diner's on the table.

79
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:05,043
- It's not on the table.
- It's not on the table.

80
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,842
Well, it will be by the time
you get him out of that pub.

81
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,882
Don't go out the front
I just done them steps.

82
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,479
- Who's this then?
- that's a new fellow aren't ya.

83
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,439
I've come for me dad.

84
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:31,199
He's not here, is he.

85
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,919
I can't believe she done that!

86
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:44,238
oh look at his little face. Bless him.

87
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:59,158
- Good evening Bill.
- Good evening Ernie.

88
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:02,358
- the usual?
- ya, cheers.

89
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,717
Dad?

90
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,997
Dad?

91
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:17,717
Dad?

92
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:21,677
Dad...

93
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,036
Now don't you say a word.

94
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:23,034
Well...

95
00:28:23,914 --> 00:28:27,394
It was different when I was a girl.

96
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:30,834
We lived out in the country then.

97
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:33,634
Essex.

98
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:37,554
I remember how I'd go across
the fields in the morning...

99
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:41,754
And I'd see the webs in the trees.

100
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:44,633
Like clouds of muslin they were.

101
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:47,393
what, spider's webs?

102
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,433
Spider's webs...

103
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:51,353
Of course spider's webs.

104
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:54,233
They always makes webs?

105
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,153
then

106
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:59,233
look up close

107
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,033
I'd see they wasn't muslin at all

108
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:05,753
They were wheels.

109
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:09,512
Great big shiny wheels...

110
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:15,992
- You know what else?
- what?

111
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:20,112
If you knew where to look,

112
00:29:20,152 --> 00:29:23,952
you could find the spider's egg bags.

113
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:27,152
Perfect little things they were.

114
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:31,632
Tiny little silk pockets she made...
to put her eggs in.

115
00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:36,191
What happened to her
after she layed her eggs?

116
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:39,311
You like this bit, don't you?

117
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:43,391
She just crawled away
without looking back once.

118
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:46,031
And then she died?

119
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,911
Her work was done.

120
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,111
She had no more silk left.

121
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,071
She's all dried up and empty.

122
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,150
You ready then?

123
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,470
As ready as I'll ever be.

124
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,430
and you!
you guard the house. Allright?

125
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:42,066
What'll you have then?

126
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:45,026
Gin and orange for me, Billy.

127
00:31:49,746 --> 00:31:51,626
- Evening Bill.
- Evening Ernie.

128
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:55,466
Pint of bitters please and then
gin and orange for the misses.

129
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:58,305
Gin and orange...

130
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:03,145
I've seen more meat on a butcher's apron.

131
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:05,625
I felt that.

132
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:08,905
I says to him, I says
"Is that the best you can do?"

133
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:11,785
You want to take it up with...
see what smart people have to say about it.

134
00:32:11,825 --> 00:32:15,105
Getting an eyeful are you?

135
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,104
It's that fat tart... Yvonne Wilkinson

136
00:32:23,144 --> 00:32:25,064
- Cheers Ernie
- Cheers

137
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:36,344
Some fat tart... Yvonne Wilkerson...

138
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:39,264
gin with...

139
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:52,583
Don't drink so fast, Bill.

140
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,743
Fancy another one?

141
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:04,063
No, not ready for another one yet...

142
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:12,342
He turns to me and I say:
"Nora, Nora... there's no hurry."

143
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,982
So back comes Nora
she's on him right away

144
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:20,702
Next thing she's got half of London...
all over her.

145
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:22,062
She's standin there laughing.

146
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:23,902
"What are you laughing at?", I says.

147
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,702
and that ain't all she said...

148
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:30,862
"Look at him, more like Tom Thumb"

149
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,901
"Tom Thumb," I says,
"what about, what about Tiny Tim?"

150
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,781
how we laughed.

151
00:33:41,341 --> 00:33:44,181
Now that he's dead,
that's another story.

152
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:45,461
that was a right little heartbreak.

153
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,981
I wouldn't let him near me.

154
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:48,941
He told me today I said.

155
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:55,021
I say to him, I says
"I have the decorador, then"
know what I mean.

156
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Yvonne Wilkinson

157
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,940
She made the first move.

158
00:34:49,698 --> 00:34:51,578
- Yes?
- Pumber.

159
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:53,858
- What?
- I'm the plumber.

160
00:34:53,938 --> 00:34:55,778
I believe you have trouble
with your pipes.

161
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:57,698
Eve!

162
00:34:57,738 --> 00:34:59,618
Plumber.

163
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:02,818
Don't tread on the cats.

164
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:07,818
It's in here.

165
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:17,657
That the plumber?

166
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:23,417
Hello, Eva.

167
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,937
Eva?
Wicked all day?

168
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,176
All bloody day...

169
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:38,896
All bloody day...

170
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:41,816
You want air in those pipes?

171
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:45,336
We got air... bad air.

172
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,256
Bad air

173
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:50,536
...can't you smell it?

174
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:53,136
ya but it's coming from your lavertory,
isn't it?

175
00:35:53,176 --> 00:35:55,896
I sincerly hope so.

176
00:35:57,176 --> 00:36:01,815
Shocking, the state
of the plumbing in this place.

177
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:08,375
You going to do me pipes or what?

178
00:36:29,574 --> 00:36:33,454
I got a letter from that
Sofia Loren this morning.

179
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:35,454
- Oh ya...
- ya.

180
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:38,134
What she want then?

181
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:40,294
usual thing.

182
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:43,174
What?
The old... you know?

183
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:46,013
Exactly, right.

184
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:47,933
They're all the same.

185
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:49,853
All the same.

186
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:52,773
Still, what can you expect, really.

187
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,653
Mind you them Frenchies know a thing or two.

188
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:58,133
I should say
ya a Frenchie one with three tits.

189
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,413
- Get away...
- I swear to God.

190
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:04,133
One here, one here and one here.

191
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:06,213
Well you do surprise me.

192
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:08,053
Lovely girl.
Comes from Manchester.

193
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:09,972
You said a Frenchie.

194
00:37:10,012 --> 00:37:12,492
Well that was a different one...

195
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:18,732
My Mother had three tits.

196
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:22,532
A lovely woman your mother.

197
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:25,252
She did like a sailor?

198
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:30,092
She loved a sailor my mum...
Down to me, that was

199
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:31,732
How's that then?

200
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,731
Every time I smoke a fag...

201
00:37:36,731 --> 00:37:40,331
my mum... has it off with a sailor.

202
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:45,891
- You smoke all the time.
- well that's what I'm saying.

203
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,651
oh!

204
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,690
Hello plumber.

205
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:20,010
What you say your name was?
Now, don't tell me.

206
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,289
Bill.

207
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:24,809
Always been one of my favorites.

208
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:27,689
Had a cat called Bill once.

209
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:31,369
Nippy out, eh
glad I got me fur.

210
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,329
Do you like my fur?

211
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:38,249
Got it at the market.

212
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:42,049
Second hand.
Still, what's in these days...

213
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:46,728
I'm a bit second hand myself...
but you don't mind that do you Bill

214
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:50,128
Probably like that... don't ya?
a bit second hand?

215
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:53,728
...lovely job you did on them pipes...

216
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:56,008
there is quite air up in there...

217
00:38:56,488 --> 00:38:59,248
smelling got better...

218
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:03,688
Oh, plumber... lets have ya

219
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:07,648
... heating my pipes...

220
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:11,327
Oh do you... ooh...

221
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,767
- Hold each other

222
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:18,047

223
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,567
ooh, plumber!
ooh!

224
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:48,246
Hurry up, Bill.
Bloody freezing.

225
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:50,166
I'm stopping here for a bit.

226
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,046
suit yourself.

227
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:55,046
I'm goin back up to 'Dog'.

228
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:05,525
I went down to Salisbury for a drink.

229
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:10,885
Can't a man go for a drink
after his work?

230
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,205
I won't live like this...
wasn't meant to live like this.

231
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,965
ya, but it's not my fault is it.

232
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:22,244
- Oh yes it is.
- No, it bloody isn't.

233
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:27,524
It's all right, Spider.

234
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:32,044
Your father and me we're just...
havin' a talk.

235
00:40:32,244 --> 00:40:34,804
You woke me up.

236
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:38,124
That's all right now.

237
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:41,404
We're all coming up to bed now.

238
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:47,723
Care about my big Spider.

239
00:40:47,763 --> 00:40:50,603
Let's go on up.

240
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,681
Look what I bought.

241
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:51,761
Think your dad will like it?

242
00:41:54,841 --> 00:41:57,241
Spider?

243
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,400
Doesn't fit...

244
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:36,039
You will pick it all up, Mr. Cleg.

245
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,479
Every single piece!

246
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,399
Ya, hello?

247
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:13,437
Gas works got you have they?

248
00:43:13,477 --> 00:43:15,357
I'm not surprised.

249
00:43:15,397 --> 00:43:18,277
Nasty stuff... gas.

250
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,197
I knew a man once,

251
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:23,997
put his head in a gas oven,

252
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:26,757
turned on the gas,

253
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:30,317
then... he changed his mind.

254
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:34,956
His head was stuck.

255
00:44:11,995 --> 00:44:14,475
smell gas.

256
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:19,475
ya, I smell...

257
00:44:37,914 --> 00:44:40,194
Gas...

258
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:43,994
Gas...

259
00:45:06,313 --> 00:45:09,433
gas will smell...
gas in here...

260
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,749
honey it's certainly nice to
stay in for a change.

261
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:28,109
Just the two of us.

262
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:32,949
- Wouldn't it, aye, Billy.
- No it bloody wouldn't.

263
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:36,349
I'm sick of this house.

264
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,628
Bill!

265
00:47:11,347 --> 00:47:14,027
Oh, Spider...

266
00:47:53,586 --> 00:47:56,346
- Double scotch.
- coming up

267
00:48:28,064 --> 00:48:29,944
So... plumber...

268
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:33,744
Feeling any better tonight
know what I mean?

269
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:38,144
Why don't you a...
why don't you come down to the allotment?

270
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:42,864
The allotment?
When?

271
00:48:44,384 --> 00:48:46,264
Well, I'm heading off now?

272
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:49,783
Why don't you come down in a bit.

273
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:51,983
All right, plumber.

274
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:55,343
Don't mind if I do.

275
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:38,021
I'm going out, Spider.

276
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:43,181
I'm going to meet your father.

277
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:51,458

278
00:50:59,618 --> 00:51:02,418
- You all right then?
- ooh why yes!

279
00:51:02,578 --> 00:51:04,418
oh, you tipped over bad right there.

280
00:51:10,138 --> 00:51:14,337
- You all right?
- will be in a minute.

281
00:51:15,897 --> 00:51:17,777
This way.

282
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:20,017
You're going to take me
right in there are you?

283
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:23,417
Take you right in there, oh ya
I have something to show you all right.

284
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:24,857
What?

285
00:51:25,097 --> 00:51:28,417
- Oh ain't it lovely.

287
00:51:52,336 --> 00:51:56,136

and 20 Embassy please.

288
00:51:56,176 --> 00:51:59,935
- What can I get you dear?
- Oh no... I'm looking for my husband.

289
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,775
Right! She's looking for her husband!

290
00:52:01,775 --> 00:52:04,935
- Who's your husband dear?
- Bill?

291
00:52:05,095 --> 00:52:06,335
Bill who?

292
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,335
Bill Cleg.

293
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:12,415
- Bill Cleg...
- Bill! You're wanted!

294
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:14,375
Is he in here?

295
00:52:14,415 --> 00:52:17,255
Not if he's got any sense he ain't.

296
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:19,175
Bill Cleg... I don't know him.

297
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:22,855
- Regular is he?

298
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,934

299
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:29,134
Sorry dear.
Can I get you something?

300
00:52:29,734 --> 00:52:32,414
No.
Thank you.

301
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:28,607
That would be all right,

302
00:55:41,966 --> 00:55:46,686
That would be all right, plumber...

303
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,405
What?
What?

304
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:13,925
We don't care!

305
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:16,005
You'll wake up the neighbors.

306
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:17,925
They're my neighbors now

00:57:10,123 --> 00:57:13,402

314
00:57:13,402 --> 00:57:15,042

No one said you was a Spaniard.

318
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:25,082
You... bastard

I'll cut your fucken' heart

320
00:57:29,642 --> 00:57:32,802
Don't talk to me about nonchalance!

321

Stay away!
Keep away you bastards...!

327
00:58:57,198 --> 00:58:59,918
There it is.

328
00:59:02,918 --> 00:59:05,958
We was worried about that one.

329
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:23,117
Take your eye out

Kitchener Street

We're going to go to the shops...

332
01:01:00,553 --> 01:01:02,793
... we'll get you... some food.

333
01:01:03,433 --> 01:01:04,913
just put you in your buggy.

334
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:08,473
There's a good girl...
Right.

335
01:01:08,513 --> 01:01:12,033
Off we go...
Good girl.

336
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:21,590
What are you looking at me
like that for?

337
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:25,949
you have turned into a most
peculiar boy recently.

338
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:29,989
No wonder your father's
worried about ya.

339
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:33,109
It's not worth it.

340
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:42,549
It's your turn

341
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,269
Here's your toast

342
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:51,268
Dip (lard) in it, if you want it.

343
01:02:55,948 --> 01:02:59,788
Your father might be home early today...

344
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:03,308
He'd bloody wonder
if everything gets done...

345
01:03:03,348 --> 01:03:06,428
... ask yourself is it worth it.

346
01:03:06,468 --> 01:03:10,308
Yes, it's true he murdered
your mother.

347
01:03:10,348 --> 01:03:14,827
Try and think of me
as your mother now.

348
01:03:16,307 --> 01:03:20,867
They told me to go back to the gibblets,
can you believe it.

349
01:03:20,907 --> 01:03:23,347
Murderer!

350
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:30,467
- What are you saying?
- You're both murderers!

351
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:36,627
Down the cellar
I've had enough of this.

352
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:38,146
Come here you, you...

353
01:03:38,786 --> 01:03:40,906
Come back here!

354
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:44,866
now don't bother coming back!

355
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:47,346
Murderer!

356
01:03:49,666 --> 01:03:52,306
the hell...

357
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:57,666
murderer

358
01:03:58,826 --> 01:04:01,466
Murder, they're both murderers.

359
01:05:37,102 --> 01:05:39,381
Dennis?

360
01:05:42,061 --> 01:05:43,261
Dennis?

361
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:55,861
Dennis...

362
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:59,101
You all right?

363
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,860
Come on Dennis.

364
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,940
Come here.
I want to talk with you.

365
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:13,820
What... what is the matter
with you Dennis?

366
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,340
Why are you so...

367
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,380
... angry with us?

368
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,940
You know you're making
your mother very unhappy.

369
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,580
She's not my mother!

370
01:06:26,659 --> 01:06:27,859
Oh, this again...

371
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:29,979
Who is she then?

372
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:32,659
Who is she Dennis?

373
01:06:32,899 --> 01:06:33,979
Who is she?

374
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:37,139
She's a tart!

375
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:40,339
You cheaky monkey.
We should smack your head!

376
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:42,259
She's a cheap tart!

377
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,179
You killed my mum, you murderer!

378
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:47,379
You bloody murderer!

379
01:06:58,618 --> 01:07:00,458
Dennis...

380
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:03,378
Do you know what you're saying?

381
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:06,298
Are you daft?

382
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:11,938
I don't know where
you get your ideas from.

383
01:07:12,578 --> 01:07:14,497
You're by yourself too much.

384
01:07:14,937 --> 01:07:16,777
you need some mates.

385
01:07:16,937 --> 01:07:20,857
When I was your age
I had mates.

386
01:07:21,097 --> 01:07:25,897
Every young lad needs his mates.

387
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:32,697
Dennis...

388
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:35,937
... you still think I...

389
01:07:35,977 --> 01:07:38,856
... I done her in?

390
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:42,536
Answer me.

391
01:07:43,256 --> 01:07:47,536
Do you think I done her in?

392
01:07:59,656 --> 01:08:01,736
Thank God for that.

393
01:08:04,535 --> 01:08:06,655
All right.
Let's go home then.

394
01:08:06,695 --> 01:08:09,135
Come on.

395
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:26,574
Sorry.

396
01:08:31,454 --> 01:08:34,214
Sorry.

397
01:08:44,694 --> 01:08:47,574
- All right then?
- All right now.

398
01:08:53,053 --> 01:08:56,133
You sit yourself down.

399
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:07,573
I went out and I got something
nice for your supper.

400
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:28,572
Wakey wakey

401
01:09:32,012 --> 01:09:34,732
Wakey wakey...

402
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:44,331
Wakey wakey...

403
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:37,169
Well, Mr. Cleg?

404
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,449
What's you lookin at me like that for?

405
01:10:41,689 --> 01:10:44,929
Say something, Mr. Cleg.

406
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:48,569
cat got your tongue...

407
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:48,871
I'm missing a spare set of keys.

408
01:17:49,751 --> 01:17:53,351
I left them on this table
last night.

409
01:17:53,351 --> 01:17:57,831
And when I came down
this morning they were gone.

410
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:00,551
Well?

411
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:08,430
Mr. Cleg?

412
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:11,790
What do you know
about my spare keys?

413
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:15,310
A spare set of keys?

414
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:20,310
Several keys on a ring?

415
01:19:03,588 --> 01:19:06,148
Mr. Cleg!

416
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:13,108
Not in your room, Mr. Cleg...

417
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:16,467
... this filthy thing...

418
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:21,107
will come down.

419
01:19:23,547 --> 01:19:26,587
I'll ask you again, Mr. Cleg.

420
01:19:26,627 --> 01:19:29,787
Were are my keys?

421
01:19:31,427 --> 01:19:34,107
Who are you?

422
01:19:34,307 --> 01:19:37,867
Don't play dumb with me my friend.

423
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:41,906
Alright,
you leave me no alternative.

424
01:19:43,026 --> 01:19:45,506
Arms up, legs apart.

425
01:20:08,825 --> 01:20:11,945
What a magpie you are.

426
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:15,905
What have you hidden then... aye?

427
01:20:20,345 --> 01:20:24,265
Nothing to say to me, Mr. Cleg?

428
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:21,610
Oh! Come on!

429
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,610
Doesn't work.

430
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:29,409
The plumbing don't...

431
01:26:30,489 --> 01:26:35,049
Oh plumber...
fucking toilet don't work.

432
01:28:19,845 --> 01:28:22,525
You stay here!

433
01:28:53,404 --> 01:28:55,963
no, no...

434
01:28:56,283 --> 01:28:59,123
For God's sakes
somebody help me, please!

435
01:28:59,163 --> 01:29:02,003
For God's sakes!

436
01:29:03,723 --> 01:29:05,923
For God's sakes...

437
01:29:07,763 --> 01:29:10,563
You did this.

438
01:29:11,043 --> 01:29:13,443
You did this.

439
01:29:14,483 --> 01:29:17,882
You did your mum in.

440
01:29:20,242 --> 01:29:23,322
You... you killed your mother.

441
01:29:25,042 --> 01:29:28,402
You murdered your mother.

442
01:29:28,882 --> 01:29:31,322
Oh God...

443
01:29:40,402 --> 01:29:43,121
What have you done?

444
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:51,841
What have you done...

445
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:16,120
You ready to come back to us then, son?

446
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:21,160
you got smoke...
you got smoke, John?
