Whoo-hoo-hoo!

163
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:06,756
Got it.

164
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:10,259
- Million-year-old ice, right?
- Yes.

165
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:16,136
- Ten-year-old whiskey. Yeah?
- Ten-year-old whiskey.

166
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,168

Out of the way.

172
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,679
It bothers me that nobody's
reported him missing yet.

173
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:58,838
Maybe no one thinks he is.

174
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:10,186
What's this?

175
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:23,032
Well, let's find out.

176
00:19:37,421 --> 00:19:39,116
It's a fresh wound.

177
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:42,291
- Somebody treated him in the field.
- Yeah.

178
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,655

182
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:11,951
What could have caused that?

183
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:15,121
Rough edges around the wound.

184
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,420
Ice ax, something like that.

185
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:24,292
So we got a geologist
out at Haworth Mesa.

186
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:26,595
He injures his leg, has it stitched...

187
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:29,069
...then manages to climb
a 100-foot ice wall...

188
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,903
...falls onto his own ax, which isn't
found anywhere near the body?

189
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:35,671
Doc, this wasn't an accident.

190
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,980
This means a federal investigation.

191
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,846
We're witnesses.

and the last plane leaves in two days.

193
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,453
We could be stuck here for the winter.

00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,054
Can you handle that?

195
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:53,963
No.

196
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,498
I mean, God, I don't know.

197
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:02,395
Say the word, I'll bag the body,
put it on the plane for McMurdo.

198
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,404
Let them sort it out. No big deal.

199
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,886
I won't take no for an answer, Jack.

200
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,386
I have plans Saturday.

201
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:28,964
Microwave popcorn and a six-pack
is not plans. We're clear.

So it was a popsicle.

208
00:21:46,884 --> 00:21:50,945
But please, next time you find a dead body,
don't parade him down the corridor.

209
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:52,520
Sam, he was murdered.

210
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:56,552
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

211
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:59,787
His name was Weiss.
He was one of ours. We got to call it in.

212
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,488
Yeah.

213
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:05,633
See how the FBI wants to handle it.

214
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:10,034
- What camp's he with?
- I don't know. I got to talk to McGuire.

...131, confirming to

Michael Rubin. John Mooney.

218
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,380
- What do they do at that camp?
- One One is an ablation zone.

219
00:22:27,157 --> 00:22:29,853
- English?
- It's a good place to find meteorites.

220
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:31,961
It's right there.

221
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:35,291
Well, Weiss was nowhere near that camp
when we found him.

222
00:22:35,466 --> 00:22:37,525
Wait a minute. Weiss?

223
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:41,603
A few days ago, someone
from Delta-One One called, looking for him.

224
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:43,899
I asked around, but nobody had seen him.

225
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:47,976
Didn't you think it was odd that they called
here looking for one of their own guys?

226
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:49,271
Not at the time.

227
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:52,539

with that camp?

00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:52,973
You know who I am?

245
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,037
- Come in and let's talk.
No.

246
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,340
I can't come in.
You have to come to Vostok.

Only you.

248
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:04,552
- Why would I want to go to Vostok?
- Just come to Vostok. Please.

249
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:08,119
Look, I got a better idea.
I'll send a plane. You come here.

and you'll understand everything.

This storm is coming in fast,
10 hours earlier than we first calculated.

253
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:37,116
Fly eight runs?

254
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,983
Sorry, guys. We need to put up
as many planes as possible.

What is this, Top Gun?

256
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:45,990
How am I supposed to make eight runs
on three hours' sleep?

257
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:49,030
Same way as everyone else will:
by the skin of your teeth.

258
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:53,091
- Rhonda, I need a plane to Vostok.
- Good luck. All my planes are committed.

259
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,795
Pullouts are completely screwed
because of this front.

260
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:57,838
I need Defy.

261
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:00,937
Rhonda, I'm not asking.

262
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,273
Listen up, all personnel.

263
00:25:03,447 --> 00:25:07,440
The expected storm is now calculated
to arrive 10 hours earlier.

264
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:10,212
New evac timetable
has therefore been accelerated.

265
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:12,412
All personnel will be on the tarmac...

266
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:15,387
...10 hours before previous embarkation.

- Which one?
- Mooney.

278
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,324
Yeah, I heard of him.

279
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:01,330
Anyway, he's at Vostok,
the old Russian base.

280
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:03,964
I thought they already evac'd
for the winter.

281
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:06,803

He wouldn't talk over the phone.

You will be fine or you are fine?

285

when you first came into my office.

That's not true. I had a great tan then.

- Go.
- All fuelled up and clear skies...

- Miami.

Yeah. Ever since I saw Weiss's body...

298
00:26:57,194 --> 00:27:01,324
...it's been like 85 degrees
and 80 percent humidity.

There was a man.
He... He killed Mooney.

343
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:16,628
And he tried to kill me too.

344
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:19,698
He must still be here somewhere.

345

How's your chin?

346
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,579
It's better than your hand.

347
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:29,875
How bad?

348
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:32,811
Bad enough you don't want to see.

349
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:35,890
I got to get back out there.

350
00:34:03,253 --> 00:34:04,982
Hey. Let me see your hands.

351
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:07,123
- Hit the lights.
Right.

352
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,090
- Who are you?
Relax. I've got ID.

353
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:12,828
Where are the lights?

354
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,357
Get that light out of my face now.

00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:17,693
Robert Pryce?

356
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:21,127
I'm with the U.N.
Special Investigations Division.

357
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:22,771
Got it.

358
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:26,265
I went to Pole
to talk to you about Weiss.

359
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:29,310
- How do you know about Weiss?
- FBI notified us.

360
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,874
Your base commander, Murphy,
called it in.

361
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:34,209
I was dropped here
after the weather cleared.

362
00:34:34,384 --> 00:34:37,547
Been here for a few hours,
thought I'd let you two sleep.

363
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,151
You mind lowering that gun?

364
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,390
Mind telling me why the U.N.'s
interested in the murder of a geologist?

365
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,195
This isn't just a murder.

366
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:49,332
This is the first murder in Antarctica...

367
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:52,991
...and now our second. I don't
have to tell you how sensitive this is.

368
00:34:53,169 --> 00:34:56,332
We don't want this to become
an international issue.

369
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,406
- Right.
- U.N. wants our eyes on the ground...

370
00:34:59,576 --> 00:35:01,908
...someone to track it,
control the information.

371
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:04,808
- And that's you?
- That's me.

372
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,010
It's late. We better get to Delta-One One
while the weather holds.

373
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:12,086
Wait. I don't need your help.

374
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:15,015
I can see we're getting off
to a really good start here.

You don't want to share your toys.
I can do that.

to commandeer your plane...

377
00:35:21,831 --> 00:35:23,924
...and your pilot if I have to.

00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:28,497

who came after you?

Yeah, 6 feet, 175,
ECW gear head-to-toe.

00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,696
Sound like anyone you know?

385
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:01,398
I got there after the whiteout.

386
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:03,668

Haven't acclimated yet.

390
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:18,579
Well, if you were in McMurdo,
you weren't there long.

00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,785
We're on approach. Buckle up.

ASB, this is November 178.

393
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:28,222
I'm landing at camp Delta-One One with
Marshal and Agent Robert Pryce.

394
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:30,798
Can you give me an update?

395
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:34,595
November 178, there's been no
significant change in the approaching system.

396
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:37,331
I'll keep you updated
if anything develops.

397
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,941

We'll inform you on turnaround.

- Be careful around him.
- Right.

399
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,404
Here's a map of their work site.

400
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:48,869
They searched it in a grid pattern.

401
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:51,811
Looks like they stopped on grid 104.

402
00:37:52,115 --> 00:37:55,107
I've only been out here
a couple of months...

403
00:37:55,451 --> 00:37:59,319
...but when did det cord and blasting caps
become standard issue for geology camps?

404
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,586
There's got to be 40 pounds of plastic.

405
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:03,848
What the hell were they doing?

406
00:38:04,027 --> 00:38:07,519
They were supposed to be searching
for meteorites on the surface.

407
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:13,029
We better head out there.

408
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:30,978
You seem to know
your high explosives, Defy.

409
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:33,679
I learned to recognize them pretty quick.

Somewhere in the same region, yeah.

00:38:41,598 --> 00:38:44,965
Well, my friend, it looks like
we just traded one desert for another.

414
00:38:46,269 --> 00:38:48,533
But one hell of a lot colder.

415
00:39:03,152 --> 00:39:04,449
So how we doing?

416
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:07,289
- We're almost there.
Good.

417
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:12,090
How does ex-military wind up down here
working for the U. N?

418
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,456
It was an open post.

419
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:19,300
So really, how does a U.S. Marshal like you
end up in Antarctica?

Section 104. These are the coordinates.

Maybe you wrote it down wrong.

428
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:14,350
This ice has been worked.

429
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:21,191
They were digging here.

430
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:24,959
Looks like they spread the ice out
to cover whatever they found.

You okay?

00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:40,542
Just sit tight.

438
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:43,743
I saw a rope in the Cat.

439
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:48,515
If you're hurt, try not to move.

440

Watch the rope.

00:41:05,008 --> 00:41:06,032
Okay, I'm coming down.

442
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:28,953
Guess they found
what they were looking for.

443
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,337
What the hell happened here?

444

00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,299
Yes, I did.

446
00:41:58,861 --> 00:42:00,795
It's a cargo plane.

447
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:03,458
Is it American?

448
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:08,434
No, I don't think so.
But whatever it is, it's an antique.

449

this has been here?

00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,948
Could be an Antonov An-12.
These things haven't flown for 50 years.

452
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:27,079
Oh, my God.

453
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,622
- What? What is it?
It's a body.

454
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:39,431
Looks like he's been shot in the head.

455
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:44,873
Here's another.

456
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,343
We got another one over here.

457
00:42:56,586 --> 00:43:00,249
Why is one of the pilots back here?
Who knows?

458
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,575
We really should be heading back.

459
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:58,945
Well, that would explain
how they crashed.

460

They were in the air.

went back to take out the passengers.

{MEN SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN}

463
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:11,258
He must have surprised the
first guard, but missed the others.

464
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:17,065
And the other guards returned fire
on the co-pilot. Bang, bang.

465
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:22,599
The guards and the co-pilot take each
other out, and the pilot caught a stray.

Ice swallows them whole. Jesus.

Oh, God. Looks like fresh blood.

It's got to be Weiss's.

474
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:00,804
Weiss had an injury to his leg.

475
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:04,838
He must have cut it
getting into this box.

Whatever was in there
was what they were after.

That's his blood in the shaft.

478
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:14,153
He left a trail as they dragged him out.

Right.

00:45:20,529 --> 00:45:22,963
You're not surprised by any of this.

481
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,234
You knew this was here.

482
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,267
Talk to me, Pryce.

483
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,534
Two days ago...

484
00:45:36,212 --> 00:45:39,841
...someone down here contacted
an arms dealer on the watch list.

485
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,916
He was arranging the sale of six canisters
recovered from an old Soviet transport.

486
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,715
- Containing what?
- We're not sure.

487
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,154
During the '50s,
the Soviets mined down here...

488
00:45:50,326 --> 00:45:53,295
...for material to use
in their nuclear program.

489
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,930
If that's what the geologists found
in this box...

490
00:45:56,098 --> 00:45:58,225
...and it makes its way
onto the open market...

491
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:01,199
- Why didn't you tell me any of this before?
- I wasn't sure...

492
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,361
...if your murders and my canisters
were connected.

493
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:04,665
Oh, they're connected.

494
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,603
{CREAKING}

495
00:46:06,776 --> 00:46:08,141
You hear that?

496
00:46:16,018 --> 00:46:17,815
{ROBERT YELLS}

497
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:29,621
We're going to run out of air
long before anyone finds us.

498
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:32,233
Yeah, that's if
we don't freeze to death first.

499
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:46,171
Anything?

500
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,149
No.

501
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:50,943
Great.

502
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:56,355
Well, it looks like we're going to
have to dig ourselves out of here.

503
00:46:56,892 --> 00:47:00,453
With what?
That ice has got to be 20 feet deep.

504
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:03,355
Just trying to keep it upbeat.

505
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:05,533
Nobody knows we're down here.

506
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:09,003
Yeah. Thanks for reminding me.

507
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:22,413
Don't make them like that anymore.

508
00:47:28,991 --> 00:47:32,051
Let's hope Captain America over there
has got a plan.

509
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:36,992
The backup oxygen's empty,
must have been damaged in the crash.

510
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:39,062
Oh, great.

511
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,403
- Hey.
- Yeah?

512
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:50,909
You think when that guy boarded this plane,
he had any idea he'd end up like this?

513
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:58,442
- Oh, my God.
- What?

514
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:03,655
That's why Weiss wasn't wearing
any ECW gear when we found him.

515
00:48:03,826 --> 00:48:06,693
That's why there was no ax
found near the body.

516
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:10,127
Wait, wait, wait, you're losing me.

517
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:13,391
The only way in or out of Vostok
is by plane...

518
00:48:13,569 --> 00:48:16,265
...which means the killer
had to have access to one.

519
00:48:16,439 --> 00:48:18,839
That's why Weiss was so busted up.

520
00:48:19,008 --> 00:48:21,169
You think that's why
he was at Haworth Mesa?

521
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:24,471
Yeah, I think somebody killed him
and dropped him out of a plane.

522
00:48:32,488 --> 00:48:33,512
{SCOFFS}

523
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:37,056
This little revelation doesn't happen
to come with an escape plan, does it?

524
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:39,451
We're fucked.

525
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,806
Listen, Defy, I've been thinking.
Does this plane have a main-hold bail out?

526
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:58,310
Yeah, it's usually on the ceiling,
in case of an ocean landing.

527
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:01,081
Here.

528
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:05,714
Explosive bolts.

529
00:49:07,223 --> 00:49:10,090
We blow the hatch,
we punch a hole through the ice.

530
00:49:10,593 --> 00:49:13,585
At this angle, the surface can't
be more than 10 feet above us.

531
00:49:13,762 --> 00:49:16,458
No, no, no. Whoa,
you're asking a lot of 60-year-old bolts.

532
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:19,658
If the ice is too thick,
the blast will come right back on us.

533
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:23,601
We can blow ourselves up, suffocate,
or freeze to death. You take your pick.

534
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:26,205
Do it.

535
00:49:30,212 --> 00:49:32,009
We need a power source.

536
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:35,480
Here, there may be enough juice
left in the SAT-phone battery.

Oh, that's smart.

...his core wasn't frozen solid yet...

in Haworth Mesa for a day, at most.

- So I'm searching the flight logs...

before he was found. This is what I got.

Doesn't make any sense.

Sam, Weiss's body
was thrown from a plane.

600

Whoever flew it is trying to cover
their tracks. I got to talk to the pilots.

We'd found nothing for weeks.

We came back to base
to report what we'd found.

That's when we heard the story
about the lost Russian plane.

Instead of filing the report,
we went back out there.

We blasted our way through the ice
and found the plane...

We were afraid to move him,
so I radioed for help.

The plan was for him to call us when he
got to Pole to let us know he was okay.
