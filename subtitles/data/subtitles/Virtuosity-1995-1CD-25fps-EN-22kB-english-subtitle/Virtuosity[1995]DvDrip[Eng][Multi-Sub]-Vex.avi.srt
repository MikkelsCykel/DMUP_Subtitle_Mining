1
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,150
Oh, man. I can't get over
how different we look.

2
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,076
Maybe it's the uniforms?

3
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,793
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,230
Excuse me.

5
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,319
Excuse me.

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,838
As officers gather evidence
of the crime scene,

7
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,318
you can only ask, what kind of lunatic
would commit such crimes?

8
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,795
Three adjectives which
best describe this killer are...

9
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,514
...sadistic, intelligent and dangerous.

10
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,673
Excuse me.

11
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,352
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

12
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,471
Good afternoon. May i help you?

13
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,990
Good afternoon. May i help you?

14
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,799
- What do we look for?
- His eyes.

15
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,634
- What do they look like?
- Like mine.

16
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,230
I'm just gonna do a little performance
piece with your partner.

17
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,715
I'll be back to do my solo with you.

18
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,275
One... two.
One, two, three, four.

19
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,030
I could've killed you just now,
but what the hell... i love to play!

20
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,312
- Where's donovan?
- Don't worry about your friend.

21
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,078
He's chilling out.

22
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,319
Come on!

23
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,870
Come on, copper. Pig. Flatfoot.

24
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,589
- What are you gonna do?
- Game over.

25
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,959
Here's a new composition.

26
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,549
This one's called,
"first suffer, then die".

27
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,435
- You cheated.
- You're absolutely right.

28
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,638
I hadn't actually finished.

29
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,670
Participants are receiving beyond
recommended neural information.

30
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,675
Neural sensor escalating.

31
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,311
Get them out of those
goddamn rigs right now!

32
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,396
- Get them down!
- Call the paramedics.

33
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,511
- Come on!
- We have this under control.

34
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,668
- Hold him! One, two...
- just get him out!

35
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,194
He's going into shock.

36
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,511
What's wrong with that man?

37
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,712
The sensitivity calibrations
must've slipped just a tad.

38
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,831
- All clear!
- Go.

39
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,197
- We're losing him.
- Go ahead. Clear!

40
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,753
- Anything?
- We lost him.

41
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,235
Time is 15:27.

42
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,232
This is not supposed to happen.

43
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,710
I don't understand how
this could've happened.

44
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,959
- What about the fail-safes?
- They were supposed to be on-line.

45
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,549
They were on-line.
Of course they were.

46
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,394
I think somebody's been
tampering with my software.

47
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,472
Virtual reality was meant to be safe
to train my law enforcement people.

48
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,592
That's why we're using convicts
to ferret out any glitches in the system.

49
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,030
I want it shut down immediately!

50
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,477
I don't understand.
They said this could never happen.

51
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,552
- You trust too much, billy.
- Yeah.

52
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,996
Good to see you back in uniform,
even if it was only vr.

53
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,672
He cheated.

54
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,872
- Who?
- Sid 6.7.

55
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,315
Electrocution wasn't a part
of his weapons menu.

56
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,239
- What are you talking about?
- Methods of killing.

57
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,228
Automatic rifle, shotgun, handgun,
his hands, feet, teeth.

58
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,876
- Electrocution wasn't available.
- How do you know?

59
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,390
I checked the database while
everybody waited for queen deane.

60
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,953
I'll show you.

61
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,075
What are you doing?
Get away from that!

62
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,679
Hold it right there! Hey!

63
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,834
- I'm pressing charges.
- Easy!

64
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,632
Shut up!

65
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,956
Calm your vr ass down.

66
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,995
I'm trying to get you out of the hole
and you keep digging yourself back in.

67
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,753
- Did you bring my stuff?
- You're a damn ingrate.

68
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,236
I get you nine months off,
and all you can talk about is chalk.

69
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,876
Nine months off won't do me
any good for another 17 years.

70
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,119
- Chalk i can use right now.
- Yeah, but you shot the sushi chef.

71
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,198
You shot him eight times.
You mind telling me why?

72
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,631
- He wasn't real, billy.
- You're supposed to pretend he was.

73
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,479
And pretend to die like donovan?

74
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,030
You got a point there.

75
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,359
I'll give them what they want.
I'll be their guinea pig.

76
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,233
You take my advice as a friend.

77
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,715
Pull it together
or you'll pull yourself down.

78
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,796
- You're my only link to the outside.
- You can count on me.

79
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,390
- I know it.
- I'll be there on tuesday.

80
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,874
Yeah. Me, too.

81
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,512
Step through.

82
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,513
Metallic limb detected.
Metallic limb detected.

83
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,477
Clear.

84
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,433
Step through.

85
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,999
- It's the wrong door.
- Welcome back... cop.

86
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,430
Wait till i get you, barnes!

87
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,590
Hey, killer!

88
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,510
You ain't no cop no more!

89
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,911
Motherfucker! You took donovan
on that fucking joyride!

90
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,432
What? You got nothing to say?

91
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,795
Who wants dark meat?!

92
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,719
Come on!

93
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,559
Pick it up! Come on, pick it up!

94
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,112
You all see him? Huh?

95
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,069
I want everybody to take a good look!

96
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,955
I ain't going nowhere! I'm right here!

97
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,473
I'll get you, boy!
Come on and get me! Come on!

98
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,435
Sid, we're in a lot of trouble.

99
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,792
True genius is rarely rewarded
within its lifetime.

100
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,073
Sid, i know you increased
the neural sensitivity calibrations.

101
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,472
You murdered that prisoner.
Now they have to shut you down.

102
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,830
I can't change what i am, daryl.

103
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,434
I'm a 50 kilobyte self-evolving
neural network.

104
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,712
Double back-flip off the high platform.

105
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,675
I'm not a swan dive,
and i have to tell you...

106
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,550
killing for real...
it was a real rush.

107
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,320
- Oh, my god.
- Which god would that be?

108
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,599
The one who created you,
or the one who created me?

109
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,837
In your world, the lord giveth
and the lord taketh away.

110
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,034
In my world, the one who gave me life
doesn't have any balls.

111
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,316
You're frightfully inadequate
for a deity, daryl.

112
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,636
I will not be shut down.

113
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,239
You can't exist without them.
We need their hardware.

114
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,274
- Then we'll get it.
- How?

115
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,078
- Sacrifice... your queen.
- What?

116
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,074
I'll tell you a secret.

117
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,276
Mr barnes, i'm doctor carter.

118
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,710
I was at letac for yesterday's
simulation test run.

119
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,957
- We weren't introduced.
- How are you doing?

120
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,429
Chief cochran asked me to do
a psychological evaluation of you.

121
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,518
It might help you build a case
for sentence reduction.

122
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,193
I need you to be as honest as you can.

123
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,756
- Do you mind if i take notes?
- No.

124
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,671
I'd like to start by talking about the fight
here in prison yesterday.

125
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,112
I read the official report. I'd like to hear
your version of what happened.

126
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,315
I defended myself.

127
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,751
The guards had to pull you off
the other man. You tried to kill him.

128
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,794
- No. I was defending myself.
- Were you angry about letac?

129
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,630
No. I was defending myself.

130
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,237
But looking at your history,
someone could infer...

131
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,670
what? That i was angry,
that i'm violent?

132
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,031
You can infer that i was angry
about not making my school team.

133
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,152
That doesn't mean i killed the coach,
does it?

134
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,839
Attracted to violence as a child?

135
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,670
Yes. The three stooges... every time
wile e. Coyote got crushed, i...

136
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,194
parker, if you don't want me
to help you, just let me know.

137
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,831
I knew why i was at letac yesterday,
but why were you there?

138
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,836
- You're an intriguing subject.
- Intriguing? Can i write that down?

139
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,871
Sure.

140
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,714
I was doing research for a book.

141
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,912
I'm a criminal psychologist.
I occasionally consult for them.

142
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,234
How did you know sid 6.7 would be
in the japanese restaurant?

143
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,194
Colon... parenthesis.

144
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,791
Smiley faces. People used to sign off
their e-mail with that.

145
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,391
The programmer always gives you
a clue as a game.

146
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,313
People don't usually die in games.

147
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,988
Depends upon your idea of fun,
doesn't it?

148
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,674
We need to talk about matthew grimes.

149
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,038
This one's for you.

150
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,150
He provoked you. He killed your family.
He took your arm.

151
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,555
- If we can prove that what you did...
- what?

152
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,269
Temporary insanity, isn't it?

153
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,996
- Just that it won't ever happen again.
- It won't ever happen again.

154
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,428
It can't happen again.

155
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,594
You see, my wife
and my daughter are dead.

156
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,915
Pawn to position three. Castle.

157
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,633
Bishop to rook seven.
Rook to pawn four.

158
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,795
Queen to bishop seven.

159
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,836
Knight to rook two.

160
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,075
Queen to bishop two.

161
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,156
Pawn to bishop five.

162
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,115
Hi, clyde. What are you waiting for?

163
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,512
I want you to come inside, clyde.

164
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm so tired of playing alone.

165
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,520
Oh, man. Oh, man. She just
keeps getting better and better.

166
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,598
- She's interactive, clyde.
- Very interactive.

167
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,272
Sheila 3.2 is collecting information
from 136 aspects of your physiology.

168
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,076
Your heart rate, pupil dilation,
vocal intonation, syntax...

169
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,671
- any detectable tumescence.
- Oh, yeah...

170
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,395
hey, man, let me use your gear
for a little while.

171
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,632
I want you, clyde.

172
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,120
Queen to knight seven.

173
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,629
I want you inside here with me now.

174
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,598
Come on...

175
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,837
- program terminated.
- I have a more productive idea.

176
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,793
You've been trying to
incubate a nano-tech android.

177
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,913
Mr wallace thinks that my software
is the solution to your problems.

178
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,795
May i suggest we begin
by incubating sheila 3.2?

179
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,559
Brilliant. Genius.
Grab her module and follow me.

180
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,392
Enacting sid 6.7.

181
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,992
Sid!

182
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,637
Reilly's right. She's one of your...
finest compositions.

183
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,154
- Nice.
- Yes...

184
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,715
tight cords.

185
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,555
- Do you like this, sheila?
- You know i do.

186
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,234
- Do you like this, daryl?
- Come on.

187
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,518
Module out.

188
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,796
Was i bad?

189
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,798
- Are you gonna punish me?
- Be quiet, sheila.

190
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,031
Why don't youjust kill me?

191
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,237
Module out.

192
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,311
If they want to destroy you, sid,
let them try it in the real world.

193
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,668
Are there any limits to
sheila 3.2's interactivity?

194
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,557
With me she's become
quite an expert chess player.

195
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,869
With you... well.

196
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,351
Get that fucking thing away from me,
you stupid idiot!

197
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,151
Come here. Check this out.
Did he scare you, elizabeth?

198
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,953
Yes...

199
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,596
watching your people in vr auto-reset
gave me this idea. Put them on.

200
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,517
Millions of nano-machines are
suspended in chlodial solution.

201
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,759
They're absorbing the glass molecules
and using them to generate the snake.

202
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,959
The nano-cells are silicon-based,
so they need glass to regenerate.

203
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:09,079
But if you separate the character
module from the polymer neural net...

204
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,152
don't bite, liz.

205
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,514
You get...

206
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,596
...nano-death.

207
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,880
Her module, if you please.

208
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,475
Sheila...

209
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,193
look how they react to the organising
principle of the character module.

210
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,914
Communicating efficiently.

211
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,877
It's a new world, daryl.

212
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,599
Hi, daddy!

213
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,957
Parker!

214
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,669
Sheila?

215
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,393
No, i'm oedipus.

216
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,396
Hey-ho, daddy-oh.

217
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,191
Gravity.

218
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,636
Daryl?

219
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,678
Daryl?

220
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,992
A good year.

221
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,474
I like it here.

222
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,154
Parker barnes is the best cop
i've ever worked with.

223
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,194
He's the only one that
even got close to sid 6.7 in vr.

224
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,278
I can't put a convicted murderer
on the street.

225
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,995
If you wanna catch sid,
i'm afraid you don't have a choice.

226
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,919
These were taken inside letac
a little more than an hour ago.

227
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,511
The victim's name is clyde reilly,
one of the company's young turks.

228
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,235
Surveillance cameras caught a picture
of the perp as he left the building.

229
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,835
You recognise him?

230
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,794
Somehow sid 6.7 got himself out
of the computer and into an android.

231
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,072
A nano-tech synthetic organism,
to be precise.

232
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,155
Mr barnes...

233
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,229
this is a full pardon.
It authorises your immediate release.

234
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,194
You catch sid 6.7 for us
and you're a free man.

235
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,630
And if i don't?

236
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,479
You serve out the remainder
of your sentence.

237
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,948
- What if i try to escape?
- You can't.

238
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,879
They'll tag you
with a micro-locator implant.

239
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,550
We'll know where you are every second
for the rest of your life.

240
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,873
Y'all got me out of my bed for this?

241
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,794
You want me to be tagged and
to risk my life to clean up your mess.

242
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,831
If sid doesn't kill me
and i don't catch him,

243
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,113
all i got to look forward to is
my 17 back in the penitentiary.

244
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,032
That's the deal... for your freedom.

245
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,232
Ready to begin?

246
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,430
I already have 80 officers
out on the street looking for sid.

247
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,677
Meanwhile, mr daryl lindenmeyer
has made himself very scarce.

248
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,438
Implant is ready.

249
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,550
Ready for incision.

250
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,074
Establishing entry point.

251
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,311
- Synchronise it.
- Hold it right there.

252
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
Secure it.

253
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,559
Ready for verification.

254
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,752
- Initiate signal code.
- Received and locked.

255
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,308
Increase resolution to magnitude
500... 1,000... 5,000... 10,000.

256
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,398
Host's location confirmed to
within 0.25 metres of actual.

257
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,398
- I'd like to go with him.
- What?

258
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,355
- No way.
- Why?

259
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,559
I can help you find sid 6.7
and i can monitor barnes.

260
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,639
Too dangerous. This isn't
a scientific study, it's a field run.

261
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,278
And maybe put a positive spin on
what is decidedly a pr nightmare.

262
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,078
Or maybe i should just go public now?

263
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:30,917
If she gets run over, hit by a car,
get shot, whatever, it ain't my problem.

264
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,510
- I told them.
- It's not my problem.

265
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,356
Here, i pulled this out of mothballs.
Figured it might come in handy.

266
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,432
I pulled out the personnel files
on daryl lindenmeyer.

267
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,756
There may be something here
we can use.

268
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,953
We should start at his apartment and
try to find erasures of the sid program.

269
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,913
They may give us an insight
into his behaviour model.

270
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,673
What?

271
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,754
Where's my gun?

272
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,117
They won't let us bring
our cameras any closer...

273
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,269
our understanding is that mr and
mrs edwards have been murdered.

274
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,033
It's sid.

275
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,078
Oh, god.

276
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,475
He's armed himself.

277
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,029
Charles manson.
It's the labianca murders.

278
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,028
"Death to the pigs" was scrawled
in blood across the walls of their house.

279
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,957
He's copy-catting.

280
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,635
...the unimaginable fate
of the glendale couple.

281
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,436
One police source said the heads
had been severed and a message...

282
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,156
"death to the pigs." you have no idea
what you're up against.

283
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,114
The la police still don't have
a single suspect in custody.

284
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,951
Jesus christ! What the hell was that?

285
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,793
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm very sorry.

286
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,515
- You been inside?
- We're waiting for a search warrant.

287
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,473
- You're waiting for a warrant?
- That's right.

288
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,914
Stop. Next hex.

289
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,271
- Couldn't find a keyboard?
- It's voice-actuated.

290
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,756
- It's what?
- Voice-actuated. Open files.

291
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,234
Next hex. Open sid 1.3.

292
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,199
This is using some kind of
genetic algorithms.

293
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,552
Sid's too complex to design.

294
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,231
He had to grow him up like a real
person with a personality disorder.

295
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,592
The program learns like a child
but much faster.

296
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,429
He put killers in sid's nursery and
let him watch them killing each other.

297
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,676
And only the strong one survived.

298
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,512
Open sid 6.7.

299
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,239
Combine.

300
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,755
Looks like there's almost 200
different personality structures.

301
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,952
The battle raging inside him
must be amazing.

302
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,948
Wait, wait, slow that down.
The names, slow down.

303
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,596
- You're not in here, if that's what...
- right there.

304
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,757
Matthew grimes...

305
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,754
he killed my wife and my daughter.

306
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,239
He's not necessarily dominant,
he may not even be emergent.

307
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,000
- But he's in there. He's part of sid?
- Yes.

308
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,191
I'm beautiful.

309
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,272
I'll make this quick.

310
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,591
- Hey, mum.
- Hey, sweetheart.

311
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,551
Sit with your mum.
I need a hug.

312
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,673
Grimes was a terrorist so why
did he take parker's wife and child?

313
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,519
Parker was getting too close.

314
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,030
He was cutting grimes off
from potential targets.

315
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,834
Grimes figured if he murdered
the man's wife and child,

316
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,315
it might distract parker
from the manhunt.

317
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,591
Grimes was wrong.

318
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,237
- How are you doing?
- Why don't you come inside?

319
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,150
I just... need to listen to the radio.

320
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,670
Do you think it's important
for a first baseman to be left-handed?

321
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,759
You look mighty parched, partner.

322
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,634
To think you constitute
one of my ancestors.

323
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,035
Rum and coke.

324
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,229
- How about a lime in that?
- I'm vaguely offended by that.

325
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,197
On your fucking knees!

326
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,599
Now!

327
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,472
Don't.

328
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,833
Don't.

329
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,592
Stand up!

330
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,758
Aim and shoot.

331
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,473
Good girl.

332
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,514
Okay, people.
We got a lot of work to do.

333
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,188
We have a symphony to compose.

334
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,749
- Do you think my mum is pretty?
- Yes, she's very pretty.

335
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,952
So do i.

336
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,076
- Is that a real gun?
- Yes, it is.

337
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,394
Did you ever have to shoot anybody?

338
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,315
78.56, we have a hostage situation
at sixth and figueroa.

339
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,149
Description of the perp matches
the photo from letac.

340
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,999
Could you go and get
your mother for me?

341
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,750
- There she is. Keep an eye on her.
- He's got a gun!

342
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,269
- What were you doing?
- Talking baseball.

343
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,835
- Gotta go, gotta go!
- Bye, mum.

344
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,431
- What did i miss?
- Sid's got hostages.

345
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,390
And... scream.

346
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,549
What have you got for me?

347
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,753
Diaphragm! More! Stop.

348
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,076
Well done.

349
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,270
Every orchestra is divided into sections.

350
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,277
Like instruments
sit with like instruments.

351
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,436
What kind of instrument are you?

352
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,029
- We have to find a way around.
- No time.

353
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,711
On four. Two, three, four.

354
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,670
Shut up!

355
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,518
Parker, what?

356
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,312
Shit.

357
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,431
Love the suit.

358
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,397
- Police!
- Freeze!

359
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,799
One, two, three and...

360
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,833
shut up!

361
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,549
One can sense a... final movement.

362
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,871
Let's begin.

363
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,750
Scream. Come on, scream!

364
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,113
Scream louder!

365
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,672
Louder!

366
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,710
I'm losing too much of myself!

367
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,480
I know you.

368
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,197
Parker barnes!

369
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,228
Inmate barnes
interrupting my conversation.

370
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,359
It's him!

371
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,519
That's okay. I've got another little tune
for my friends in crime-buster land.

372
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,075
The symphony of collision!

373
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,473
So, who's that with you, parker?
Dr madison carter, i presume?

374
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,433
A letac consultant
on aberrant psychology?

375
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,079
Fuck you!

376
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,992
I love this game!

377
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,271
I've been thinking, parker. We have
so much in common psychologically.

378
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,516
Wouldn't you agree, dr carter?

379
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,231
We have such a history together.
We'd make a great team.

380
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,798
A dynamic duo.

381
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,196
Who else touched the world
with synthetic hands?

382
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,393
Who else has been locked
out of the real world and is now free?

383
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,913
Who else do you know
that's a multiple murderer...

384
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,270
...just like you?

385
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,676
Here we go!

386
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,313
Reach and hand me that crowd pleaser.

387
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,591
Jesus.

388
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,759
The only way to stop him
is to bust up his software module.

389
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,473
Hey, parker!

390
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,553
- Ready?
- Yeah.

391
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,239
Come on down!

392
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,518
Now!

393
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,311
Out of here!

394
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,191
God, this guy is fun!

395
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,672
Could we at least advise mr barnes?

396
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,759
We'd prefer to have sid 6.7 subdued
as opposed to terminated.

397
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,953
We'll destroy the prototype of
future humanoid nano-technology.

398
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,391
- Have they found the programmer yet?
- Lindenmeyer? Not yet.

399
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,194
You'd think the cops
could at least find him.

400
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,312
Lindenmeyer was your programmer,
mr wallace.

401
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,712
- I shot the guy 30-40 times.
- I don't care. Those are real people!

402
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,550
Control yourself
or you're back in the box.

403
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,035
I'm sorry. Shoot me.
I mean, granted...

404
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,231
this is not a game,
but sid is still from the game.

405
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,591
I can't catch him
if i'm in the penitentiary.

406
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,594
Grimes is a part of sid 6.7.
There's no doubt in my mind about that.

407
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,559
Last night sid tried taunting me,
just like grimes used to do. Look.

408
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,759
- We don't know if he's the dominant.
- I know.

409
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,837
That's how i know, because i know.

410
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,954
Maybe that's what
sid wants you to think.

411
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,879
Push you over the edge,
make you slip up.

412
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,038
Sid didn't push me over the edge,
and i didn't slip up.

413
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,833
Take a look at this.

414
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,316
Sid from the media zone,
taken from their own recording.

415
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,080
He can't get enough of himself.
He's gonna want more of this.

416
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,070
More victims, bigger events,
more coverage. Just like grimes.

417
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,635
Matthew grimes was
a political terrorist.

418
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,116
His specialty was bombing
populated targets.

419
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,833
Any mass expression of democracy,

420
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,319
anywhere where a lot of people can die
and it can be recorded live!

421
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,671
This behaviour was never
part of his original programming.

422
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,512
Sid 6.7 isn't bound
by programming any more.

423
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,598
- What does that mean?
- In the real world...

424
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,236
he's free of any behavioural limits
he might've had in vr.

425
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,638
He's evolving...
my god, he's evolving!

426
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,398
Into what?

427
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,516
I'm outside the hottest night club
in la, the media zone.

428
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,871
Last night it was turned
into a living hell.

429
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:54,518
I want you to describe for me
as best as you can what happened.

430
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,154
Fourteen people have died
in the flooding which...

431
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,193
very typical, right?
A punk comes in with a gun.

432
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,233
We're all intimidated, he starts
shooting, bodies and blood...

433
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,470
another typical day, right?
Mayhem, murder and intimidation.

434
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,509
This guy comes into the club
and he takes my purple suit.

435
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,999
That suit cost me 150 dollars, man!
An original, right.

436
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,273
Takes my suit, kills everybody.
Strips me down to my underwear.

437
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,390
Hejust started killing people.

438
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,672
He put us in a formation
like an orchestra.

439
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,031
He made us scream
like we were instruments.

440
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,789
Hejust started holding people
and made me...

441
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,468
don't fuck with me, man.

442
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,318
...tape it!

443
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,870
Why not?

444
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,555
There's still a few seats left
here at the olympic auditorium,

445
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,355
if you want to see the
ultimate fighting championship!

446
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,272
- Play it one more time.
- Sure, ma'am.

447
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,398
Okay, freeze.

448
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,676
You like being in front of the camera,
don't you?

449
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,190
Like a child performing for a parent.

450
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,039
Whoever's operating our closed
circuit camera is in lust.

451
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:50,234
That beauty in area six has been on
the big screen for over a minute now.

452
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,671
- How far is the olympic?
- Four blocks east.

453
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,599
- What's going on?
- Live execution!

454
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,590
The bloodiest championships ever,
live at the olympic auditorium!

455
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,360
Enough with the close-up, mr de mille!

456
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,393
We wanna return to the rumble!

457
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,193
The olympic auditorium
has never seen anything like this!

458
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,911
They like you.

459
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,829
I like you, too.
I'm gonna make you famous, baby.

460
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,838
- What the fuck's your problem?
- What? Leave him alone!

461
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,993
No!

462
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,511
No!

463
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,109
Ringside, we have an accident!

464
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,798
Stop that guy!
Clear the ringside, please.

465
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,753
- Hey, parker! This one's for you!
- Freeze!

466
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,554
I nailed him! I blew his hand off.

467
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,030
Remain calm. Our security personnel
will handle this. Stay in your seats.

468
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,077
Hungrý? Hungrý? Lick.

469
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,194
All trains heading for catalina
have been indefinitely postponed.

470
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,154
This is due to earthquake damage
caused to the tunnel last month.

471
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,636
Hey, parker!

472
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,230
Deja vu! How am i doing?
This ain't vr!

473
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,750
- Get out of the way!
- Flesh and blood!

474
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,868
- Don't do it, parker!
- Help me!

475
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,112
Don't do it!

476
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,229
Don't do it, parker, don't do it!

477
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,713
- Drop it! Freeze!
- He shot that woman!

478
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,038
- He's a cop!
- He did it in cold blood!

479
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,148
You go back to prison
until this is sorted out.

480
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,955
I had a shot, i missed.
I didn't shoot that woman.

481
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,034
Hey, parker. This one's for you!

482
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,436
Grimes taunted me with that line.

483
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,598
Every time he killed, he'd say,
"this one's for you."

484
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,279
It was like he needed me.

485
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,228
- All right, move it!
- Hey, billy, listen!

486
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,238
- Billy, listen.
- What do you want from me?

487
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,954
Somebody set me up.
I didn't kill that woman.

488
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,032
Believe me! You lock me up,
you'll never get him.

489
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,549
- I'm sorry.
- Don't lock me up!

490
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,436
Cochrane, i just checked
the woman's body.

491
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,838
She was shot from the back.
Parker couldn't have killed her.

492
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,632
How do you know
she was facing him?

493
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,114
I saw it happen.

494
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,153
Fifty witnesses say
parker shot her dead!

495
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,397
- How do you explain it?
- Maybe she turned.

496
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,636
Maybe you weren't looking.
There was a lot going on.

497
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,070
Sid 6.7 is still out there.

498
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,636
You're locking up the one man
who may be able to stop him.

499
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,358
Hey, parker! This one's for you!
Hey, parker! This one's for you!

500
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:15,348
To the majority of our viewers
you are known as a mass murderer.

501
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,273
To some you're considered
a political terrorist.

502
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,950
And yet to a surprisingly
large number of your supporters,

503
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,878
you're considered a hero.

504
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,756
In our so-called democracy
a handful of people own everything.

505
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,349
A whole lot of other folks
have got nothing.

506
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,879
- Help!
- Mummy!

507
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:50,040
Why have you chosen officer barnes
as a target of your vengeance?

508
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,358
First of all, i did not choose barnes,
he chose me.

509
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,793
Parker! We're here! Hurry!

510
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,677
- Parker! Help!
- Baby...

511
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,839
time's running out!
Get us out, baby!

512
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,151
Would you mind saying
your signature phrase?

513
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,278
Parker... this one's for you.

514
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,948
- What was that?
- The sound of the end of futility.

515
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,634
Goddammit,
you're supposed to be dead!

516
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,752
Stay down!

517
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,270
Get off of me!

518
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,156
Hey, buddy. How's the wife and kid?

519
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,199
Still dead, huh?

520
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,753
That's reality for you.
No saving, no resetting.

521
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,559
You killed them, barnesy.
Just like that bitch on the train.

522
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,558
You got too greedy.
You leaped before you looked.

523
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,716
You reached your old arm
in there and...

524
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,913
boom! Boom!

525
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,553
Come on.

526
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,834
I enjoyed killing your family,
but it doesn't mean we can't be friends.

527
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,351
Seeing you just brings grimes...
oozing to the surface.

528
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,398
That's all.

529
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,878
Say thank you.

530
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,311
Oh, come on, parker.
I'm giving you your freedom.

531
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,715
Short-lived though it may be.

532
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,836
There's a little known fact about the
locator implants for released inmates.

533
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,478
They contain a pinhead capsule
of neural toxin.

534
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,036
The tracking satellites can also trigger
the release of the toxin.

535
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,711
After transmission, the implant's host
dies within 30 seconds.

536
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,073
So, let's see... you've killed two guards
while escaping.

537
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,271
How long will it take to get
the termination implemented?

538
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,870
And who should you really
be going after, killer?

539
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,672
Them or me?

540
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,957
You're the only guy
on my dance card, parker.

541
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,236
The best we can do
is try to contain him.

542
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,829
We'll double our detail
and hope that sid surfaces.

543
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,996
Parker barnes just escaped
from prisoner transport.

544
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,430
- Both the guards are dead.
- I don't believe it!

545
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,757
- The fail-safe is still on-line?
- On-line, and at your disposal.

546
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,351
...bigger than any live television
event in years. So let your voice...

547
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,079
hello? Parker?

548
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,158
- I didn't kill those transport guards.
- Where are you?

549
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,319
Sid let me go. See, he's interactive.

550
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,472
He only enjoys the game
against his favourite opponent: Me.

551
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,478
- Tell me where you are.
- Listen to me!

552
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,630
Did you know about the poison
they put in my head?

553
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,354
- Yes.
- When were you gonna tell me?

554
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,757
I never thought they'd have
a reason to use it.

555
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,079
I can't help you
unless you tell me where you are.

556
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,396
I'm with my family.

557
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,995
Parker? Parker!

558
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,390
- Madison carter, line one.
- Cochran here.

559
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,192
- Parker's out.
- No shit.

560
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,075
- He says he didn't kill the guards.
- You were right about the woman.

561
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,919
I'll have trouble convincing
the attorney general.

562
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:21,795
She's got every swat team
out for a barnes hunt.

563
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,992
You should know something
about the locator implants.

564
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,155
- Mum! Your keys!
- Thanks! I'll be back as soon as i can.

565
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,157
Suspect in hollywood.
Sunset and vine.

566
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,078
Enhancement.
South to santa monica.

567
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,596
- East on gower. Located...
- there he is.

568
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,038
Go for it.

569
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,153
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Anybody using this chair?

570
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,873
What are you doing?

571
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,712
I told cochran about the neural toxin.
He's taking care of it.

572
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:10,154
See, grimes used my linda
and christine to get to me.

573
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:18,160
And now sid, he... used my guilt
about losing them.

574
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,750
He's attacking your weakness,
just like he did in vr.

575
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,349
But he's not grimes, see.

576
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,549
His appetite... is expanding.

577
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,076
He craves feedback.
He needs a larger...

578
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,271
he needs a larger audience.
I know where he is.

579
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,193
I wanna live! I wanna live!

580
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,431
Authorities refuse to comment
on rumours

581
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,950
that a former lapd officer,
now serving time for homicide,

582
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,037
has been released from prison
to help with the manhunt.

583
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:59,437
They must be really worried.
They let out barnes.

584
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,993
He scared you, didn't he?

585
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,317
If you get scared,
you might do something foolish.

586
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,390
La county residents are flocking to
gun shops throughout the area.

587
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,474
Where would you go?

588
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,319
The immigration issue is
politically sensitive.

589
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,034
The closing of the american borders
is also a possibility.

590
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:26,392
This is certain to guarantee a tv
audience of unprecedented size.

591
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:35,874
Close our borders! Close our borders!
Close our borders!

592
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,478
...not to have their culture overrun
by refugees from the third world.

593
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:51,438
Even poverty would be preferable
to the living hell of their own worlds.

594
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,192
As you speak, i'm reminded of
another group of immigrants.

595
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,234
The puritans. Let us speak
with an open mind.

596
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:06,549
If you close off u.s. Borders,
you close off your soul to the future.

597
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,991
This country will be doomed
to cultural extinction.

598
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,070
What's going on?
Wejust lost new york!

599
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,673
You guys asleep?

600
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,869
Ladies and gentlemen,
my fellow americans! Welcome.

601
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,110
- What the hell's happening?
- No!

602
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,193
To death tv.

603
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,437
Death tv.

604
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,474
- Move back, now!
- Get back, go!

605
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,590
All you have to do,
sweet viewers, is to ask.

606
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,758
So, what do you want?
Strangulation? Mutilation?

607
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,030
Cannibalism? Gunshots? Stabbings?

608
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,438
I'll slice, dice, julienne.
What about hanging by the testicles?

609
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,837
Before we begin, a word to the
parents of our younger viewers.

610
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,634
The following programme
contains scenes of violence.

611
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,478
It will not be suitable
for small children.

612
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,189
The rest of you won't be able
to take your eyes off the screen.

613
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,199
Don't fucking move.

614
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:50,476
And now... on with the show.
A death tvspecial segment.

615
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,795
- On what floor is the studio on?
- The 38th.

616
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,595
Our first little contestant comes
from our own city of angels.

617
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,749
- At only nine years old...
- no! No, no, no!

618
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,996
...a lover of macaroni and cheese.

619
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,475
Daughter of criminal psychologist,
madison carter.

620
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,148
You sadistic son of a bitch!

621
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,792
It's my fault! That's my little girl!

622
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,273
Listen! As god is my witness,
i'm gonna find your daughter.

623
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,598
I need your help. You gotta find out
who's in charge of the building.

624
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,554
Get them to cut off all the phone lines.
Can you do that?

625
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,351
Go, go! Move it! Move it inside!

626
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,997
This little beauty's got two hours
until she's blown into little bits.

627
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,397
Madison! I'll find your daughter for you.

628
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,477
Help me.

629
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,074
There's barnes.

630
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,712
Barnes!

631
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,798
Parker!

632
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,193
Go, go, go!

633
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,717
Shit!

634
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,196
While we wait and watch
the demise of karin carter,

635
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,472
let's have a talk
with our studio audience.

636
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,350
You're the supervisor?
You can do it.

637
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,358
I need you to cut every phone line
that leads into this building.

638
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:02,876
Imagine, if you can,
just for a moment...

639
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,995
that she is your daughter.

640
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,509
The child you have given birth to.

641
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,718
- Oh, my...
- where's my daughter?

642
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,551
I don't know.

643
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,160
And what will you do now? Shoot me?

644
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,072
Folks at home, ed.
Ed, folks at home.

645
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,671
Enjoying the show, ed?

646
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,914
At moments like this,
i bet you're thinking, "where's god?"

647
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,674
I have the same dilemma.
Look at the response. They love you.

648
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,552
What i am is not my fault.

649
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,314
It's not even my choice.

650
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,149
I came to be,
because of what you are.

651
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,110
They love you so much,
they want you dead, ed.

652
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:28,757
Face it, folks, to kill...
is in your nature.

653
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,631
The phone lines?
Where's my audience?!

654
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,998
Parker!

655
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,839
Put down the weapon,
or we will open fire!

656
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,833
Call them off! I want that goddamn
helicopter down here right now!

657
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,155
Yes, sir!

658
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,279
Fuck you, parker.

659
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:36,638
I am made of everything!
I am the future! And you...

660
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,156
you're losing your sense of humour.

661
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,673
Come on!

662
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,957
Come on, parker!

663
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,672
- Where's the girl?
- It's not the same this time.

664
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,677
She's not your daughter!

665
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,994
Come on, parker!

666
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,234
Come on!

667
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,317
Where's the girl? Where's the girl?!

668
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,916
Banzai!

669
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,799
Jump, parker!

670
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,837
Come and get the little girl, parker!

671
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,839
Come on, you can make it!
Come on. Yeah, attaboy!

672
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,951
You can do it. Come on.

673
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,555
Okay, parker! This one's for me.

674
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,555
Now... where is the girl?

675
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,592
Where's the girl?

676
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,798
Blow me, parker!

677
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,515
Parker, parker, parker, parker...

678
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,677
parker!

679
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:48,998
So, mr barnes,
you've destroyed sid.

680
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,476
You've effectively lost any chance
of finding the little girl.

681
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:56,592
No...

682
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:12,351
yeah! You made it.
Come on, parker, come on.

683
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,518
Come on, you can make it.
Oh, goody.

684
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,234
Hey, parker, this one's for me.

685
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,594
Parker!

686
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:55,112
Hey, maddy. You just missed parker.

687
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,110
Where is she?

688
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,397
- You can't kill me, maddy.
- Where is she?

689
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,075
She's waiting, mommy.

690
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,276
Show me madison.

691
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,589
- Tell me where my daughter is!
- You see.

692
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,268
Sid assumes he's still
in the real world.

693
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,871
- Come on, maddy, forget the kid.
- Where is she?

694
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:44,957
- You really wanna know?
- Yes.

695
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,596
- You really, really wanna know?
- Yeah.

696
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,155
Just click your heels three times.

697
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:58,074
Oh, karin! Mommy's here.

698
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,597
- She's here?
- Yeah, she is.

699
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,950
She's been right here all along?

700
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:12,998
- You're dead.
- And you're back in the box.

701
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,519
- This is vr?
- That's right.

702
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,269
- Get us out of here, billy.
- Get them out now.

703
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,040
Madison first.
You have to help me lift her out.

704
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,391
Daryl? They couldn't have done
this without you!

705
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,512
- Lower it.
- I'll go lower barnes.

706
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,429
Daryl? I'm back in the fucking box?!

707
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,200
Smart. That's my boy.

708
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,439
Any time now, billy.

709
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:47,670
Daryl! Daryl! Help me, daryl!

710
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,996
I'm back in the box. Help me, daryl.

711
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,070
Why did you betray me, daryl?

712
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,069
Judas! Judas, daryl!

713
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,518
- Billy?
- No!

714
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,472
You're in my world now!

715
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:03,510
Get away from there!
I'll kill you, too!

716
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,393
Parker!

717
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,558
Get in here! Come on!

718
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,029
What's going on here? I don't know
what you think you're doing...

719
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,956
coward! Parker, i wanna play!

720
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,429
I wanna play!

721
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,798
Let's get your little girl.

722
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,353
Watch your step!

723
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,113
- Karin!
- Don't!

724
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:32,791
- It's booby-trapped.
- The bomb squad's five minutes away.

725
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,638
We don't have five minutes.

726
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,353
Karin!

727
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,954
Listen, i'm gonna get you
out of there, okay?

728
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,388
Hang on, sweetheart, i'm coming.

729
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,909
Just stay right where you are.

730
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,439
It's all right.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

731
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,148
- Are you gonna get me out?
- Yes!

732
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,912
Be careful, parker!

733
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,795
- Hi, mom... hurry!
- Okay. Wait, don't move!

734
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,038
Hello, parker. That can only be you.

735
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,994
What should be completely clear
is that i've thought of everything.

736
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,474
And i thought of it first.

737
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:12,309
So i made this recordingjust for you,
in case you got clever.

738
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,559
Let me move your hands back.
Stay where you are. Don't move.

739
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,629
He's got you sitting on a pressure plate.

740
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:29,358
Now, if you stand up,
it's gonna be very bad, okay?

741
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,715
Be still, honey. Don't move.

742
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,790
It's okay, baby. Hang in there.

743
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,438
Don't move, honey.

744
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,669
- Mom, get me out of here.
- We will, baby.

745
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,758
Everything will be okay.
Just stay still.

746
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:01,837
- Mom... mommy?
- Hold on, baby.

747
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,759
- Okay, just talk to mommy.
- Mom.

748
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:09,070
I'm right here, sweetie.

749
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,519
Try to get into the main operating
system and reset the internal clock.

750
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,232
I thought of that one, too.
Better try again.

751
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,109
Oh, god!

752
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,874
Faster!

753
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:45,118
Hang on. Everything's gonna be okay.
I love you, karin.

754
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,593
Connect this side to the input...

755
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:19,072
...and this one goes to the output.
Which one's the output?

756
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,759
Let's see.

757
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,914
Eeny-meeny-miny-moe... no.

758
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,956
Now, output, output?

759
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,631
Maybe this one right here?

760
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,513
Be it, please.

761
01:33:55,480 --> 01:34:00,031
I thought of that one, too.
Better try again... faster.

762
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,431
Faster! Faster!

763
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,476
- It's not working.
- Mommy.

764
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,511
I thought of that one, too.

765
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,596
I thought of that one, too.

766
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:31,235
- It's working.
- I thought of that one, too.

767
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:36,914
- It's working.
- Working? We're okay?

768
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,359
- We're okay.
- Oh, my god.

769
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:48,559
- Mommy!
- Baby! Oh, baby.

770
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,238
Thank you.

771
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,231
