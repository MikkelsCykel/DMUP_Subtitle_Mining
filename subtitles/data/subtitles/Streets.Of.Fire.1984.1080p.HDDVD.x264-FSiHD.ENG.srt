1
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:17,117
It looks like she drug
in a real crowd, don't it?

2
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,683
Sure does.

3
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,019
Looks like it's gonna be
a full house tonight.

4
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:24,091
Hey, what do you say we run in
and check out the show?

5
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,166
How we doing here? We all
set? Hey, big crowd, huh?

6
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:36,034
Yeah, and not one of them's
got a pot to piss in.

7
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,236
I never should have let myself
get talked into this dumb benefit.

8
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:42,014
I could be making some real money tonight.
All right, let's get this thing started.

9
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:51,751
And now back home again

10
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:54,220
the one, the only

11
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,823
Ellen Aim!

12
00:02:17,877 --> 00:02:20,413
Lying in your bed
and on a Saturday night

13
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,949
You're sweatin' buckets
and it's not even hot

14
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,851
But your brain
has got the message

15
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,251
And it's sending it out

16
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:29,189
To every nerve
and every muscle you've got

17
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,555
You've got so many dreams

18
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,792
That you don't know
where to put 'em

19
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:34,959
So you'd better turn
a few of 'em loose

20
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:37,831
Your body's got a feeling
that it's starting to rust

21
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,709
You'd better rev it up
and put it to use

22
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:47,251
And I don't know how I ever thought
that I could make it all alone

23
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:50,677
When you only make it better

24
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,445
And it better be tonight

25
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
I'll be there for you tonight

26
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:58,416
Even if you don't have
anywhere to go

27
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,020
You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

28
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,153
And your speed

29
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:03,254
Is all you'll ever need

30
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,758
All you'll ever need to know

31
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:07,492
Darlin', Darlin'

32
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:10,313
You and me
we're goin' nowhere slowly

33
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:13,064
And we've gotta get away
from the past

34
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,969
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

35
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,843
But we should
be goin' nowhere fast

36
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,682
It's so much better
goin' nowhere fast

37
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:35,121
Stalkin' in the shadows
by the light of the moon

38
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:37,891
It's like a prison
and the night is a cell

39
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,627
Goin' anywhere
has gotta be heaven tonight

40
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:43,539
'Cause stayin' here
has gotta be hell

41
00:03:44,164 --> 00:03:46,933
Dyin' in the city
like a fire on the water

42
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,667
Let's go runnin'
on the back of the wind

43
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:52,238
There's gotta be some action
on the face of the earth

44
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,412
And I've gotta
see your face once again

45
00:03:55,842 --> 00:04:01,849
And I don't know where I ever got
the bright idea that I was cool

46
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:05,287
So alone and independent

47
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:08,127
But I'm depending on you now

48
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:13,465
And you'll always be the only
thing that I just can't be without

49
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:16,473
And I'm out for you tonight

50
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,997
I'm comin' out
for you tonight

51
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,833
Even if you don't
have anywhere to go

52
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,304
You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

53
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:25,436
And your speed

54
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,638
Is all you'll ever need

55
00:04:26,673 --> 00:04:29,209
All you'll ever need to know

56
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:30,742
Darlin', Darlin'

57
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:33,484
You and me
we're goin' nowhere slowly

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,481
And we've gotta get away
from the past

59
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:39,352
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

60
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:42,272
But we should be
goin' nowhere fast

61
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:45,123
Everybody's goin'
nowhere slowly

62
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:48,027
They're only fighting
for the chance to be last

63
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:50,897
There's nothin' wrong
with goin' nowhere, baby

64
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:53,400
But we should be
goin' nowhere fast

65
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:09,681
Godspeed

66
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:13,026
Speed us away

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:21,292
Godspeed

68
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:23,761
Speed us away

69
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,665
We're goin' nowhere fast

70
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,065
Godspeed

71
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,568
We're goin' nowhere fast

72
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:29,801
Godspeed

73
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,437
We're goin' nowhere fast

74
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:32,870
Godspeed

75
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:35,340
Speed us away

76
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,210
We're goin' nowhere fast

77
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,243
Godspeed

78
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:40,079
We're goin' nowhere fast

79
00:05:40,114 --> 00:05:41,179
Godspeed

80
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,915
We're goin' nowhere fast

81
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,515
Godspeed

82
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,189
Speed us away

83
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,922
Now!

84
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:32,266
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? Get off the stage!

85
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,880
Hey, you guys
shouldn't be doing this!

86
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:49,916
Hey, we don't want
no trouble!

87
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:57,256
Let me go!

88
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,157
No!

89
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,796
Let me go!

90
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:03,701
Put me down now!

91
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:08,276
Let me go! Let me go!

92
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:15,776
Help me!

93
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,944
Get them!

94
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,557
Them Goddamn son-of-a-bitches!
Hang a one-eight.

95
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:03,961
What's with that guy?

96
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:10,094
Watch out!

97
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:12,165
These guys are gonna pay!

98
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:21,078
Someone help me!

99
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:28,789
Stop it!

100
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:51,600
Can I help you?
Coffee.

101
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:54,265
Cream and sugar?
Just black.

102
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,335
Oh, you guys really know
how to come through a door.

103
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,902
What are you trying to prove?

104
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:40,877
We just came down from Kings
Park looking for a good time.

105
00:11:40,912 --> 00:11:43,818
You guys already missed all the
excitement. The party's over.

106
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:49,990
The Roadmasters are hungry. And
when they're hungry, they eat.

107
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:52,952
The Bombers have brought this
act through The Richmond already.

108
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,121
All you're doing in here
is looking like punks.

109
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,656
Is that right?

110
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,893
We're just gonna
have to mess the place up.

111
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:09,343
And after we mess your place
up maybe we'll mess you up.

112
00:12:13,072 --> 00:12:15,609
Oh, you got a problem
with this, pretty boy?

113
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:35,034
Try it again, punk.

114
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,403
Go on, go home!

115
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,851
What do you think
of my new car?

116
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:26,588
It looks great. Why don't you
sell it and buy me a new window?

117
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,836
Tom, come on, slow down.

118
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:55,875
Reva, there's no point in stealing a
car, if you're not gonna ring it out.

119
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,004
When are you
ever gonna grow up?

120
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,882
Why should I?
This is more fun.

121
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,690
Let me give you
some news, Tom.

122
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:16,228
The Bombers and this guy Raven
Shaddock, they stole Ellen Aim.

123
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:18,139
How the hell did that happen?

124
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:20,272
Oh, shit!

125
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,045
Goddamn cops!

126
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,708
Okay, buddy, what the
hell do you think this is?

127
00:14:45,743 --> 00:14:47,593
We don't go for that kind
of speeding around here.

128
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:48,793
Now let's see your license.

129
00:14:48,828 --> 00:14:51,365
Sorry, Officer,
I must have left it at home.

130
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:55,968
Tom Cody. It's been a couple of years
since I've had any trouble out of you.

131
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:58,035
Hey, Ed, I just came home
to visit my big sister.

132
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,337
You're not gonna have any
trouble with me. Glad to hear it.

133
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:03,342
We don't need somebody coming back
here trying to give us a hard time.

134
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:06,429
Come on, Ed, he just got back.
Give him a break.

135
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:09,482
Yeah, I'll give him a break.
Get out of here, Cody.

136
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,686
Yeah, and anymore driving like
that and I'll give you a ticket.

137
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:14,960
Asshole!

138
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:31,235
Who the hell
does that guy think he is?

139
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,208
Well, he's always been a real bad ass.
I busted him a couple of years ago.

140
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:39,378
He had a pistol in the
glove compartment of his car.

141
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:40,678
A real punk, huh?

142
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:44,285
Yeah, he belongs in jail with all
the other juvenile delinquents.

143
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:08,574
You sure I'm not gonna be cramping
your style with any guy tonight, huh?

144
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,007
No, not tonight.

145
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,311
I bring one in now and then
but there's nothing steady.

146
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,811
I never seem to find
the right one.

147
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,548
Yeah, I ain't having much luck
in that department myself.

148
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,883
Look, Tom, you were always
real close with Ellen.

149
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,287
She wasn't like all those tramps
you used to run around with.

150
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,120
Reva,
it didn't work out, okay?

151
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:25,490
Well, somebody figured out
how to make it work with her.

152
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,791
She's been living with a guy
named Billy Fish. Who's that?

153
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:31,563
He's done some rock joints in The
Battery. He started managing her act.

154
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:34,433
Yeah, she was always
interested in going somewhere.

155
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:35,604
Tom.

156
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:39,136
She's not just your old girl.

157
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,639
Reva, what do you want from
me, huh? You know what I want.

158
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:44,710
You want me to go rescue an old girlfriend
who's shacked up with another guy?

159
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,245
Thanks a lot.

160
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:14,505
Tequila.

161
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,974
Hey, Tom! Tom Cody.

162
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:19,845
It's been a long time, pal.
How's your hammer hanging?

163
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,245
How's it going, Clyde?

164
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,581
Well, not so hot. I got beat
up trying to save your old girl.

165
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:28,585
I could use a little help with those
guys. You should have been there, Tom.

166
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,791
It would have been like the old days when
we were in school. We'd have kicked ass.

167
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:35,227
Hey, bartender, you gonna
shoot the shit all night,

168
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,194
or do you wanna
get me another drink?

169
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:38,897
Hey, Tom, would you get a
load of this little heinie?

170
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,364
She thinks she owns the place.

171
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:42,902
I'm just trying to
get myself a drink, pal.

172
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,772
Well, maybe you've already
had enough, babe.

173
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:48,707
You gotta be kidding me!
Do I look like I'm kidding?

174
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,874
You know, maybe you
ought to pay up as well.

175
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:54,378
You've been driving up a tab here all
night and we're not real big on credit.

176
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:57,826
Are you trying to say that I can't pay?
Yeah, let's see the color of your money.

177
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:03,189
There. Happy? Yeah. But
now I don't like your face.

178
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:08,336
You know, everywhere I go
there's always an asshole.

179
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,910
Hey, you got any preferences?

180
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,114
I've always been
a tequila man.

181
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:28,383
Let's get out of here.

182
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:32,082
The name's McCoy.
I'm a soldier.

183
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:35,087
At least I was up until about
a year ago, ran out of wars.

184
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,639
Yeah, what's your spec?

185
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:38,122
Motor pool. Nothing fancy.

186
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,692
But if it's got wheels I can
drive it and I can fix it.

187
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:43,228
That's funny, I just got
out a couple of months ago.

188
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:44,661
Been R and R ever since.

189
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:46,641
Yeah?
How'd you like the army?

190
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:50,411
I liked shooting the guns,
but I didn't win no medal.

191
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:53,511
Hey!

192
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,782
Is that your car?
Yeah.

193
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:01,448
Nice. Yeah, I know. I just picked it up.

194
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:06,885
Hey, Cody? That's your
name, right, Cody? Yeah.

195
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,728
You got a spare bed?

196
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:12,363
You want a quick tumble, huh?

197
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,283
Hey, you may have a rough time
with this one,

198
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:18,707
and I don't wanna hurt
your feelings, but...

199
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,038
You're not my type.

200
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,837
Yeah, I guess it kind of figures. I
ain't had much luck with women lately.

201
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,903
Yeah, well, you'll live.

202
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:29,007
Something tells me that getting girls
isn't exactly your problem in life.

203
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,911
Maybe some other time, huh? I
doubt it, but anything's possible.

204
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:34,390
Hey, look...

205
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,014
About the spare bed.

206
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm just passing through this
district. I don't know anybody.

207
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:43,431
I'm between jobs and last
time I heard hotels cost money.

208
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:47,567
Get in.

209
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,544
My sister's got the bedroom, I got
the spare, that puts you on the couch.

210
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,786
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
Yeah, no sweat.

211
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:22,233
There you go, McCoy.
I'll see you in the morning.

212
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,450
Hey, you always walk around packed,
huh? I told you, I'm a soldier.

213
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:32,271
Yeah, well, don't go pointing that
thing at me, I wouldn't like it.

214
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,907
I don't go pointing it,
unless I'm gonna use it.

215
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,408
Yeah, right.

216
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:17,583
No, you don't get by on pride

217
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:21,462
It'll run over you

218
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,856
But since you let me down

219
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,924
I'm hard to be around

220
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,561
I don't know
what I'm gonna do

221
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:36,677
He could never be you

222
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:44,319
Okay, you got it.
I'm gonna go and get her.

223
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,277
But I ain't doing it
for nothing.

224
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:51,049
You tell this Mr. Billy Fish to meet
me at the diner tomorrow at 12:00.

225
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:53,461
Me and him are gonna talk
some business.

226
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:56,955
Oh, there's a girl I picked up in
the Black-hawk sleeping on the couch.

227
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,108
Give her some coffee
in the morning, okay?

228
00:21:59,143 --> 00:22:01,226
How come she's sleeping
in the front room?

229
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:03,296
Why don't you go ask her?

230
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:26,461
Hey, Pete!

231
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:32,090
Hey, look, I really needed a place to
stay, so thanks for the use of the sofa.

232
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,657
Oh, that's okay.

233
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:36,660
You're the first girl Tom
ever brought home that used it.

234
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:39,496
Yeah, well, sometimes it helps a
guy out if you don't make it so easy.

235
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:43,911
He could use a little help in that direction.
Maybe he ought to meet a few more like you.

236
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:49,608
A fellow came through here a
couple of months ago. Tapped out.

237
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:52,409
Had to part with this outfit
after a card game.

238
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:55,720
Real unhappy about it, too,
'cause it's all custom stuff.

239
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:59,651
I tell you, if Tom wasn't going
for being number two to her music,

240
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:02,119
so he just took off.
He was crazy about Ellen.

241
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:04,222
He was just the kind of guy
who doesn't like to admit it.

242
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,666
Yeah, sure, I know the type.

243
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,092
I'll tell you something.

244
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:12,898
Some people never talk about their
feelings, they got them deeper than anybody.

245
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,674
Other people never talk about their
feelings 'cause they ain't got any.

246
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:23,511
What's your story?
Me? Just looking for work.

247
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:52,135
You must be Billy Fish?

248
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:55,507
Yeah. So what gives, and make
it fast my time is valuable.

249
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,010
You want Ellen Aim back,
I'm gonna get her.

250
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,810
You and what army?

251
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:02,587
I can see you two are gonna
get along just fine.

252
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:07,619
I want 10 grand. Easy. All
you gotta do is earn it.

253
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,287
I'll earn it
and you're gonna help.

254
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:13,225
Reva told me you used to
live in The Battery.

255
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,759
I started out there.
It's the shits.

256
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:17,828
I wouldn't go back
to that dump if you paid me.

257
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:21,199
You're going! I need somebody
who knows their way around.

258
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,100
I don't think so.
It's not my scene.

259
00:24:23,135 --> 00:24:25,270
If you want your meal ticket
back, get in the car

260
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:27,337
or otherwise the deal is off.

261
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:30,208
Look, Cody, you sound pretty
dumb, but nobody's that dumb.

262
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,341
I'm the one paying you.

263
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:34,880
That means you go get her, I wait
here and you bring her back to me.

264
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:36,680
You smart guys.

265
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:40,218
You always figure you can hire a
bum like me to do your dirty work.

266
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:42,061
Well, not this time!

267
00:24:42,687 --> 00:24:46,327
Can you really get her back?
You got a better volunteer?

268
00:24:56,735 --> 00:25:00,080
All right, I'll go.
She's real important to me.

269
00:25:13,084 --> 00:25:16,054
You know The Battery's
gonna be nothing but trouble.

270
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:18,774
Yeah? Well, I'm getting
paid for it, right, Fish?

271
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,460
That's right, Cody. You
cut me in, I'll back you up.

272
00:25:21,495 --> 00:25:22,526
I don't think so.

273
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:24,996
Hey, what's your problem?
We're not taking no skirt along.

274
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:27,365
Look, I don't think
you can handle it, okay?

275
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,598
What do I gotta do?

276
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:31,536
You know, people don't exactly have
written references for this kind of work.

277
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,447
You should know that, Cody.

278
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:37,776
I need the job. I'm plenty good
enough and I ain't gonna let you down.

279
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:41,485
Listen, skirt, let me make it
simple for you. Take a hike.

280
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:48,218
All right. I'll cut you in for 10%,
but get this, you're working for me.

281
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:51,957
I tell you to do something, you do it.
You don't do more or you don't do less.

282
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:54,893
And if you start dragging
your ass, I'm sending you home.

283
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,926
Got it.

284
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:57,227
Hey, what is this?
Get serious.

285
00:25:57,262 --> 00:26:00,565
I'm not paying you any extra to take
some sweetie pie along for company.

286
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,975
You drive.

287
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:07,806
Don't worry about it. They always
hire bums like me for jobs like this.

288
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,698
Look, I'll take you through The
Battery where the Bombers hang out,

289
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,065
but I'm not taking any risks.

290
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,933
I'm not paying you to add
any thrills to my life.

291
00:26:36,968 --> 00:26:39,736
That's not how it works. You
got a real big mouth, Fish.

292
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:43,108
Look, butch, I buy and sell more
people more valuable than you every day.

293
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,876
You know, it's hard to figure
out what's more pathetic,

294
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:47,279
the way you talk
or the way you dress.

295
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,378
Let me tell you something.

296
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:51,370
These clothes are worth more
than you make in a year.

297
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:54,328
I can see working with you two
is gonna be a real dream.

298
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:15,105
If they got her anywhere,
they got her at Torchies.

299
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,144
It's a real knockdown joint, no
class. I used to book bands in there.

300
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,778
It's right in the middle of
a big factory. It's the shits.

301
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:25,817
You'll love it, McCoy. It's just your
style. Okay, Cody, what's the plan?

302
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,118
How do you figure on handling all
these guys and their motorcycles?

303
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:31,489
You start killing Bombers, we're gonna
be in worse shape than we're already in.

304
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,056
I don't have to kill anybody.

305
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:36,367
The motorcycles don't run so hot
when I'm shooting holes in them.

306
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:07,324
Some neighborhood. Everything's
dead. What a place to come to.

307
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,261
Just keep going straight ahead and
then make a left under the bridge.

308
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:11,930
What are you?
Giving me orders now?

309
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,029
Look, I know my way around.

310
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:15,100
That's why you brought me
along, remember?

311
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:16,600
I'll take care
of giving the orders.

312
00:28:16,635 --> 00:28:19,547
Get under the bridge,
pull over and kill the lights.

313
00:28:54,272 --> 00:29:01,684
Well one bad stud
moved in my neighborhood

314
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:06,021
He's big and man
I know he ain't no good

315
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:14,460
He don't wear no hat, and
Lord he don't wear no shoes

316
00:29:15,727 --> 00:29:18,833
He just hangs on the corner
singing old country blues

317
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:21,934
Oh, well, one bad stud

318
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,443
One bad stud

319
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,142
I said, one, one, one, one,

320
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:32,518
One bad stud

321
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:40,828
If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

322
00:29:41,753 --> 00:29:45,632
'Cause the girls all love him
like a schoolboy loves his pie

323
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:49,916
He loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock 'n' rye

324
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:53,675
Yes, he loves his whiskey
he loves his rock 'n' rye

325
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:58,875
You know it takes ten bottles
to make that fool get high

326
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,439
Oh, well, one bad stud

327
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:07,780
One bad stud

328
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:28,198
You know, you're making
things real hard on yourself.

329
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:33,071
You act nice, you and me fall in love
for a week or two and then I let you go.

330
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,811
Nobody gets hurt.

331
00:30:35,807 --> 00:30:39,413
You see,
I ain't such a bad guy.

332
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:44,424
I just get excited
around pretty girls.

333
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,795
Oh, well, one bad stud

334
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:02,878
One bad stud

335
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:05,676
I said, one, one, one, one

336
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:32,630
From now on either of you make any
mistakes, I'm making you walk home.

337
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:34,666
Walk? I'm not gonna walk
around here, I'd get killed.

338
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:37,271
You got it.
What about you, McCoy?

339
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,573
Are we gonna do it or are
we gonna talk about it?

340
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,143
You're right.

341
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:03,067
The main drag
is around here somewhere.

342
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:09,809
What the hell's that? Guess
you don't know who I am, do you?

343
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:14,370
Things have gotten kind of
funny around here.

344
00:32:14,405 --> 00:32:17,593
All kinds of strangers coming
around, sneaking through the alleys.

345
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:20,782
What the hell we talking to this
creep for? Let's get out of here.

346
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,533
My gosh, you're scared. What's
even funnier, you're afraid of me.

347
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,887
I'm just trying to get away from
you. We got some business here.

348
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:33,130
Oh, you're dumb,
and you're short. Real short.

349
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:39,529
You're after that girl, aren't
you? What makes you say that?

350
00:32:39,564 --> 00:32:42,066
Come down a back alley, 10:00 at
night carrying a bunch of guns,

351
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:44,569
I don't figure you're here to give
The Battery a new coat of paint.

352
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:47,523
Where they keeping her?
Torchies, second floor.

353
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:50,442
Don't tell them I told
you, though. Pay him.

354
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:54,143
Yeah, pay me.
I'm not gonna pay this jerk!

355
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:56,915
Listen, shithead, you give
him some of your money,

356
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,583
or I'll give him
some of your money.

357
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:00,323
Don't call me "shithead. "

358
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:02,352
Hey, you gotta
keep moving forward.

359
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:05,256
That's the whole point of things,
and I thank you now, I appreciate it.

360
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,395
Why don't you buy some soap?

361
00:33:08,593 --> 00:33:11,512
I don't need this guy
to tell me she's in Torchies.

362
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:14,432
I said they had her
at Torchies. I am a shithead.

363
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,721
Okay, Fish,
you get back to the car.

364
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:42,627
I want you in that doorway over there
in 15 minutes and I mean 15 minutes.

365
00:33:42,662 --> 00:33:45,063
Are you crazy? They'll notice
me in a second down there.

366
00:33:45,098 --> 00:33:46,129
Don't worry about that.

367
00:33:46,164 --> 00:33:48,199
I'm gonna give them a couple
of other things to worry about.

368
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,752
What about her? I thought she's
supposed to do the driving?

369
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:53,271
Get moving! And you better
be ready when we get there.

370
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:01,396
Do you trust him
or are you just desperate?

371
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:03,413
You take the front entrance.
I'm going topside.

372
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:06,918
If you can work your way upstairs to
help me out, fine, if not I'll handle it!

373
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:10,695
Just what I always wanted to
do, Cody, take on the Bombers.

374
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:34,017
Hey, baby!

375
00:34:57,602 --> 00:34:59,940
I've been around the world

376
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:02,279
And every man bleeds the same

377
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:06,348
But when the lights are dim

378
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,788
You never know who's to blame

379
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:14,172
I don't want no scars to show

380
00:35:14,207 --> 00:35:17,130
I don't want no one to know

381
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:21,563
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

382
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:27,081
No other place for me to go

383
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:30,166
No other place for dying slow

384
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:34,877
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

385
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:40,810
I've been around the world

386
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:44,019
I take credit
for the things I've done

387
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,722
But when the lights are dim

388
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:50,028
I'm not the only guilty one

389
00:35:53,024 --> 00:35:55,943
I don't want no scars to show

390
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:58,828
I don't want no one to know

391
00:35:58,863 --> 00:36:03,004
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

392
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:06,053
Hey! How you doing, babe?
Come around here much?

393
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:08,631
Only when I wanna check out
some real action.

394
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,593
Well, you're talking to
the right guy. Says who?

395
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,520
Says me. I like a guy
that's got confidence.

396
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:16,288
All right.

397
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:46,342
No, that way's
the card game, huh?

398
00:36:46,377 --> 00:36:48,880
We're going down here.
We got a party room.

399
00:36:53,317 --> 00:36:57,321
Check it out, huh, baby? This is
the party room. How you like it, huh?

400
00:36:57,356 --> 00:37:01,257
I've had a lot of good times
here, so, let's party, huh?

401
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:07,265
Hey, killer. Can I take my jacket off first?
Yeah, you can take off whatever you want.

402
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,302
All right.
Now, listen to me, buddy.

403
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:14,505
There's just one thing I want you
to do, and that is to keep quiet.

404
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,038
Hey, come on, babe,
what is this thing loaded?

405
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,142
We're gonna play a little game.
You Bombers are gonna like it.

406
00:37:18,177 --> 00:37:19,828
It's called "lights out. "

407
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,289
No other place for me to go

408
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,680
No other place for dying slow

409
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:30,062
So I'll be killing
just killing time

410
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:35,061
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

411
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,330
I've been around the world

412
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:44,311
I take credit
for the things I've done

413
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:48,206
But when the lights are dim

414
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,410
I'm not the only guilty one

415
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:53,743
Knock, knock.

416
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:56,681
I don't want no scars to show

417
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:59,549
I don't want no one to know

418
00:37:59,584 --> 00:38:03,793
So I'll be killing time
in the blue shadows

419
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:33,282
Go ahead and take that money,
sweetie.

420
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:35,987
You better pray you make
it out of The Battery.

421
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,558
I don't think
she's after the money.

422
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:17,326
You know poker's
a real interesting game

423
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:20,398
especially when you've got
all the best cards!

424
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:24,175
Next time it'll be right in your
nuts, pal. You know what I mean?

425
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,856
Guys, it's been a slice.

426
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,080
Who are you?
McCoy. I'm a big fan.

427
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:52,069
Yeah, great,
come on, let's go.

428
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,071
Who is that guy?

429
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:03,674
Look out, it's surrounded! Get
this guy out of The Battery.

430
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:05,483
Move it! Move it!

431
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:17,063
This way. Follow me!

432
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:32,503
Jesus, Ellen, am I glad to see you.
I thought you were gone forever.

433
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:34,605
Cody, get in! This ain't no
time for checking out the sights!

434
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,090
Take off! I'm gonna run
these guys for awhile.

435
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,817
I'm staying with you...
You're not going with him!

436
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,448
You stay in the car!
Stay with your boyfriend!

437
00:40:39,483 --> 00:40:41,010
McCoy, meet me at
the Grant Street underpass.

438
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:44,424
Right. If we don't see
you, Cody, have a nice life!

439
00:41:42,173 --> 00:41:43,908
McCoy, can't you drive
this car any faster?

440
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:45,627
I don't want any Bombers
sneaking up on us!

441
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:47,276
Let's get our asses
out of here real quick!

442
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:49,345
And where's this Grant Street
anyway? I never heard of it before!

443
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,486
You sure you know where you're going?
Turn it off, Fish! You sound pathetic!

444
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:01,261
Well.

445
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,364
Looks like I finally ran into someone
that likes to play as rough as I do.

446
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:12,643
Yeah, this must be your lucky
night. I'm lucky? I guess maybe I am.

447
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,808
And you're dumb. Real dumb, if
you think you can pull this off.

448
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:21,844
I think you're forgetting
something. I got the gun.

449
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:27,021
I can get guns, smart guy. Lots of them.
Now why don't you tell me your name.

450
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:30,391
Tom Cody. Pleased to meet you.

451
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:37,002
I'll be coming for her, and
I'll be coming for you too.

452
00:42:37,461 --> 00:42:40,032
Sure, you will,
and I'll be waiting.

453
00:43:30,548 --> 00:43:33,217
Listen, I say we give it a couple of
minutes then get out of here, okay?

454
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:34,416
What are you talking about?

455
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:37,955
I'm talking about saving our ass.
We got a lot to live for, Ellen.

456
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,155
He came and he got me! I'm
not going back without him.

457
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,227
Don't worry about him. He's getting
paid a lot of money to look after Raven.

458
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,530
What money? What do you think
he's doing this for love?

459
00:43:45,565 --> 00:43:47,798
You think he's doing this
'cause he's your biggest fan?

460
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,134
He's getting paid, dear.
He takes his chances!

461
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,614
Hey! Too bad, Billy.

462
00:43:53,137 --> 00:43:56,015
Looks like Ellen's old flame
decided to show up.

463
00:44:14,024 --> 00:44:16,003
Okay, we're on the move.

464
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:19,228
What's this old flame stuff?

465
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:21,096
Didn't you know?
Ellen used to go with Cody,

466
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:24,435
real hot and heavy from what
I hear. You know what I mean?

467
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,901
What, is she kidding?

468
00:44:25,936 --> 00:44:29,576
Let's not get into it now, okay,
Billy? Hard news, huh, shorty?

469
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,797
Look, Cody, we've had our differences,
but it looks like we got it made now, huh?

470
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:55,599
We'll just zoom along here
for a couple of hours,

471
00:44:55,634 --> 00:44:56,765
then we're home and dry.

472
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,475
I got news for you, it ain't that
simple. We gotta bury the car.

473
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:02,973
Bury the car? What are you
talking about "bury the car"?

474
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,107
He means we're gonna
get rid of it, stupid.

475
00:45:05,142 --> 00:45:07,478
He's gonna get rid of the car?
What's wrong with the car?

476
00:45:07,513 --> 00:45:08,946
This is what I'm paying you
all this money for?

477
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:10,779
To come up
with these brilliant ideas?

478
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:14,227
Why don't we just hand ourselves back
over to Raven and ask him to shoot us?

479
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:46,772
You two go ahead. I wanna talk
alone with Tom for a minute.

480
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:49,463
What are you talking about?
What are you going with him for?

481
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:52,998
Hey, I don't like
the way this looks, Ellen.

482
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:55,964
I'm paying the bills around
here. How about some respect?

483
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:03,300
So what do you wanna talk to me
about? I got a lot to say to you, Tom.

484
00:46:03,335 --> 00:46:05,334
No, you don't.
You have nothing to say to me.

485
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:07,654
You wanna talk to somebody,
go talk to your boyfriend.

486
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:09,905
Look, what was I supposed
to do? I had all that work.

487
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,443
Things were going real good. Things
were starting to happen for me.

488
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,476
Yeah, so, bye-bye,
Tom, right?

489
00:46:14,511 --> 00:46:15,879
You're the one who took off
and joined the army.

490
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:17,579
Let's forget all this.
It's history.

491
00:46:17,614 --> 00:46:21,452
From now on I'm just like you. I do
what I'm good at and I do it for money.

492
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,818
Is that why
you came and got me?

493
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:26,021
That's right. Billy Fish
is paying me 10 grand.

494
00:46:26,056 --> 00:46:30,834
I just can't believe you'd do that.
Maybe you'd better get used to the idea.

495
00:46:32,296 --> 00:46:33,797
I wonder what
they're talking about?

496
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,198
Who says they're talking?
Cute.

497
00:46:36,233 --> 00:46:39,339
It was just a joke, man,
you know what I mean?

498
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,371
How big a thing
do you think they had anyway?

499
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:46,149
From what I hear it was real major.
Yeah, well, she's with me now.

500
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:49,113
Yeah, right. Against a big
tough, good-looking guy like you,

501
00:46:49,148 --> 00:46:51,149
Cody don't stand a chance.

502
00:47:00,157 --> 00:47:02,391
I hope you two got
everything straightened out.

503
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:06,829
Yeah, we got a lot straightened
out. It was a real eye opener.

504
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:11,001
I think I hurt your girlfriend's
feelings. I'm real sorry about it.

505
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,955
What does he mean he hurt
your feelings? What'd he say?

506
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,874
Did he say anything about me?
What'd he say? Tell me!

507
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:40,467
I'm tired

508
00:47:41,698 --> 00:47:43,643
I'm thirsty

509
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:48,845
I'm wild eyed

510
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:52,382
In my misery

511
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:57,582
Timeless

512
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:01,459
In your finery

513
00:48:03,487 --> 00:48:05,523
A high price

514
00:48:07,558 --> 00:48:09,867
For your luxury

515
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:15,671
Sorcerer

516
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,270
Who is the master

517
00:48:21,572 --> 00:48:25,747
Man and woman
on a star stream

518
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:29,686
In the middle of a snow dream

519
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:32,751
Sorcerer

520
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:37,396
Show me the high life

521
00:48:39,356 --> 00:48:41,597
Come over

522
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,405
Let me put you on ice

523
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:55,041
I'm tired

524
00:48:57,207 --> 00:49:00,586
When I need you badly

525
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:04,023
Wild eyed

526
00:49:05,883 --> 00:49:09,159
In the middle of your dream

527
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:12,425
Timeless

528
00:49:15,525 --> 00:49:18,929
Hey. Hi, you guys. Hey, what's
the hurry? Where you guys going?

529
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:21,730
We're nobody, we're going
nowhere. Nobody goes nowhere.

530
00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:25,576
Look, knock it off, we're not
interested in conversation, okay, moron?

531
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:31,341
I know you. I know who you are, dig?
I love your stuff so much, I really do.

532
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:32,507
Look, if you love me so much,

533
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:34,278
why don't you just go away
and leave us alone.

534
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:36,144
No, look,
I'm your biggest fan, really.

535
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:37,946
Let me go with you, okay?
I won't be any trouble.

536
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:40,048
And I'll tell you guys something,
you gotta get off the street,

537
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:44,121
'cause the cops know the guys that hit
The Battery will be coming through here.

538
00:49:44,156 --> 00:49:45,420
Shit!

539
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:47,256
We gotta get
a new set of wheels.

540
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:51,068
Great, we just got rid of the old
wheels. Wonderful leadership, Cody.

541
00:50:01,872 --> 00:50:05,042
Hey, what's the matter with you? Are
you looking to get yourself run over?

542
00:50:05,077 --> 00:50:08,612
Me and my friends need a lift.
So what? This ain't no muni bus!

543
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:10,279
Need a lift real bad.

544
00:50:10,314 --> 00:50:16,520
Now look, let me make it real clear.
Nobody tells me where to take my bus.

545
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,964
You dig?

546
00:50:19,389 --> 00:50:20,956
Well, we're very flexible.

547
00:50:20,991 --> 00:50:23,060
We'll take you where you wanna
go. Anywhere you wanna go.

548
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:24,693
You just say the word
and we're with you.

549
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:27,898
You folks just hop right in.
Just make yourself at home.

550
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:29,468
I'm driving.

551
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,742
Hey, Bird, what the hell
you doing, man?

552
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:52,154
Hey, how you guys doing?

553
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:54,858
My name's McCoy. Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you none.

554
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:57,859
That's great.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

555
00:50:57,894 --> 00:51:01,318
We're the Sorels. I'm Bird.
These are my associates.

556
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:04,743
This is Lester. My man
B.J., and that's Reggie.

557
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:10,940
Aren't you Ellen Aim?
That's right. It is Ellen Aim.

558
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,643
Hey, Ellen, you guys need
an opener or anything?

559
00:51:13,678 --> 00:51:14,743
I mean, we're good.

560
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:17,114
I mean, we're real good, but we just
can't seem to get anything going.

561
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:19,883
Hey, look, what gives? I handle
the management and the booking.

562
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:23,018
Now, you guys just shut up
and leave Ellen alone.

563
00:51:23,053 --> 00:51:25,389
Look, I know how tough it
can be getting the right gig.

564
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:26,855
Baby, you don't
even begin to know.

565
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,870
Man, what did I tell you guys?
Will you just cool it?

566
00:51:35,899 --> 00:51:40,575
Hey, if you got any chance at all of
missing the cops, it's through here.

567
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:45,843
Yeah, so what are our
chances? Horrible and terrible.

568
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,709
Oh, that's just great.

569
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:50,580
Look, we don't wanna mess
with any of these Ardmore cops.

570
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,014
They busted me
a couple of years ago,

571
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:54,584
threw my ass right in jail
'cause I wouldn't pay them off.

572
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,251
What'd they bust you for?

573
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:59,489
Disturbing the peace. They said I
got out of line in some bar, you know?

574
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:01,969
Great.
I love a girl with class.

575
00:52:34,891 --> 00:52:39,229
This is great, just great. You
wanna help change this tire, shorty?

576
00:52:39,264 --> 00:52:41,949
Changing flat tires isn't
exactly my line of work, dear.

577
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,634
If that's the case, then
why don't you just shut up?

578
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:46,773
Why don't you just shut up?

579
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:53,675
Then I try and write songs,
you know.

580
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,678
I just can't seem to figure out how
to do it right the way you do it.

581
00:52:56,713 --> 00:52:59,282
You know, I can't figure out how you
work out the rhymes and the melodies

582
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:00,849
and you make it all come out.

583
00:53:00,884 --> 00:53:03,954
Somebody else writes the songs,
Billy buys them or steals them,

584
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,187
I can't write for shit.

585
00:53:05,222 --> 00:53:08,391
I always thought those were
your songs. I just sing them.

586
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:11,094
Yeah, but when you sing them,
you make it yours.

587
00:53:11,129 --> 00:53:12,896
That's the way it is, right?

588
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:15,035
I guess so. Who knows?

589
00:53:15,665 --> 00:53:19,237
The famous Sorels sure put a
lot of money into that bus, huh?

590
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:22,239
Listen, Cody, I didn't know you had
a thing with Ellen in the old days.

591
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:23,638
You better get some smarts.

592
00:53:23,673 --> 00:53:26,041
Learn to adjust to the fact that
you're out of the picture now.

593
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:29,880
You see, Cody, I do things for her.
Things that a guy like you could never do.

594
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,155
Things that matter
in the real world.

595
00:53:37,354 --> 00:53:38,653
You know something?

596
00:53:38,688 --> 00:53:43,193
The only trouble with kicking the shit
out of you is it would be too easy.

597
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,945
You keep your hands
off the suit, buddy.

598
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:59,659
Come on, hurry the hell up with that
flat tire, already, let's get going.

599
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:03,613
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one

600
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:10,554
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one

601
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:12,122
Countdown to love

602
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:13,188
Ten

603
00:54:13,223 --> 00:54:16,126
Remember when you didn't
love me

604
00:54:16,161 --> 00:54:17,259
Nine

605
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:20,536
Now all the time
you're thinking of me

606
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:24,839
Eight, life is great
You're all I'm living for

607
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:28,573
This is my countdown to love

608
00:54:28,772 --> 00:54:32,685
Oh, this is
my countdown to love

609
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:37,687
You are the one love
in my life

610
00:54:37,847 --> 00:54:40,987
I know you feel that way too

611
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:46,163
Oh, what a thrill
when I'm holdin' you near

612
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:50,396
All of my wild dreams
come true

613
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:51,593
Four

614
00:54:51,628 --> 00:54:54,764
Forevermore you'll be my lover

615
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:55,997
Three

616
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:58,969
It's you for me
there'll never be another

617
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,001
Two

618
00:55:00,036 --> 00:55:03,574
Together forever
we'll be as one

619
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,645
Pretty good, you guys.

620
00:55:07,444 --> 00:55:09,177
Oh, this is
my countdown to love

621
00:55:09,212 --> 00:55:12,647
Cody? All right, Ellen,
Baby Doll, down in back.

622
00:55:12,682 --> 00:55:16,286
Fish, McCoy, we're working for the
Sorels. Fish, you're the manager.

623
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:17,419
I'm way ahead of you, Cody.

624
00:55:17,454 --> 00:55:19,856
What, do you think I gotta be a
genius to know what you're going for?

625
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:22,268
I'll handle this.
I'll talk us through.

626
00:55:37,374 --> 00:55:41,311
Hey, guys, how's it going? I'm
the bus driver here for the Sorels.

627
00:55:41,346 --> 00:55:44,547
We're on our way to play a gig
at an after hours joint.

628
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:46,615
The Sorels. The singers.
You know them, right?

629
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,320
No. Never heard of them. You know
what's going on here, don't you?

630
00:55:50,355 --> 00:55:52,721
Look, man, all I know
is we're running real late.

631
00:55:52,756 --> 00:55:56,159
Well, babe, some outfit just broke into
The Battery and burned half of it down.

632
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:57,359
Really?

633
00:55:57,394 --> 00:55:59,327
Knock off the crap, will you?

634
00:55:59,362 --> 00:56:01,564
As far as I'm concerned anybody
that goes into The Battery

635
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,465
and does some damage
deserves a medal.

636
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,419
Well, let me tell you how we look
at it. Look, cut the shit, okay?

637
00:56:06,454 --> 00:56:09,304
You guys got a big job to do, we're
trying to get where we're going.

638
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:13,576
Now, let us through, or you wanna come
to some kind of financial arrangement?

639
00:56:13,611 --> 00:56:15,210
Well, what do you
think, Harry?

640
00:56:15,245 --> 00:56:19,115
Well, I think what we got here
is a model citizen.

641
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,686
I knew you guys
talked my language.

642
00:56:25,655 --> 00:56:27,225
Keep it coming.

643
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:31,159
You guys take a big bite.
That's right.

644
00:56:31,194 --> 00:56:33,895
Nice to see there's some
integrity left on the force.

645
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,867
You know, you're just a little
too anxious to buy us off.

646
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:40,279
Spade musicians
with a big wad of money.

647
00:56:41,504 --> 00:56:43,608
All right,
everybody off the bus!

648
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:49,711
All right, now this is
how we're gonna play it.

649
00:56:49,746 --> 00:56:53,421
You're gonna walk off this bus
like there's nothing wrong. Get me?

650
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,266
All right, down on
the ground! Do it! Now!

651
00:57:05,495 --> 00:57:06,803
Get over there!

652
00:57:08,365 --> 00:57:11,901
Don't worry about it, fellows.
We'll be out of your face in no time.

653
00:57:11,936 --> 00:57:15,092
You know, some of you guys
got some cute little asses.

654
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:18,249
Be a real shame if I had
to blow them off! Stay down!

655
00:57:18,408 --> 00:57:19,477
Oh, shit!

656
00:57:23,179 --> 00:57:24,312
All right!

657
00:57:24,347 --> 00:57:25,655
Son-of-a-bitch!

658
00:57:32,155 --> 00:57:34,692
Come on, man, let's get
out of here! Come on!

659
00:57:52,175 --> 00:57:53,346
Go! Go!

660
00:57:55,945 --> 00:57:57,479
Shut the hell up!

661
00:57:57,514 --> 00:58:00,790
McCoy, pull out in a back
alley, we're gonna dump the bus.

662
00:58:01,184 --> 00:58:03,493
First he dumps the car,
now he's dumping the bus?

663
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:12,306
Code 99! Code 99.
Blockade at Cross and Ardmore.

664
00:58:12,662 --> 00:58:14,662
Suspects armed and dangerous!

665
00:58:14,697 --> 00:58:17,499
Repeat, armed and dangerous!
Broke blockade!

666
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:21,573
Heading north on Ardmore.
Cannot pursue. Do you copy?

667
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:25,782
God damn it, this is the blockade
at Ardmore, come back to me.

668
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:37,761
Come on.

669
00:58:59,576 --> 00:59:01,077
Come on! Come on!

670
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:12,654
We had a $1,000 in that bus!

671
00:59:12,689 --> 00:59:16,459
I lost my clothes, the luggage is
gone, all the sheet music is gone!

672
00:59:16,494 --> 00:59:17,559
This is great.

673
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:20,196
We're on our way to the
Richmond. No bus, no nothing.

674
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:22,005
You shouldn't have stopped,
Bird.

675
00:59:40,049 --> 00:59:42,688
He ain't a real
social kind of guy, is he?

676
00:59:43,286 --> 00:59:45,857
Really? Gee, I think
he's a real sweetheart.

677
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:48,825
Cut him some slack, will you?
He was there for you tonight.

678
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,358
Yeah, he really
earned his money.

679
00:59:50,393 --> 00:59:52,629
You know, you got a real
funny way of saying thanks

680
00:59:52,664 --> 00:59:54,028
when someone saves your ass.

681
00:59:54,063 --> 00:59:56,232
Why don't you go sit with
your pal Billy over there.

682
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:58,868
I guess he's more
your kind of guy.

683
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:01,041
Yeah, I think maybe I will.

684
01:00:15,418 --> 01:00:19,388
Don't worry, babe, everything's
gonna be okay from now on.

685
01:00:21,925 --> 01:00:23,836
We're gonna be great.

686
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,261
Hey, Reva, Ellen Aim's back.
And guess what? Tom's with her.

687
01:00:58,296 --> 01:01:00,900
Is he okay? Oh, he
looked all right to me.

688
01:01:01,898 --> 01:01:03,138
Chief?

689
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:23,063
Tom.

690
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:27,892
Reva, cut it out. We made it.
Everybody's in one piece.

691
01:01:28,558 --> 01:01:31,629
What about that, Ellen?
You okay?

692
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,164
Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.

693
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:38,633
No, she's not. She's tired,
and she's been roughed up.

694
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:41,502
I'm gonna take her back to the
hotel so she can get some rest.

695
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:44,641
This whole thing started 'cause I
had to do a gig in this shit hole.

696
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:47,849
I should've stayed the
hell away from this dump!

697
01:01:48,511 --> 01:01:50,511
Is that the way
you feel about it, Ellen?

698
01:01:50,546 --> 01:01:53,116
Yeah, I guess I just wanna
get away from here.

699
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:54,983
Get back on the road.

700
01:01:55,018 --> 01:01:58,658
Now you're talking, kiddo.
Come on, let's get out of here.

701
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:02,626
I hate you for taking money
to come and get me.

702
01:02:05,094 --> 01:02:07,198
That's telling him, Ellen.

703
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:29,752
I guess she doesn't like you much,
Cody. She doesn't seem real thankful.

704
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,388
Yeah, one thing about you,
Cooley, you catch on real quick.

705
01:02:32,423 --> 01:02:34,791
Yeah, that's right, Buddy,
and I get the job done.

706
01:02:34,826 --> 01:02:37,771
Good. Because I think
it's just starting.

707
01:03:09,258 --> 01:03:12,796
What the hell does he
wanna talk about? Tom Cody.

708
01:03:16,165 --> 01:03:17,871
I want Tom Cody.

709
01:03:18,868 --> 01:03:21,804
I wanna nail that son-of-a-bitch's
head to the sidewalk

710
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,239
under that marquee
that says Ellen Aim on it?

711
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:28,845
And just to prove to you,
I'm gonna be a nice guy,

712
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,757
I'm coming in
with just two of my men.

713
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:36,052
After I take care of Cody,
there'll be no more trouble.

714
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:42,599
You do your job, man.
Keep the peace.

715
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:12,538
Hey, Cody, I need a drink.
Come on, let's get out of here.

716
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,024
Maybe I can get lucky and pick
a fight with that bartender.

717
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:16,764
No, not this time.

718
01:04:25,635 --> 01:04:29,139
Hey, McCoy, look, I'll get
you your money later, okay?

719
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,141
Is that all you got to say is,
"I'll get your money to you later. "

720
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:35,144
Yeah, that's all I gotta say.
What else do you wanna hear?

721
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:36,778
Hey, look,
I did real good back there.

722
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:40,624
So what? I'm all out of medals,
besides you're getting paid.

723
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:48,391
You know, Reva, Ellen Aim
was right about one thing,

724
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:50,131
your brother's a jerk.

725
01:05:09,178 --> 01:05:12,181
What's your problem? You're
feeling pretty sorry for yourself...

726
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:13,481
Don't start on me, Reva.

727
01:05:13,516 --> 01:05:15,251
She comes back to town,
tells you and everybody else

728
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:16,317
it doesn't mean a goddamn...

729
01:05:16,352 --> 01:05:19,655
Yeah and the worst part is she
runs off with that creep Billy Fish.

730
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,858
You know, Tom, I didn't ask
you to go out and get Ellen Aim

731
01:05:21,893 --> 01:05:23,658
because she looks great
on stage.

732
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:27,363
Well, what the hell do you
care... I care about you!

733
01:05:27,398 --> 01:05:28,596
And this town!

734
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:31,868
Look, if you're gonna fight, you're
supposed to fight for something.

735
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:34,203
You and Billy Fish are the
same. You're both selfish!

736
01:05:34,238 --> 01:05:36,706
All you two
are really worried about...

737
01:05:37,206 --> 01:05:40,476
Hi, Ed. I came to talk to your brother.

738
01:05:40,511 --> 01:05:42,182
Come on outside.

739
01:05:52,822 --> 01:05:56,565
Raven says he has to face you
alone. Right here in The Richmond.

740
01:05:57,627 --> 01:06:02,565
I'm ordering you to get out of town,
Tom. I want you on a train tonight.

741
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,198
If Raven comes in here
to face you,

742
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:06,802
I'll be waiting for him
right here with a lot of guns.

743
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:09,270
I'm throwing his ass in jail.

744
01:06:09,305 --> 01:06:12,308
I am not gonna sit around
and watch two maniacs

745
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:15,276
play out some little game
about personal honor.

746
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:18,080
I want you gone. If you're
still in town tomorrow morning,

747
01:06:18,115 --> 01:06:21,390
I'm throwing your ass in jail
right next to Raven.

748
01:06:28,157 --> 01:06:31,125
Look, you did real good
rescuing her, Tom.

749
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,664
You surprised me. 'Cause I
didn't think you had it in you.

750
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:38,434
Now, surprise me again.
Do something else real good,

751
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:40,504
be on that train tonight.

752
01:07:13,636 --> 01:07:16,275
Yeah, come in.
Hey, I'll get It.

753
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,081
Who is It?

754
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:25,486
What the hell are you still doing here? Oh,
hey, look, see you guys later, all right?

755
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:36,562
I've been expecting you I
know what you want. Ten grand.

756
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:40,194
I'm as good as my word.
I pay on time.

757
01:07:40,229 --> 01:07:42,098
You know you play rough,
Cody, but you do a good job.

758
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:43,164
You should do
a little more work for me

759
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:44,899
when you get a taste of
what that money'll bring you.

760
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:47,403
Then you'll realize I'm the
one with the brains around here

761
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,314
and you'll start
treating me a bit nicer.

762
01:07:51,507 --> 01:07:53,843
You know, nobody ever had
a hold on me the way you did.

763
01:07:53,878 --> 01:07:55,609
I would have done
anything for you.

764
01:07:55,644 --> 01:07:58,180
A long time ago I would have
thought you were worth it.

765
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:00,023
Not anymore, babe.

766
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:03,819
Where do you get off
talking to her like that?

767
01:08:03,854 --> 01:08:05,886
She's way out of your league,
musclehead.

768
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:09,925
This is the grand I promised
McCoy. You can keep the rest.

769
01:08:15,931 --> 01:08:19,139
You know what's wrong
with that guy? He's stupid.

770
01:08:21,504 --> 01:08:22,670
I'm sorry, Billy.

771
01:08:22,705 --> 01:08:25,344
What are you sorry about? Where
are you going? Where you going?

772
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:28,246
Tom!

773
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:32,457
Tom, wait!

774
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:35,416
What was I supposed to do?

775
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:38,554
I hadn't heard from you in two years.
You didn't even write me a letter.

776
01:08:38,589 --> 01:08:40,931
What did I do
that was so wrong?

777
01:08:57,273 --> 01:08:59,140
You gotta go away.

778
01:08:59,175 --> 01:09:01,542
You fought enough fights,
you can let this one go.

779
01:09:01,577 --> 01:09:05,247
With both of us gone, maybe...
What do you mean "both of us"?

780
01:09:05,282 --> 01:09:08,592
Us! I wanna go with you.

781
01:09:09,652 --> 01:09:11,461
We could be together.

782
01:09:13,422 --> 01:09:17,335
You'd really come along with
me? In two seconds I would.

783
01:09:19,795 --> 01:09:21,035
Please?

784
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:51,310
Well, if it isn't
my old pal, Tom Cody.

785
01:09:51,345 --> 01:09:54,495
How's it going?
Great till you got here.

786
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:56,749
I've just been talking
things over with Clyde.

787
01:09:56,784 --> 01:09:58,968
You remember he and I
used to be real close.

788
01:09:59,003 --> 01:10:00,970
Hey, Tom, tequila, right?

789
01:10:08,577 --> 01:10:10,181
Here's what I owe you.

790
01:10:12,915 --> 01:10:17,261
You did real good back there. I
couldn't have got her out without you.

791
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:21,288
Maybe I rode you a little
harder than I should have.

792
01:10:21,323 --> 01:10:25,669
Don't get sentimental on me. I
wouldn't know how to handle it.

793
01:10:38,741 --> 01:10:41,410
Hey, I got a problem with
Ellen I gotta talk to you about.

794
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,711
Yeah, I understand
about these kind of things.

795
01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:47,950
You know, Cody, I was actually in
love once myself. It didn't work out.

796
01:10:47,985 --> 01:10:49,383
You're the kind
that makes bad picks, huh?

797
01:10:49,418 --> 01:10:52,755
He was the worst. He lied to
me all the time, cheated on me.

798
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,546
Well, if I ever run into
him, I'll give him your best.

799
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:58,303
Of course, you know,
that's before I was a soldier.

800
01:11:03,432 --> 01:11:08,103
You're real crazy about Ellen, aren't
you? Yeah, I don't know. I guess I am.

801
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,873
Hey, there's nothing wrong with
it. Nothing to be embarrassed about.

802
01:11:10,908 --> 01:11:13,107
I ain't embarrassed. I just
know it ain't gonna work out.

803
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:16,510
Ellen and I are going in different
directions. It's nobody's fault.

804
01:11:16,545 --> 01:11:20,414
Maybe you're right, 'cause you don't
look like no back-up singer to me.

805
01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:23,896
Look, I'm gonna need your help tonight.
I gotta do something I don't wanna do.

806
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:12,035
Come on.
Tom.

807
01:12:13,736 --> 01:12:15,069
This is not The Bayside.

808
01:12:15,104 --> 01:12:17,273
This is something back in The
Richmond I gotta take care of.

809
01:12:17,308 --> 01:12:18,906
What are you...

810
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:20,874
You get as far
from here as you can.

811
01:12:20,909 --> 01:12:23,445
You run until you hit The Bayside
and you can hang out there.

812
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,151
Sure, tough guy.

813
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:47,870
When's this train take off? I
gotta get back to The Richmond.

814
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:48,936
We don't.

815
01:12:48,971 --> 01:12:51,657
Look, lady, I gotta get
moving. It's important.

816
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:54,343
Well, you ain't gonna
get there on this train.

817
01:12:54,378 --> 01:12:56,645
Hey! Maybe you better think about it.

818
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,746
The Bombers have gone crazy.

819
01:12:58,781 --> 01:13:02,524
They're doing everything they
can to seal off The Richmond.

820
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:28,888
Let's go.

821
01:13:44,026 --> 01:13:46,160
What the hell
are you doing here, Clyde?

822
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:49,098
I told everybody to get off the
streets until this thing is over with.

823
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,800
Yeah, but I wanna see
Raven run from up close.

824
01:13:51,835 --> 01:13:53,506
Just stay out of the way.

825
01:14:00,743 --> 01:14:02,109
Well?

826
01:14:02,144 --> 01:14:07,150
Real simple. There's no showdown. Tom
Cody ain't here and neither is the girl.

827
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,854
I don't get it.

828
01:14:11,453 --> 01:14:13,432
Get off your bike, Raven.

829
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:18,901
I ain't too crazy
about jails, Chief.

830
01:14:20,896 --> 01:14:23,103
I got a better idea for you.

831
01:14:41,316 --> 01:14:43,420
Holy shit!

832
01:14:48,924 --> 01:14:51,267
They're here! They're here!

833
01:15:10,012 --> 01:15:13,459
I told your friend Cody
I could get a lot of guns.

834
01:15:14,116 --> 01:15:16,459
Hey, get out of my way!
What the hell!

835
01:15:17,786 --> 01:15:19,853
What is this?
You can't get away with this.

836
01:15:19,888 --> 01:15:22,691
You think you can ride into any
town and kidnap anybody you want?

837
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,933
Now, get the hell out of town
and leave these people alone.

838
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:56,593
Sorry I'm late. I got
something special in mind.

839
01:15:57,326 --> 01:16:00,068
I brought them along
just for you.

840
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,904
Well, my plan went to shit.
Let's see how you do.

841
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:14,643
Kick his ass.

842
01:16:42,504 --> 01:16:43,846
Nice, huh?

843
01:16:55,117 --> 01:16:56,459
Get him!

844
01:17:30,452 --> 01:17:31,931
Drop him!

845
01:18:22,037 --> 01:18:23,140
Tom!

846
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:56,507
Let's get out of here!

847
01:20:20,455 --> 01:20:25,404
No more timing

848
01:20:25,527 --> 01:20:29,065
Each tear that falls
from my eyes

849
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:33,440
I'm not hiding

850
01:20:33,802 --> 01:20:37,706
The remedy to cure
this old heart of mine

851
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:40,618
I can dream about you

852
01:20:41,476 --> 01:20:44,718
If I can't hold you tonight

853
01:20:45,947 --> 01:20:47,881
I can dream about you

854
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:51,086
You know something, Waldo,
we're gonna be rich.

855
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:53,463
Yeah. Long live rock and roll.

856
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:58,032
I can dream about you

857
01:20:58,493 --> 01:21:01,963
If I can't hold you tonight

858
01:21:03,031 --> 01:21:06,171
I can dream about you

859
01:21:06,935 --> 01:21:10,211
You know how
to hold me just right

860
01:21:12,274 --> 01:21:16,347
Moving sidewalks,

861
01:21:16,511 --> 01:21:20,186
I don't see under my feet

862
01:21:21,383 --> 01:21:25,020
Great, huh? My new discovery. I'm
gonna take them right up the ladder.

863
01:21:25,055 --> 01:21:27,864
Yeah, they ought to make you
a lot of money, Fish.

864
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:32,561
Look, don't worry, Cody, I'm not
gonna stand in your way with Ellen.

865
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:35,064
I know how it is
between you two.

866
01:21:35,997 --> 01:21:37,798
There's one thing
we both know, Fish.

867
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:40,168
She needs you a lot more
than she needs me.

868
01:21:40,203 --> 01:21:43,370
Yeah, she needs me,
but she loves you.

869
01:21:43,405 --> 01:21:46,775
She'll get over it. She's
used to me being unreliable.

870
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:49,309
Is that what I'm
supposed to tell her?

871
01:21:49,344 --> 01:21:53,519
You're okay with words. You'll
make her feel better than I could.

872
01:21:56,351 --> 01:21:58,262
Take it easy, Cody.

873
01:21:58,954 --> 01:22:00,330
Thanks.

874
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:02,795
I'll take it
wherever I can get it.

875
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:12,774
Climbing up
from the pain in my heart

876
01:22:13,068 --> 01:22:15,275
'Cause it's you that I need.

877
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:29,500
I can dream

878
01:22:29,535 --> 01:22:35,056
Everybody!

879
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:43,075
Yes, I can dream

880
01:22:50,038 --> 01:22:52,105
I don't understand it

881
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:56,111
I can't keep my mind
off loving you

882
01:22:56,146 --> 01:22:58,090
Love you forever

883
01:22:58,546 --> 01:23:00,513
Ooh, now baby

884
01:23:00,548 --> 01:23:04,686
I'm caught up
in the magic I see in you

885
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:06,655
There's one thing to do

886
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,555
I can dream about you

887
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:12,549
Guess you're just gonna cut
out, huh? Yeah. You know me.

888
01:23:12,584 --> 01:23:16,508
Yeah, I know you. You're
the guy with the right hook.

889
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:24,748
Is that it? Is that
all you've left to say?

890
01:23:26,675 --> 01:23:30,210
Look, I know you're gonna be going
places with your singing and stuff,

891
01:23:30,245 --> 01:23:34,852
but then I'm not the kind of guy to be
carrying your guitars around for you.

892
01:23:36,418 --> 01:23:40,422
But if you ever need me
for something, I'll be there.

893
01:23:44,592 --> 01:23:48,471
I can dream about you

894
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:53,101
I'm gonna press my lips against
you and hold you tight to me

895
01:23:53,136 --> 01:23:56,104
I can dream about you

896
01:23:57,138 --> 01:24:01,676
You know you got me spellbound
what else can it be

897
01:24:01,711 --> 01:24:04,019
I can dream

898
01:24:05,347 --> 01:24:08,225
Dreamin' about you

899
01:24:44,185 --> 01:24:47,658
I've got a dream
'bout an angel on the beach

900
01:24:47,693 --> 01:24:51,132
And the perfect waves
are starting to come

901
01:24:52,861 --> 01:24:56,482
His hair is flying out
in ribbons of gold

902
01:24:56,517 --> 01:25:00,104
And his touch
has got the power to stun

903
01:25:01,169 --> 01:25:04,939
I've got a dream
'bout an angel in the forest

904
01:25:04,974 --> 01:25:08,181
Enchanted by
the edge of a lake

905
01:25:10,178 --> 01:25:13,632
His body's flowing
in the jewels alive

906
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:17,087
And the earth below him
starting to shake

907
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:21,425
But I don't see
any angels in the city

908
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:25,600
I don't hear
any holy choirs sing

909
01:25:26,461 --> 01:25:28,863
And if I can't get an angel

910
01:25:28,898 --> 01:25:30,830
I can still get a boy

911
01:25:30,865 --> 01:25:34,023
And a boy'd
be the next best thing

912
01:25:34,058 --> 01:25:37,182
The next best thing
to an angel

913
01:25:37,372 --> 01:25:40,876
A boy'd be the next best thing

914
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:51,206
I've got a dream
'bout a boy in a castle

915
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:54,030
And he's dancing
like a cat on the stairs

916
01:25:54,856 --> 01:25:57,962
He's got the fire
of a prince in his eyes

917
01:25:57,997 --> 01:26:01,069
And the thunder
of a drum in his ears

918
01:26:01,663 --> 01:26:04,449
I've got a dream
'bout a boy on a star

919
01:26:04,484 --> 01:26:07,236
Lookin' down
upon the rim of the world

920
01:26:08,303 --> 01:26:11,172
He's there all alone and
dreamin' of someone like me

921
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:14,278
I'm not an angel
but at least I'm a girl

922
01:26:15,143 --> 01:26:17,979
I've got a dream
when the darkness is over

923
01:26:18,014 --> 01:26:20,925
We'll be lyin'
in the rays of the sun

924
01:26:21,349 --> 01:26:24,719
But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

925
01:26:24,754 --> 01:26:26,438
You'll never know
what it means

926
01:26:26,473 --> 01:26:28,382
But you'll know how it feels

927
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,256
It's gonna be over, over

928
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:33,994
Before you know it's begun

929
01:26:34,029 --> 01:26:36,698
It's all we really got tonight

930
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,266
Stop your cryin' hold on

931
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:39,506
Tonight

932
01:26:39,767 --> 01:26:41,736
Before you know it it's gone

933
01:26:41,771 --> 01:26:42,976
Tonight

934
01:26:43,238 --> 01:26:49,544
Tonight is what
it means to be young

935
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:51,778
Let the fire be started

936
01:26:51,813 --> 01:26:55,183
We're dancing for the restless
and the broken-hearted

937
01:26:55,218 --> 01:26:56,919
Let the rebels begin

938
01:26:56,954 --> 01:26:58,585
Let the fire be started

939
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,923
We're dancing for the
desperate and the broken-hearted

940
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:03,556
Let the rebels begin

941
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:06,662
Tonight is what
it means to be young

942
01:27:07,529 --> 01:27:09,796
Before you know it it's gone

943
01:27:09,831 --> 01:27:13,744
Say a prayer in the darkness
for the magic to come

944
01:27:15,803 --> 01:27:17,170
No matter what it seems

945
01:27:17,205 --> 01:27:23,955
Tonight is what
it means to be young

946
01:27:24,746 --> 01:27:27,021
Before you know it's begun

947
01:27:27,715 --> 01:27:30,695
Tonight is what
it means to be young

948
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:33,663
Before you know it's begun

949
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:02,717
I've got a dream
when the darkness is over

950
01:28:02,752 --> 01:28:05,754
We'll be lyin'
in the rays of the sun

951
01:28:06,054 --> 01:28:09,090
But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

952
01:28:09,125 --> 01:28:10,959
You'll never know
what it means

953
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,781
But you'll know how it feels

954
01:28:12,816 --> 01:28:14,568
It's gonna be over, over

955
01:28:14,963 --> 01:28:18,116
Before you know it's begun

956
01:28:18,151 --> 01:28:21,269
It's all we really got tonight

957
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:22,904
Stop your cryin' hold on

958
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:24,270
Tonight

959
01:28:24,305 --> 01:28:26,274
Before you know it it's gone

960
01:28:26,309 --> 01:28:27,514
Tonight

961
01:28:27,942 --> 01:28:33,581
Tonight is what
it means to be young

962
01:28:33,616 --> 01:28:34,983
Let the rebels begin

963
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,316
Let the fire be started

964
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:40,288
We're dancing for the restless
and the broken-hearted

965
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:41,606
Let the rebels begin

966
01:28:41,641 --> 01:28:42,855
Let the fire be started

967
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:45,793
Tonight is what
it means to be young

968
01:28:45,828 --> 01:28:47,827
Before you know it it's gone

969
01:28:47,862 --> 01:28:51,741
Say a prayer in the darkness
for the magic to come

970
01:28:53,067 --> 01:28:55,101
No matter what it seems

971
01:28:55,136 --> 01:28:58,378
Tonight is what
it means to be young

972
01:29:04,345 --> 01:29:06,480
Hey, Cody, how do you
like my new wheels?

973
01:29:06,515 --> 01:29:08,581
I found it
in the middle of the street.

974
01:29:08,616 --> 01:29:11,986
Somebody just dumped it. Finders
keepers, you know what I mean?

975
01:29:12,021 --> 01:29:14,577
Maybe you need
some company, huh?

976
01:29:14,612 --> 01:29:17,133
Yeah, I don't mind
if you tag along.

977
01:29:21,262 --> 01:29:23,435
I guess this is
my big chance, huh?

978
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:29,942
Hey, cool down, big guy, I already
told you, you're not my type.

979
01:29:30,942 --> 01:29:40,942
