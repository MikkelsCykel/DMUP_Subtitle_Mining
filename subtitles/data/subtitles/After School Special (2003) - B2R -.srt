<i>In high school, everyone's got</i>
<i>that one magic moment...</i>

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:08,941
<i>... when all the fears and insecurities</i>
<i>of being a teenager just vanish...</i>

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,906
<i>... and you're on top of the world.</i>

4
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,738
<i>It's like the planets have aligned...</i>

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,847
<i>... and everything you touch</i>
<i>just turns to gold.</i>

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,974
<i>And then there's this other moment.</i>

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,444
Get in there.
Follow those plans.

8
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,205
That's right.

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,049
I'll never touch myself again,
I swear.

10
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,049
It's all a big...

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,678
Please, please, no.
Mommy, Mommy.

12
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,690
He's gonna... No!

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,294
- Oh, God.
- No!

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,088
Please don't kill us, Mr. Porno Man!

15
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,633
Relax.

16
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,426
We ain't gonna kill youse.

17
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,805
We're gonna cut off your balls.

18
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,338
<i>This was unfortunate on two levels.</i>

19
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,707
<i>One, no one wants</i>
<i>to get their balls cut off.</i>

20
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,372
<i>And two, we hadn't even had</i>
<i>the chance to use them yet.</i>

21
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,416
<i>Well, socially, I mean.</i>

22
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>High school is about being able</i>
<i>to make mistakes.</i>

23
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,928
<i>And when you're 17,</i>
<i>you screw up a lot.</i>

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,897
<i>But that's okay,</i>
<i>seeing as people expect it.</i>

25
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,469
<i>I mean, 99 times out of 100</i>
<i>they give you a free pass.</i>

26
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,267
<i>Well, this story is about</i>
<i>number 100.</i>

27
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,616
<i>Let me go back to the beginning.</i>

28
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,980
<i>Now, it all started</i>
<i>around my 17 th birthday...</i>

29
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,851
<i>... with our usual morning routine,</i>
<i>film appreciation.</i>

30
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,960
<i>Now, when I say film appreciation,</i>
<i>I mean film duplication.</i>

31
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,792
<i>You see, Fred borrows them</i>
<i>from his job at the video store...</i>

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,457
<i>... then Matt makes copies</i>
<i>of them at school...</i>

33
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,330
<i>... and I market them</i>
<i>to needy freshmen.</i>

34
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,439
<i>Oh, my God, it's so big!</i>

35
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,335
<i>Christ!</i>

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,999
This is totally unwatchable.

37
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,006
This is really shoddy work.

38
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,111
And, jeez, look,
the boom mike is in the shot.

39
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,910
<i>What the fuck?</i>

40
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,886
Why do they always
show the guy's face?

41
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,113
Because we're better looking
than that guy...

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,485
...so we should be able
to get chicks hot as her.

43
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,819
- How the hell do you know?
- It's a basic rule of porno.

44
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,893
Let's get out of here.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,334
Now, <i>Dirty Darla No. 7</i>
is a modern classic.

46
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,232
This is grade-A porn, my friend,
worth a lot more than $20.

47
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,236
Sweet.

48
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,000
<i>Matt's an aspiring filmmaker.</i>

49
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,043
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>he's underappreciated...</i>

50
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,976
<i>... and he gets pushed around a lot.</i>

51
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,378
<i>Especially in gym class.</i>

52
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,681
<i>But he's still trying to develop</i>
<i>his personal visual style.</i>

53
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,787
Hand me my razor.

54
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,726
Sarah, I can see your panties.

55
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,538
Oh, my God,
it's that guy at the door again.

56
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,539
Busted.

57
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,745
<i>Now, you could say</i>
<i>that Fred's problem is that...</i>

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,889
<i>... he can't get up the nerve</i>
<i>to talk to girls.</i>

59
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:52,954
That test was so hard.

60
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,768
<i>Now, personally, I think it's</i>
<i>just a self-confidence issue.</i>

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,067
<i>One that he's working on</i>
<i>very hard.</i>

62
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,711
<i>Five, six...</i>

63
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,711
<i>... seven, eight times a day.</i>

64
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,183
Oh, yeah.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,210
Yeah!

66
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,286
<i>That's me, Deacon Lewis.</i>

67
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,581
<i>To understand why I led us</i>
<i>down the wrong road...</i>

68
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,158
<i>... you have to imagine what it's like</i>
<i>to be a 17-year-old guy...</i>

69
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:58,957
<i>... with only one thing on your mind,</i>
<i>all day, every day...</i>

70
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,430
<i>... but to have absolutely</i>
<i>no way of getting it.</i>

71
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,626
- We're all sitting here.

72
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,295
That your parents have signed
your permission slips...

73
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:12,906
...to attend my
sexual-education course.

74
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,480
I think we will begin
with hormones.

75
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,419
Hey, where'd they
get a picture of me?

76
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,716
- I can see by your tittering...
- Did you hear about Rachael?

77
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,588
...that a lot of you are uncomfortable...
- What happened?

78
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:32,390
- John Baldwin nailed her.
...with the male organ...

79
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,226
...the penis.
- Rachael Unger?

80
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,602
Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's
party on the weekend.

81
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,468
- Half of you have one.
- It was in the bathroom.

82
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,168
The other half of you
have a vagina.

83
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,509
Mr. Lewis.

84
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,181
Would you like to join us?

85
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,588
Thank you. Back to the breast.

86
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,352
<i>I absolutely refuse to believe it.</i>

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,192
<i>Rachael told me she wasn't ready,</i>
<i>but she did it.</i>

88
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,800
<i>With him.</i>

89
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,934
<i>Look at her face.</i>

90
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,734
<i>I was fed up with losing out,</i>
<i>and something had to be done.</i>

91
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,938
See that?

92
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,276
- Can we get a ride?
- Yeah, sure, where you going?

93
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,077
Yeah, let's go!

94
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,413
That should be us.

95
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:33,116
That's not gonna be us.
This year, next year or any year.

96
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,055
- Ever.
- Why not?

97
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,423
All you gotta do
is follow the simple lessons...

98
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,157
...of Tony Montana in <i>Scarface</i>.

99
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,301
Oh, good movie.

100
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,529
First you get the money,
then you get the power...

101
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,834
...then you get the women.

102
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,732
- Word.
- Word.

103
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,311
So we're gonna become
Cuban drug lords?

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,142
The porno-pirating operation
is bringing in plenty of money.

105
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,443
Once I get my new car
for my birthday tonight...

106
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,553
...we'll have the power
to go where we want.

107
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,849
And then there's nothing stopping
us from getting the girls.

108
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,422
Bye, sphincter.

109
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,166
You know what?
Nothing's gonna change, Deacon.

110
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,995
You'll still be the kid who
shit his pants in fifth grade...

111
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,900
...and no one will ever
let you forget it.

112
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,831
It was a stomach virus, asshole.

113
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,871
Happy birthday!

114
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,416
It's that new computer system
you've been talking about.

115
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,616
Art, why did I wrap it?

116
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,351
I'm sorry, honey. I got excited.

117
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,893
Don't you like it, honey?

118
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:48,031
Yes, I do, I do. It's just...

119
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,668
- I'll take it.
- Max.

120
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,827
We'll take it back
if it's not the right one.

121
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:57,169
No, Dad. No, no.
I don't know, I...

122
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,877
I guess I just thought you guys
were buying me that car I wanted.

123
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,777
Car? Why do you need a car?

124
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,885
Son, you don't need a car.
You can borrow the minivan anytime.

125
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,384
Right.

126
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,757
<i>Tom Cooperman's parties</i>
<i>were legendary.</i>

127
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:18,420
<i>But in the five, six years he was at our</i>
<i>high school, he never invited us once.</i>

128
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,330
Coop, what's going on, man?

129
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,671
Can we come in?

130
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,773
No, actually.

131
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,967
We're having a séance, man,
and everybody likes to keep it chill.

132
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,375
If you don't believe in the dark powers,
then you can't come in.

133
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,549
- Wait a second, man.
- What?

134
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:43,580
It's my birthday today.
So cut me a little slack, all right?

135
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,951
It's your birthday?

136
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,592
You guys, my best friends are here.

137
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,229
Come on, man.

138
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,137
Hey, Stephen, looking good
in that grey sweater, man.

139
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,639
Thank you.
Doing a great job, boys.

140
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,606
Look what I have.

141
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,939
Look at that dude.
I fucking hate him.

142
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,809
All right, have a good time, man.

143
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,007
- All right.
- And wear a rubber, dude.

144
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,778
Like he'd know
what to do with a rubber.

145
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,717
Oh, my God. It's Naomi.

146
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,461
Yeah, she looks good.

147
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,009
Oh, no.
Beer-foam moustache.

148
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,138
I'm gonna go talk to her.

149
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,450
What have I got to lose?

150
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,815
- Jesus, Fred.
- Your dignity, God!

151
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,013
Don't talk to her. Please.

152
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,655
Naomi.

153
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,159
- Hey, Deacon.
- Hey.

154
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,529
- Where's Jake?
- Like I care.

155
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,768
You mean you're not going out
with him anymore?

156
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,844
- Duh.
- Freakon, hey!

157
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,106
- What's up, Naomi?
- Hey.

158
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,943
Come on, Naomi.
I'm going to the pool.

159
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,782
Talking to Deacon.

160
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,348
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

161
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,493
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

162
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,788
Yeah, whatever.

163
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,252
Asshole.

164
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,626
Whatever.

165
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,803
You realize how long it's
gonna take to save up for a car...

166
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,844
...selling pornos at $20 each?

167
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,917
- What?
- There's a small problem.

168
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,313
What?

169
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,748
I got fired yesterday.

170
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,692
All right, Russ caught me
and went berserk.

171
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,386
It was crazy. It was like
some sort of sting operation...

172
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,224
...he'd been planning for months.

173
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,492
You're kidding me.
Tell me you're kidding me.

174
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,794
I'm not kidding you.

175
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:13,063
And now I gotta work twice a week
at my dad's office, he's so pissed.

176
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,037
See, see, I told you this
<i>Scarface</i> plan was stupid.

177
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,766
This is great.

178
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,538
So now not only do we have no car,
no girls, we also got no money.

179
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,204
- And no porn.
- Shit.

180
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,442
Tony Montana would be pissed.

181
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:35,023
<i>Stop right there. Stop right there.</i>
<i>Stop right there. Stop right there.</i>

182
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,392
<i>- Not for monkey boys.</i>
- Goddamn it.

183
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,364
Your dad really knows his firewalls.

184
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,095
Hey, asshole,
don't just come barging in here.

185
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,104
We could have been naked.

186
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,742
Shut up and listen to me.

187
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,277
I figured out a way to get back
on the Tony Montana track.

188
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,847
So I'm at the zoo today...

189
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,284
People, people.

190
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,720
Witness the miracle of nature
at its most primal.

191
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,018
<i>And these monkeys are doing it.</i>

192
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,187
<i>They're going insane.</i>
<i>And Ms. Ariel is videotaping it.</i>

193
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:17,597
- Of his engorged penis,
the male deposits his seed...

194
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,234
...and moves on.

195
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:26,777
Probably to a younger,
more desirable female.

196
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,312
One who doesn't have any issues.

197
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,006
Whatever that means.

198
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,481
<i>And that's when it hit me.</i>

199
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,285
Incoming.

200
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,520
<i>Well, Roger, actually.</i>

201
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:44,922
A little help?

202
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,295
- What?
- Let's make one.

203
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,336
- One what?
- A movie.

204
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,598
Oh, that's great. That's perfect.

205
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,802
I've already got an idea for, like,
a sci-fi<i>l</i>horror kind of thing.

206
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,776
It's like <i>The Jetsons</i>
meets <i>The Shining...</i>

207
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,812
No, you moron.

208
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,577
- A porno movie.
- Oh, even better.

209
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,050
Yeah, and here's the best part.
I got an angle.

210
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,347
What kind of angle?

211
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,219
We can make pornos
that cater to guys like us.

212
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,691
- You mean virgins?
- Exactly.

213
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,330
Adult films made
by virgins for virgins.

214
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,931
Well, here's a question.

215
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,500
How are we gonna get the women
to star in the film?

216
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,193
And the guys?

217
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,464
That's simple.
We'll surf the Net or something.

218
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,369
We could figure that out.

219
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,038
Then...

220
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,547
- What's so funny?
- It was...

221
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,207
It was too much, man.
I couldn't...

222
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,684
Oh, you're funny.

223
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,322
I'm serious about this.

224
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,519
We can't make a porno.

225
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:53,154
Deacon, do you have any idea
how much trouble we would get in?

226
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,199
Do you have any idea
how much money we'd make?

227
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,765
- Like how much?
- How much?

228
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,634
Enough to buy a car.

229
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,607
Enough to get more camera shit.
Enough to take out girls.

230
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,837
Enough to do whatever
the hell we want.

231
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,004
Well, what about
the moral implications?

232
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,151
It's a free-market transaction
between two consenting aduIts.

233
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,980
What's the problem?

234
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,213
Hello? We're not aduIts.

235
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,879
He's got a point, Deacon.

236
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,656
You just don't get it, do you?

237
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,262
If we make this movie...

238
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,195
...this year could be
the best year of our lives.

239
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,562
We go in boys,
and we come out men.

240
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,763
But you know what? You two losers
would rather sit back and play it safe.

241
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,875
Well, I'm not waiting on you, man.
I'm not wasting another minute.

242
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,977
I'm making this movie,
with or without you.

243
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,705
And when I show up at school
in my new set of wheels...

244
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,747
...do you know what I'm
gonna have to say?

245
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:50,120
Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed.
You blew it.

246
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,589
- That was a great speech, Deacon.
- Thanks, Matt.

247
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,732
Did you work that out before?

248
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,328
No, Matt.

249
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:07,905
Okay, so let's say that we were
actually going to do this.

250
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,802
What would we call our company?

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,171
I know.

252
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,370
After School Special.

253
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,868
- Hey, Vic.
- Hey, Darla.

254
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,165
How you doing?
Ready for number eight?

255
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,331
Sure, just give me
a couple of minutes.

256
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,601
It was great, Vic, huh?

257
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,745
Some good action.
Nice arc there at the end.

258
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,608
- Thank you very much, Mikey.
- No problem.

259
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,148
Hey, buddy,
let me ask you something.

260
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,451
I want you to be
completely honest with me.

261
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,848
Sure, Vic.

262
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,081
- You think I'm too fat?
- Are you kidding?

263
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:03,490
- I know I've put on a few pounds...
- Vic, the camera loves you.

264
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,120
- Seriously?
- Absolutely.

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,099
Hey, thanks, buddy.

266
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,006
All right.

267
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,506
Thank you, seriously.

268
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,041
- Sure.
- I needed it.

269
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,769
<i>Dr. Jablowma.</i>
<i>Dr. Heywood Jablowma.</i>

270
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,006
<i>Please report</i>
<i>to the emergency room.</i>

271
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,174
<i>Dr. Heywood Jablowma</i>
<i>to the emergency room.</i>

272
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,480
We need two forms of ID
to prove she's over 18.

273
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,917
How much money do we need?

274
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,059
Well, a first-time porno actress
makes only 250 to 500 bucks.

275
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,394
That's it?
Does that include the sex?

276
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,358
Yes, Matt.

277
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,657
We're not supposed to have
sex with them, are we?

278
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,822
No, Matt.

279
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,164
Fred, your father wants you
to take these urine samples to the lab.

280
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,103
Okay, in a minute.

281
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,370
We also need an adult signature to
set up the bank account and website.

282
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,346
- Let's use Principal Taggart's name.
- You're a genius.

283
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,277
That'll never come back to haunt us.

284
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,878
Then whose name are
we gonna use, huh?

285
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,718
I'm Ronald Greitzer,
here for my 4:00 appointment.

286
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,392
He's got a rectal exam.

287
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,356
It's worse when he sleeps.

288
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,191
He does a lot of night scratching.
I try to prevent it.

289
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,857
- Don't be embarrassed about it.
- Oh, don't forget your sample jar.

290
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,597
Go get your stool jar.
I'll be over here.

291
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,609
- No.
- Why not? It's perfect.

292
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,506
My dad's got
Mr. Greitzer's signature...

293
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,408
...his credit card number,
his Social Security number.

294
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:30,741
And he'll never find out?

295
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,947
It's not like we're sending him
our annual report.

296
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,247
It'll be like an official name of record
or something.

297
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,357
<i>Code blue.</i>
<i>Crash cart to the specimen room.</i>

298
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,390
Greitzer it is, then.

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,461
And we need porno names.

300
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,858
What do you mean?

301
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,498
It's a basic rule of porno.

302
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,430
All people affiliated with
the production of an adult film...

303
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,537
...have porno names so their friends
don't recognize them.

304
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,832
Oh, you mean like
Johnny Hardmember.

305
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,236
Exactly.

306
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,812
Hey, that's a good one.
I'll be Balls McLongcock.

307
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,949
You guys are dorks.
Those names are for the actors.

308
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,585
You're jealous because you don't
have a cool porno name.

309
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,687
Exactly.

310
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,613
All right, fine.

311
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,623
Then I'm Sam Slam.

312
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,387
Yeah. Sam Slam, the Backdoor Man.

313
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,856
- That name sucks.
- You don't get it, do you?

314
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,094
A porno name needs
to be a very subtle thing!

315
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,207
Sorry, Balls.
I guess I'm a little new at this.

316
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,637
Yeah, and you're funny too.

317
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,550
I say we make him from Hawaii.

318
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,186
Do you know what a Hawaiian
driver's license looks like?

319
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,821
- No.
- Exactly.

320
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,419
Won't it seem a little suspicious?
Like, why are we in Cleveland?

321
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,119
Vacation.

322
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,127
People from Cleveland
vacation in Hawaii.

323
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,528
Where do you think
people from Hawaii go?

324
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,802
Aloha.

325
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,519
Mom, can I use the car?

326
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,626
Deacon, I have to go
to the video store later. I'm sorry.

327
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,694
Mom, you said I could use the car,
but it's never free.

328
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,494
Okay, Deacon,
I'll walk to the video store.

329
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,000
- Where you guys going?
- Out.

330
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,396
How come you boys
are dressed like Don Ho?

331
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,601
Because, Mr. Lewis,
this is the new style.

332
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,146
- Yeah, for ass wranglers.
- Max.

333
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,145
Ass wranglers.

334
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,844
All right, boys,
let the wrangling begin.

335
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,463
Are we really gonna do this?

336
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,363
Oh, yeah.

337
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,558
IDs.

338
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,832
Oh, Richard Runningbear
from Hawaii.

339
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,537
Okay, well, have a good time, guys.

340
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,582
Oh, and, hey, guys?

341
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,051
- That's a nice lamination job.
- Oh, thanks.

342
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,453
You don't understand.

343
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,027
We have to get into
this strip club tonight.

344
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,688
The next two years
of high school totally depend on it.

345
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,235
We've got cash.

346
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,801
Have a good time, guys.

347
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,497
Hey, what'll you boys have?

348
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,266
Two-drink minimum.

349
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,900
I'll have a Scotch,
straight up on the rocks.

350
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,112
I'll have a 7 and 7.

351
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,616
Same for me. Thank you.

352
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,950
What the hell is a 7 and 7?

353
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,389
I have no idea.

354
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,427
But I heard the guy
over there order one...

355
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,929
...and I like the way it sounds.

356
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,590
Numerical.

357
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,018
Do you want a dance?

358
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,661
No, thank you.

359
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,765
I need to go to the bathroom.

360
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,958
- How about you buy me a drink?
- Okay.

361
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,902
Seven and 7.

362
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,634
Want mine?

363
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,373
What brings you boys
to the Pretty Kitty?

364
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:04,072
Well, actually, we're filmmakers,
and we're here looking for new talent.

365
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,807
- Really?
- Really.

366
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,045
- You interested or what?
- No.

367
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,881
But I do know someone who is.

368
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,078
Hi, I'm Ashley.

369
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,909
You guys the filmmakers?

370
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,944
Videographers, actually.

371
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,683
I wanted to shoot on film,
but these guys wouldn't let me.

372
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,087
All right, here's the deal.

373
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,058
We're paying top dollar here, okay?

374
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,254
Hetero only, no anal.

375
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,491
And we'll be distributing
through our website.

376
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,464
So?

377
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,072
Aren't you a little young?

378
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,137
No.

379
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,507
Well, aren't you,
is the question I have to ask.

380
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,777
I mean, we will need two forms of ID
to prove that you're over 18, so...

381
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:18,020
- I'm 18.
- Then you're hired.

382
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,682
- Shouldn't we audition her first?
- Shut up, Matt.

383
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,885
<i>She's everybody's favorite</i>
<i>naughty schoolgirl.</i>

384
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,893
<i>Give it up for Ashley!</i>

385
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,927
<i>- Ashley, we love you...</i>
- Call me.

386
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,061
Look, this is my picture
and this is my number.

387
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,068
When you're sober, call me, okay?

388
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,467
Bye.

389
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,635
Sphincter?

390
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,005
<i>And cut.</i>

391
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,445
Okay, people, reset
and we'll go again right away.

392
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:26,845
Nobody step in the lube.

393
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,246
Mike, I need to talk to you.

394
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,821
Okay, five minutes
and we'll go again right away.

395
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,458
I hear someone's been
muscling in on our territory.

396
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,390
Yeah, I heard that.
They're recruiting new talent.

397
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,427
Jimmy Rimmer says
they're from Hawaii.

398
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,532
Hawaii?

399
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,294
Why would someone from Hawaii
wanna come to Cleveland?

400
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,063
I don't know. Vacation?

401
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,263
It's Cleveland. Look out the window.

402
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,205
Hey, there's the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, huh?

403
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,306
Yeah, I guess.

404
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,745
What is this, F with Vic month?

405
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:03,650
If these goddamn amateur yabos
try to muscle in on my territory...

406
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,313
...I swear to God, I'm gonna go off.

407
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,322
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who you gonna shoot?

408
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,689
I don't know. Everybody, nobody.
I don't know.

409
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:16,027
Calm down, Vic, huh?
I don't need you all agitated.

410
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,102
You still got five films
to star in today.

411
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,498
You're right.

412
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,297
Yeah, course I'm right.

413
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,839
Don't worry about it, okay?

414
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,136
We'll find these guys
and we'll take care of it.

415
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,302
- Good.
- Good.

416
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,076
- You hungry?
- Yeah, I could eat.

417
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,842
- Wanna grab some lunch?
- Sure.

418
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,576
- All right.
- Let's break for lunch.

419
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,449
Everybody, we're breaking for lunch.

420
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,460
- What are you guys doing?
- We came up with a great idea.

421
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:46,654
We're gonna presell copies
of the video on the website.

422
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,460
- Will that work?
- I don't know, but it's fun.

423
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,364
One thing, though,
I just thought about:

424
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,028
If our motto is
"by virgins, for virgins"...

425
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,505
...maybe we should put a picture
or something of one of us on the site...

426
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,406
...to sort of sell the image.

427
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,172
- You're not putting my picture up.
- Why? You're a virgin.

428
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,111
No, this is a good idea.

429
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:10,550
But it doesn't necessarily
have to be one of us.

430
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,288
I don't know.
Do you think he'll be mad?

431
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,895
What, are you kidding me?
He looks great.

432
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,759
He'll probably even get laid.

433
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,093
Deacon? Honey, are you in here?

434
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,794
Oh, hi, boys.
Look who's here.

435
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,769
Your good friend Jake.

436
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,670
Hi, guys.

437
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,242
Okay, boys, have a good time.

438
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,242
- Bye, Mrs. Lewis.
- Goodbye, Jake.

439
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:36,880
Good to see you.
Come again, okay?

440
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,777
I will, for sure.

441
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,850
What the hell's
going on here, sphincter?

442
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,544
What are you doing here?

443
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,157
No, no, no.
I saw the strippers drop you guys off.

444
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,294
We don't know
what you're talking about.

445
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,486
Oh, yeah, yeah?
Well, then...

446
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,325
Well, then, what's this, huh?

447
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,524
"'Oh, my God. There's a boy
at the door...

448
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,566
...looking at us naked in the shower.'

449
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:03,970
The AD Club secretary
lathers all of their glis..."

450
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,042
- Glistening.
- Shut up!

451
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,076
"Glistening bodies.

452
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:12,046
First girl: 'I'm so dirty.
Do me the right way,' she moans."

453
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,310
What kind of sick shit is this?
Are you guys..?

454
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,420
You guys running
a whorehouse or something?

455
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,489
- No.
- That is great writing. Are you crazy?

456
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,592
They're not whores
if we film them, idiot.

457
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,162
You retards are trying
to make a porno movie?

458
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,798
Hey, you can't prove a thing.

459
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,992
Yeah? Who's the girl?

460
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,296
A stripper. Her name's Ashley.

461
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,699
Shit.

462
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,500
Who's the guy?

463
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,011
You know,
because maybe I could...

464
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,204
Maybe I could do it.

465
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,871
- No, it wouldn't work.
- Why not?

466
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,984
It's harder than it looks. You need
concentration, stamina, girth.

467
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,814
What, you don't think I can do it?

468
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:53,549
Trust me, the Jake-meister's
nailed his.

469
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,023
Look, just forget about it, man. It's...

470
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,425
Listen here, you little fuck,
I wanna do it.

471
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,462
If you don't let me,
I'll tell your mom...

472
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,761
...what kind of sick shit
you're up to. All right?

473
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,564
- Come on.
- Oh, Mrs. Lewis!

474
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,537
Okay, fine, you can do it.

475
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,936
You'll need these.

476
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,975
That's what I thought.
I'll see you on set.

477
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,373
Bye, fucker.

478
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,070
In my basement, after school.

479
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,150
- Go up there.
- No, I'm not going up there.

480
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,049
- You go up there.
- Man, she's all alone.

481
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,020
- Will one of you guys go over there?
- I'm not going up there.

482
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,161
- Someone has to give her the scene.
- Yeah, and that person is you.

483
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,287
So go. You're wasting time.

484
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,861
Man, I'm really nervous.

485
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:49,101
What's he doing?

486
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,272
So I'll be directing.

487
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,644
Okay.

488
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,219
Okay...

489
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:01,590
I want you to play
this really understated.

490
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,920
It's a very visceral scene...

491
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,826
...so it's important not to play it
too over-the-top.

492
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,931
Hey, did you guys shave
or something?

493
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,941
Let's roll. Let's do this.

494
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,974
Come on, get the... Get the boom.

495
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,477
Okay, boom in position.

496
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:24,737
What?

497
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,583
What?

498
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,913
Get it in position.

499
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,661
It has to be closer. Get closer.

500
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,561
- What are you doing?
- Get closer.

501
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,496
Don't. Just give it.
What do you want?

502
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,638
- Get closer.
- Come on, man!

503
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,667
My mom gave me $30 for this boom,
and you just broke it.

504
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,570
- You're a disgrace.
- You make me nervous, man.

505
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,917
So, Ashley, could you take
your position?

506
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,316
Okay.

507
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,192
Are we really gonna do this?

508
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,952
Obviously, yeah.

509
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,960
Okay, so...

510
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,860
We're starting with the masturbation.

511
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:32,782
And then Philip the yearbook editor
is gonna surprise you.

512
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,418
Okay.

513
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,348
Okay, action.

514
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,958
These yearbook photos
of the Debate Club...

515
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,494
...are just making me so hot.

516
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,863
I can't help myself.

517
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,203
And, you know,
I hope nobody comes in...

518
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,502
...because I think I forgot
to lock the door.

519
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,549
<i>- Camera rear, close-up.</i>
- What?

520
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,986
Get a close-up.

521
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,387
Yeah.

522
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,556
Oh, yeah.

523
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,301
Yeah.

524
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,839
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

525
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,739
- Oh, God.
- Okay, cut.

526
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,679
Okay.

527
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,452
Did I do something wrong?

528
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,055
Oh, no. You were great.

529
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,190
I think I've got everything
I need there.

530
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,922
- Set up for Jake.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

531
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,793
No, you're not, Fred.
Jake, you ready?

532
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,864
- Yeah, action.
- Okay.

533
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,604
Oh, my God.

534
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,243
What are you doing here?

535
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,972
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell the principal.

536
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,816
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't.

537
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:18,649
- Cut. That was perfect.
- Yeah.

538
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,718
Why don't we move on to...

539
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,225
...the sexual material.

540
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,519
Yeah.

541
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,664
Yeah.

542
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,827
And action.

543
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,808
That's it?

544
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,909
It's not hard yet.

545
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,018
Oh, well, yeah, I can see that.

546
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,745
Shut up, man.

547
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,621
Ashley, maybe you could
help him out a little.

548
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,456
Yeah. Wait, what?

549
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,359
Okay.

550
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,866
- Oh, God.
- Wait, I'm not set up for that shot.

551
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,342
- God.
- Yeah, well, that's just not right.

552
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,209
- Oh, can I put the boom down now?
- I'm sorry.

553
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,111
- That's disgusting.
- I never do this.

554
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,615
I never do this.

555
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,380
- She got me too excited.
- What?

556
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,023
I got a problem, okay?

557
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,818
Is that what you guys wanna hear?

558
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:34,993
That I got a tiny pee-pee
and I'm a premature ejaculator, huh?

559
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,499
All right, okay, listen, calm down.
It'll be fine.

560
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,796
Not a problem at all.

561
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,135
We'll film it again,
and we can splice it together, right?

562
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,832
Yeah.

563
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,207
Well, we'd have to shoot it, like,
20 times to get enough footage.

564
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,213
All right, that's it, little fucks.

565
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,214
I'm out of here.

566
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,013
Quit looking at me.

567
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:01,558
If you guys tell anybody about this,
I'm gonna kick your ass and kill you.

568
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,524
Then I'm gonna rat you out.
Come on!

569
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,927
Now what?

570
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,633
Just one sex... Sec.

571
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,939
Deacon, you do it.

572
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,514
- What? Me?
- Come on, this is your big chance.

573
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,449
Give me a break.
Yeah, why don't you do it.

574
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,388
- Fred.
- What?

575
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,115
Come on.

576
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,584
You do it.

577
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,253
- I have to run the camera.
- Like you're the only one who can.

578
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,194
Oh, fine.

579
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,498
Fine, I'll do it.

580
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,602
I'll do it for the sake of the film.

581
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,733
- Matt, give me a... Matt.
- Matt.

582
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,310
- Put your shirt back on.
- Okay.

583
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,380
- There you go.
- God. Straighten up.

584
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,642
Okay.

585
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,078
You know what?

586
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,655
I say we just pay Ashley...

587
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,951
...and chalk it up
to a failed experiment, right?

588
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,356
- Fine with me.
- Yeah, me too.

589
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,019
No.

590
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,761
- We can find someone else.
- Who?

591
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,131
And we're gonna presell them
through our website.

592
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,296
So, what do you think?

593
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,169
You guys are gonna be
legends of the school, man.

594
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,710
Oh, my God.

595
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,748
I've got it.

596
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,219
Oh, my God.

597
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,517
- The Math Team captain.
- What?

598
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:44,752
The Math Team captain is in
detention for something, all right?

599
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,397
- For fixing grades for a girl.
- My God, that's perfect.

600
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,192
And the cheerleader's in there.

601
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:54,464
And she is going to get grounded...

602
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,368
...if she fails one more test.

603
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,373
- That's perfect.
- Okay, okay, so...

604
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,602
...she goes over to his house...

605
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,647
- And she's really, really hot.
- Really hot.

606
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,613
- Type that in. Type that in.
- Really, really hot. Hot.

607
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,083
All right, okay, perfect.
But he's bright.

608
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,347
She's not in calculus or anything.
She's like...

609
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,751
- Algebra.
- Algebra.

610
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,222
- Right, because she's a slut.
- She doesn't really...

611
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,988
So, what should we call it?
Like <i>Orgasmic Equations</i>?

612
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,927
I don't know. Make it...
Make it broader.

613
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,158
<i>Twelve-Inch Ruler</i>?

614
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,560
You're getting closer.

615
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,500
<i>Slide-Rule Slut</i>.

616
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,963
<i>Slide-Rule Slut</i>.
<i>Slide-Rule Slut</i>.

617
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,372
<i>- Slide-Rule Slut</i>.
<i>- Slide-Rule Slut</i>.

618
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,944
Oh, my God,
I gotta go to the bathroom.

619
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,206
Okay, I'll leave, you keep typing.

620
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,009
- Right, right, right.
- Oh, my God.

621
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,842
And he doesn't know what to do.

622
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,988
He's... He's...
It's strange. It's kind of foreign.

623
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,522
- Mr. Lewis.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?

624
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,487
- Yeah, thanks.
- Jeez.

625
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,718
I'm so embarrassed.

626
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,323
Well, I... I guess I should go.

627
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:32,026
Deacon, will you wait
while I change my shirt really fast?

628
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,235
Will you just turn around
and block me? Nobody will see.

629
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,376
Oh, my God.

630
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,337
So I haven't seen you
around school for a while.

631
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,649
Oh, yeah. You know,
I'm just working on this...

632
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:53,119
- This project at home.
- Cool.

633
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,121
You can turn around now.

634
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,925
Listen, Mark and J.T.
Are having a party tonight.

635
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,801
- Do you wanna meet me there?
- Really?

636
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,801
Why not?

637
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,237
Yeah. Cool.

638
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,542
- Watch out! Move!
- Clear! Clear!

639
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,443
Jerks!

640
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,018
And that's the history...

641
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,484
...of the blowhole.

642
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,624
Now, on to the sea lions.

643
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:31,785
Sea lions, as you will see,
are not really lions.

644
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:35,796
They have no fur, no tail,
and they do not live in Africa.

645
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,400
Deacon, Deacon.
Deacon, guess what.

646
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,866
- Guess what, man.
- What?

647
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,834
Our site got linked by another site.

648
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,906
Somebody read our stories
and liked them.

649
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,440
That's great. And?

650
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,942
We got a few more preorders
and a ton of hits.

651
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,181
- How many?
- Twelve thousand.

652
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,944
Holy shit. Nice.

653
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,487
Guys, we gotta hurry up
and make this movie.

654
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,682
I can't really do it tonight, guys.

655
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,326
Where are you going?

656
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,394
Naomi invited me to a party.

657
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,030
Can we come?

658
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,766
Yeah. Of course you can.

659
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,701
The thing is, I really want you to...

660
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,832
...but I was kind of getting this vibe
from her, you know what I mean?

661
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,001
Okay, we can just meet you there.

662
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,574
Sure. Sounds good.

663
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,739
It's at Mark and J.T. Slistak's house.

664
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,836
- So, what?
- Oh, no.

665
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,845
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, look who's here.

666
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:04,986
So I hear you guys are
working on a project together.

667
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,518
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

668
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,559
- But we can't really talk about it.
- Yeah, it's private.

669
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:14,731
Hey, guys.

670
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,367
Deacon, what's up, buddy?
Give me some skin.

671
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,470
Come on.

672
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,104
- What's up?
- You dumb shit.

673
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,912
Naomi, what are you doing
hanging out with this loser?

674
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,113
- What's your problem, Jake?
- What's yours?

675
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,578
Whatever.

676
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,454
Hey, what was that all about?

677
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,784
He really pisses me off.

678
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,359
Jake is such an asshole.

679
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,496
Tell me about it.

680
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,898
You know, when we were going out,
he was mean to me all the time.

681
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,593
Okay? I think he was
compensating...

682
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,763
...for his little penis
that never gets hard.

683
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,671
You were really smart to dump him.

684
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,114
And I'll tell you why.

685
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,713
Because you...

686
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,489
...you deserve someone that'll...

687
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,260
...treat you really well.

688
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,896
You know what you are?

689
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,333
You're a nice guy.

690
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,603
Deacon.

691
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,868
I've wanted to do that
for a long time.

692
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,142
So why didn't you?

693
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,505
- Do you have anything?
- Like what?

694
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,235
Protection.

695
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,105
No.

696
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,148
Hold on.

697
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,212
Here.

698
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,654
Do you want to?

699
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:26,824
Oh, of course. Yeah.

700
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:35,730
What's the problem?

701
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,875
It's my first time.

702
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:45,541
It's okay. Just go slow.

703
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,416
<i>Okay, don't panic, don't panic.</i>

704
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,950
<i>What do I do?</i>
<i>I mean, what do I do?</i>

705
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,587
<i>I gotta think.</i>

706
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:55,452
<i>All right, now, I've seen porn.</i>
<i>I've seen lots of porn.</i>

707
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,389
<i>That's it.</i>

708
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,587
<i>I'll borrow a little scene</i>
<i>from</i> Forrest Pump.

709
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,898
<i>Yeah.</i>

710
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,466
<i>Then I'll take a little something...</i>

711
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,698
<i>... from</i> American Thigh,
<i>part one and two.</i>

712
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,838
<i>And then I'm gonna finish up</i>
<i>with some classic material...</i>

713
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,481
<i>... from</i> Pulp Friction.

714
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,580
<i>You know, it's true what they say.</i>

715
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,417
<i>It really does help</i>
<i>to have company.</i>

716
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,422
I might have to have you tell me
you're a lesbian.

717
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:31,993
- What?
- Where the hell is Coop?

718
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,198
- What the hell is this?
- That is a special effect.

719
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,266
If you want this film
to look amateurish...

720
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,164
...find somebody else, because I...

721
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,834
What y'all talking about?

722
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:43,905
Come on, already.
Let's do it, all right?

723
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,771
Okay, places, please.

724
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,751
- And action.
- Watch your ass, man.

725
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:02,320
Oh, this summer tent-pole
blockbuster has me so scared.

726
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,653
Put your head in my lap...

727
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,261
...and I'll let you know
when the scary parts are over.

728
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,655
What are you doing?

729
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,371
Monster's coming out, baby, just...

730
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,847
Oh, God, this is bad.

731
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,015
- How's Naomi?
- Fine.

732
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,215
Oh, Jesus Christ, this is horrifying.

733
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,588
All right, be honest with me.

734
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:45,826
Do you ever think that we've gotten in
a little over our heads with all this?

735
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,969
Oh, goddamn it,
here comes the monster.

736
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,469
Fire! Fire!

737
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:56,573
What are you doing?

738
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,275
Get the fire extinguisher.

739
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:07,320
We're all going to die!

740
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,058
Clear!

741
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,873
I can't believe this.

742
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,704
Are you okay? You okay?

743
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,244
- What is going on here?
- You okay? You okay?

744
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,938
Nice rack.

745
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,410
Mom, Dad,
what are you doing here?

746
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,851
Well, Max sprained his wrist
at soccer practice.

747
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,286
- What's going on here, Deacon?
- Wait, wait, honey.

748
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,484
I'm sure that Deacon's
got a pretty good explanation...

749
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:48,062
...why there's a very beautiful,
naked girl in our kitchen.

750
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,224
- Well?
- Well...

751
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:56,529
I'm Deacon's girlfriend, Ashley.

752
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,174
- His girlfriend.
- His girlfriend?

753
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,072
- Yeah.
- Yeah, my girlfriend.

754
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,645
Well, what are you doing
in my kitchen...

755
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,146
...without any clothes on?

756
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,580
Oh, well, we were having
a make-out party.

757
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:11,448
Make-out party?

758
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,453
That's great, where's the other girls?

759
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,022
Oh, their...

760
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,487
...dates stood them up.

761
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:22,826
Yeah, theirs did, mine didn't, man.
Mine got sick, she had to go home.

762
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,400
Mine has mono from
too much making out with me.

763
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:30,033
- What's that smell?
- We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis.

764
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,638
I tipped over a candle.

765
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,572
It was to set the right mood.

766
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,077
- A fire?
- Oh, no, Dad.

767
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,148
Allow me to take responsibility.
I'd feel better that way.

768
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,579
We can... We can pay for it.

769
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,085
I am really sorry, Ashley.
I just didn't know he had a girlfriend.

770
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,847
Would you like to stay for dinner?

771
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,925
- Oh, no, no. Ashley has this...
- Okay.

772
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,251
Great, I'm Art.

773
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,292
Okay, okay. Do you have a shirt?

774
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,457
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes, she's got this robe.

775
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, she's got a shirt in here.

776
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,799
Kids.

777
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,908
So get this,
Johnson comes in and he's like:

778
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,874
"Where are the MB-90s?"
I'm like, "You gotta be kidding me.

779
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:12,311
We discontinued the MB-90s,
like, six months ago."

780
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,177
And they think he's the genius.

781
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,216
Johnson sounds
like a complete moron.

782
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,478
Exactly.

783
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,987
Ashley, I have
a personal question for you.

784
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,456
Exactly how old are you?

785
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:29,722
Well, I'm 19,
but I tell people I'm 18, right?

786
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:34,363
Eighteen, I... Isn't that funny?

787
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,836
I've got it, I've got it.
Don't worry, don't worry.

788
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,474
More sausage, Art?

789
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,611
I'm on a diet. Put that down, son,
before you hurt yourself.

790
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,781
- What are you doing here?
- I thought I'd come by and say hi.

791
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,078
Maybe we could hang out
in your bedroom.

792
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,982
Oh, God, now's not a good time.

793
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,919
- What's wrong?
- Well, nothing. Nothing at all.

794
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,994
- It's just... Let me talk to you later?
- Deacon?

795
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:03,326
- Who is it?
- Hi, Mrs. Lewis, I'm Naomi.

796
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,766
- This is Naomi, and she's my good...
- Girlfriend.

797
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,202
- His girlfriend?
- Deacon has two girlfriends?

798
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,937
- I'm gonna break your other arm, Max.
- What do you mean?

799
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,605
Deacon's other girlfriend
is having dinner with us.

800
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,410
Oh, God, I can explain.

801
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:25,282
Naomi, this is
Deacon's other girlfriend, Ashley.

802
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,946
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

803
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,559
How old are you, you slut?

804
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:32,884
Eighteen.

805
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,323
I thought you were a nice guy.

806
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,644
Hey, hey, let her go.

807
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,077
Let her go? Are you insane?

808
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,546
That's Naomi Feldman.

809
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,686
I've been fantasizing about her
since I was in the seventh grade.

810
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,583
Well, fantasy and reality
are two different things, Deacon.

811
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,486
Don't fall in love with her
because of who you think she is.

812
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:06,459
Make sure you fall in love
with the... Like, the real deal.

813
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,498
- All right. So, what should I do?
- Whatever.

814
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,637
So she's a porno actress
in your porno film...

815
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,708
...and she pretended
to be your girlfriend...

816
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:23,471
...because she ran upstairs naked
because the light caused a fire...

817
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,946
...and you've never had sex with her
and you've never kissed her?

818
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,284
Yeah. Pretty much.

819
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,652
So I guess this means
you're not my girlfriend anymore.

820
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,492
Not necessarily.

821
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,595
I wanna come to set tomorrow.

822
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,533
No, no, no.

823
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:48,330
Why not? I'm curious.
I wanna see what this porno looks like.

824
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,769
I'm sorry, but you can't.
There's just no way.

825
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,272
Matt and Fred will kill me.

826
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,307
I'm not supposed to be
telling anyone.

827
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,845
Just tell them I'm creative consultant
for the female point of view.

828
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,772
No offense...

829
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,010
...but the female point of view
doesn't matter in these movies.

830
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,593
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

831
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,333
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

832
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,197
- All right, everybody.
- Hey, Vic, you gotta see this.

833
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,499
This After School Special shit
is amazing.

834
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:30,210
They get a ton of hits
with their stupid stories...

835
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,143
...and they don't even have
any product.

836
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,510
It's the same guys
from the Pretty Kitty?

837
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,083
It's the same guys.

838
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,981
Bingo, I just found out
where they live.

839
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:44,258
- Give me their address.
- What are you gonna do?

840
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,891
Give me the address.

841
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,025
I'm gonna teach those assholes...

842
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,398
...something about
the adult-film business.

843
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,997
Goddamn amateurs.

844
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,269
- Think they can screw Vic Ramalot?
- Are you ready?

845
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,309
- I'm ready.
- We gonna do this?

846
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,380
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

847
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,893
Hello.

848
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,556
Is you Greitzer?

849
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,964
Yes, that's me.

850
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,239
Ronald J. Greitzer?

851
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,706
Actually, it's "Ronald," but yes.

852
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,811
I get it. Brilliant.

853
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:37,947
You ain't even a goddamn kid,
are you?

854
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,878
Get in the house!
Come on!

855
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,544
What are you doing?

856
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,051
What am I doing?

857
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,282
I'm putting you in retirement from
the porno business for good, hear?

858
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,653
- Yes.
- No more school-girl fantasies.

859
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,827
No more goddamn pornos
by virgins, for virgins, you got me?

860
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,899
- Please don't hurt my husband.
- What..?

861
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,832
I'm sorry, I'll never rent them again.

862
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,234
It was only that time
my wife was at her sister's.

863
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,668
Please, I promise.

864
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,604
You rented a dirty movie?

865
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,676
You told me it was <i>Jakob the Liar</i>.

866
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,678
What? I shouldn't be entitled to
a little joy in life?

867
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,316
Look at all the trouble
you've brought into this house.

868
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,810
Ronald, you are a pervert.

869
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,717
Excuse us.

870
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,456
- I don't think that was him.
- What the hell was that?

871
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,594
I'm sorry, that was the address
on the site.

872
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,128
- A bunch of 9-year-old girls in there.
- I know. I'm sorry, Vic, I'm sorry.

873
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,528
Jesus. You see that cake?

874
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,327
- It was a good cake.
- It looked good.

875
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:34,470
Was it ice cream?
Chocolate ice cream cake?

876
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,162
- Let's get one.
- All right.

877
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,172
It's super easy. Camera right is left,
and camera left is right.

878
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,606
There's a line that we can't cross,
you understand?

879
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,609
We can't cross the line.

880
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,180
What is she doing here?

881
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,612
Naomi is my girlfriend.

882
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:56,453
- Excuse me. Can I talk to you?
- Yes, Fred.

883
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,025
Fred, Fred, Fred.

884
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,957
Naomi can give
a female point of view...

885
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,224
Shut up. What are you doing?

886
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,662
Didn't you see
that Beatles documentary?

887
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:09,100
You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us.

888
00:55:09,272 --> 00:55:11,433
A what?

889
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,104
All right, fine.

890
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:17,110
You know what?
I'm sorry I said anything.

891
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,113
I'm sure it's gonna be great, all right?
Let's just get started.

892
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,377
She's gonna be really helpful.

893
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,396
- Well, hey, Naomi.
- Hey, Coop.

894
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,725
- What, are you helping these guys out?
- Sort of.

895
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,266
- Okay, people. Places, everybody.
<i>- What the fuck?</i>

896
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:44,271
Let's try to do this
with a little feeling, okay?

897
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,870
Hey, Coop.

898
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,874
And action.

899
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,280
This quadratic equation is so hard.

900
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:06,191
Maybe we should just stick
to the long division.

901
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,897
Cut. This is all wrong.

902
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,632
She would not be fantasizing
about some geek.

903
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,606
He's not a geek,
he's the Math Team captain.

904
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,770
No, he should
be really well-dressed.

905
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,543
And maybe he's a foreign-exchange
student from Portugal.

906
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,381
Okay, nobody told you this,
so it's not a big deal...

907
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,546
...but nobody calls "cut" but me!

908
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,255
Who cares, Naomi?

909
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:39,089
Deacon agrees with me.

910
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:42,254
Guys, can we get this done today?
My balls are freezing.

911
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,332
Shut up, Coop, this is important.

912
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,401
- Oh, and my balls aren't?
- Jesus.

913
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,093
- Jesus.
- God.

914
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,432
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
- I think you broke my nose.

915
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,235
- I'm sorry, baby.
- You know what? This is ridiculous.

916
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,174
I mean, who does a dress rehearsal
for a porno, anyway?

917
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,247
Sure. Why don't we just throw
the script out while we're at it...

918
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,440
...and improvise.

919
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,442
Guys, I appreciate this.

920
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,713
I appreciate getting money
for doing absolutely nothing.

921
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:09,825
But this is my career,
and I have no footage for my reel.

922
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,427
Whatever.

923
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,460
- Ashley, listen...
- I'll kill you, Deacon.

924
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,462
- Baby.
- Don't forget your pom-poms.

925
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,624
- Ashley, hold on.
- Where are you going?

926
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,033
- Come here, Ashley.
- Where are you going? Come on.

927
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,732
Oh, great. That is just great.

928
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,968
What do we do now, huh, Deacon?

929
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:32,547
- Your girlfriend ruined everything.
- Wait a second here.

930
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:34,512
If you guys knew anything
about women...

931
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,311
...we wouldn't have this problem.

932
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:38,681
- But you don't.
- Who asked you?

933
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,482
Whatever. I'm out of here.

934
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,854
- Come on, Deacon.
- Yeah. Get out of here.

935
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:48,293
- Leave already. Go!
- Are you coming, Deacon?

936
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,467
Okay, here we are.

937
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,129
Wait a sec. What are we doing here?

938
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,503
Oh, I thought you might want
some new clothes.

939
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,501
I really don't need new clothes.

940
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,309
I gotta meet up with Matt and Fred.
I already blew them off yesterday.

941
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,385
Deacon, you don't have to hang out
with those boys anymore.

942
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

943
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,683
I just thought we could
spend the day together.

944
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,319
What about Matt and Fred?

945
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,927
What about me?

946
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:35,902
What are you wearing?

947
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,274
I'm wearing a sweater. Why?

948
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,048
- Matt and I have been talking.
- Okay.

949
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,019
We wanna make this movie.

950
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,190
Yeah, dude, obviously. So do I.

951
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,489
No, Deacon.

952
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,721
We wanna make this movie
we wrote...

953
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:56,661
...without you.

954
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,362
I know what this is about.
It's about Naomi.

955
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,063
By virgins, for virgins, remember?

956
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,107
As soon as you got what you wanted,
you blew us off.

957
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,603
Come on, man.
You don't understand.

958
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,105
Do you even like her?

959
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,318
Fine. Do it without me.

960
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,892
Fine.

961
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,727
Fine.

962
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,639
Deacon.

963
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,910
Rachael?

964
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,374
- How are you?
- Good, good.

965
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,243
How was France?

966
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,612
It was so fun.
We just got back yesterday.

967
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,651
The school totally screwed up
my schedule.

968
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,653
How's John Baldwin?

969
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:02,696
Who told you about that?

970
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,992
Everyone knows.

971
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,136
Everyone's a liar.

972
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,268
I didn't do it with John Baldwin.

973
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,003
You didn't?

974
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,874
It's not like how it was with us.

975
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,698
<i>But as soon as you got what</i>
<i>you wanted, you blew us off.</i>

976
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,670
<i>Do you even like her?</i>

977
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,967
<i>It's not like how it was with us.</i>

978
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,805
I don't know, sometimes I feel like...

979
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,145
...the whole world is just passing us by
and we're just sitting still.

980
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,146
And like...

981
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,514
I don't know.

982
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,225
Anyway, I'm sorry.

983
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:11,658
Well, you know,
you can be a real dick sometimes.

984
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,911
All right, so now what?
Do we make this thing?

985
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:27,674
I don't know.

986
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,876
- Maybe we should just call it quits.
- Hey, guys.

987
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,516
Oh, Ash, hey.
What are you doing here?

988
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,919
I need you.

989
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,084
What?

990
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:41,060
I need you to make this movie.

991
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,527
For my reel.

992
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,067
Well, actually, we were just
talking about...

993
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,666
You have an eyelash, Deacon.

994
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,070
Make a wish.

995
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,915
<i>Testosterone is a drug</i>
<i>more powerful than heroin.</i>

996
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,419
<i>And girls know it.</i>

997
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,216
<i>They use our obsession</i>
<i>against us...</i>

998
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,554
<i>... to get flowers and class rings</i>
<i>and commitments.</i>

999
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,425
<i>And in Ashley's case,</i>
<i>full-length adult videos.</i>

1000
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:18,931
<i>But, come on, if she hadn't</i>
<i>come back, we could have stopped.</i>

1001
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,195
<i>But we were weak.</i>

1002
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:25,571
<i>At that moment, if Ashley would've</i>
<i>asked us to jump off a bridge...</i>

1003
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,371
<i>... as I'm sure you can guess,</i>
<i>we would have done it.</i>

1004
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,140
<i>We had to finish the film.</i>

1005
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,051
So I've been thinking about
getting into films.

1006
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,689
Any tips on how I can break in?

1007
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,952
Not really. Acting classes, I guess.

1008
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,790
Really? I didn't think
there was much...

1009
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,592
...you know,
acting in those sorts of films.

1010
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,130
I guess it kind of depends.

1011
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:56,967
So you think you can get me
an audition?

1012
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:59,204
For what?

1013
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,605
How long have I been
cutting your hair?

1014
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,439
I don't know. Since I was like 8.

1015
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,915
I know who you are.

1016
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,251
Don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

1017
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:17,189
Come on. I just wanna
just make one film.

1018
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,954
You know, just to see what it's like.

1019
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,828
That's great,
but how can I help you?

1020
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,629
I get it.

1021
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:31,968
You do for me, if I do for you.

1022
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,110
That's how it works. Okay.

1023
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,189
This is it.

1024
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,564
This is the magic hour.

1025
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:33,963
The high school prom.

1026
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,432
But let's remember
what's really important:

1027
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,042
The transition of the moment.

1028
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,144
Like, we've all, you know,
for instance...

1029
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,338
...we've all read <i>The Metamorphosis</i>
by Franz Kafka.

1030
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,642
Yeah, dude, my mom has that book.

1031
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:51,849
Let's see that, up here and in here.

1032
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,689
Action.

1033
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:00,593
Ira, I have something to tell you.

1034
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:02,025
What is it?

1035
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,428
This prom is making me so hot.

1036
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,068
I think I'm ready to lose my virginity
to you tonight.

1037
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,965
- Action.
- Oh, Ira.

1038
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:10,995
I...

1039
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:23,317
Guys, this is like Nickelodeon
with penises and vaginas.

1040
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,078
- Did I sound stupid?
- It was great.

1041
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,087
- Let's just get naked and get it on.
- Okay.

1042
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,491
Round two.

1043
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:34,728
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1044
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,763
Action. More like an animal,
like an animal.

1045
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:43,870
Okay, all right, next setup.

1046
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,269
My dress is ruined.
Is that okay?

1047
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,413
What are we going to do now?

1048
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,308
Oh, yeah.

1049
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,511
I'm going... I'm going hand-held.

1050
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,489
Oh, it's so good.

1051
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,058
Oh, just like that.

1052
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,024
Oh, good. Oh, yeah.

1053
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,561
What are you doing?

1054
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,632
It's a basic rule of porno,
you gotta be sweaty.

1055
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,668
And action!

1056
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,200
What?

1057
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:20,001
But, teacher, I...

1058
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:21,837
Hold on.

1059
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:24,340
- It was a queef.
- Are you..?

1060
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,481
- She queefed.
- That's disgusting.

1061
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,210
I had the shrimp salad last night, man,
and, look, I told my mom...

1062
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:33,082
- Are you just about done?
- Yes.

1063
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,483
Pick up where we left off.

1064
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,750
- That's what I'm saying.
- Action.

1065
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:42,022
- Oh, my God.
- Warn us next time.

1066
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,665
You know, this ain't easy, dude.

1067
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,234
I got people I don't even know
bouncing up and down on my stomach.

1068
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,836
You know what? Lunch.

1069
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,939
We're over schedule,
we're overbudget...

1070
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,773
...so put everything aside.

1071
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,206
We take that fine bridgework
of gossamer and silk.

1072
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:57,505
No questions?
All right. Let's do this.

1073
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:02,850
And action!

1074
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,047
Vic, here you go.
About your account...

1075
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,710
- Talk to Mike.
- No, it's good. Have a good day.

1076
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,357
Dave, a kid on the phone
wants to set up a new account.

1077
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:44,516
- For what?
- After School Special.

1078
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,024
I'll get you a form.

1079
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,423
What did you say?

1080
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,496
Well, no, this is for
another customer.

1081
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,359
- Did you say "After School Special"?
- Yeah.

1082
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:57,005
I'm gonna get some pasta,
some sauce, some cheese...

1083
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,607
...put it in there,
mix it with these bastards' nuts...

1084
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,470
...and make balls lasagna.

1085
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,608
- So?
- How does it look?

1086
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:13,383
Well, I cut together some footage
to give to Ashley for her reel...

1087
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,281
...but I don't think I can
finish this movie.

1088
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,587
- Why not?
- I can't even watch it.

1089
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,528
Every time I turn it on, all I can think
about is Coop farting all day long.

1090
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:25,599
- That was pretty gross.
- That's just it.

1091
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,794
The movie looks great,
but seeing all that other stuff...

1092
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,599
...all that disgusting, nasty stuff...

1093
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,765
...that's what's taking all the fun
out of it.

1094
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,877
And I just...
I don't wanna do it anymore.

1095
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:38,707
Great. I knew it.

1096
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,314
I knew you couldn't handle this.

1097
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:42,314
- Take it easy, Fred.
- No, shut up, Deacon.

1098
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:46,512
I knew, when it came down to it,
Matt would wuss out.

1099
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,783
You know what? Fuck you, Fred.
You're the wuss here.

1100
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,621
At least I don't whack off
when I see a girl in the hallway.

1101
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,194
- Shut up, man.
- No, you shut up.

1102
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,332
For once in your life, be a man
and admit this movie was a mistake.

1103
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,627
- Hey, why don't you make me, huh?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1104
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,292
Matt's right.

1105
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,835
This movie was a mistake.

1106
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,906
What are you talking about?
This whole thing was your idea.

1107
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:12,241
If you didn't like making the movie,
why didn't you just say something?

1108
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,448
I don't know. I thought you guys
were having fun.

1109
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,051
I didn't wanna be the wuss.

1110
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,088
<i>We convinced Matt to finish</i>
<i>the movie. We had orders to fill.</i>

1111
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:24,021
<i>But after that,</i>
<i>we promised ourselves...</i>

1112
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,991
<i>... we'd shut down the website</i>
<i>and get out of the porn business.</i>

1113
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,529
<i>We weren't gonna let life</i>
<i>pass us by anymore.</i>

1114
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,258
<i>So we did what any self-respecting</i>
<i>teenager would do.</i>

1115
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:33,526
<i>We threw a bitchen party!</i>

1116
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,060
- Hey, guys.
- Ashley.

1117
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,672
- Hi, how's it going?
- What's up?

1118
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,743
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Ashley.

1119
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,709
This is such a great party.

1120
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,644
- Well, thank you.
- I have the biggest news.

1121
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,613
So I sent my reel to Vivid...

1122
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:54,722
...and they wanna fly me and Coop
to L.A. To talk about a contract.

1123
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,289
Get out of here.

1124
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,619
- I know.
- Hey, congratulations.

1125
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,227
Thank you, sweetheart.

1126
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,796
- Deacon, we need more ice.
- Hey, that's me.

1127
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,195
- Hey, I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

1128
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,767
So, what's going on, guys?

1129
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,537
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

1130
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:17,312
He wanted to know, actually,
if we'd ever get girlfriends.

1131
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:23,111
In a couple of years, girls are gonna
be dying to meet guys like you.

1132
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,419
- I told you.
- Yo, Fred, Matt.

1133
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:30,585
Hey, guys. Great party.

1134
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,729
Yeah.

1135
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:38,600
- God, you're looking good.
- Hey, hey.

1136
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,595
He looks great.

1137
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,498
We should have put
my picture up there.

1138
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:46,539
- Or mine.
- What's he got in those pants?

1139
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,413
How's Naomi?

1140
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,249
I don't know. Good, I guess.

1141
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,188
I thought she was your fantasy girl.

1142
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:02,449
Yeah, she was.

1143
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,957
But I don't know,
at the same time...

1144
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:07,755
...it wasn't like it was
with Rachael and I.

1145
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,660
- We connected.
- You're gonna dump her.

1146
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,098
You're breaking up with me?

1147
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,171
Can we still have sex?

1148
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,711
Naomi, listen.
Listen to what I'm saying.

1149
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,279
Deacon, the only reason
I went out with you...

1150
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,712
...is because I thought
you were a nice guy.

1151
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,682
And now you wanna
break up with me?

1152
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:33,452
Yeah, I guess so.

1153
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,854
- If you tell anybody about this...
- I won't.

1154
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,391
I have a reputation.

1155
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:42,024
Jeez, you can tell people
you dumped me if you want.

1156
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:45,724
- Really?
- Sure, what do I care.

1157
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,529
You are a nice guy.

1158
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:57,942
Just do me a favor and don't tell
anyone about the movies, all right?

1159
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:00,513
Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen.

1160
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,743
These sick little shits right here...

1161
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:08,020
...are pornographers, man.

1162
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,021
No, they're perverts, right, Deacon?

1163
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:14,288
They make porno movies
in their basements.

1164
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,796
Jake, you better give it a rest, buddy,
because no one's listening to you.

1165
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,593
Oh, really?

1166
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,035
Shit-pants.

1167
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:26,765
You know what? I bet I know
someone who might believe me.

1168
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,573
Your parents.

1169
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,673
The website's in
someone else's name.

1170
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,749
All of our files are encrypted.
There's nothing tracing it to us.

1171
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,011
Well, I guess it's a good thing...

1172
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:43,318
...that I took the tape of Ashley
masturbating in your basement, huh?

1173
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,428
Once your parents see
what kind of sick little movies...

1174
01:12:47,596 --> 01:12:51,623
...their good boy Deacon's making,
they might be kind of mad.

1175
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,300
- Did you make copies of that tape?
- Hell, no.

1176
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:00,707
So you sent the original tape
to my parents?

1177
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,439
Yup.

1178
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,745
- Hey, Jake.
- What's up?

1179
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,718
You're a real dick.

1180
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,224
You should probably avoid
pissing her off.

1181
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,157
Noted.

1182
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,591
Guys, we got a problem.

1183
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:36,411
Not so... Not so fast, ladies.

1184
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,241
Which one of youse is
Balls McLongcock?

1185
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,816
- Nice name.
- Thanks.

1186
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,415
Too bad you're not gonna be able
to use it anymore.

1187
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,719
- Who the hell are you, man?
- Who the hell am I?

1188
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,955
I'm the competition.
Who the hell are youse?

1189
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,621
Come in to my town?

1190
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,700
Pay the ladies
twice what I pay them?

1191
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:05,539
This After School Special bullshit
is cutting into my business.

1192
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:11,543
So now I'm gonna put youse
out of business.

1193
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,605
Get in the car!

1194
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,547
<i>So here we are back at the beginning,</i>
<i>hanging from meat hooks.</i>

1195
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,448
<i>But now we were boys</i>
<i>who'd become men...</i>

1196
01:14:19,621 --> 01:14:22,556
<i>... and real men just</i>
<i>don't scare that easy.</i>

1197
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,323
- Anything but my balls!
- Start with this one.

1198
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:32,456
Me? Why me?
It was all Deacon's idea.

1199
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,363
First I'm gonna kill you!

1200
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:38,336
No, no, no. Do Deacon.
Please, it was all his idea.

1201
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,304
Even better.

1202
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,239
Let's get the leader.

1203
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:51,418
Quit squirming, kid.
It hurts worse when you struggle.

1204
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,920
We've got preorders!

1205
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,820
- What?
- We presold copies of our video.

1206
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,189
How many, 50? A hundred?

1207
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,993
63,212.

1208
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,438
- That's a lot of product, Vic.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1209
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:15,407
We got orders from all over the world.
I swear, all over the world.

1210
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:18,603
We'll give you the website
if you let us go.

1211
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,407
Cut them down.

1212
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:30,458
- So, what's your cut?
- Absolutely nothing.

1213
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,617
- Except...
- What except? There's no except!

1214
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:38,255
Except you promise to supply us
with quality porn...

1215
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:39,900
...free of charge.

1216
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,602
It could come in handy, I mean...

1217
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:45,030
...until we get girlfriends.

1218
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,072
- And...
- What? No, Matt!

1219
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:50,939
And you promise to maintain the
vision of After School Special.

1220
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,911
And what, pray tell, might that be?

1221
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,043
The key is...

1222
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,676
...to try to remember what it was like
before you had sex.

1223
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,516
What did you used
to fantasize about?

1224
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:05,421
A math teacher who bends over
a little too far?

1225
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:09,663
The door of the girl's locker room
open just a sliver?

1226
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,527
Going over to your friend's house
and catching his mom...

1227
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,896
...walking out of the shower?
- Dude!

1228
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:20,097
- Not you, Deacon's mom.
- Oh, have I been there.

1229
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:23,870
- Guys!
- All right, deal.

1230
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,645
I'm gonna need those master tapes.

1231
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:30,342
Kid, you ever need a job,
give me a call.

1232
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,885
Come on, come on, come on.

1233
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,783
Thanks, Mr?

1234
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,926
Ramalot.

1235
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,822
Vic Ramalot.

1236
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,320
- Good name.
- Thanks.

1237
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,802
- Vic, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1238
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,303
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Come on.

1239
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,600
It's me. What's the matter?

1240
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,801
That damn kid.

1241
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,741
He reminded me...

1242
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,972
...of the way I was
when I was his age.

1243
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:13,955
Vic, come here.
Let it out. Let it out.

1244
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:18,590
Come on, you okay?

1245
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:21,167
Yeah, yeah.
I'm good, I'm good. Thanks.

1246
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:25,063
- You hungry?
- I could eat.

1247
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,832
- Grab a bite?
- Yeah.

1248
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,876
Honey, did you go through
the mail today?

1249
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,075
Not yet.

1250
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:34,511
I'll go get it.

1251
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,624
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- It's a minivan, Fred.

1252
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,418
It won't go any faster.

1253
01:17:45,227 --> 01:17:47,092
Come on, you drive like my grandma.

1254
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:56,999
What are you doing?
We don't got time...

1255
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,834
Stop sign, man. I'm not about
to lose my license over this.

1256
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,813
Looking for something
in the mail, Deacon?

1257
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,150
No. I just...

1258
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:49,984
Maybe something you didn't
want us to see?

1259
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,457
Mom, Dad...

1260
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:55,960
- It's too late, Deacon.
- If you'd just wait a sec...

1261
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:59,328
We just want you to know how
deeply disappointed we are in you.

1262
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,867
- I can explain.
- You can explain?

1263
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,407
Well, explain it to me,
son, explain it.

1264
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,845
Believe...
If you just give me a chance...

1265
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,777
How in the hell can you ever
explain this!

1266
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,445
How did you manage
to get a C in biology?

1267
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:21,111
You are a straight-A student, boy.

1268
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,553
I knew we shouldn't have let him
have a girlfriend.

1269
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,022
Let alone two.

1270
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,461
Is that what this is about?

1271
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:30,393
My biology class?

1272
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:33,399
Mom, Dad...

1273
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:35,627
...l'm 17.

1274
01:19:36,404 --> 01:19:38,929
I'm driving, I got a girlfriend.

1275
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,970
But the fact is, you guys treat me
as if I'm a little kid.

1276
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:46,706
Is it too much to ask for to be
a normal teenager with a normal life?

1277
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,077
I don't like your tone, son.

1278
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,009
I just wanna have fun
with my friends.

1279
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,848
Okay?

1280
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,050
Okay, then.

1281
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:02,657
But make sure we don't get
a repeat performance in the finals.

1282
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,731
I won't.

1283
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,967
- What's up?
- What's going on?

1284
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,972
They don't have it.

1285
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,268
But neither do I.

1286
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:19,003
- We don't have it.
- I don't know.

1287
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,945
- Don't just stand there all the time.
- What are we gonna do?

1288
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,584
Your parents are right there.

1289
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,291
How much do you know?

1290
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,985
Pretty much everything, Mr. Slam.

1291
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,755
These are my demands.

1292
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,972
Done.

1293
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,546
- Did you know all along?
- Are you kidding?

1294
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:57,082
Who do you think made
the first preorder?

1295
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:07,120
Little bastard.

1296
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,067
So, what do we do with this?

1297
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:17,933
I have an idea.

1298
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,880
You meet me right here, after school.

1299
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,984
So I guess we all got
what we deserved, huh?

1300
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:34,144
No money, no power, no women.

1301
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,514
Tony Montana would be pissed.

1302
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,918
Speak for yourselves, guys.

1303
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,789
<i>I don't know if we got</i>
<i>what we deserved or not.</i>

1304
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:45,694
<i>Okay, probably not.</i>

1305
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,893
<i>But Rachael dumped that guy</i>
<i>and we got back together.</i>

1306
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,972
<i>We haven't had sex yet,</i>
<i>but somehow I'm okay with that.</i>

1307
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:56,110
<i>You know, I don't think I wanna</i>
<i>rush it this time.</i>

1308
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,736
<i>And even though we kept quiet</i>
<i>about the film, word got around.</i>

1309
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,510
<i>And just like Coop said,</i>
<i>we became legends of the school.</i>

1310
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,552
<i>And Fred finally learned</i>
<i>how to talk to a girl.</i>

1311
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:10,680
Hey, Fred. I hear you know a thing
or two about giving a woman pleasure.

1312
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:15,687
No, I don't.

1313
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:26,071
Matt knows a thing or two
about giving women pleasure.

1314
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,569
I know everything.

1315
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:35,539
We should go out sometime.

1316
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:39,176
I knew you'd come around.

1317
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,219
Maybe all four of us could go out.

1318
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:47,855
Yeah. That could work, you know,
depending on my schedule.

1319
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:53,800
- So call me?
- Oh, most definitely.

1320
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,960
- Cool.
- Later.

1321
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,300
Ladies, ladies.
What's up? All right.

1322
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,039
- See you.
- Bye.

1323
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,343
Watch where you're going, sphincter.

1324
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,642
I thought I told you
not to call me that anymore.

1325
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,584
That's right. I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

1326
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,890
Some people just never learn.

1327
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,386
You know...

1328
01:23:21,629 --> 01:23:24,757
...you really shouldn't have
mailed that tape back to us.

1329
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:28,836
<i>- Attention, Wallies</i>.
- What's that?

1330
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,206
What is that, guys?

1331
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:36,367
<i>I got a problem</i>.

1332
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:37,738
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

1333
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:40,642
- For real, what was that?
<i>- I got a problem</i>.

1334
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:44,148
- What was that?
<i>- I've got a tiny, tiny, tiny pee-pee.</i>

1335
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,617
<i>Problem. She...</i>

1336
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,126
<i>I got a problem.</i>
<i>I got a tiny pee-pee.</i>

1337
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:53,783
<i>I never wanted it.</i>

1338
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:56,487
<i>Tiny, tiny, tiny pee-pee, pee-pee.</i>

1339
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,757
Jake's a premature ejaculator.

1340
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:05,036
People, premature ejaculation
is nothing to laugh at.

1341
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,140
I'm gonna get you for this,
you little shit.

1342
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:09,003
<i>It's like I said in the beginning:</i>

1343
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,169
<i>In high school, everyone's got</i>
<i>that one magic moment.</i>

1344
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:15,011
<i>For us, this was it.</i>

1345
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:18,311
Don't ever say Vic Ramalot
never gave you nothing.

1346
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,579
Thanks, Mr. Ramalot.

1347
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,986
- Let's hit a drive-through.
- I could eat.

1348
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:53,015
<i>Oh, that's so good.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, that... Just like that.</i>

1349
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:58,182
<i>That's it. Oh, just like that.</i>
<i>That's it. Oh, yeah.</i>

1350
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:01,328
Boy, why do they always have
to show the guys' faces?

1351
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:05,698
Oh, you know, it's so that guys will
think they can get girls as hot as her.

1352
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:09,325
- It's the basic rule of porno.
- That's true.

1353
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,640
Oh, my God!

1354
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:14,772
Is that our basement?
