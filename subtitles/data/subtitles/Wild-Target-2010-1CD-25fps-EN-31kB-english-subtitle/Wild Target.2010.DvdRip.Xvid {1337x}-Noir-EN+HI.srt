330
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:34,717
Trust me?

331
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:39,277
What happened here was not random.

332
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:41,398
His boss wants me dead.

333
00:23:41,478 --> 00:23:43,878
I only hope it's quick
when it happens, you know?

334
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,078
Like with him, I mean...

335
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,919
I mean, I almost wish that it would
just happen now, you know?

336
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,638
So I wouldn't...

337
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,959
So I wouldn't have to
keep wondering when...

338
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:57,800
Oh, God.

339
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,399
-I need to pee.
-Right.

340
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,000
-Right.
-I think it's just nerves.

341
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:08,560
Do you have a tissue?

342
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:20,043
Ooh, silk. Nice.

343
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:30,203
Here you go.

344
00:24:32,766 --> 00:24:34,284
Um...

345
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:38,124
Oh, God, they can't kill me
for less than a million!

346
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:41,286
I mean, it's nothing to them, you know?
And I didn't hurt anyone.

347
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:44,765
I mean,
why do people have to be so gullible?

348
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,967
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?!

349
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:58,527
I need protection!
You know how to shoot!

350
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:01,007
I can--I can pay you.

351
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:03,129
I can give you a down payment
right now!

352
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:06,448
And there's loads more in my bag.
Please? Please?

353
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,168
It's no good.
I can't help you.

354
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,170
But you can't abandon me like this.

355
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,809
I mean, you're--
you're too kind for that.

356
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,730
Please, I'm begging you.

357
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:19,771
I'm sorry, I'm in no position
to protect you, believe me.

358
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,570
I feel safe with you.

359
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,452
You're wise and calm and steady.

360
00:25:25,532 --> 00:25:28,451
You're like a mighty ancient oak.

361
00:25:51,055 --> 00:25:53,213
Half now. Half later.

362
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:03,176
Do you want me to drive?
You seem a little--

363
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:04,256
I'm upset.

364
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:07,895
These are in the way.

365
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:09,777
You stole his boots?

366
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,137
He doesn't need them anymore,
does he?

367
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:12,536
Shit!

368
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:14,257
(HORNS HONKING)

369
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,418
How come you have a gun?

370
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:18,938
Oh--that's--that's for work.

371
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,058
What work?

372
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,417
I'm an undercover private detective.

373
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:26,818
You just don't look like the type.
What were you doing in here?

374
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,419
I was watching a client's wife.

375
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,020
She had a tryst in a--in--
with a man in a car on the fifth floor.

376
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:35,819
(LAUGHS) A tryst?

377
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,621
I've given you a down payment.
How much for the week?

378
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,940
A week?
I'm too expensive.

379
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:44,381
-How much?
-30 thousand.

380
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,982
All right, 30 thou.
I'm gonna get out of here.

381
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,902
I want round-the-clock protection.

382
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:51,621
I'm sorry, no.

383
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:55,223
Get down!

384
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:58,142
-Quick! Back up, run him over!
-You must be kidding!

385
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,943
Agh! Ow!

386
00:27:02,785 --> 00:27:04,263
-Hang on!
-He's fine!

387
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:06,825
What are you doing?!Get in!

388
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:09,985
Get in!Get in!

389
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:12,225
I can't see!

390
00:27:13,706 --> 00:27:15,225
I just saved your life!
You almost killed me!

391
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:17,705
So we're quits. Oh shit! Shit!

392
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:18,705
-Floor it!
-What?!

393
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:20,505
Now!!

394
00:27:24,787 --> 00:27:25,546
Oh, my god!

395
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:30,828
Where now?

396
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:32,747
Third street on the right.
We'll get across town.

397
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:35,587
-Well, then what?
-A discreet hotel. We need to lie low.

398
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:43,229
Discreet?
How about ridiculously overpriced?

399
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,990
They'll be checking the cheaper hotels.
No one will look for us here.

400
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:52,630
Three...

401
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:56,230
Three rooms, please.

402
00:27:56,312 --> 00:27:58,391
Of course, sir.
What name?

403
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:02,151
Smith.

404
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:05,032
You have the same name?

405
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:07,392
-And your name, sir?
-Tony.

406
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,272
We'll just take the one room.

407
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:12,232
Excuse me.

408
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:13,872
What? Ow.

409
00:28:15,114 --> 00:28:17,273
-You can't be serious.
-Who's paying for this?

410
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:19,553
-You said you had plenty of money.
-Yeah, and I mean to keep it that way.

411
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,914
I'm sorry, I really can't sleep
in a r¤om with someone else.

412
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:23,434
Well, I can't imagine
you get many requests.

413
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:26,154
-I'll pay for my own room.
-It's not about the money, all right?

414
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:27,955
Round-the-clock protection, we said.

415
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:29,635
How are you going to protect me
from another room? No.

416
00:28:29,716 --> 00:28:32,395
-Wait!
-No. One room. One room's fine.

417
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:36,676
Why don't you settle this in 322?
It's one of our cheapest.

418
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,836
Are you sure this is a safe place?

419
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:41,516
Of course I'm sure.
I leave nothing to chance.

420
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,757
-Ah, Laetitia.
-Good morning, boss.

421
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:48,116
-Have you seen Mike?
-Sorry, Mr. Ferguson, no.

422
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,838
(SIGHS) Where is he?

423
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,159
-Thank you, sir.
-Mmm.

424
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,839
-May I say...
-Oh, here we go...

425
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,998
It would help ifyou could manage
to behave with a little more decorum.

426
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,079
Hey, they have cable.

427
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,760
Three adults in one room,
a miniscule room in a luxury hotel?

428
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,720
-So what?
-So you got us noticed!

429
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,920
COMMENTATOR:
Already the home team's defence
is looking rather nervous, Andy.

430
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,841
What do you think?

431
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:16,001
Tempers getting a bit out of control
in the early stages.

432
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,681
Outside coming forward again...

433
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:19,842
with killers after you,
you're discreet.

434
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:23,482
You hide.
You don't yell in hotel lobbies.

435
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:26,642
Oh, that's a beautiful move.

436
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,003
Putting together a few passes now.
That's it!

437
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:34,523
Oh, and he puts it wide!

438
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:37,204
My goodness,
he'll be kicking himself.

439
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:39,364
Which side do you sleep on?

440
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,604
What?

441
00:29:40,684 --> 00:29:43,325
I don't. I keep watch.

442
00:29:43,405 --> 00:29:46,084
Tony, you sleep with her.

443
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:47,724
Whatever.

444
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:51,405
While we're here,
please respect my living space.

445
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:54,766
This... is my area.

446
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,487
Time's just going to fly by,
I can tell.

447
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:59,246
Now just you change your tune,
young lady.

448
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:01,006
You were a lot less lippy
in the car-park,

449
00:30:01,087 --> 00:30:02,407
sobbing about ancient oaks.

450
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,647
-I didn't beg you to come, remember.
-I didn't beg.

451
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:06,768
Offering a man 30,000 pounds
to spend a week with you

452
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,407
is scarcely playing hard-to-get.

453
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,888
Incredible,
I have only known you for three hours,

454
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,608
and already it would take me
three days

455
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,968
to list everything
that I hate about you.

456
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:17,728
(CROWD CHEERlNG)

457
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,290
Oh dear, oh dear!
Six yards out.

458
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,129
Perhaps he should have done
betterthan that.

459
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,650
Are you sure you won't come?

460
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:34,650
It's been a long day.
I just want some peace and quiet.

461
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,011
(DOOR OPENS)

462
00:30:36,092 --> 00:30:38,251
I'll be in the bar.
Don't be long.

463
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:42,572
(GIGGLES)

464
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:46,332
One thing though, Mr. Smith.

465
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:49,172
-Yeah?
-Did I hear you say she's paying you?

466
00:30:49,254 --> 00:30:52,333
-You did.
-I haven't got any money.

467
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:54,775
Don't worry.
I'll look after you for free.

468
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,054
In fact...

469
00:30:58,335 --> 00:30:59,774
you can help me look after her.

470
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:02,014
Great, probably need
all the help you can get.

471
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:07,495
So I'll be your assistant?

472
00:31:08,975 --> 00:31:10,976
Apprentice.

473
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:17,376
You know, Tony,
you're a fine young man.

474
00:31:21,418 --> 00:31:22,656
Um...

475
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,258
That's all.

476
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,299
There you are.

477
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,458
I was wondering
what the two ofyou were up to.

478
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:44,940
I'm sorry, before,
I was unpleasant and--

479
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,341
and hostile even.

480
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:48,901
I'm not usually like that.

481
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:50,541
Oh, don't worry.

482
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:53,541
I was aggressive
and annoying and, um,

483
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:55,301
I'm quite often like that.

484
00:31:57,423 --> 00:31:59,822
No. You can be pleasant.

485
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:01,222
-Really?
-Yeah.

486
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,382
When?

487
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:06,622
I can't think
of an example right now but...

488
00:32:06,703 --> 00:32:08,143
Great. Thank you.

489
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:15,905
Now.
Now you're being pleasant.

490
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:20,024
You're not listening.

491
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,384
I am.

492
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,306
What were you were saying?

493
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:27,266
I was saying you were pleasant
then for seven or eight seconds.

494
00:32:27,346 --> 00:32:29,665
You're eyeing up the barman.

495
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:32,986
Yeah. He fancies me.
Is that bothering you?

496
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,226
As a matter offact.

497
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:36,907
Why? Do you fancy me?

498
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,227
-What?
-It's a simple enough question.

499
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:41,668
Of course not.
Not at all.

500
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:43,628
Okay, that's what I thought.

501
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:52,829
Do you fancy him?
Is that it?

502
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,989
No, it is not,
I would simply like you to listen

503
00:32:57,071 --> 00:32:58,309
ifwe're having a conversation,
that's all.

504
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:01,271
I couldn't care less ifyou have it away
with the barman,

505
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:03,510
the bellboy and all the other customers
ifyou want to.

506
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:06,031
-It's none of my business.
-You're unbelievable.

507
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:16,033
Hi, um, can I have a large Glenfiddich,
and a cognac,

508
00:33:16,113 --> 00:33:19,952
and a Belvedere, and a Becks,

509
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,873
and two small red wines
and some peanuts.

510
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:23,313
Not all for you.

511
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:26,913
No, the Becks is for you.
And my father will pay.

512
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,677
What do you weigh?

513
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:52,237
(SIGHS CONTENTEDLY)

514
00:33:57,438 --> 00:33:58,758
You know, Mike?

515
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:03,477
You are the only genuine one
in all this.

516
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,599
Genuine asshole.

517
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,839
It's not my fault.

518
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,799
Not your fault?

519
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,880
You said not to hire another hit man.
You said you'd handle it with Barney.

520
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,721
And now I'm left with one bodyguard.

521
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,080
The incompetent fat one.

522
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,841
Stop shaking.

523
00:34:24,922 --> 00:34:26,561
Oh, stop shaking!

524
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:31,042
Why are you shaking?
You think I'm angry with you, hm?

525
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:35,803
Do you think that I'm going to hit you?
Is that it?

526
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:38,243
It's funny.

527
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:42,602
Truth is, tonight I feel more like tears
than anger.

528
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:45,404
You understand we've lost her now.

529
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:51,524
The vixen will have gone to ground.

530
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:54,964
Our chances offinding her
are next to nil.

531
00:34:57,727 --> 00:35:01,286
No, tonight...

532
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,885
I am sad.

533
00:35:05,847 --> 00:35:07,126
You're sad, too.

534
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:16,647
I don't like to see sad people.
Go to the bathroom.

535
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,010
You just stay away from me.

536
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,409
You ruined my evening.

537
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,930
-Really.
-I was making friends.

538
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,891
You were making a spectacle of
yourself.

539
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:41,210
Do you have any friends, I wonder?
No, I can't imagine that you do.

540
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:46,251
Sorry.
Sorry, wrong room.

541
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:47,252
No problem.

542
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:57,053
Why are you always in the way?

543
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,374
-I fell asleep.
-That's all right.

544
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,694
Of course, everything he does
is all right, isn't it?

545
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:07,934
Hey, you scuffed those boots!

546
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,613
Ignore her, she's drunk.

547
00:36:09,695 --> 00:36:11,736
Still, my reactions will be quicker
now I've rested.

548
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:15,535
In case anything happens,
I can stay up with you.

549
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:18,175
-We can take it in turns.
-Fantastic, the two musketeers.

550
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:23,295
TONY: Hey, what are you doing?

551
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,897
-Putting them out to be cleaned.
-Someone'll steal them.

552
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,977
God,
you're not in the YMCA now.

553
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:45,139
And don't you try anything.

554
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,264
Right, who's going to take
the first...

555
00:37:28,786 --> 00:37:29,985
watch.

556
00:37:56,549 --> 00:37:58,149
Boss?

557
00:37:58,229 --> 00:37:59,788
What? He's here.

558
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,948
Good.

559
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,590
Tell him to wait.
Shan't be long.

560
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,589
Do you want anything?

561
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,230
Just some coffee.

562
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,030
Can we just go?

563
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:18,712
Would you please
let me go first?

564
00:38:23,793 --> 00:38:25,472
-All clear.
-You don't say.

565
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:31,033
(CHUCKLES)
So it's a quite extraordinary story.

566
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:35,593
The man I hired to do the job
kills one of my men,

567
00:38:35,673 --> 00:38:39,993
grotesquely maims another,
and is now protecting the girl.

568
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:43,794
Needless to say,
you're to get rid of both ofthem.

569
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,273
Should've called me sooner.

570
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,555
We tried to handle it ourselves.

571
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:50,395
-(CHUCKLES) So I see.
-They killed Barney!

572
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:51,635
Mike...

573
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:56,956
I can't look at you right now.
Go and buy me some cigarettes.

574
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:01,237
Would you feed our meter?

575
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:03,876
Feed your own sodding meter.

576
00:39:05,158 --> 00:39:08,598
And the name ofthis man
who has caused you so much trouble?

577
00:39:08,678 --> 00:39:10,998
I don't know his name.
We never met.

578
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,077
Can you tell me anything
about him at all?

579
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,679
Mike saw him.

580
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,959
Describe him.

581
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,199
Taller than average.

582
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,640
Thinner than average,
average looks.

583
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
Average moustache.

584
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,480
Victor Maynard.

585
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,680
You know him?
You know where he is?

586
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,361
No, no one knows him.

587
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:32,320
No one ever sees him,
not even his clients.

588
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:33,760
He's old-school.

589
00:39:33,842 --> 00:39:35,641
So how come
you know what he looks like?

590
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,722
-Rumor.
-Oh.

591
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:43,161
In our line, we're--
how can I put this?

592
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,522
The two most expensive.

593
00:39:45,604 --> 00:39:47,722
Actually, uh...

594
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,283
he's a little bit more expensive
then you are.

595
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,364
We'll find out if he's worth it at last.

596
00:40:15,368 --> 00:40:18,526
Help yourself.
Anything but the sausage.

597
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:20,167
Such largesse.

598
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:24,968
Why don't you just settle the bill?
All right?

599
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,087
Because if I don't get a minute
without you, I will kill myself.

600
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:50,891
(WATER SPLASHES)

601
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:07,133
Hey, what the--

602
00:41:20,496 --> 00:41:24,534
Wait, please, I didn't mean to hurt you.
It was just good luck.

603
00:41:38,738 --> 00:41:40,457
Freeze!
Put your hands up.

604
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:43,578
Shit!Shit!

605
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:46,138
You're shaking like a leaf.

606
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:47,538
Give me the gun.

607
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:50,018
I'm serious!
You know I'm a terrible shot.

608
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:52,899
I could easily aim at your head
and blow your balls off.

609
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,699
-You tried to drown me.
-Only a bit.

610
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,860
I'm an ordinary, kind,
peaceful person...

611
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,180
Just calm down.

612
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,219
-Take a deep breath.
-I am calm!

613
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:05,621
Agh!Aah!Aah...

614
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:08,580
That was an accident!
You frightened me!

615
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:13,702
Try and find your ear.

616
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:16,381
Put it on some ice,
and the hospital can stitch it back on.

617
00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:22,063
There's some ice in the mini-bar.

618
00:42:28,584 --> 00:42:29,824
Quick! Run!

619
00:42:29,905 --> 00:42:33,544
What? Shit. Shit!

620
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:36,424
Didn't even get a bathrobe.

621
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:39,784
Ah, yes,
Smith, Smith and... Tony.

622
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,945
He tried to kill me!

623
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,985
In the bathroom with a big gun!

624
00:42:46,026 --> 00:42:50,507
Wait!Wait!

625
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:53,666
My ear!
You sick bastard!

626
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:56,027
-Put it on ice!
-Move!

627
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,868
-What, you shot his ear o¤
-It was an accident.

628
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:05,348
Get the case!

629
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,588
Make sure you get them.

630
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,669
You got a professional
on the case now.

631
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,070
Mike!
What are you doing?

632
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,989
The girl,
the moustache,

633
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,631
They were here all the time
in the hotel!

634
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:20,311
The kid blew my ear off!

635
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,671
The Mini!

636
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,711
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Get the car.

637
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,312
Get the car!!

638
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,711
He just frightened me, so I...
(IMITATES GUNSHOT)

639
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:32,792
-You did what you had to do.
-Did I?

640
00:43:32,873 --> 00:43:34,992
Of course, yeah,
because you're a natural.

641
00:43:41,434 --> 00:43:43,234
-They're following.
-Faster.

642
00:43:43,314 --> 00:43:45,953
-I can't go any faster.
-Drive faster!

643
00:43:46,033 --> 00:43:47,314
I'm doing my best.

644
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:48,674
I'm still trying
to get the hang ofthe car.

645
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:49,994
-It's a new car?
-Well, new to me.

646
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:52,073

and slide under you.

and basic untraceable poisons.

00:54:57,681 --> 00:54:59,001
What are you--
what are you doing?!

806
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:01,000
-You're insane!
-I'm just digging.

807
00:55:01,082 --> 00:55:02,961
Put that pick down right now!
Stop it!

808
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,961
I was gonna get you some magnolias.

809
00:55:05,043 --> 00:55:07,241
It was supposed to be
a surprise for you.

810
00:55:07,322 --> 00:55:09,482
I got up at 6:00!

811
00:55:11,443 --> 00:55:13,283
I've never dug a hole
for anyone before!

812
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:15,282
-What, and you had to do it for me!?
-Yes!

813
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:18,004
-Why?!
-'Cause I wanted to thank you!

814
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:20,723
For helping me get to sleep!

815
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:22,884
Fill them back up
and put the turf on top now!

816
00:55:22,964 --> 00:55:26,164
-No!
-That was not a request!

817
00:55:26,245 --> 00:55:28,004
That was an instruction!

818
00:55:28,086 --> 00:55:30,005
Hey, hang on a second!

819
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:32,605
You had no right!
That's my garden!

820
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:35,485
As ifyou cared about your garden!

821
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:40,366
A garden is a place of beauty
where your senses run riot!

822
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:42,207
What good is that to you?

823
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:45,126
You shrink-wrap
your own furniture!

824
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:51,367
You're only happy hiding away
inside this gloomy awful house.

825
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:53,487
God, it's horrible.

826
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:57,208
It's like everywhere you go,
there's that smell.

827
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,329
What smell?

828
00:55:58,409 --> 00:55:59,688
Cleanliness. Bleach.

829
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:02,170
It's like being in a hospital.

830
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,289
It's so safe, it's dangerous.

831
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,210
I can't breathe here.

832
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,169
I mean it.
I'm frightened.

833
00:56:12,012 --> 00:56:15,049
I'm frightened if I stay here
much longer,

834
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:16,730
I'll end up like you.

835
00:56:18,132 --> 00:56:19,970
-Afraid of everything.
-I'm not afraid.

836
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:21,972
Afraid of admitting who I am.

837
00:56:22,052 --> 00:56:24,050
What I want.

838
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:30,012
What are you getting at?

839
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:37,253
You really don't know anything
about yourself, do you?

840
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Yeah?

841
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,540
It's me. Can I come in?

842
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,300
I'm in my bath.

843
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:34,381
I know.

844
00:57:35,341 --> 00:57:36,861
Is it important?

845
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,582
I think so.

846
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,661
Okay.

847
00:57:51,423 --> 00:57:52,903
All right?

848
00:57:52,985 --> 00:57:54,464
Yeah.

849
00:57:57,584 --> 00:57:58,904
Having a bath?

850
00:58:00,705 --> 00:58:02,024
Looks like it.

851
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:05,104
Tony, just lately,

852
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:08,705
well, I haven't really been
on top ofthings.

853
00:58:08,787 --> 00:58:14,306
I've been distracted at work,
and I just over trimmed my dwarf ulmus.

854
00:58:14,386 --> 00:58:17,507
My favourite bonsai tree.

855
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:20,346
So I wondered...

856
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:22,548
if it mightn't be you...

857
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:24,427
Confusing me.

858
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:26,267
Confusing you...

859
00:58:26,347 --> 00:58:29,027
Without meaning to.
Without realizing.

860
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:31,148
Without either of us realizing.

861
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:35,148
Confusing you...

862
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:38,389
Sexually.

863
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,309
I see.

864
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,549
-The idea's absurd, I know.
-I didn't even know you were--

865
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,070
I'm not. (CHUCKLES)

866
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:47,110
That's the thing.

867
00:58:47,192 --> 00:58:49,750
Oh. That is confusing.

868
00:58:49,831 --> 00:58:51,231
Y-yeah.

869
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,311
Okay.

870
00:58:58,392 --> 00:59:01,192
-What's your first thought?
-My dwarf ulmus.

871
00:59:03,993 --> 00:59:08,913
I could graft it onto the rubber plant.
I won't disturb you any longer.

872
00:59:14,555 --> 00:59:18,114
So now we all know
it's as fake as a ropa Rolex,

873
00:59:18,194 --> 00:59:21,475
Mr. Ferguson would like to know
where the girl got it.

874
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:25,875
I really don't mix
with the criminal fraternity.

875
00:59:25,956 --> 00:59:28,196
(LAUGHS)
Please, even your smile's crooked.

876
00:59:29,476 --> 00:59:31,516
Names.

877
00:59:31,597 --> 00:59:35,797
There are a great many people
who copy paintings.

878
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:37,396
The ones I know didn't do it.

879
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:47,878
Don't make me shoot first
and ask questions later.

880
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:52,479
Start writing.

881
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,921
What flavour are these?

882
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,721
Potpourri.

883
01:00:13,722 --> 01:00:15,002
They're not bad.

884
01:00:20,524 --> 01:00:24,682
Here, but I'm not sure any ofthese
are good enough to have done that.

885
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:27,003
Marvellous. Fabian?

886
01:00:28,605 --> 01:00:29,723
No. No.

887
01:00:31,844 --> 01:00:33,604
Get the painting.

888
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:40,965
(SILENCED GUNSHOTS)

889
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:48,606
It's me.

890
01:00:52,207 --> 01:00:53,407
Am I disturbing you?

891
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,726
No, not at all.

892
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:56,607
It's late, I know, um...

893
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,889
I'm sorry about before.

894
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:06,648
I shouldn't have said
all those things.

895
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,368
I was upset and very tired.

896
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,609
Well, there's no harm done.

897
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,450
What do you care what I think,
right?

898
01:01:23,332 --> 01:01:26,091
Well...
you should get some rest.

899
01:01:26,172 --> 01:01:28,811
-I can't sleep.
-What is it this time?

900
01:01:28,892 --> 01:01:30,291
My jaw's hurting.

901
01:01:30,372 --> 01:01:32,891
I have one too many teeth
at the back here.

902
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:34,332
-Really?
-Yeah.

903
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:41,574
Do you have any pills?
Temazepam? Trazodone?

904
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:46,813
Sleeping pills? Soneryl?
Valium? Xanex? Sleepies?

905
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:48,694
No. I'm sorry, no.

906
01:01:48,775 --> 01:01:51,374
All right,
I'll just go back to my...

907
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:54,534
Just go back...

908
01:01:54,615 --> 01:01:55,774
I could...

909
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,415
massage your feet.

910
01:02:02,857 --> 01:02:04,376
Are you serious?

911
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:06,016
A-acupressure.

912
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,416
I trained a long time ago.

913
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:11,537
I occasionally practice on myself.

914
01:02:11,618 --> 01:02:13,776
It's wonderful for anxiety.

915
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:15,897
You massage your own feet?

916
01:02:20,299 --> 01:02:21,858
-Here?
-Mm.

917
01:02:22,898 --> 01:02:23,897
And there?

918
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:28,379
(SIGHS)
You really have a feel for this.

919
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,179
A great many people experience
fits of nocturnal anxiety.

920
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:37,539
It's perfectly normal.
You mustn't worry about it.

921
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,460
Can I tell you something?
A confession?

922
01:02:42,542 --> 01:02:43,540
Why not?

923
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:47,181
I like having you protecting me.

924
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:50,182
You're really good at it.
Well, you seem to be.

925
01:02:52,822 --> 01:02:55,062
I don't really have
anything to compare it with,

926
01:02:55,144 --> 01:02:59,783
because no one--
no one ever tried before.

927
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,023
But with you...

928
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:05,983
I really enjoy it.

929
01:03:08,504 --> 01:03:11,225
Well...

930
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:13,904
I enjoy...

931
01:03:13,986 --> 01:03:15,704
doing it.

932
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:21,145
with me particularly?

933
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,787
With you.

934
01:03:25,947 --> 01:03:27,626
Particularly.

935
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:41,428
May I...

936
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:45,228
do the other foot?

937
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:25,073
(SCREAMS)

938
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:26,595
Shit.

939
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:27,914
Tony!

940
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:34,275
(SCREAMING) Tony!Tony!

941
01:04:34,356 --> 01:04:36,956
Tony!
Let me out, what are you doing?!

942
01:04:37,037 --> 01:04:38,836
Tony! Please!

943
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,836
Tony!She's gonna kill me!
Let me out! Please!

944
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:52,958
This hideous old bat in a wheelchair
just tried to kill me!

945
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:54,918
She had a knife this big!
I swear!

946
01:04:54,998 --> 01:04:56,718
-It was horrible!
-It's true!

947
01:04:58,759 --> 01:05:00,118
Mother?

948
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,919
Mother, are you there?
It's me.

949
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,240
Mother.

950
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:19,880
I've got everything under control.

951
01:05:20,001 --> 01:05:22,561
(GUNSHOT)
(WOOD SPLINTERING)

952
01:05:22,682 --> 01:05:24,481
She means well.

953
01:05:25,403 --> 01:05:28,643
Mother, can we talk about this?

954
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,923
I'm very disappointed in you,
Victor.

955
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:33,203
(SIGHS)
Could you sleep in the living room?

956
01:05:33,283 --> 01:05:34,923
-I'm too frightened.
-Come to my room.

957
01:05:35,004 --> 01:05:37,443
That's an excellent idea.
Tony will look after you.

958
01:05:37,525 --> 01:05:40,004
Your reputation is in tatters!

959
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:46,444
Mother--

960
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,284
Is she, like,
your typical mother?

961
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:53,925
Until you kill that floozy,
you're the target.

962
01:05:54,005 --> 01:05:56,085
I was behind the door.

963
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:59,406
Never face a closed door.
How many times have I told you?

964
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:02,406
-Forgive me, I just--
-No, stop.

965
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,326
Do you realize the mess
that you're in?

966
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:07,407
I should have stayed here with you.

967
01:06:07,488 --> 01:06:09,048
Since I moved out,
you've gone to the dogs.
