1
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,454
This is not what we were led to expect.

2
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,790
We were to see the Arno.

3
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:52,045
The signora wrote: 
"South rooms with a view, close together".

4
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,883
Instead of which, we have north rooms
without a view and far apart.

5
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,437
Hurry and get dressed or we'll miss
our dinner on top of everything else.

6
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:14,526
She had no business doing it.
No business at all!

7
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,955
Any nook does for me,
but it is hard that you have no view.

8
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,749
No, you must have a view, too.

9
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,418
- Buonasera.
- Buonasera.

10
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,005
Miss Lavish,
what a recommendation for a place!

11
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,216
Indeed, Miss Alan, it is.

12
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:42,930
Between the squalor of London and the squalor
of Prato, there is a great gulf fixed.

13
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,197
By going off the track,
you get to know the country,

14
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:05,702
see the little towns,
Gubbio, Settignano, Galuzzo,

15
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:09,790
San Gimignano, Monteriggioni.

16
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:15,754
Their mixture of the primitive
with the classical is irresistible.

17
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,423
- Miss Pole?
- Yes, Mr. Emerson.

18
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,010
What is that you are taking?
It's not lemonade, is it?

19
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,223
- Yes, it is.
- Put it right away, Miss Pole.

20
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,143
Lemonade is very bad for the stomach.

21
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,478
Oh!

22
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:38,986
I shall tell the signora to give
the next south view available to you.

23
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,114
- Why not to you?
- No, I insist.

24
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,368
This meat has surely been boiled.

25
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:51,415
For stock. It's lost all its flavor.

26
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,711
Monteriggioni is not only quaint,

27
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,799
but one meets the Italians
in all their simplicity and charm.

28
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:05,262
Wasn't Monteriggioni
where we saw the cornflowers, Teresa?

29
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,393
An entire carpet of them. It was delightful!

30
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:17,065
I find the cornflower
the most delightful of flowers.

31
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,530
I prefer something bolder,
the reckless rose, the tempestuous tulip.

32
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,993
- Your mother would never forgive me.
- She'd want you to have it.

33
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,912
On no account. The view of the Arno is yours.

34
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know why we're arguing,
because we have no view.

35
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,920
I have a view. And so does George.

36
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,840
My son George here.

37
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:48,138
You can have our rooms.
We'll have yours. We can change.

38
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,018
- Why not?
- Thank you very much.

39
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,104
- We could not impose on your kindness.
- Why?

40
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,399
- You see ...
- Hush, Lucy.

41
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:06,698
Women like looking at a view.
Men don't. George, persuade them.

42
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,743
It's obvious they should have the rooms.

43
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,953
- Signora?
- No, thank you.

44
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:19,378
We could clear out in fifteen minutes.
These niceties go against common sense!

45
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:25,926
Every kind of sense. I don't care
what I see outside. My vision is within.

46
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,472
Here is where the birds sing
and where the sky is blue.

47
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,891
Come, Lucy.

48
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:43,777
Let them have the view if they want it.
Why not? George, go after them.

49
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,322
What an impossible person!

50
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,790
- He meant to be kind.
- I know how to deal with these people.

51
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,334
Charlotte, you dealed rudely.
You dealed wrongly.

52
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,966
This pensione is a failure.
Tomorrow we'll change.

53
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,178
- It's Mr. Beebe.
- Who?

54
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,140
Charlotte, we can't change now.

55
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,937
- Mr. Beebe.
- Don't you remember us?

56
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,107
Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch.

57
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,694
- We met at Tunbridge Wells.
- That very cold Easter.

58
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,320
How do you do?

59
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:33,869
- I heard you are to be our vicar.
- Yes, I move into the rectory in June.

60
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,166
We did feel so sorry for you
in the dining room.

61
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,503
- Mr. Emerson is so tactless.
- But he meant to be kind.

62
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,468
This old gentleman and his son
offered us their rooms with a view.

63
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,845
It was most indelicate!

64
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,476
But things that are indelicate
can sometimes be beautiful.

65
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,564
- Yes!
- I am the chaperone to my young cousin Lucy.

66
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:08,945
It would be serious if I put her under an
obligation to people of whom I know nothing.

67
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,825
- I wouldn't think much harm could have come.
- There.

68
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:21,500
You think I ought to have accepted?
You think I have been narrow-minded.

69
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,044
I never suggested that.

70
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:29,674
If you would allow me, I would be happy
to act as intermediary with Mr. Emerson.

71
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:34,054
He would not take advantage
nor expect gratitude.

72
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,099
He has rooms he does not value
and thinks you would.

73
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,268
Charlotte, please.

74
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,189
My wishes are unimportant
compared with yours.

75
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,608
I am only here through your kindness.

76
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,947
If you want me to turn these gentlemen
out of their rooms, I will.

77
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,994
Would you, Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. ...

78
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,997
- Emerson.
- Emerson,

79
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,751
we accept his offer?

80
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:18,348
I would like to thank your father personally
for his kindness.

81
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,350
You can't. He's in his bath.

82
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,067
I would have given the larger room to you,

83
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,028
but I happen to know
it was the young man's.

84
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,284
In my small way, I am a woman of the world.

85
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,078
And I know where things can lead.

86
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,792
Whatever does it mean?

87
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,679
Lucy, get dressed or the better part
of the day will be gone.

88
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,792
You said you liked cornflowers.

89
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,713
- So we brought you cornflowers.
- Oh, how kind!

90
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,842
They're your type of flowers.
They have your personality.

91
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,386
I'd like to see them in your hair.

92
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,307
There are no jewels more becoming to a lady.

93
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,834
May I say something rather daring?

94
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,672
Mr. Beebe, you sound like Miss Lavish.

95
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:43,011
- Are you writing a novel, too?
- If I were, you would be my heroine.

96
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:50,310
And I should write, "If Miss Honeychurch
ever takes to live as she plays

97
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:56,399
"it will be very exciting,
both for us and for her".

98
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,828
Mother doesn't like me playing Beethoven.
She says I'm peevish afterwards.

99
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,916
Naturally, one would be stirred up.

100
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,543
Won't you play some more?

101
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,921
No, I think I'll go out.

102
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,925
Alone? Is that wise, Miss Honeychurch?

103
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:26,304
To be wise, one might have stayed at home.

104
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,226
I'll not go far. I promise.

105
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,230
I'm sorry.

106
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,695
Whatever's the matter with dear Miss Lucy?

107
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,907
I put it down to too much Beethoven.

108
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,451
I heard her beautiful playing.

109
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:52,872
Miss Catharine,
you have flowers in your hair.

110
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,929
Buongiorno, buongiorno, Ferdinando!

111
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,100
We salute thee.

112
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:17,146
The bronze came from Turkish cannons,
captured by the Knights of San Stefano.

113
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,232
Come along.

114
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:36,332
Stop a minute. Let that man go on
or I shall have to speak to him.

115
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,793
Oh, the British abroad!

116
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:45,425
I'd set an examination at Dover
and turn back any tourists who failed.

117
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:34,223
Miss, this sepolcro not very good.
You go see affresci di Giotto.

118
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:38,061
- Capella Peruzzi, Capella Bardi very good.
- No, thank you.

119
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:44,484
Giotto scolaro di Cimabue.
Kept the sheep on the mountain.

120
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,197
Make a picture of the sheep.

121
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,660
- No, thank you.
- I very ... Good speak English.

122
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:59,040
- Do go away, please.
- Capella Peruzzi, affresci di Giotto ...

123
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,625
Ciò tutto!

124
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:17,308
You see here these superb frescoes
by Giotto, depicting the life of St. Francis.

125
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,604
On the left, there he is,
renouncing worldly goods.

126
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,316
And, on the right, the fourth Pope.

127
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,905
And here he is preaching to the bishops.

128
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:39,414
And there he is undergoing
a trial by fire before the Sultan.

129
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,873
And here ...

130
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,793
Ah, Mr. Eager, good morning.

131
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:49,507
I'm leading a little private tour of my own.

132
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,804
Here he is on his deathbed, surrounded ...

133
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,559
Mr. Eager is our English chaplain
here in Florence.

134
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,021
... now unhappily ruined by restoration,

135
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:08,860
is untroubled by the snares
of anatomy and perspective ...

136
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:14,407
Look at that fat man! He must weigh as much
as I do, but he's floating like a balloon.

137
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:22,248
Remember that Santa Croce was built
by faith in the full fervor of medievalism.

138
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,837
Built by faith! That simply means
the workers weren't paid properly!

139
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:37,305
Pardon me. The chapel is somewhat small.
We will incommode you no longer.

140
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,931
Oh, I ... Oh!

141
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:43,019
Mr. Eager, there's plenty of room
for all of us. You don't have to ...

142
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,564
Oh, dear.

143
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,777
Gather round, everybody.

144
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,614
You may observe here in the Peruzzi Chapel,

145
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,367
as well as in the place
from which we've been expelled,

146
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:03,414
the special character of Giotto
among the great painters.

147
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,084
He was practical ...

148
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,213
My poor boy has brains,
but he's very muddled.

149
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,132
But why should he be?

150
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:18,596
Well may you ask.
But think how he's been brought up,

151
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:23,601
free from the superstition
that leads men to hate in the name of God.

152
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,188
I must go ...

153
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,859
I don't require you to fall in love
with my boy, but please help him.

154
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,197
If only one could stop him from brooding.

155
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:41,285
And on what? The things of the universe.

156
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,249
I don't believe in this world sorrow. Do you?

157
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,087
No, I don't. Not at all, Mr. Emerson.

158
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:56,926
Well, there you are.
Make my boy realize that,

159
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:02,390
at the side of the everlasting "why",
there is a "yes".

160
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,809
And a "yes" and a "yes"!

161
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,187
Has your son no particular hobby?

162
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,566
I forget my worries at the piano,

163
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,735
and collecting stamps helped my brother.

164
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,991
Excuse me. My cousin will be
most anxious if I don't get back.

165
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,118
- Poor girl.
- Poor girl?

166
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,916
I think myself most fortunate.
I'm very happy and having a splendid time.

167
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,044
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

168
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:57,403
Look at that adorable wine cart.
How he stares at us, dear simple soul!

169
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,447
I love these little dark alleys.

170
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,285
They're all peasants, you know. Come along.

171
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,296
I do declare we're lost.

172
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,928
No, Miss Bartlett,
you will not look into your Baedeker.

173
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,933
Two lone females in an unknown city,
that's what I call an adventure.

174
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,644
We will simply drift.

175
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,611
One always has to be wide open.
I think Miss Lucy is.

176
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,739
- Open to what, Miss Lavish?
- To physical sensation.

177
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:47,536
I'll let you into a secret.
I have my eye on your cousin.

178
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,081
For a character in your novel?

179
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,000
The young English girl, transfigured by Italy.

180
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,670
And why should she not be transfigured?

181
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,756
It happened to the Goths.

182
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,640
Signorina?

183
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,602
The smell!

184
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,314
A true Florentine smell. Inhale, my dear.

185
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,109
Deeper.

186
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,779
Every city, let me tell you, has its own smell.

187
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,035
Grazie.

188
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,497
How are you now?

189
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,670
Perfectly well. Absolutely well.

190
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,797
Then, let's go home.

191
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,967
There's no point in our stopping.

192
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,014
How very kind you've been.
I can go alone. Thank you.

193
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,144
- My photographs!
- What photographs?

194
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,358
I must have dropped them
in the square. Would you be so kind ...

195
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,954
Miss Honeychurch!

196
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,418
You're not fit enough to go alone.

197
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,795
- I am.
- No, you're not!

198
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,215
- But ...
- Then I don't get the photographs.

199
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,219
Besides, that way,
you'd have to fly over the wall.

200
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,848
Sit down and don't move until I come back.

201
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,225
Isn't it extraordinary?

202
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:08,941
I mean, Italians are so kind, so lovable,
and yet at the same time so violent.

203
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,195
Mr. Emerson?

204
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:20,244
I've never been so ashamed.
I can't think what came over me.

205
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,497
It's perfectly natural.
I nearly fainted myself.

206
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,251
Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.

207
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,131
And I want to ask you a great favor.

208
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,051
You know how silly people are.

209
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,887
Gossiping.

210
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,601
Ladies especially, I'm afraid.

211
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,521
- You understand what I mean?
- No.

212
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:56,196
I mean, would you not mention it to anyone,
my foolish behavior.

213
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,289
What was that?
I believe it was my photographs!

214
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,251
I didn't know what to do with them.
They were covered with blood.

215
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,670
There. Now I've told you.

216
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,845
Something tremendous has happened.

217
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,810
Well, thank you again.

218
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,441
How quickly accidents happen.
Then one returns to the old life.

219
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,651
I don't.

220
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,946
I mean, something's happened to me.

221
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,491
And to you.

222
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,810
- No!
- She is my sister.

223
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,691
- We ought not to allow this.
- They're doing no harm.

224
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,277
You can't object in such a landscape.

225
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,363
As long as she is his sister.

226
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:25,619
So, Miss Honeychurch, you're traveling.
As a student of art?

227
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,250
- No, I'm afraid not.
- As a student of human nature like myself?

228
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,212
- I'm here as a tourist.
- Indeed?

229
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:40,217
We residents sometimes pity
you poor tourists not a little.

230
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,888
Handed about like parcels
from Venice to Florence to Rome,

231
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:51,687
unconscious of anything outside Baedeker,
anxious to get done and go on elsewhere.

232
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:56,108
I abhor Baedeker.
I'd fling every copy in the Arno.

233
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:01,905
Towns, rivers, palaces,
all mixed up in an inextricable whirl.

234
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,578
Over there, Miss Honeychurch,

235
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,497
the villa of my dear friend Lady Laverstock,

236
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,084
at present busy
with a Fra Angelico definitive study.

237
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,756
And, on your left, no, just there,

238
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,842
Mr. Henry Burridge lives.

239
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,929
An American of the best type. So rare!

240
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,850
Doubtless you know his monographs
in Medieval Byways.

241
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,196
Your father, Mr. Emerson, is a journalist?

242
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:47,075
- He used to be.
- He's retired? And you, yourself?

243
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,744
I'm on the railways.

244
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:54,249
You know the American girl
in Punch who says to her father,

245
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,002
"Say, Poppa, what did we see in Rome?"

246
00:29:57,086 --> 00:30:02,382
The father replies, "Guess Rome
was where we saw the yellow dog."

247
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,302
Yellow dog!

248
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,263
There's traveling for you!

249
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,308
What? Stop at once!

250
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,191
I'm not having this.

251
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,109
Ferma la carrozza subito!

252
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,154
Have we bolted?

253
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,796
What? Is Phaethon misbehaving
with his Persephone?

254
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,049
- Please, I'll deal with them.
- Leave them.

255
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,220
Do we find happiness so often
that we should turn it away?

256
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,721
Scenda!

257
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,130
Beauty!

258
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,054
Espoir!

259
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,932
Is that your son?

260
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,853
Could that be the silent, dour George?

261
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,940
He's saying his creed.

262
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,820
One more lump, if I might trouble you,
Mr. Beebe.

263
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,824
Joy!

264
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,661
Beauty!

265
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,872
Joy ...

266
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,085
He's declaring the eternal "yes".

267
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,963
And a spoon, if there is one.

268
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,675
Love!

269
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:55,597
- What's that?
- The gentlemen are doubtless having a game.

270
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,432
Why don't you join them, dear?

271
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,310
I want to stop here with you.

272
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:05,732
Observe my foresight. I never venture forth
without my mackintosh squares.

273
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,653
At any time, one may have to sit
on damp ground or cold marble.

274
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,409
Lucy, you have the other one.

275
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,663
Come on, I insist. The ground will do for me.

276
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:25,961
I have not had rheumatism for years,
and if I feel a twinge I'll stand up.

277
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,841
And she never went back to Weybridge?

278
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:35,220
Her friend had to return without her.
She remained at Monteriano.

279
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,806
And did she really ...

280
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,775
No, no. Don't be alarmed. This is not a cold.

281
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,070
Just a slight cough.
I've had it for three days.

282
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,906
Nothing to do with sitting on the ground.

283
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,285
I shall go and find Mr. Beebe.

284
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,414
Oh, do, dear. He will be so pleased.

285
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:11,798
- Did she really marry this Italian?
- In the church at Monteriano.

286
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:16,053
A youth. Ten years younger than herself.

287
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,680
Eleanor!

288
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,444
Excuse me.

289
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,531
Dove Mr. Beebe?

290
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,662
Buoni uomini?

291
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:58,512
I think there is something
in the Italian landscape

292
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,181
which inclines even
the most stolid to romance.

293
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,645
It reminds me somewhat
of the country around Shropshire.

294
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,774
Where I once spent a holiday
at the home of my friend Miss Apesbury.

295
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,571
And I divine it, Charlotte.
You had an adventure there.

296
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,742
Vain to deny it.

297
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,751
Lucy!

298
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,814
Mr. Eager, do come and join us.
Miss Honeychurch is feeling unwell.

299
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,197
Andiamo.

300
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,748
Andiamo!

301
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,793
George. George.

302
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,381
- Aren't you coming with us?
- I'll walk.

303
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,136
Are you sure?

304
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,225
Courage, Miss Honeychurch, and faith.

305
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:38,064
Do you suppose this display is called
into existence to extinguish you or me?

306
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:42,694
Even scientifically, the chances
against being struck are enormous.

307
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,615
The steel knives that might attract
the current are in the other carriage.

308
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,875
What is to be done?

309
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,461
How do you propose to silence him?

310
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,842
- The driver?
- My dear girl, no. Mr. George Emerson.

311
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:12,599
I don't wish to be uncharitable,
but I know he will talk.

312
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,851
He will not. He never talks.

313
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,854
One's lucky to get as much
as a "yes" or "no" out of him.

314
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:23,318
Unfortunately, I have met the type before.

315
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,989
They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.

316
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,449
Exploits?

317
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:35,872
Very well. I'll speak to him.

318
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,794
Oh, no, my dear Lucy.
I think it is for me to do that.

319
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,302
He should have been here
at least an hour ago.

320
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:54,099
Don't stand there, dear.
You will be seen from the outside.

321
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,647
The moment he comes, I shall face him.

322
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,650
No, my dear, you will do no such thing.

323
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,737
My poor dear girl, you are so young!

324
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:13,410
You've always lived among such nice people.
You cannot realize what men can be.

325
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:19,207
This afternoon, if I had not arrived,
what would have happened?

326
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,086
- I can't think.
- Answer me, Lucia.

327
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,089
What would have happened had I not appeared?

328
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,800
You did appear!

329
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,971
Oh, I have vexed you at every turn.

330
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,893
It's true. I am too old for you. And too dull.

331
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,481
It will be a push to catch the morning train.

332
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:50,196
I have failed in my duty to your mother.
She will never forgive me when you tell her.

333
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,282
Come away from the window!

334
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,661
She will certainly blame me
when she hears of it.

335
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,038
Certainly.

336
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,709
And deservedly.

337
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:09,883
- Why need Mother hear of it?
- Well, you tell her everything. Don't you?

338
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,219
I suppose I do, generally.

339
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,598
There's such a beautiful confidence
between you.

340
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,726
One would hate to break it.

341
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,313
And, as I've said before, I am to blame.

342
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,648
I wouldn't want Mother to think so.

343
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:29,360
She will think so, if you tell her.

344
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,781
I shall never speak of it to Mother or anyone.

345
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,246
We'll both be as silent as the grave.

346
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,293
You'd better get to bed, dear.
We have to make an early start.

347
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,343
But, of course, we have not had a full week.

348
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,263
I reserved them for a week
like you wrote you wanted.

349
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:02,769
Yes, but we've only had half a week,
so I calculate we owe you half the price.

350
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,690
I'm the loser. I could have
let them rooms five times over.

351
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,884
Buonasera. Grazie.

352
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,360
Lucy! We must get packed immediately!

353
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,908
I wish to have a word with you,
Mr. Emerson, in the drawing room, please.

354
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:27,520
- You shouldn't peep.
- Cecil asked my permission,

355
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,106
but he can't manage without me.

356
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,941
- Nor me.
- You?

357
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,403
- He asked my permission also.
- Whatever did you say?

358
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,822
- I said no.
- What?

359
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:43,911
It's the way he put it. Wouldn't it be
a splendid thing for Lucy if he married her?

360
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,832
Wasn't I off my head with joy?
So I said no, I wasn't.

361
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:55,214
Ridiculous child. You think you're so
holy and truthful, but it's just conceit.

362
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,466
Look out!

363
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,012
I promessi spose!

364
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:08,061
- She has accepted me.
- I'm so glad.

365
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:12,190
Dear Cecil, what joy!

366
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:16,444
- Well, welcome as one of the family.
- Thank you.

367
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,867
- Mother?
- Lucy.

368
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,384
Freddy!

369
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,557
- Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you, Mary.

370
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,978
Hello, Mr. Vyse, I've come for tea.
Do you suppose I shall get it?

371
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,356
Food is the one thing one does get here.

372
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:59,028
- What an extraordinary thing!
- One of Freddy's bones.

373
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:05,827
He's terrible. A most unpromising youth.
So unlike his sister.

374
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,288
You think his sister is promising?

375
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,208
I have a pet theory about Miss Honeychurch.

376
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:20,591
Is it not odd that she should play Beethoven
with such passion and live so quietly?

377
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,468
I suspect that one day ...

378
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,224
... music and life will mingle.

379
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,061
Then she will be wonderful in both.

380
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:37,442
I trust that day is at hand.
She has just promised to marry me.

381
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,072
I'm sorry if I've given you a shock.

382
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,535
I'm awfully sorry. I'd no idea
you were so intimate with her.

383
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:51,706
You should have stopped me.
Shall we join the others?

384
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,211
Congratulations.

385
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,090
Blessings. Your vicar's benediction.

386
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,761
I want you to be supremely happy.

387
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,932
And supremely good, both as
man and wife, mother and father.

388
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,101
And now I want my tea.

389
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,271
Just in time. How dare you be so serious!

390
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:26,240
- Summer Street will never be the same.
- It's too small for anyone like ourselves.

391
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:30,286
It might attract the wrong type.
The trains have improved so.

392
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,750
Fatal. What are five miles
from the station these days?

393
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,961
Sir Harry, how about spinsters as tenants?

394
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,131
Most certainly!
That is, if they are gentlewomen.

395
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:49,055
Indeed they are. Miss Teresa
and Miss Catharine Alan. I met them in Italy.

396
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:54,852
Sir Harry, beware of these gentlewomen.
Only let to a man.

397
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,854
Provided, of course, he's clean.

398
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,065
You'd love the Miss Alans.

399
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:03,069
I don't think I'd like anyone at that pensione.

400
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:07,990
Wasn't there a lady novelist
and a free-thinking father and son?

401
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:12,954
I have no profession.
My attitude, quite indefensible,

402
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,624
is that, if I trouble no one, I may do as I like.

403
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,378
It is, I dare say, an example of my decadence.

404
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:25,049
You're very fortunate.
Leisure is a wonderful opportunity.

405
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:32,306
Don't slouch, Lucy. Go and talk
to Mrs. Pool. Ask her about her leg.

406
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,269
Would Cecil and I be missed
if we went for a walk?

407
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:40,356
I think it would be all right.
Don't get your frock muddied.

408
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:05,381
It's disgusting the way an engagement
is regarded as public property.

409
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,925
All those old women smirking.

410
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,222
One has to go through it.
They won't notice us much next time.

411
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,475
But their whole attitude is wrong.

412
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:20,229
An engagement,
horrid word in the first place,

413
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,608
is a private matter
and should be regarded as such.

414
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,692
Oh.

415
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:30,656
- There's your philosophizing parson.
- Don't you like Mr. Beebe?

416
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,827
I never said so.
I consider him far above the average.

417
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,289
Mr. Beebe, I've had a wonderful idea.

418
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:44,003
I'm going to write to our Miss Alans
and ask them to take Sir Harry's villa.

419
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:48,132
Sir Harry deserves a tenant
as vulgar as himself.

420
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,469
Oh, Mr. Vyse, he's really very nice.

421
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,430
Gentlewomen! Yuck!

422
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,601
Acting the little god down here
with his patronage

423
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,605
and his sham aesthetics,
and everyone is taken in.

424
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:06,233
I'll write to them,
and if you'd also send a word?

425
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,029
Certainly. A highly suitable
addition to our little community.

426
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,449
Goodness, how cross you are!

427
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,709
It was that miserable tea party
and all those dreadful people.

428
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,170
And not being alone with you.

429
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,463
Hmm.

430
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,405
Italy and London are the places
where I feel I truly belong.

431
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,159
I am something of an Inglese Italianato.

432
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,665
E un diavolo incarnato.
You know the proverb?

433
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,214
I somehow think you feel
more at home with me in a room.

434
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,634
Never in the real country like this.

435
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:18,139
I think you're right. When I do think of you,
it is always in a room.

436
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,602
This is the Sacred Lake.

437
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:29,692
Very picturesque, but hardly a lake.
More of a puddle.

438
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:35,114
Freddy loves to bathe here.
He's very fond of it.

439
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,866
And you?

440
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,411
I used to bathe here, too.

441
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,872
Until I was found out.

442
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,917
- Lucy.
- Hmm?

443
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,336
Yes, I suppose we ought to be going.

444
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,387
I want to ask you something
that I have never asked before.

445
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,098
What, Cecil?

446
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,559
Yes?

447
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,354
I have never kissed you.

448
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,484
No. You haven't.

449
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,570
May I now?

450
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,823
Well, of course you may, Cecil.

451
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,118
You might before. I can't run at you.

452
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,312
I'm sorry.

453
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,463
Mother's right. Those people
Charlotte and I met at the pensione,

454
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,383
they were all rather extraordinary.

455
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,439
Our neighbor and friend,
Sir Harry Otway,

456
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:36,443
has a villa in Summer Street
for which he needs a tenant.

457
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,320
I immediately thought of you.

458
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,574
"The house has the added attraction

459
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:46,537
"that it stands exactly across the road
from the Reverend Beebe's church.

460
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:52,668
"I told him of my plan to lure you hither,
and he is in complete agreement

461
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:58,757
"and says he is writing today to urge you
to consider our little corner of Surrey.

462
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:03,053
"Yours sincerely, Lucy Honeychurch." There.

463
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,291
- Good night.
- Good night.

464
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,752
Oh, dear.

465
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,508
- Good night.
- Good night.

466
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,888
Good night. See you Friday.

467
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,141
- That will be all, Rose. Thank you.
- Thank you, madam.

468
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,019
Good night, Rose.

469
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:39,149
Make Lucy one of us.
Lucy's becoming wonderful.

470
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,527
Her music always was wonderful.

471
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:46,573
But she's purging off that Honeychurch taint.
You know what I mean.

472
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,286
Not quoting the servants
or asking how the pudding is made.

473
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,956
Mind you marry her next January.

474
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,085
Her music, the style of her ...

475
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,923
How she kept to Schubert when,
like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven.

476
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,426
Schubert was right for this evening.

477
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,015
Mother, I shall have our children
educated just like Lucy.

478
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,561
Bring them up among honest
country folk for freshness,

479
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,857
send them to Italy for subtlety.

480
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,069
And not till then bring them to London.

481
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,364
Not a day beyond January.

482
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,504
Cecil darling.

483
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,717
So, you do love me, little thing?

484
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,388
Lucy!

485
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,142
I want to show her this letter
from the Miss Alans.

486
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:41,105
The tiresome Miss Alans.
I hate their "if"-ing and "but"-ing.

487
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:44,233
Well, now they're really coming.

488
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:49,571
I had a letter from Miss Teresa
asking how often the butcher called.

489
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,950
My reply impressed her favorably. Lucy?

490
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,411
Go for her. Get her round the shins.

491
00:56:56,621 --> 00:57:01,208
- Freddy, be careful!
- You really are savages, you know.

492
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:08,132
Impossible to make oneself heard.
Don't you want to hear about the Miss Alans?

493
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,176
-  Who?
- Sir Harry's new tenants.

494
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,221
- That wasn't the name.
- Wasn't whose name?

495
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:18,517
Sir Harry's tenants.
I met him this morning and he said,

496
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:23,272
"I have procured desirable tenants."

497
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,483
I said, "Hurray,"
and slapped him on the back.

498
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:30,737
- Exactly. The Miss Alans.
- More like Anderson.

499
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:35,284
I knew there'd be another muddle.
I'm always right.

500
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:39,079
Only Freddy's muddle,
who doesn't even know their name.

501
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,832
Yes, I do. I've got it. It was Emerson.

502
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:50,757
- What a weathercock Sir Harry is.
- I hope they're the right kind of people.

503
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,803
Yes, Freddy,
there is a right and a wrong sort.

504
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,474
These must be all right.
They're friends of Cecil's.

505
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:03,312
- Cecil?
- So you can all call in perfect safety.

506
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:07,232
- Cecil?
- We met some Emersons in Florence.

507
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:12,362
The oddest people, Mrs. Honeychurch,
but we rather liked them.

508
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,823
Emerson's a common enough name.

509
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,039
"So really desirable. I've telegraphed them."

510
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,000
Don't be silly, Freddy. You always overdo it.

511
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,046
A most remarkable father and son.

512
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:34,676
Father's something of a radical.
The son, full of possibilities.

513
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:40,516
Don't move. Stay where you are.
Ginevra de Benci!

514
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,020
Did you know you were a Leonardo,
smiling at things beyond our ken?

515
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,689
What's this about Sir Harry's new tenants?

516
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,610
I have found him tenants for his Cissie Villa.

517
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,780
I've won a great victory for the comic muse.

518
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,033
After all the trouble I took over the Miss Alans.

519
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,371
Of course I'd prefer friends of yours ...

520
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,040
Friends of mine? The joke is to come.

521
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:08,794
They're strangers
I met in the National Gallery.

522
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,631
They had been to Italy.
A father and son. The oddest couple.

523
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:17,803
In the course of conversazione,
they said they wanted a country cottage.

524
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,432
A simple burrow
where they could smell the earth.

525
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,852
Of course, London has its own character,

526
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:29,940
but we've a longing for green things growing,
don't we, George?

527
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:33,777
The sweetness of the English countryside,

528
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:38,407
of wet hedgerows
with birds singing inside them.

529
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:42,244
I know we should make
our heaven and earth where we are.

530
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:46,582
However, I fear I've faltered
and need some help from outside.

531
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:54,381
Well, in short, sir, what I seek is a country
cottage where George can come at weekends.

532
00:59:54,465 --> 01:00:01,513
I happen to know of just the place.
Not exactly a cottage, more a villa.

533
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,890
Dear sir, I implore you ...

534
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,977
If you'd give me your card ...

535
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:11,690
I fear we have no card,
but George will write down the address.

536
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:17,362
Sir Harry Otway. It is in Surrey,
a place called Summer Street.

537
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,366
Summer Street! I've dreamed of Summer Street.

538
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,203
It will teach that snob Sir Harry a lesson.

539
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:31,251
The classes should mix, there should
be intermarriage. I believe in democracy.

540
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,338
No, you don't!
You don't know what the word means.

541
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:38,383
It isn't fair! I've probably met them before.

542
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,011
Perfectly fair if it punishes a snob.

543
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:46,016
I blame you. You had no business
to undo my work about the Miss Alans.

544
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,729
You've scored off Sir Harry, but at my expense.

545
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,565
It was most disloyal of you.

546
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,154
Temper, Lucy, temper. Please!

547
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,710
- Hello?
- Hello.

548
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,797
- I've brought someone to see you.
- One minute.

549
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,302
Byron. Exactly.

550
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,767
"A Shropshire Lad".

551
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,105
Never heard of it.

552
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,066
"The Way of All Flesh".

553
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,985
Never heard of it.

554
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:42,906
Hello? George reads German.

555
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:53,542
I'm certain that's old Emerson.
What are those people doing? Hello!

556
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,460
Wait on, Mr. Beebe.

557
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:59,297
- This is Mr. Honeychurch.
- How do you do?

558
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,425
How do you do? Come in.

559
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,386
Come and have a bathe!

560
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,138
I'd like that.

561
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:12,561
What a conversational opening!
"How do you do? Come and have a bathe."

562
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:16,481
Emerson, this is Honeychurch.
You remember his sister.

563
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,484
Oh, yes. How do you do? Glad to see you.

564
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:25,949
Very glad to hear your sister is marrying.
I'm sure she'll be happy.

565
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:31,246
We know Mr. Vyse, too.
He's been very kind.

566
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:36,042
Go and bathe. It will do you good.
Then all come back for some tea.

567
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,628
- Do you really want this bathe?
- Yes, I've said so.

568
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,891
Bye, Emerson.

569
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:58,648
Bring some milk and honey
and, er, cakes. Cakes!

570
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,694
Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch!

571
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:08,283
As a matter of fact, coincidence
is much rarer than we suppose.

572
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:15,290
For example, on reflection,
it's not coincidental that you're here now.

573
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,752
I have reflected.
It's fate. Everything is fate.

574
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:22,297
You've not reflected.
Let me cross-examine you.

575
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,759
Where did you meet Mr. Vyse?

576
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:30,263
- The National Gallery.
- Looking at Italian art.

577
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,892
You see? You talk of coincidence and fate.

578
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:39,189
You're naturally drawn to things Italian,
as are we and all our friends.

579
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,942
That narrows the field immeasurably.

580
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:46,404
It is fate, but call it Italy
if it pleases you, Vicar.

581
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,887
Are you bathing, Mr. Beebe?

582
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,059
- Don't be shy!
- Why not?

583
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:20,021
Oh, it's wonderful! Simply ripping.

584
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,900
Hurry up, Emerson!

585
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:30,448
- Come along, Mr. Beebe!
- I may as well wash, too.

586
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,461
Here goes.

587
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:30,759
Race you round it!

588
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:46,733
"In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan
a stately pleasure dome decre ...."

589
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,761
You've gone too far! Really, I ...

590
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,848
I have a boot!

591
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,479
And some trousers ...

592
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,498
Graces alive!

593
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:52,674
- Come this way immediately!
- Who were those unfortunate people?

594
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:57,762
This way, Mrs. Honeychurch. Follow me.

595
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,769
Oh, dears. Look away!

596
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,899
Poor Mr. Beebe, too!

597
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,901
You're treading on me!

598
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:18,533
It is you! Why not have a comfortable
bath at home with hot and cold laid on?

599
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:22,704
- Mother!
- You're in no position to argue. Come, Lucy.

600
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:27,792
Oh, look! No, don't look! Poor Mr. Beebe!

601
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,967
Poor Charlotte.

602
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,555
Poor, poor Charlotte!

603
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:43,808
Standard reaction to any letter
from Cousin Charlotte.

604
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,519
Poor, poor Charlotte!

605
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,772
This is serious.

606
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:54,903
Her boiler is to be had out and the cistern
cleaned and all kinds of to-doing.

607
01:07:55,196 --> 01:08:02,077
I think we should ask her to stay.
Give her a holiday while the plumbers finish.

608
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:06,706
No! We're squeezed to death
with Freddy's friend and Minnie Beebe.

609
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,209
Freddy, must you?

610
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,212
The truth is, you don't like Charlotte.

611
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,799
Well, she gets on my nerves.

612
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:20,595
The time she met Cecil,
she drove him quite frantic.

613
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:27,602
So, please, don't worry us this last summer.
Spoil us by not asking her to come.

614
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:31,689

This isn't very kind of you two.
You have each other and poor Charlotte ...

01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:45,620

Is anything the matter with Cecil?

630
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:03,489
Because otherwise, I cannot account for him.

631
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,076
Whenever I speak, he winces.

632
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:10,496
I see him, Lucy. It's useless to contradict me.

633
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:17,921
No doubt, I am not artistic
nor literary nor intellectual.

634
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:23,760
Your father bought the drawing room
furniture, and we must put up with it.

635
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,639
Cecil doesn't mean to be uncivil.

636
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:34,145
He explained. It's ugly things
that upset him. He's not uncivil to people.

637
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,774
Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?

638
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:42,946
You can't expect a really musical person
to appreciate comic songs as we do.

639
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,741
Must he sneer and spoil everyone's pleasure?

640
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,370
- Go and dress, dear.
- All right, Mother.

641
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:10,139
Sunday week, I want to ask
George Emerson up for some tennis.

642
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:14,560
- Oh, no, Freddy ...
- Oh, he's topping. He's spiffing!

643
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,855
George Emerson is simply ripping!

644
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:37,250
What a noise you're making.
Freddy, let Lucy go.

645
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,337
Hook me behind.

646
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,183
Need we have Charlotte?

647
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,518
We needn't.

648
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:01,566
- And now Freddy wants to ask the Emersons.
- Well, he needn't.

649
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,487
And you're not pleased with Cecil.

650
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:10,950
Kiss me.

651
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:20,752
Well, of course, if you want Charlotte
to come, with her boiler and everything ...

652
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:24,505
She's been so kind to me.

653
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,050
Kiss me again.

654
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,522
- Would you like it closed?
- Oh, thank you.

655
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,339
- Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

656
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,009
Oh, porter! Could you ...

657
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:27,652
The ticket says Dorking.
That was the last station.

658
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,697
How very vexing! I shall have to get a cab.

659
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:37,495
Mr. Emerson. What are you doing here?

660
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:40,498
My father lives here.
I've come for the weekend.

661
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,584
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes.

662
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:30,173
Oh, Lucy, I met him at the station.

663
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,884
I had no idea. Oh, my poor Lucia!

664
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:43,769
My dear Marian, what a stupid blunder.
You'll never forgive me.

665
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,146
Oh!

666
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:49,358
- Freddy, pay the cab.
- No, I must. I absolutely insist.

667
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:51,736
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Vyse?

668
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:57,158
- And Mr. Floyd, a friend of Freddy's.
- I insist I pay for my cab.

669
01:14:57,242 --> 01:15:02,413
- And this is Minnie, Mr. Beebe's niece.
- Grant me that.

670
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,749
- Here you are.
- Thank you, sir.

671
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,424
I insist, absolutely.

672
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,677
All right. Five shillings
and a bob for the driver.

673
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:21,682
We all have our foibles,
and mine is prompt settling of accounts.

674
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,310
Does anyone have any change?

675
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:32,610
How much is ...
Who do I give the sovereign to?

676
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,488
- Toss for it, Honeychurch.
- All right.

677
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:40,159
No. I know I'm a spoilsport,
but it would make me wretched.

678
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,745
It would be robbing the one who lost.

679
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:49,794
Freddy owes me 15 shillings, so it works out
all right if you give the pound to me.

680
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:53,297
Fifteen shillings to you? How so, Mr. Vyse?

681
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:57,927
Because fifteen
and five shillings make a pound.

682
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,889
Why is Mr. Vyse taking the quid?
No, thank you!

683
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:05,268
- Have some tea.
- What about Mr. Floyd's ten shi ...

684
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,939
And why doesn't she pay
the bob for the driver?

685
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:15,570
A shilling for the driver. Of course.
How kind of you to remind me.

686
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:19,031
Does anyone have change for half a crown?

687
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,617
Cecil, give that sovereign to me.

688
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:25,663
Mary can change it,
and we'll start from the beginning.

689
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:30,001
Oh, dear. I am sorry. What a nuisance I am!

690
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:36,215
Poor Charlotte!

691
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:44,098
Mary, have you got any change?

692
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,059
For a sovereign.

693
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:53,316
Have you told him about him?

694
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:57,361
No, I haven't, nor anyone.
I promised you I shouldn't.

695
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:02,158
Here's your money.
It's all shillings except two half crowns.

696
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:04,702
You can settle your debt nicely now.

697
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:11,250
How dreadful. How more than dreadful
if Mr. Vyse should hear from another source.

698
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,336
There is no other source.

699
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:18,549
- George would tell Mr. Emerson.
- He would tell no one.

700
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:22,970
- How do you know?
- Because I know. Shall we go out?

701
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:28,976
Dear, a moment. We may not have this
chance again. Have you spoken to him yet?

702
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,187
I have seen him.

703
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:40,279
Stop thinking he admires me or any nonsense
of that sort. He doesn't. Not one straw.

704
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:43,157
Freddy, stop it!

705
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:47,536
No, poor Minnie. No, not me. Get off!

706
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:10,351
Lucy! Lucy! What's that book?

707
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,522
Who's been leaving books out to spoil?

708
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:19,527
- It's only a library book of Cecil's.
- Well, pick it up.

709
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:33,249
It's a special collection.
I forget what for, but I beg,

710
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:36,460
no vulgar clinking ha'pennies in the plate.

711
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:40,297
Make sure Minnie has a sixpence.
Where is the child?

712
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:45,845
Dear, I'm so sorry, I don't seem
to have any small change. Could you ...

713
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:50,808
Yes, easily. Gracious,
how smart you look! What a lovely frock.

714
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,813
Go on.

715
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,357
Goodbye. Be good.

716
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:20,671
"'No place on earth as glorious
as this where love is spoken face to face.

717
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:26,427
"So he cried, 'Utter rapture! The silvered

with inutterable and inestimable bliss.'

719
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:38,147
"And so, locked in mortal combat,
they brought to life the eternal ...

720
01:19:40,817 --> 01:19:45,821
"They brought to life the eternal battle

01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:50,868
"to slowly gird, to bravely fight,
to stoutly dare ..."

722
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:55,164
Listen, Lucy. Three split infinitives.

723
01:19:55,749 --> 01:20:00,419
"And then the cry was heard,
'Once more into the breach, my friends."'

724
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:02,421
Victory, Mr. Floyd!

725
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:10,304
"The scene is set in Florence.
The sunset. The sunset of Italy."

726
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,600
- Did you mind losing?
- Of course.

727
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:19,563
You're not such a splendid player.
The light was in my eyes.

728
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:22,066
I never said I was.

729
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:28,155
"Under Orcagna's Loggia,
the Loggia de Lanzi, as we call it now ..."

730
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,782
What's the title?

731
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,578
- Under a Loggia by Eleanor Lavish.
- Eleanor Lavish!

732
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:38,165
My goodness!
Do you remember her, Mr. Emerson?

733
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,752
- Of course.
- No wonder the novel's so bad.

734
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,880
Still, one ought to read it, I suppose.

735
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:49,468
- There's an absurd account of a view.
- Do read it.

736
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,763
Do you like our view, Mr. Emerson?

737
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,891
My father says there's only one perfect view,

738
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,602
the view of the sky over our heads.

739
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:03,357
I expect your father has been reading Dante.

740
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:09,280
- Do read it.
- Not while Mr. Emerson is entertaining us.

741
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:14,076
No, do. Nothing's funnier
than silly things read aloud.

742
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,914
Mr. Emerson finds us frivolous.
Look for tennis balls, Mr. Emerson.

743
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:22,042
- Do I have to?
- No, of course not.

744
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:25,254
It's in chapter two. Find me chapter two.

745
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,601
- Give it here.
- No, it's the silliest thing.

746
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,227
Come on.

747
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,646
- Cecil!
- Thank you.

748
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,357
A-ha.

749
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:49,069
"Afar off, the towers of Florence.

750
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:54,408
"And she wandered as though in a dream
through the wavering sea of barley,

751
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:57,494
"touched with crimson stains of poppies.

752
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:02,207
"All unobserved, he came to her."
Isn't it immortal?

753
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:08,881
"There came from his lips no wordy
protestations such as formal lovers use.

754
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:15,304
"No eloquence was his, nor did he need it.
He simply enfolded her in his manly arms ..."

755
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:18,432
No, this isn't the bit. It's further on.

756
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:22,686
- Shall we go in to tea?
- By all means.

757
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,462
Excuse me.

758
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,014
Charlotte, a minute.

759
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:03,560
Cecil, ask Mary for sandwiches.
I'll be with you in a moment.

760
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,899
Do you know Miss Lavish's novel?

761
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:14,780
There's a scene in it, the hero and heroine
make love. Do you know about that?

762
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,409
Do you know about it?

763
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,538
They're on a hillside
and Florence is in the distance.

764
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,041
There are poppies and a barley field.

765
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:31,422
It can't be coincidence.
How could you tell her?

766
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:36,719
Oh, Lucy! Oh, dearest girl!
She hasn't put that in her novel?

767
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:45,519
Never, never more shall
Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.

768
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:50,315
So you did tell. Why?
When you wouldn't even let me tell Mother?

769
01:23:54,529 --> 01:23:56,238
Cecil read it to me.

770
01:23:57,115 --> 01:24:01,201
And that man insulted me again
behind Cecil's back.

771
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,872
Why did you tell her? What made you?

772
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:13,172
Even if you forgive me, I shall never
forgive myself till my dying day.

773
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:20,054
Go and call him.

774
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,184
- Call Mr. Vyse?
- No. The other one.

775
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,354
I'll deal with him myself.

776
01:24:38,448 --> 01:24:40,449
You missed a good match, Miss Bartlett.

777
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,134
Charlotte, please stay.

778
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:05,224
Mr. Emerson, leave this house
and don't come back as long as I'm here.

779
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:07,601
- I can't.
- No discussion.

780
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,731
Go, please.
I don't want to call in Mr. Vyse.

781
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,693
You mean to marry that man?

782
01:25:16,861 --> 01:25:23,283
- You're being ridiculous.
- I'd have held back if Cecil was different.

783
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:28,163
But he's the sort who can't know
anyone intimately, least of all a woman.

784
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,166
He doesn't know what a woman is.

785
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:37,923
He wants you for a possession,
to look at like a painting or an ivory box.

786
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,592
Something to own and to display.

787
01:25:41,594 --> 01:25:46,348
He doesn't want you to be real,
to think and to live. He doesn't love you.

788
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:51,520
But I love you. I want you
to have your own thoughts and ideas,

789
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:54,189
even when I hold you in my arms.

790
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:58,944
Miss Bartlett, you wouldn't stop us,
not if you understood.

791
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,655
It's our last chance.

792
01:26:04,367 --> 01:26:08,662
Do you understand how lucky
people are to find what's right for them?

793
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:11,498
It's such a blessing, don't you see?

794
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,671
And the fact I love Cecil and shall be
his wife shortly is of no importance?

795
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:22,926
This tremendous thing has happened
between us and it means ...

796
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:26,138
It means nothing must hinder us ever again.

797
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,641
You have to understand that.

798
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,230
- I've no idea what you mean.
- Everyone must understand.

799
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:37,316
And you must leave.

800
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:41,695
It was wrong of me to listen to you.

801
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:45,741
But you haven't been listening.
If you had, you would know!

802
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:48,827
- Leave at once. Now.
- Lucy ...

803
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:53,707
- No, I will not listen to one more word.
- My dears, do stop.

804
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,627
Haven't you done enough?
Don't interfere again.

805
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:03,884
- It's useless. Let me go, Miss Bartlett.
- Let Mr. Emerson go, Charlotte.

806
01:27:12,143 --> 01:27:15,270
- I shall never forgive myself.
- You always say that,

807
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,439
but you always do forgive yourself.

808
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:30,535
Why does Italy make lady novelists
reach such summits of absurdity?

809
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,665
Lucy, it's still light enough for another set.

810
01:27:35,083 --> 01:27:38,252
- Mr. Emerson has had to go.
- What a nuisance.

811
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:45,550
I say, Cecil, do play, there's a good chap.
Just this once. It's Floyd's last day.

812
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:52,766
Freddy, as you remarked this morning,
some chaps are good for nothing but books.

813
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:55,686
I plead guilty to being such a chap.

814
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:12,202
Because I wouldn't play tennis?

815
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:18,959
I never do play tennis. I never could.

816
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:22,129
Forget tennis. It was just the last straw.

817
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:26,425
I'm sorry, I can't marry you.
One day you'll be glad I said so.

818
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,678
- We're too different.
- But I ...

819
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:33,724
I love you.

820
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:40,355
And I did think you loved me.

821
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:41,898
I did not.

822
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,613
I thought I did at first. I'm sorry.

823
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:55,037
As for your loving me, you don't, not really.

824
01:28:56,831 --> 01:29:00,000
You don't. It's only as something else.

825
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:05,964
As something you own. A painting, a Leonardo.

826
01:29:06,049 --> 01:29:09,718
I don't want to be a Leonardo,
I want to be myself.

827
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:13,180
Oh, let's not go on now.

828
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:16,850
I'll only say things
that will make me unhappy afterwards.

829
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:39,247
You don't love me, evidently.

830
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,541
I dare say you're right not to ...

831
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:48,340
... but it would help a little,
hurt a little less, if I knew why.

832
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:52,010
Because ...

833
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,848
... you can't know anyone intimately,
least of all a woman.

834
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:02,979
I don't mean exactly that,
but you will go on asking questions.

835
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,734
You wrap yourself up in art,
and want to wrap me up,

836
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:09,945
so I'm breaking it off.

837
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,572
It's true.

838
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:16,326
True, on the whole.

839
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:24,459
You're so different tonight, like a different
person speaking with a new voice.

840
01:30:24,627 --> 01:30:30,590
What do you mean? If you think
I love someone else, you're mistaken.

841
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:33,093
Of course I don't. I only meant that ...

842
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:38,682
There was a force in you
I hadn't known of up to now.

843
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:46,398
If a girl breaks off her engagement,
everyone thinks, "Oh, she has someone else."

844
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,942
It's disgusting, brutal!

845
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:54,906
Forgive me if I say stupid things.
My brain has gone to pieces.

846
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,951
I think we'd better go to bed, if you don't mind.

847
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,671
Let me do that for you.

848
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:19,431
I must actually thank you for what you've done.

849
01:31:22,101 --> 01:31:25,270
For showing me what I really am.

850
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:38,867
I admire your courage.

851
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:45,165
Will you shake hands?

852
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,792
Of course I will, Cecil.

853
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:51,505
Good night.

854
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:53,965
I'm sorry about it.

855
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,137
Thank you for taking it so well.

856
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:37,300
Since the days are chillier now
and we've not, alas, a home of our own,

857
01:32:37,468 --> 01:32:41,972
my sister feels we might benefit
by travel to a warmer clime.

858
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:47,978
The doctor has ordered her special bread,
but we can take that with us.

859
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:52,524
It is only getting first into a steamer
and then a train.

860
01:32:56,153 --> 01:33:00,532
- Hello. So you're off, Mr. Vyse?
- Yes.

861
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:07,289
I've come to show Miss Honeychurch
a letter from our friends the Miss Alans.

862
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:14,838
"Since Florence did my sister so much good,
we think we should try Athens this winter."

863
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:20,093
Isn't it wonderful?
The Parthenon, the frieze of Phydias.

864
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:23,430
- Have you ever met these Miss Alans?
- Never.

865
01:33:23,514 --> 01:33:27,517
Then you cannot appreciate
the romance of this visit.

866
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:31,187
I've never been myself,
nor do I have any plans to go.

867
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:36,610
Altogether too big for our little lot,
don't you agree? Got any matches?

868
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:37,861
Thank you.

869
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:42,616
You're quite right.
Greece is not for our little lot.

870
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,118
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

871
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:57,047
Mr. Beebe! Matches!

872
01:33:58,174 --> 01:33:59,716
Matches!

873
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,846
Cecil's hard hit. Lucy won't marry him.

874
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:08,141
- When?
- Late last night. I must go.

875
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:11,269
- Will they want me to go down?
- Yes. Goodbye.

876
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:17,817
All right, Powell.

877
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:31,539
No, Charlotte. Not the scissors,
not when my hands are full.

878
01:34:31,707 --> 01:34:34,751
- Good afternoon.
- How do you do, Mr. Beebe?

879
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:38,380
- Good gracious! What a mess things are!
- Yes.

880
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:43,176
Everyone's so horrid today, Uncle Arthur.
Let's go out to tea.

881
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:47,931
Good idea. Get your hat and coat
and I'll take you.

882
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:52,727
I'll take Minnie to the Beehive Tavern.
Care to join us, Miss Bartlett?

883
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,980
Oh, yes, Charlotte! I don't mind.

884
01:34:56,065 --> 01:35:00,360
No. You have no one to help.
My services are better than nothing.

885
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:05,490
Oh, dear, Marian. I'm so sorry.

886
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:23,842
A delightful letter from the Miss Alans.
They're going to Greece. I'll read you some.

887
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:34,018
"Dear Mr. Beebe, I doubt we shall go
any further than Athens,

888
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:40,358
"but, if you know of a good pensione
in Constantinople, we should be so grateful."

889
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:46,823
Isn't that delightful? I do believe
they'll end by going round the world.

890
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,742
Delightful.

891
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:55,832
Miss Honeychurch, your brother has told me.

892
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,795
- Did he?
- I needn't say it will go no further.

893
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:09,220
Mother ... Charlotte ... Cecil ... Freddy ... you ...

894
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:15,018
If I may say so,
I'm certain you've done the right thing.

895
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:19,272
Tell me more of the Miss Alans.
How splendid of them to go abroad.

896
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:26,279
I want them to start from Venice and then
go by cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast.

897
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:31,284
- Did Freddy say he'd drive straight back?
- No, he didn't.

898
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,453
I hope he won't gossip.

899
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:37,540
How splendid of them to go.
I wish they'd take me.

900
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,876
Would your mother spare you?

901
01:36:40,085 --> 01:36:43,213
She must. I simply must go away.

902
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:46,132
I have to. Don't you see I have to go away?

903
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,969
Charlotte, the Miss Alans
are going to Constantinople.

904
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,597
No, only to Athens.

905
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:56,100
I've longed to go to Constantinople ...
Athens, I mean.

906
01:36:56,185 --> 01:37:01,231
In lieu of Constantinople,
could not we lure you to tea at the Beehive?

907
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:06,694
- No, thank you.
- Oh, well, Minnie, you and I must eat alone.

908
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:09,531
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe.

909
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:19,207
- You must persuade Mother.
- What?

910
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:23,545
Don't you see? I must go somewhere.
Anywhere!

911
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:27,632
I must get away, far, before it's known.

912
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:31,302
- What?
- That I've broken off my engagement.

913
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:35,807
- He mustn't get any ideas.
- You mean Mr. Emerson?

914
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:38,101
Charlotte, how slow you are.

915
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:42,939
There must be no gossip
at Summer Street, but to go as far as Greece!

916
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:49,028
I thought you'd be the first to go to
Mother and say Lucy must go to Greece.

917
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:54,033
Lucy, are you absolutely sure?
I only want to do what is right for you.

918
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:57,912
I'm telling you what's right.
Don't argue, do it!

919
01:37:58,163 --> 01:37:59,706
All right.

920
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:03,418
Thank you, Freddy.

921
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,923
Why does she look like that?

922
01:38:09,008 --> 01:38:12,260
- Like what?
- Like Charlotte Bartlett.

923
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:17,015
Because she is Charlotte Bartlett.

01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:45,251
- Marian?
- Oh, Charlotte!

930
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:49,464
- Lucy has a plan.
- Isn't this a tragedy?

931
01:38:49,798 --> 01:38:53,593
I get one thing tied up
and another thing falls over.

932
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:58,306
- The Misses Alan are going to Greece.
- Good luck to them.

933
01:38:58,390 --> 01:39:01,893
Lucy would like to join them
as far as Athens.

934
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:07,440
- She'd what?
- And on to Delphi if the roads are safe.

You can take all those, but leave me
Thoreau till I go. I need him by me now.

940
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,653
It's an ugly house. We never liked it.

941
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:02,745
I mustn't miss the train.
The removers can do the rest.

942
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:04,122
Oh, I ...

943
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:08,084
No. I don't want you straining your back.

944
01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:12,338
I won't be down at the weekend.
There's no point.

945
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,760
I'll come to take you back to town
the week after.

946
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:53,671
Paper soap is a great help towards
freshening up one's face on a train.

947
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:59,552
But you know about these matters,
and you have Mr. Vyse to help you.

948
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:02,221
A gentleman is such a standby.

949
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:05,683
It's so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you.

950
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:08,561
Perhaps he will join you later.

951
01:41:08,896 --> 01:41:14,067
- Or does work keep him in London?
- We shall meet him when he sees you off.

952
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,195
No one will see Lucy off. She doesn't like it.

953
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,363
Really?

954
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:22,325
But, in this case ...

955
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:26,662
- You aren't going?
- Yes, we've a train to catch.

956
01:41:26,747 --> 01:41:31,167
- It's been such a pleasure to meet you.
- We will write you often

957
01:41:31,251 --> 01:41:34,629
and send pretty cards from every place.

958
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:41,803
- Thank you so much for taking her.
- Bye-bye.

959
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:44,597
Well, we got through that time.

960
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,308
Yes, and were seen through,
which is most unpleasant.

961
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:52,355
I cannot understand
this hole and corner business.

962
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:56,275
You got rid of Cecil, well and good.

963
01:41:58,153 --> 01:42:00,905
I'm thankful. Why not announce it?

964
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:05,910
- I promised. It's only for a few days.
- Victoria Station.

965
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:11,415
I couldn't help thinking
that our dear Lucy did not ... No.

966
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:15,795
I wish you'd finish your sentences.
You're getting worse.

967
01:42:17,339 --> 01:42:20,675
Did not look like a bride-to-be.

968
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:26,931
How should one look? According to your
great experience in these matters.

969
01:42:27,015 --> 01:42:31,853
I can't say exactly.
Only she lacked something.

970
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:37,650
And, if you want to know,
Teresa, she lacked radiance.

971
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:56,002
- Miss Bartlett.
- Mr. Beebe.

972
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:59,922
- What is happening to your neighbors?
- They're moving.

973
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:04,677
Old Mr. Emerson's rheumatism is back,
and George thinks it's too far.

974
01:43:05,053 --> 01:43:07,680
Mr. Emerson is avoiding the removers inside.

975
01:43:07,764 --> 01:43:11,893
Might I impose and wait here
for Mrs. Honeychurch?

976
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:16,355
By all means. I'm afraid you must excuse me.

977
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:21,402
Mr. Emerson, Miss Bartlett, excuse me.

978
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:23,613
Oh, please.

979
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:27,783
I am sorry that the house
has brought on your rheumatism.

980
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:31,579
It's not the rheumatism, it's my boy.

981
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:34,832
George is so sorry.

982
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:39,295
I cannot blame him,
but I wish he'd told me about it first.

983
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:44,008
- He never told you what happened in Italy?
- Not a word.

984
01:43:45,427 --> 01:43:48,429
No. Lucy said he wouldn't.

985
01:43:48,513 --> 01:43:50,598
I was only told last Sunday.

986
01:43:50,766 --> 01:43:53,643
- What were you told?
- That he loves her.

987
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:58,981
Won't you sit down?

988
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,859
I think I hear the carriage.

989
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:05,029
It would be discourteous
to keep my cousin waiting.

990
01:44:05,113 --> 01:44:06,697
There isn't any carriage.

991
01:44:08,367 --> 01:44:09,742
Sit down, my dear.

992
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:22,421
Everyone's been lying, except George.

993
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:28,302
And now here's Miss Honeychurch
marrying Mr. Vyse in January ...

994
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:31,347
She has broken off her engagement.

995
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:35,810
It was all done with great
tact and discretion, naturally.

996
01:44:35,894 --> 01:44:40,064
And, for the time being,
we would like to keep it quiet.

997
01:44:40,148 --> 01:44:45,903
There's a time for keeping quiet
and there's a time for speaking out.

998
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:49,657
Now, you don't hear any carriage.

999
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:54,495
Why don't you sit back, make yourself
more comfortable? Take this.

1000
01:44:55,706 --> 01:44:58,249
There. You look much better.

1001
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:02,753
So she's not marrying Mr. Vyse?

1002
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:08,634
Why? Why Greece?

1003
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,680
Why rush off to the ends of the earth?

1004
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:17,810
You're tired of your home.
You're tired of Windy Corner.

1005
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:19,979
And you're tired of Freddy and me.

1006
01:45:22,190 --> 01:45:27,653
Of course I'm not tired of Windy Corner,
but, as we're talking about it,

1007
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:30,781
I shall want to come up to London more.

1008
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:34,952
I might even share a flat
for a little with some other girl.

1009
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:39,040
You see, I come into my money next year.

1010
01:45:40,959 --> 01:45:44,628
To mess about with typewriters
and latchkeys and call it work.

1011
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:49,592
- Perhaps I spoke hastily.
- Oh, goodness!

1012
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:52,136
You remind me of Charlotte Bartlett!

1013
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,889
- Charlotte?
- Charlotte to a T.

1014
01:45:59,478 --> 01:46:02,897
I don't know what you mean.
We are not the least alike.

1015
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:08,277
- You never used to be.
- Can't we have the hood down?

1016
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:19,205
Can we have the hood down, Powell?

1017
01:46:30,008 --> 01:46:32,426
Powell, is that house to be let again?

1018
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:35,763
Sir Harry's looking for new tenants,
I hear, Miss.

1019
01:46:35,972 --> 01:46:38,849
What a pity about the Emersons.

1020
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:43,020
Freddy will be so sorry.
And, indeed, so am I.

1021
01:46:43,271 --> 01:46:47,483
- All right, Powell, stop at the stores.
- Yes, ma'am. Walk on.

1022
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,904
Such an agreeable family.
What a pity.

1023
01:47:06,795 --> 01:47:09,296
No Charlotte.

1024
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:11,382
Go and see if she's at Mr. Beebe's.

1025
01:47:12,092 --> 01:47:15,886
And do hurry, both of you.
Mary has her fish pie in.

1026
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:20,724
Did you hear what I said, Lucy?

1027
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:34,071
Lucy!

1028
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:40,870
Mr. Emerson says it's all his fault.

1029
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,997
I told him to trust to love.

1030
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:49,378
I told him, "George, love and do
what you will." It's what I taught him.

1031
01:47:50,088 --> 01:47:52,047
So you see, it is all my fault.

1032
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:55,092
Where are you going?

1033
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:59,221
Your mother offered
to fetch me in her carriage.

1034
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:04,602
I have not been brought up to keep
anyone waiting, least of all a kind hostess.

1035
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,900
And now where's Lucy?

1036
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:16,530
Get in. If Mary's fish pie spoils,
she'll mope till next Friday.

1037
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:18,574
- I will sit here.
- Nonsense.

1038
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:23,829
- I mustn't inconvenience you.
- You know you prefer facing.

1039
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:29,793
I've no wish to even hear your son's name
mentioned. He has misbehaved from the first.

1040
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:35,216
In fact, he behaved abominably.

1041
01:48:35,634 --> 01:48:39,970
Not abominably. He only tried
when he should not have tried.

1042
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:46,810
No, of course,
abominable is too strong a word.

1043
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:53,567
- It's no good discussing this.
- George is taking me to London.

1044
01:48:54,444 --> 01:48:57,821
He can't bear to be here,
and I must be where he is.

1045
01:48:58,949 --> 01:49:04,537
He says the thought of
seeing you or hearing about you ...

1046
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:08,707
Mr. Emerson, please don't go on my account.
I'm going to Greece.

1047
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:13,712
Don't leave your comfortable house.
You mustn't!

1048
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:16,048
Why are you going to Greece?

1049
01:49:17,759 --> 01:49:21,303
Forgive me, but it seems to me
you're in a muddle.

1050
01:49:21,513 --> 01:49:27,017
I think the reason you're going to Greece
and you've broken off your engagement,

1051
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:32,898
Miss Bartlett told me,
is that you love George.

1052
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:39,154
All the light's gone out of your pretty face.

1053
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,324
Just like it's gone out of George.

1054
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:47,871
I can't bear it and now
I've made you cry. Forgive me.

1055
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:52,376
But I've got to go to Greece now.
The ticket's bought and everything.

1056
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:57,047
- It's impossible!
- There's only one thing impossible.

1057
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:01,468
That's to love and to part.

1058
01:50:02,637 --> 01:50:04,096
Lucy!

1059
01:50:06,975 --> 01:50:08,684
You love George.

1060
01:50:09,561 --> 01:50:14,064
You love the boy body and soul,
as he loves you.

1061
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:16,609
But of course I do.

1062
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:18,777
What did you all think?

1063
01:50:19,362 --> 01:50:23,657
- Then ...
-  No. Mother's calling. I've got to go.

1064
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:26,702
They trust me.

1065
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:30,539
Why should they?
When you deceived everyone

1066
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:33,876
including yourself.

1067
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:41,508
Charlotte, sit here. Go on, Powell.

1068
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:50,142
- One week Italy, then Greece.
- Greece may be canceled.

1069
01:50:50,226 --> 01:50:52,269
- What?
- Do stop!

1070
01:50:52,354 --> 01:50:55,481
- I think Lucy has something to tell us.
- Stop the horse!

1071
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:13,499
Dear Charlotte, after an awful journey

1072
01:51:13,583 --> 01:51:17,670
when our luggage went missing twice,
we reached Florence.

1073
01:51:17,837 --> 01:51:22,341
You'll be glad to hear that
the Pensione Bertolini is its dear self.

1074
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:26,345
The Cockney signora still terrorizes the staff.

1075
01:51:26,554 --> 01:51:31,058
Her guests are another set of
Miss Alans, Miss Lavish, Mr. Beebe

1076
01:51:31,142 --> 01:51:35,270
- and Charlotte and Lucy.
- We were promised rooms with a view.

1077
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:41,777
Hush, we mustn't. First thing tomorrow,
I shall have a bone to pick with the signora.

1078
01:51:42,153 --> 01:51:43,737
It's so unfair!

1079
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:49,451
Don't you agree that, on one's first visit to
Florence, one must have a room with a view?

1080
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:51,453
We have a view.

1081
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:10,180
Kiss me again.

1082
01:52:10,473 --> 01:52:13,225
- Again.
- I'm reading.

1083
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:17,730
- What are you reading?
- It's from Freddy.

1084
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:19,440
What does he say?

1085
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:25,446
Silly boy, he thinks he's being dignified.

1086
01:52:25,905 --> 01:52:30,159
I mean, everybody knew
we were going away in the spring.
