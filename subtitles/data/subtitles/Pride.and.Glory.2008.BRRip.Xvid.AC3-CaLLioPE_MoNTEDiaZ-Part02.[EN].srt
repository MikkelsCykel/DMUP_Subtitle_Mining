00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Are you alone?.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,440
- Yeah.
- Don't fuck with me, man.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,440
- I swear to God, don't fuck with me.
- I'm not, man. I'm being straight.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,120
Nobody knows I'm here,
nobody knows you're here.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,600
You recording this?.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,520
Do you want me to?.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,760
You got a recorder?.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
No.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,040
Then I don't want you to record it.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,680
Okay.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,720
All right, look, you could just...
You just talk, all right?.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,920
Tell me anything you wanna say,
I won't interrupt you. Say whatever.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,680
So you can get my story, right?.
So you can fuck me.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,920
- Turn my name to shit, is that it?.
- Hey, Sandy. You called me.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm not a priest, I'm a writer.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,080
I came down here to freeze my ass off
sitting in this fucking car. I did my part.

17
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,920
I gotta get this out of me.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,200
- I gotta get this out.
- What?.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,640
We're all dirty.

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,160
We sold our shields off,
highest bidder, murder for hire.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,840
Stole drugs off dead men, planted shit...

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,200
...beat suspects.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,160
We robbed and...

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
We condemned four of our own to die.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,880
- What are you talking about?.
- Washington Heights.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,920
We sent them into a slaughter.

27
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,880
- Who?. Who, Sandy?. Who sent those men?.
- I fucking told you, no names!

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
I can't undo it now.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,640
There's no atoning.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm gonna burn, man.
I'm gonna fucking burn.

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,680
No, no, no. No, this is-
We can work this out, okay?.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,920
- No, no, no.
- Look, I'm gonna call my city desk.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,440
All right?. I'm gonna call my editor.
All right?.

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,440
To save space for your story, okay?.
Your story.

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,040
Okay?.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,400
Becoming a cop...

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,560
...the respect that earned us...

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,960
...the pledge we took...

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,760
...to uphold something honest...

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,520
Being in the blue, wearing that shield...

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,320
...the pride that I felt...

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,600
...the fucking glory...

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,000
We let it all go out from under us.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,680
I was a good man once.

46
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,400
Who is it?.

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
It's Kenny.

48
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,440
What does he want?.

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,160
I just got up.
How the fuck should I know?.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,920
Jesus Christ.

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,360
We're about to get fucked.

52
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,120
He's dead. Jimmy, he's fucking dead.

53
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,760
Sandy fucking killed himself.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,600
Shh. Come on.

55
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
Ladies and gentlemen...

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
...it is with sorrow
and a deep sense of regret...

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,560
...that I appear before you today.

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
At 10:30 p. m. last night...

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,120
...Officer Ruben Santiago of the
31 st Precinct in Washington Heights...

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
...took his own life.

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,720
Officer Santiago...

62
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,680
...along with the four officers slain
in Washington Heights...

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,080
...had formed an illicit criminal cabal.

64
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,680
Working in collusion
and under the aegis of the N.Y.P D...

65
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,640
...these officers undertook all manner
of criminal misdeed.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,880
Investigators from Internal Affairs
have isolated the involvement...

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
Where the hell have you been?.
... of this rogue unit...

68
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
- ... to the deceased men.
- Yeah, we need to talk.

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,760
- No other officer in 31 st Precinct...
- Yeah, okay. Tonight.

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,280
- ... has been found culpable of...
- You be there.

71
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,560
...or in any way linked
to this criminal conspiracy.

72
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
Francis.

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,480
Francis.

74
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,440
What the hell is going on here?.

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,800
- I can't talk, Pop, I gotta go.
- What the hell is going on here, Francis?.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,760
How involved are you?.

77
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
Look at me.

78
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,120
Look at me.

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Did you know what they were doing?.

80
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,320
I knew enough.

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,240
Dad, come on, man. All those years,
you never got jammed up?.

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,360
- It never came down on top of you?.
- No.

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,200
Because I kept my head up.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,920
All I took was a check cut by the city.
That's all I took.

85
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,440
I didn't take any money.
I didn't take a fucking cent.

86
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Then what?. What did you do?.

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,400
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.
- Francis, sit down. Let's talk.

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
- I'm here to help you, Franny.
- I can't do this now, Pop. I gotta go.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,640
I gotta do this my way, all right?.
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,680
Happy New Year!

91
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,600
Happy fucking New Year!

92
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Taxi!

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
Thanks.

94
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Fuck!

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,640
Move, I'll break it off.

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,880
Who are you?.

97
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,760
Bragon, Carlos Bragon.
I'm a reporter, for chrissake!

98
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,280
- You know me, Tierney.
- Shut up, shut up!

99
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,920
You know me, Tierney. You know me.

100
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Yeah, I know you, you fucking hack.

101
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,480
What the fuck are you doing following me?.
What do you want?.

102
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm writing a story.

103
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,600
I got two versions,
I wanna run them by you.

104
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,480
First one goes like this:

105
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,120
Hero detective captures cop killer.
Kills him in self-defense.

106
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,840
Yeah, what else?.

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,920
The other one is key witness
in a cop-corruption case...

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,320
...dies mysteriously in the presence
of cops from the 31 st Precinct.

109
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,160
- Which one sounds better?.
- Whatever sells more papers, right?.

110
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,160
Yeah, I know cops from the 31
were there before you, Ray.

111
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
That's your brother's house, isn't it?.

112
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Sources are telling me that Angel Tezo
was tortured and was executed.

113
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,680
He had half his teeth shoved down
to his belly, splinters in his throat.

114
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,520
- You carry a stick?.
- Keep pushing me, you're gonna find out.

115
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm trying to help you. Be smart.

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,720
I can be writing a story
about Ray Tierney.

117
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
But I should be writing a story
about the 31.

118
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,240
You were there. Here's your opportunity
to set it straight right now.

119
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,680
I don't like my odds with you.

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,400
Last cop you talked to
blew his brains out in your car.

121
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Last time I saw you, you were
feeding bullshit to the grand jury.

122
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,040
I was only sitting there
because of your hard-on to crucify cops.

123
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,160
I do. Because they were protecting
their own and burying the truth.

124
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Don't talk to me about the truth. You got
no idea what it takes to do what we do.

125
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,560
- You weren't there.
- You wanna know what I know?.

126
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,040
I know you took a bullet in the face
during the raid.

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,640
I know Kareem Aldovise, a 19-year-old
kid, went off that roof and died.

128
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Everybody knows that.

129
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,080
Yeah, and I know a witness
saw him surrender before they did it.

130
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,600
He had no priors, he had no gun.

131
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,320
You wanna bullshit the grand jury, fine.
Don't do it to me.

132
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,240
Well, in case you didn't hear, they cleared
us two years ago, okay?. Case closed.

133
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,680
So don't get in my face because you're
skeeved about losing your Pulitzer.

134
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,880
But you know what?.
I don't really think about it that much.

135
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,600
Wake up, all right?. Come on.

136
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,800
Jimmy!

137
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,320
Jimmy!

138
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
Help.

139
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
Help me, Jimmy.

140
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,560
Hey, boss.

141
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
Where is he?.

142
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,880
Have you lost your fucking mind?.

143
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,760
Mayor goes on TV, moans the loss, gives us
a clean bill of health. What's the problem?.

144
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,040
I asked you point-blank, "Were you
involved in this?. " What did you say?.

145
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
I said what you wanted to hear.

146
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,240
- I wanted the fucking truth.
- What truth?.

147
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,440
Truth about the money we were getting?.
The dirty cops you preside over?.

148
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,000
You knew. All you cared about
was your promotion.

149
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,920
- I knew what was fucking going on?.
- Yeah.

150
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,960
I gave you room to get the job done.
If you took a little here...

151
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,200
...I wasn't looking.
But you crossed the line.

152
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,400
What, you think because you didn't
take an envelope, it absolves you?.

153
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,720
Silk hat, same pig.

154
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,440
Crimes down, collars up.
It's what you wanted.

155
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,920
End justifies the means, buddy boy.

156
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,400
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

157
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,920
You think you can set Ray up for this?.
You are dead fucking wrong.

158
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,240
We took you in.
You were a fucking brother to us.

159
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,760
My sister's your wife, your family's my
family, and you jam us up like this?.

160
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,440
I jam you?. I saved you.
It's a lay-up, Fran.

161
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh, yeah?. How's that, Jimmy?.
Run that by me.

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,800
- Ray sticks to the story, he's a hero.
- That's not gonna happen.

163
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,560
- You're gonna make this right, or I swear-
- Or what?.

164
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,080
What the fuck are you gonna do, Franny?.

165
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,880
You gonna burn down your own house?.
Blow up everything you worked for?.

166
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
All Ray's gotta do is walk into IAB...

167
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,760
...say what needs to be said,
end of fucking story.

168
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,120
- We go home, we go to sleep at night.
- You think this ends that simply?.

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,040
We all go to sleep at night. Let me tell you,
what we've done does not get forgiven.

170
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,560
Here we go with the
Sister Mary Margarets.

171
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,360
Someone says you're dirty, who cares?.

172
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,640
They say you're fucking corrupt.
Fuck them.

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
Do they know how these animals live?.

174
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,240
We tour the sewers, Franny!

175
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,320
I will not apologize for doing what I do.
I earn 65 grand a year.

176
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Some fuck like Tezo wipes his ass
with that shit in a week.

177
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,960
We're in this together, Franny.

178
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,000
- What the fuck is that?.
- It's your cut. I've been keeping it for you.

179
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Take the fucking money, Franny.

180
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
You were my brother, Jimmy.

181
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,120
Franny. Take-

182
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,760
Fuck.

183
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,720
Yeah, Tierney.

184
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa. IAB?.

185
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,280
Well, no, no,
but I thought I'd have some time.

186
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,480
Detective, let me start
by saying we're aware...

187
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,280
...of your outstanding service record...

188
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,200
...and we wanna thank you
for your role in solving this case.

189
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,440
We 're gonna make this as brief as possible,
gonna get you out of here.

190
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
We need a statement detailing your
participation in the incident on record.

191
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,160
Now, you declined to give a
statement at the scene of the shooting.

192
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,480
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

193
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,600
Mr. Tezo was tried and sentenced
in a bathroom in the Bronx.

194
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,880
But you're prepared to give us one now?

195
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,320
Far removed from a jury.

196
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,680
- Far removed from a judge.
- I'm gonna do my best.

197
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,680
Far removed from our basic rights
endowed on all men by our Constitution.

198
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,800
This march will commence at noon.

199
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
Can you explain how your investigation
led to the apprehension of Tezo?

200
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
- and end up on the steps
of the 31 st Precinct.

201
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,240
Angel Tezo was identified by
witnesses at the scene of the shooting.

202
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,800
I sought information
regarding his whereabouts...

203
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,120
...from a former confidential informant.

204
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,360
He directed me to the location in question
in Morrisania...

205
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
...and I followed that lead.

206
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,400
The reverend reiterated
that this planned march is about peace...

207
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,880
...and is not intended as a condemnation
of the entire N. Y.P.D.

208
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,480
His target: the 31st Precinct...

209
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,200
...and the officers involved in the
Angel Tezo killing.

210
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,080
The investigation is continuing.

211
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,560
- Now, did you pursue this lead alone?.
- No.

212
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,800
I called the task force.
I spoke to my colleague, Detective Miller.

213
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,680
I told him where I was going.
I requested backup, and he initiated that.

214
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,960
But you arrived on the location alone.

215
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,560
I arrived before the rest of the team, yes.

216
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,320
Okay.

217
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,640
Now, could you describe for us what
transpired at the location in question...

218
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,920
...leading up to you having to
discharge your weapon?.

219
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,800
Detective?.

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,320
This isn't gonna go how you want it to.

221
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,640
Excuse me?.

222
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,640
I know what you guys want me to say...

223
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,440
...but it's not gonna happen.

224
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,120
No one's looking for you to say anything
except your version of what happened.

225
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,400
- Really?.
- All we need is a full accounting...

226
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,360
...of what happened,
then we can go home.

227
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,480
Yeah, I know what you need.

228
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,560
But I can't give it to you,
because I didn't shoot him.

229
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,040
Are you aware that ballistics
has confirmed that the perp was killed...

230
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,920
...by three bullets fired from your gun
at close range?

231
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,240
I am.

232
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,280
But you maintain
that you didn't shoot him?

233
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,880
I do.

234
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,440
Could you elaborate on that?
No, I would not care to.

235
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,640
What are you saying, detective?

236
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
From here on out, nothing.

237
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,280
I respectfully refuse
to answer any further questions.

238
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,360
Are you denying that you
were involved in the Angel Tezo killing?

239
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,920
I respectfully refuse
to answer any more questions.

240
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,360
If you don't start answering,
this is gonna go bad.

241
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,960
We can do this all afternoon...

242
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,640
...but I have nothing more to say
in this matter.

243
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,440
This wasn't like Ray. He's not that guy.

244
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,760
He's a fucking good cop.

245
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,600
He's a good man.

246
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,960
He said something about Lonnie Mercer,
"Lonnie and I. "

247
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,640
I remember that they were close.
They were partners.

248
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,480
Lonnie Mercer, one of the officers
killed in the Washington Heights raid?

249
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
That's right.

250
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,640
What happened next?

251
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,720
I tried to revive Mr. Tezo.

252
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,480
I didn't know if he'd had a heart attack...

253
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,880
...or if he was still alive.
I tried to revive him.

254
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,800
I checked for a pulse,
I couldn't find a fucking pulse.

255
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,320
He looked pretty fucking dead.

256
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,480
So I did some fucking CPR.

257
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,520
After I tried to revive him,
I was still kneeling over the body.

258
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,520
That's when the shots went off.

259
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,800
Oh, fuck.

260
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,600
Who was shot?

261
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,760
- Mr. Tezo was shot?
- Yeah.

262
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,640
Yeah, he was shot. Yeah, he was shot.

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,960
Got what he fucking deserved.
Got what he fucking deserved.

264
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,520
Who shot Mr. Tezo?

265
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,360
I would've done the same thing myself.

266
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,680
Who shot Angel Tezo, Sergeant Egan?

267
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,200
Detective Tierney.

268
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,120
Detective Raymond Tierney?

269
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,120
Yes.

270
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,000
Listen, Frank...

271
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,440
...I know how this must feel,
and I wish I knew what to say.

272
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,120
But you should know that these officers
are all prepared to testify at a grand jury.

273
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,640
So what's critical now,
from here on out...

274
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,680
...is that we handle this thing quietly,
with as little incident as possible.

275
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,200
He's not capable of that.

276
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,600
I know my son. He's not capable of that.

277
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,920
Frank, we're gonna have to bring Ray in.

278
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
You okay?.

279
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,080
Hey.

280
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm proud of you.

281
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Call me when it's done.

282
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,320
They wanna take you in,
put "arrest pending " in the press tomorrow.

283
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm sitting there on my ass,
watching this fucking testimony.

284
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,320
You believe that shit
that Jimmy's spinning?.

285
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,400
- You gonna tell me you believe that?.
- Of course not. That's not the point.

286
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,960
I told you to run everything through me
and that we would handle it.

287
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,160
And then you sit down
with the goddamn IAB...

288
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,640
...and don't give me a heads up?.

289
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,000
No fucking phone call?.
You don't talk to me, Ray.

290
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm here. I'm telling you now, okay?.

291
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,280
Listen to me. Jimmy is a drug dealer, Pop.

292
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
He murdered that guy, and Fran is in it.
Pop, he's in up to his neck.

293
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Now, I tried. I tried to talk to Fran,
and when I sat in there with those guys...

294
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,520
...I gave them nothing.
I said as little as I could say.

295
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,440
But if Jimmy's gonna box me in, I gotta tell
them what I know. I got no fucking choice.

296
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,640
The fuck you got no choice.

297
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,360
You could've taken that lay-up
that they were handing you.

298
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,200
- Oh, no. No, Pop.
- And saved us a fucking mess.

299
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,080
Come on. What good would it have done?.

300
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,920
Jimmy's a scumbag. Jesus.
We'll take care of him.

301
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,960
But we got a hole that needs
to get plugged up...

302
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,280
...before it takes down
half the department.

303
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,160
It's too late, Pop.

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,240
We protect our own, Ray.

305
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,920
That is all I know. We protect our own.
You gotta show me some fucking loyalty.

306
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,440
No. Don't use that word with me. It doesn't
mean shit to me anymore, you know that?.

307
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,440
I done your loyalty. It cost me too much.

308
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,640
- What did it cost you?.
- It cost me everything!

309
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,720
It cost me the woman that I love.

310
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
Because she told me that we were wrong
on Mott Haven.

311
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,360
She told me. I didn't listen.

312
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,320
Look, you said you weren't sure about
what you saw. I heard it.

313
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,080
You heard what you wanted to hear.
Don't bullshit me.

314
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
It was a lie to protect a bad cop,
and you knew it, and I knew it.

315
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,200
And I got up there and said it
in front of the grand jury.

316
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,960
- I got it.
- I'm not gonna do this.

317
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,920
- Not for you.
- I'm responsible, huh?.

318
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,120
- This is my responsibility, this shit?.
- No. We did wrong. I wanna hear you say it.

319
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,640
Both of you, stop the yelling.

320
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,840
- Get out of here, Mo.
- No. Stop it.

321
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,640
- Get out of here.
- I am not leaving.

322
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,240
- This is not for you.
- No, no.

323
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,560
- I am not leaving.
- I don't want you hearing this.

324
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,200
Hey, hey, hey. Dad, take it easy.

325
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,960
- Don't yell at her.
- Get upstairs.

326
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,120
This is too much.

327
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,000
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

328
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
This is not just about the department.

329
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,800
That's not what we're talking about here.

330
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,520
This is family. This is our way of life.

331
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Jimmy is married to your sister.

332
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,880
He's the father of her children,
for chrissake.

333
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,200
And your brother is in a bad hour here,
and the only way through this is you.

334
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,520
You're the only door.

335
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,800
Jimmy is gonna take back his story.
I'll see to that.

336
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,920
And you just follow the crumbs
like they're laid out for you.

337
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,280
Take a deep breath
and say what needs to be said.

338
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,760
Like you believe it with every bone of your
body, and then we move through this thing.

339
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,960
- And that's what you're gonna do.
- No.

340
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,000
No, he's not gonna do that, Pop.

341
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,120
- Franny, listen.
- Ray is not getting hung out for what I did.

342
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,440
What I did.

343
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,000
He'll get a slap on the wrist,
nothing more.

344
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,920
- You're not thinking clearly, Franny.
- Yeah, I am.

345
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,240
Listen to me, Pop. This shit ends now.

346
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,160
Tonight.

347
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,400
And if that means
I can't be a cop anymore...

348
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
...I'm okay with that.

349
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,120
What do you want me to do?.

350
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,880
We're gonna get Jimmy.
That's what we're gonna do.

351
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,920
Yeah. Okay.

352
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,560
Just gonna make a stop over here.

353
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Real quick.

354
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,000
What are you doing?.

355
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,800
I gotta pick something up.

356
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,320
Picking up what?.
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?.

357
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,560
- I gotta make a collection.
- A collection with a gun?. Jesus, come on.

358
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,040
Jimmy told us to lay low.
Stay under the radar.

359
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,400
- You know what?. Fuck Jimmy.
- Fuck Jimmy?. What are you talking about?.

360
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,240
- Jimmy's looking out for us.
- Jimmy ain't looking out for me!

361
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
He ain't paying my fucking rent! I got no
fucking money in my pocket. I'm broke!

362
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,720
- Jeez, you coming with me or not?.
- No, I'm not coming, Eddie.

363
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,760
- Do what you wanna do. Stay here.
- I will fucking stay here.

364
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,360
Yo, bro.

365
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,400
No, I'm not a fucking cop anymore.
Get the fuck out of here.

366
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,280
You gotta do this every time?.

367
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,320
Let's fucking go, Eddie. Let's go.

368
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,160
- Shit, Eddie!
- Get down. get down.

369
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,720
Eddie, fucking- Eddie.

370
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,600
I see how it is.

371
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,800
Out of the store. I'm a cop. Out of the
fucking store. Get the fuck out of the store!

372
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,400
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the fucking gun now.

373
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,160
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Out now! Go.

374
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,760
- He got a gun, man.
- You! You!

375
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,040
- You!
Oh, shit.

376
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,960
Yo, that's that nigga right there.

377
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,640
- That's what I said.
- You sure?.

378
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,720
Yes, I'm sure.

379
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,760
No, I can't talk right now, Megan.

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I know it, I'm with him.

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
No, we'll call you soon.

382
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,520
Okay.

383
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,560
He's at Irish Eyes.

384
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,920
You motherfucker, unlock that door!

385
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,480
You stupid, stupid idiot, Eddie.
You fucking...

386
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,640
How do I get out of here?.

387
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,240
Is there another way out of here?.

388
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Tell me.
Is there another way out of here?.

389
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,520
- Back door.
- Fucking show me. Show me!

390
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,200
Goddamn it. Go right or left?.

391
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,920
Left.

392
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,240
Oh, shit! Is there another fucking exit?.

393
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,080
No, fuck it. Don't talk.

394
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,760
MAN Callback, Central.
Stand by, units.

395
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,960
- Tierney.
- We got a 10-30 on Audubon.

396
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,440
- I know. It's coming over the radio.
- That ain't the problem, I got a riot.

397
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,040
Wait, man, slow down.
I can't understand you. What?.

398
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,760
Looks like it's two guys from
your command. Two SNEU guys.

399
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,760
Who?.

400
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,400
I ' m on my way.

401
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,440
It's Dugan and Carbone.

402
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm gonna need units for crowd control.

403
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,160
You gotta go.

404
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,360
I'll get Jimmy.

405
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,120
Destroy that piece of shit!

406
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,080
I fucking told you not to do it.

407
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,000
Chief Tierney,
I'm Captain Lavier from Internal Affairs.

408
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,200
Have a warrant for your son's arrest.
We'd like him to come with us.

409
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
What makes you think he's here?.

410
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,040
Car's outside.

411
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,920
Got a message?. I'll tell him.

412
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,440
- How about if I come in myself and tell him?.
- No, you're not invited.

413
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,960
Now, get the hell off my porch
and take your boys with you.

414
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,440
Let's go.

415
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,920
You can tell your superiors I said so.

416
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,280
Let's go.

417
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,960
They got the fucking place surrounded.
Just get down here, Jimmy.

418
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,320
We'll meet back here.

419
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,640
What's going down in there?. Pepe okay?.

420
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,480
I hope Pepe killed 20
of you motherfuckers.

421
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,520
Let's go. Move back.

422
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,480
Do you believe this shit?.

423
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,040
- We got any communication established?.
- I requested Hostage Negotiation, sir.

424
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
- They give you an ETA?.
- Not yet, sir.

425
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,040
All right.
I want this perimeter pushed back.

426
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,040
Big Stevie, Ponch, you're my shooters.

427
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm going in.

428
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
Boss.

429
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
These are my guys.

430
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,800
I'm going in.

431
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,760
Where is everybody?. Get over there!

432
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,680
Let's go, move it!

433
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,480
Fuck, man. Come on, hurry up.

434
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,960
They knocked my tooth out. Black and blue.
My whole family disrespected.

435
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,200
These motherfuckers!

436
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,840
Whoa. Whoa, man, easy.

437
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,080
Kenny, easy.

438
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,080
Let's not lose our heads here.

439
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,680
I'm gonna fucking kill him, boss.

440
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,040
Kenny, just keep it calm, all right?.
It's just me.

441
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,600
Get them motherfuckers out of here!
It's on.

442
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,520
I swear to Jesus Christ,
I will fucking kill him, Franny.

443
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,560
In about two minutes,
we got everybody showing up here.

444
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,280
You do not want that to happen. You do not
want me to lose control of this scene.

445
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,880
Do not fucking play me, Franny.

446
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,520
There's no play here, Kenny.
There's no fucking play.

447
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,040
You wanna talk to me or
you wanna talk to a stranger?.

448
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Kenny.

449
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,480
Open the door.

450
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,760
Police. I want everyone
out of this bar right now.

451
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,520
You too, Mac.

452
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,400
You got anything you wanna say to me
about what you've done?.

453
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,080
You left me no choice, Ray.

454
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,480
Push to shove, it's me and mine.
It's Megan and the kids.

455
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,200
After that, it's every swinging dick
for himself.

456
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,000
You broke our fucking hearts, Jimmy.

457
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,840
Lot of hearts broken, Ray.

458
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,640
There's a lot of hearts broken.

459
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,800
So how do you think this ends?.

460
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,560
You gonna take me in?.

461
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,080
Take your gun out and put it on the bar.

462
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Turn on me, Ray!

463
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,800
- I'm so fucking tired.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

464
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,040
I'm gonna send in a crew! Open it up!
Let's go, let's go!

465
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,960
Back! Everybody step back.

466
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,240
You gotta push these guys back.

467
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,800
- Ray. Ray.
- Shut up, Jimmy.

468
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
- Move. Move.
- Ray.

469
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,680
That's him. That's that nigga Egan. Go.

470
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,440
- Get behind me.
- Take the cuffs off.

471
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
- Shut up. Get behind me.
- Yo, that's him!

472
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Right there. Police
officer. Stay back. This man's under arrest.

473
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,160
Take the cuffs off, give me my gun.
Shut up.

474
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,240
We want Egan, not you.
Walk away, you live.

475
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
Fuck you! Stay back.

476
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,080
- I'm not kidding.
- You gonna kill everybody?.

477
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,000
Try me.
They're gonna tear us apart.

478
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,520
- This ain't your fight.
- That nigga's dead. Give me that stick.

479
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,840
You walk out with me right now.
Let's go.

480
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
Jimmy!

481
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,760
Let him be. Let him be.

482
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,320
- You motherfuckers!
- Back off!

483
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,640
Jimmy!
Back the fuck off!

484
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,160
Jimmy!
Back off!

485
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,280
Back off! Nigga's mine.
This nigga's mine!

486
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,200
Get off of me, you motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

487
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,640
No! Don't you do it!
Don't you fucking do it!

488
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,960
Tell her I love her.

489
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,960
Don't you fucking do it! No! Jimmy!

490
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,800
No! No! Don't fucking do it!

491
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,200
Don't you do it!

492
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,240
Jimmy.

493
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,040
Detective Tierney. Your CO's my brother.

494
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,920
- You all right?.
- Yeah. I'm all right.

495
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,800
- You sure?.
- I'm all right.

496
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,240
You go find him, I got the brief.
Okay. Great job, boss.

497
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,960
Thanks.

498
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,880
Hi, chief. Couple of my suspended guys
were involved in this 30...

499
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,760
The fuck happened to you?.

500
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,400
What?.

501
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,800
Where's Jimmy?.

502
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,600
Let's go home.

503
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:37,600
