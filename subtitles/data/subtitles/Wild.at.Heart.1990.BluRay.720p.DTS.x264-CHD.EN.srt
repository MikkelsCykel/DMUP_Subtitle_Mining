00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,561
Hey, Sailor, wait!

2
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,565
I got something for you.

3
00:03:40,234 --> 00:03:42,861
Marietta tells me you were trying to

4
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,530
fuck her in the toilets.
- Oh, man...

5
00:03:45,946 --> 00:03:49,784
You crazy bad boy, trying to
fuck your girl's mama!

6
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:55,248
Tell me: How does
that little cunt Lula feel about that?

7
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,250
You know...

8
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:00,963
Marietta gave me this
to kill you.

9
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,965
And then she said
I'd be able to fuck Lula...

10
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:10,324
PEE DEE PENITENTIARY

11
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:39,104
22 MONTHS, 18 DAYS LATER

12
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,195
Hello...?
- Is Lula there?

13
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:50,322
Who is this?

14
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,492
Sailor Ripley.

15
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,705
Can I... talk to Lula?

16
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:01,042
There's no way in hell!

17
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,088
If you even think
about seeing Lula, you're dead. - What?

18
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:11,511
You heard me.
And don't you ever call here again!

19
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,191
Mama?

20
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:28,321
You know who that was.

21
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,782
And you know you aren't,

22
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,661
and I mean are not
gonna see him ever.

23
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:38,122
End of story!

24
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,667
Like hell!

25
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,986
Lula!

26
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,951
Sailor!
- Peanut!

27
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,869
Hey baby!

28
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,126
I've got a surprise for you!

29
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:28,672
Hey, my snakeskin jacket!
Thanks, baby! Did I ever tell you

30
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:34,053
that this jacket is a symbol of my
belief in personal freedom?

31
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,639
About 50,000 times.

32
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,476
I got us a room at
the Cape Fear. And guess what?

33
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,063
"Powermad" is at the "Hurricane"!

34
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,563
Stab it and steer!

35
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:30,276
Jeez Lou-eez, Sailor,
you are something else...

36
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,408
When I was 15,
my mama told me

37
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,495
that pretty soon
I'd be starting to think about sex,

38
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:43,541
and that I should tell her before
I did anything about it.

39
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,001
But I thought
you told me your uncle Pooch

40
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,796
raped you
when you was 13?

41
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,008
True.

42
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,760
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.

43
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:58,765
He was
a business partner of my daddy's.

44
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:03,478
Mama never knew 'bout me and him...

45
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:05,978
that's for damn sure.

46
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:10,567
You know what?
You're a pumpkin.

47
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh, my God! Get out!

48
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:49,773
Uncle Pooch died
in a car crash 3 months later,

49
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,943
on holiday in Myrtle Beach.

50
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,572
They still got
way too much traffic there.

51
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:58,658
Have you been
noticin' the buildup in traffic?

52
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,578
Here she goes again.

53
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:02,037
I'm sorry, Sailor,

54
00:10:02,663 --> 00:10:06,166
but that ozone layer is disappearin'.

55
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,502
One of these mornings, the sun's gonna

56
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:12,630
burn a hole clean through the earth
like an electrical X-ray.

57
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,507
That won't happen, honey.

58
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:18,095
At least not in our lifetime.
And by then,

59
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:20,763
they'll be driving Buicks to the moon.

60
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:34,528
You OK, honey?

61
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,699
That woman's laugh
creeps me out.

62
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:43,288
Like something I've heard before.

63
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,082
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.

64
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,751
Just sounded like an old gal
having a good time to me.

65
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:52,255
You ready to go dancing?

66
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:55,090
I'm always ready to dance.

67
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:59,595
But I need my kiss first.
Just one!

68
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:21,868
I'm gonna hire me a hit man, if you
don't help me stop this thing.

69
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:27,498
I'm going to call Marcello Santos.

70
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:34,547
Marietta, I am gonna help you.

71
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:37,258
So don't get carried away.

72
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:40,554
You don't want
to bring Santos and his bunch into this.

73
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:45,350
You're just jealous of him
'cause he's still sweet on me.

74
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:50,897
You been seeing him again?

75
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,399
Oh my God,

76
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:55,652
I don't believe this!

77
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:58,154
Johnnie Farragut...

78
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:04,161
who doesn't even trust
his very own Marietta?

79
00:12:07,371 --> 00:12:10,416
Alright, I'm sorry honey, but...

80
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,378
I just love you,

81
00:12:13,963 --> 00:12:16,464
and it just brings out...

82
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:20,969
That ugly jealous side,
I hate it, God!

83
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:44,242
No tongue! My lipstick.

84
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:51,458
Sweetheart, I want you
to stop worrying about me,

85
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:58,132
and start worryin' about
how to get Lula from that murderer.

86
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:00,800
Honey, wait a minute now:

87
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:03,011
Sailor ain't no murderer.

88
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:06,806
Now listen to me!
You gotta get off that kick.

89
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:12,020
As far as I know, Sailor was
all clean before he got involved in

90
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:14,315
in that event with Lula.

91
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:16,650
And even there,
he was trying to protect her.

92
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:20,904
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was
comin' at them with a knife.

93
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:24,033
He could've killed both of them.
You oughtta be thankin' him!

94
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,160
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

95
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:29,497
You were there,
you saw the whole damned thing!

96
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:31,249
Didn't you?

97
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:01,822
Sailor boy!

98
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:13,875
How'd you like

99
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,837
to fuck Lula's mama?

100
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,923
No... ma'am...

101
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,430
I sure don't.
- Lula's mama would like to fuck you.

102
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:32,644
Mrs. Fortune, I really think
you need a cup of coffee.

103
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:37,231
Maybe I was there.

104
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:40,276
But I didn't see anything at all.

105
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:43,990
All I know is,
is that trash,

106
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:47,366
he killed a man
with his bare hands,

107
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:52,915
hands that are probably
all over my baby right now!

108
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,335
Oh, honey, settle down.

109
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:01,256
It's all right, come on now.

110
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:03,968
It's alright.

111
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:07,179
Now listen, I want
what's best for her too.

112
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:11,725
I'll do everything I can
to bring her back home, OK?

113
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:34,707
Baby, quit bouncing.
I got one more toe to do.

114
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,710
Let's go dancing, Peanut!

115
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,546
I'm ready.

116
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:42,881
But we better be careful.

117
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:47,387
Mama's gonna
have Johnnie Farragut after us.

118
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:51,348
He's one clever detective.
You know how clever?

119
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,851
How clever?
- He told me once,

120
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:56,937
he could find
an honest man in Washington.

121
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:04,279
I just want two more moments,
then my toes will be dry.

122
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:08,658
One thing puzzles me, sugar.
- What's that?

123
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:10,619
You're 20 years old.

124
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,539
Ain't you ever curious as to why
your mama wants to keep us apart?

125
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,629
I'll tell you, Lula...

126
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,470
it's more than
me killing Bob Ray Lemon.

127
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:33,683
Maybe my mama
cares for me just a little too much.

128
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,437
Yeah, maybe.

129
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:43,444
I just want
to kiss you goodbye.

130
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,531
You know too much about Lula's Mama.

131
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:49,532
What do you mean?

132
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:54,955
Johnnie told me
you were a driver for Marcello Santos.

133
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:58,583
So what?
- So maybe one night,

134
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,877
you got too close to a fire.

135
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,843
So maybe you're gonna burn.
Besides, you're shit.

136
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:10,136
You think I'd let my little girl

137
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:13,849
hang out with a piece
of s-h-i-t like you?

138
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:18,645
Kid, you belong
in one of these toilets!

139
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:25,653
You piece of white trash!

140
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,239
You...

141
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:37,081
You're gonna have to kill me
to keep me away from Lula.

142
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:42,128
Don't worry about that.
First I'm gonna cut your balls off

143
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:44,213
and feed them to you.

144
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:49,426
You're gonna have to kill me.

145
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,430
I can arrange that.

146
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:59,186
It's a problem I don't think
is gonna go away too soon.

147
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:04,526
I'm ready to break parole
and take you out to sunny California!

148
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:08,030
Sailor!
- You up for that?

149
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:11,448
I'd go to the far end
of the world for you, baby.

150
00:18:11,866 --> 00:18:13,326
You know that.

151
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:16,120
Rockin' good news!

152
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:23,587
Are those toenails about dry yet,
sweetheart?

153
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,006
We've got some dancing to do!

154
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,525
You gonna give me the
opportunity to prove my love to my girl?

155
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:30,737
Or you gonna save yourself
some trouble and apologize to her?

156
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:35,034
Don't fuck with me, man.

157
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,626
You look like a clown
in that stupid jacket.

158
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:46,380
This is a snakeskin jacket...

159
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:49,465
It's a symbol of my individuality

160
00:19:49,882 --> 00:19:52,802
and my belief
in personal freedom.

161
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,347
Asshole!

162
00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:00,726
Come here!
- Sailor, honey...

163
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:08,110
I'm sorry to do this to you
here in front of a crowd and all...

164
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,820
But I want you to get up
and apologize to my girl.

165
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,620
I'm sorry.

166
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:25,544
You just bumped against
the wrong girl, that's all.

167
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:29,464
Get yourself a beer.

168
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,341
You fellas have
a lot of the same power "E" had.

169
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,469
Do you know this one?

170
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,157
Sail', how come you didn't
sing me "Love me tender"?

171
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,659
You told me
that was your favorite love song.

172
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:06,458
I told you I'd only sing
"Love me tender" to my wife.

173
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,732
Did you ever think something...

174
00:23:32,775 --> 00:23:34,985
you can hear a wind...

175
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,864
and see the Wicked Witch of the East
come flyin' in?

176
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:48,375
I really did miss your mind
while I was out at Pee Dee.

177
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,836
The rest of your too, of course.

178
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:56,173
But the way your head works
is God's mystery.

179
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:58,509
What were you thinking?

180
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:05,809
Well, I was thinking
about smoking, actually.

181
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:09,604
My mama smokes Merits now.

182
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:12,773
She used to smoke Viceroys.

183
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,235
I started stealing
'em from her about 6th grade.

184
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,655
When did you start smoking, Sail'?

185
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,452
I started when I was about...

186
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:27,039
four.

187
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:31,167
My mom was already
dead then from lung cancer.

188
00:24:31,835 --> 00:24:36,130
What brand did she smoke?
- Marlboros, same as me.

189
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:39,216
I guess both my mom
and my daddy died

190
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:41,678
of smoke
or alcohol related illness.

191
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,098
Jeez, Sail', I'm sorry.
- Its OK, honey.

192
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,685
I hardly used to see them anyways.

193
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:52,480
I didn't have much
parental guidance.

194
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:56,901
The public defender
kept saying that.

195
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:01,699
He was a good ol' boy,
he stood by me.

196
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:07,078
I'd stand by you, Sail',

197
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:08,956
through anything.

198
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:11,875
Hell, Peanut...

199
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:20,510
You stuck by me after
I planted Bob Ray Lemon.

200
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:23,762
A man can't ask for more than that.

201
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:28,226
You move me, Sail'.

202
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:31,145
You really do.

203
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:35,525
You mark me the deepest.

204
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:44,158
You're perfect for me too.

205
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,873
You remind me of my daddy.

206
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,252
Mama told me
he liked skinny women

207
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:57,587
with breasts
that stood up and said "Hello".

208
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:05,054
He had a long nose too,
just like yours.

209
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,435
Did I ever tell you
how my daddy died?

210
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:13,938
In a fire, as I recall.

211
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:15,939
Yeah...

212
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:20,903
Mama told me he poured
kerosene all over himself,

213
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,574
and lit a match.

214
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,266
That was the year
before I met you.

215
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,792
No, I haven't found them yet.

216
00:27:16,209 --> 00:27:19,923
Just try to take it easy.
- Johnnie!

217
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,926
I'm going to stay
right here, by this telephone,

218
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,721
until you find Lula.
And then I'm coming to get her.

219
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:30,725
So call me the second
you get to New Orleans.

220
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,936
I will, honey.
- Please don't let me down again!

221
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,272
I'll miss you.
- Get going! - OK. Bye.

222
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,650
Bye, honey.

223
00:27:58,753 --> 00:28:01,588
Well, I guess you
broke parole now.

224
00:28:02,005 --> 00:28:03,508
You guess?

225
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:08,721
My parole was broke 200 miles back,
when we burned Portagee County.

226
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:17,396
I guess I'll send Mama
a postcard from somewhere.

227
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:20,566
I don't want
her to worry more than necessary.

228
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:24,362
That's not why I
called you here, Santos.

229
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,656
That don't smell like a Kool.

230
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:30,743
It ain't.
It's part of the lessons of life.

231
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,954
Just tell me what you want.

232
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:39,752
You ain't gonna start worrying
about what's bad for you?

233
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,216
I mean, here you are, crossing
state lines with a real murderer...

234
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:49,138
A manslaughterer, honey,
not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

235
00:28:49,555 --> 00:28:51,806
OK, manslaughterer...

236
00:28:52,224 --> 00:28:57,479
who just broke parole and has only
immoral purposes in mind,

237
00:28:57,896 --> 00:29:00,857
as far as you're concerned.
- Thank the Lord!

238
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:03,902
Well, you ain't
let me down yet... Sail'.

239
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,282
That's more than
I can say for the rest of the world.

240
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,701
You please me too, Peanut

241
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:19,000
You want me to shoot
Sailor in the brains, with a gun.

242
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:21,085
Yes.

243
00:29:22,922 --> 00:29:25,716
In the forehead?
- Yes.

244
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:27,760
Wrong!

245
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:32,265
It's always better to blow a hole
through the back of the head.

246
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:34,059
Right through...

247
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:36,518
to the nose.

248
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,358
Lots of irreparable damage.

249
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,903
See?

250
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:49,156
I knew
you had it under control.

251
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:53,161
You are a little slow, but
you're beginning to get it.

252
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,624
Why didn't you send
Johnnie Farragut?

253
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:00,292
Maybe I did.

254
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:05,506
Why don't you
look in New Orleans?

255
00:30:05,923 --> 00:30:09,845
Lula always talks about that town.
- On one condition:

256
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:14,682
You give me permission
to kill Johnnie Farragut.

257
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:16,893
Santos, please!

258
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,895
You're not telling me
you're that sweet on him?

259
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:22,273
What? No...
- Are you that sweet on him?

260
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,527
No, but...
- One day he's gonna find out

261
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:29,698
what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer,
and he can cause us a lot of trouble.

262
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:35,787
I'll take your silence as a "yes".

263
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:39,623
No... no, Santos...
- Shhh, it's OK.

264
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:42,377
It's alright.
- No! You're not gonna kill him!

265
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:46,464
You're not gonna kill him!
- No, no...

266
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:52,638
No, not Johnnie.
You kill Sailor!

267
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:56,766
I am going to kill Sailor.

268
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:00,061
You can be certain of that.

269
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,080
Hello, Mr. Reindeer.
Marcello Santos speaking.

270
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:25,003
Mr. Marcello Santos. Hey there!

271
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:28,882
That was great shit
you sent last in last month.

272
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:33,721
I've got a problem.

273
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:36,932
A couple of problems, in fact.

274
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,518
A couple of problems?

275
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,566
For each problem, drop a
silver dollar through my mail slot.

276
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:47,652
With all particulars.

277
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:51,780
We'll work out
"il conto" later.

278
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:55,159
Have a beautiful day!

279
00:32:04,418 --> 00:32:06,212
We are.

280
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,652
Keep them panties up,
we're in Jimmy Swaggart country!

281
00:32:52,425 --> 00:32:53,593
You know what?

282
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:57,471
That little bitch Susie
stole my comb.

283
00:32:58,931 --> 00:33:00,725
I hate that.

284
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:02,935
The stupid little shit!

285
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:04,855
Phone's ringing.

286
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:16,034
Juana.

287
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:20,077
A couple of silver dollars
came my way today.

288
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:24,248
I'm sending one to you,
with a paper on the beneficiary.

289
00:33:24,666 --> 00:33:28,128
As usual, you are completely free
to fulfill the obligation

290
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:31,716
in any manner you so desire.

291
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:35,219
In fact, send
Reggie and Drop Shadow over,

292
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:37,553
for the silver dollar
and the papers.

293
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:39,097
Now.

294
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:45,186
They're on their way.
Who's getting' the second silver dollar?

295
00:33:45,604 --> 00:33:47,188
That's for me to know.

296
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:49,107
Yeah?

297
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,861
Thanks, Mr. Reindeer.

298
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:55,447
Have fun, darling.

299
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,882
How you doin', my boy?

300
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:17,072
Sometimes, when we're making love,

301
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:22,576
you just about take me
right over that rainbow.

302
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:27,707
You're so aware of what goes on in me,
I mean, you pay attention.

303
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:31,544
And I swear, baby,
you got the sweetest cock.

304
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:36,467
It's like it's talking to me
when you're inside.

305
00:35:38,218 --> 00:35:40,470
You get right on me.

306
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:46,060
You are dangerously cute, baby,
I got to admit it.

307
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:52,359
Let's go out
into the crazy world of New Orleans!

308
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,737
Let's get a fried banana sandwich.

309
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:09,876
That's about the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

310
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:53,503
Pigeons spread diseases and
mess up the place. You've seen it.

311
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,569
The big N.O.!

312
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,074
Santos? I don't know...

313
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,203
I'm having second thoughts.

314
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,956
Guess what?

315
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:34,002
There's no turnin' back,
remember?

316
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:38,673
I'm in a killing mood.
- Santos!

317
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,221
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street.
- I'm not sure...

318
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:47,725
What? Are you in New Orleans?

319
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,227
Crazy fucking bitch!

320
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:19,714
Ladies!

321
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,134
What are you?

322
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,055
You're not just a pretty face
with a fucking smile.

323
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:28,640
You're here
to make Mr. Reindeer happy.

324
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:31,102
And to show him a good time.

325
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:36,065
Do not bring misfortune
upon yourselves.

326
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,546
When I gave you
the silver dollar, I forgot

327
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,715
to include
the contents of this envelope.

328
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:03,092
They are to be returned.

329
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:08,723
Show it just before the deed.

330
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:28,763
I knew I had an important lesson
to learn that day.

331
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:33,643
When she got to the top step,
I stuck my hand between her legs.

332
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,564
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

333
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:41,400
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

334
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,445
That's just what she said.

335
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,742
I had a boner with a capital "O".

336
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,245
Anyway, I found her lying

337
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:56,207
in a room filled with
guns and porno magazines.

338
00:40:56,624 --> 00:41:00,211
So, I slid
my hand between her legs again,

339
00:41:01,254 --> 00:41:03,464
and she closed her thighs.

340
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,425
You're exciting me, honey.

341
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,718
Then what did she do?

342
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:11,473
Her face was
half pushed into the pillow,

343
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,686
and I remember, she looked back
over her shoulder at me and said:

344
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:19,940
"I won't suck you.
Don't ask me to suck you."

345
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:22,858
Poor baby, she doesn't know
what she missed.

346
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:26,488
What color hair did she have?
- Jet black,

347
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:28,907
but gentlemen prefer blondes.

348
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:31,618
Anyway, dig this:

349
00:41:32,035 --> 00:41:33,703
She turns over,

350
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:37,791
peels off them orange pants,

351
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:41,585
spreads her legs
real wide

352
00:41:42,003 --> 00:41:45,466
and says to me:
"Take a bite of peach."

353
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:50,887
Jesus, honey, you more than
sort of got what you come for.

354
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,477
Baby, you better run me
back to the hotel.

355
00:41:56,894 --> 00:41:59,897
You've got me hotter
than Georgia asphalt.

356
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:02,274
Say no more,
but go easy on me, sweetheart,

357
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,194
tomorrow we got
a lot of driving to do.

358
00:42:09,281 --> 00:42:11,243
Hotter than Georgia asphalt.

359
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,698
Wouldn't it be fabulous
if we someway stayed in love forever?

360
00:43:33,826 --> 00:43:38,164
You think of the weirdest damn things
to say sometimes, Peanut.

361
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,957
Ain't we been
doing a pretty fair job thus far?

362
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:46,128
Oh, you know exactly
what I mean, sugar.

363
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:51,218
It'd make the future so simple and nice.

364
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:53,094
I've done a few things

365
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,725
in my life
which I ain't too proud of.

366
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:04,063
But from now on I ain't
gonna do nothin' for no good reason.

367
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:07,275
All I know for sure is
there's more than a few bad ideas

368
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:09,236
runnin' loose out there.

369
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,662
There's something
I ain't never told you about.

370
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:24,335
This here's a story with a lesson
about bad ideas.

371
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:25,836
What's that?

372
00:44:26,254 --> 00:44:31,050
Well, my cousin Dell was
always fighting bad ideas.

373
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:35,471
See, Dell loved Christmas.
We used to call him

374
00:44:35,888 --> 00:44:37,306
"Jingle Dell".

375
00:44:37,723 --> 00:44:40,435
He wanted
Christmas to last all year long.

376
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:44,896
He sure would scream
when his mom told him it was summer,

377
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:48,359
and Christmas was
six months off.

378
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:52,655
Also, he said...

379
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,871
he felt there's men

380
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:02,622
with black rubber gloves who were
following him around.

381
00:45:03,707 --> 00:45:07,545
Dell said that trust in the spirit of
Christmas was destroyed

382
00:45:07,962 --> 00:45:13,134
by ideas being controlled
by aliens wearing black gloves.

383
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:17,471
These aliens would get Dell
to do all kinds of things.

384
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:21,392
Then he'd carry on about the weather,

385
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,190
talk about how rainfall is
controlled by aliens on earth.

386
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:30,526
Aunt Rootie told him
that one day he would realize

387
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:34,573
that the alien wearing
the black gloves was him,

388
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,909
and him alone.

389
00:45:40,244 --> 00:45:45,083
Sounds like old Dell
was more than just a bit confused.

390
00:45:47,585 --> 00:45:49,921
Dell was learning a hard lesson.

391
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:54,218
It got so he would stay up
all night making sandwiches.

392
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,679
Dell, what are you doing?

393
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:08,066
I'm making my lunch!

394
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:13,487
Mama told me
Aunt Rootie, that's Dell's mama,

395
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:18,660
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

396
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,913
One time, she found Dell

397
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:26,083
putting one big cockroach
on his anus.

398
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,335
Hell, Peanut!

399
00:46:34,342 --> 00:46:36,511
It ain't so funny now, though.

400
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:39,972
Dell disappeared.

401
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,350
Nobody's seen him since.

402
00:46:44,393 --> 00:46:47,689
Too bad he couldn't visit

403
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:52,360
that old Wizard of Oz,

404
00:46:53,403 --> 00:46:55,738
and get some good advice.

405
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:00,368
Too bad
we all can't, baby.

406
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:20,181
Are you there, Johnnie?

407
00:47:20,598 --> 00:47:22,765
What's wrong, honey?

408
00:47:28,606 --> 00:47:32,108
Johnnie, sweetheart.
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

409
00:47:32,525 --> 00:47:36,238
I want you to know something.

410
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:39,491
I've done something so bad,
real bad.

411
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:43,785
What?
- Not on the phone! No...

412
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:48,124
I'm coming to New Orleans tomorrow
to tell you in person. OK?

413
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:53,421
Don't do this to me. You'd freak out
if I did that to you. Now what is it?

414
00:47:55,174 --> 00:47:57,343
No,
I'm not gonna tell you on the phone.

415
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,055
But honey, I gotta leave right now
and get on their trail.

416
00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:05,226
The kids were here. They checked
out of the Hotel Brazil this morning.

417
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,477
No!

418
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:09,938
Stay right there! Don't go anywhere!

419
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:12,983
I'm coming in on Piedmont
tomorrow, on the 7 o'clock flight.

420
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:19,949
We're going after Lula together!
- OK, if that's what you want.

421
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,368
But I'm against it!

422
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,495
7 o'clock,

423
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:27,872
tomorrow evening. Sugar...

424
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,793
We'll have dinner at our
favorite French restaurant, OK?

425
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,630
You fix it up. OK, bye now?

426
00:48:35,673 --> 00:48:37,216
I love you.

427
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:40,846
Marietta?

428
00:49:56,755 --> 00:49:59,258
How much we got left, baby?

429
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:01,344
Under 100.

430
00:50:01,761 --> 00:50:03,804
You want me to drive

431
00:50:04,221 --> 00:50:08,225
so you can get a bit of rest?
- Yeah, that'd be good.

432
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:29,579
Come in, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your mind this evening?

433
00:50:30,038 --> 00:50:32,707
I just had triple bypass,
open-heart surgery,

434
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,963
and it's people like you who make me
wanna get out of the hospital...

435
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,923
How can anyone listen to this crap?

436
00:50:40,674 --> 00:50:43,970
...for her recent divorce, shot
her three children, aged seven...

437
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:46,638
A judge

438
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:49,976
praised defendant John Roy,
but was dismayed to learn

439
00:50:50,393 --> 00:50:52,770
that he'd had sex with the corpse.

440
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:54,480
What?

441
00:50:56,148 --> 00:50:58,901
State authorities, last October
released 500 turtles ino the Ganges,

442
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:01,654
to try and reduce human pollution,

443
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:05,156
and will now use crocodiles to eat
corpses dumped by poor Hindus...

444
00:51:05,574 --> 00:51:10,455
Holy shit!
It's Night of the Living Dead!

445
00:51:11,497 --> 00:51:14,709
What's that, Peanut?
- I can't take any more of this radio!

446
00:51:15,126 --> 00:51:18,005
I've never heard
so much shit in all my life!

447
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:22,800
Sailor Ripley, you get me
some music now! I mean it!

448
00:51:23,218 --> 00:51:25,928
...victim of a sexual assault...
...mutilated... raped...

449
00:52:48,428 --> 00:52:52,516
Johnnie, I can't tell you now,
honey, but listen:

450
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:57,104
Is there any way, any way
that we could get on the road tonight?

451
00:52:57,522 --> 00:53:02,902
Something was upsetting you bad
last night when you called.

452
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:05,656
And you wanted to tell me.

453
00:53:06,071 --> 00:53:09,741
So I figured that you
wanted me to help you.

454
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:12,328
I did.

455
00:53:13,246 --> 00:53:16,624
Oh, I did.
But that was last night.

456
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,962
Now I need your help. We have to
find Lula before it's too late.

457
00:53:21,714 --> 00:53:24,799
Honey, I have to ask you something.
- Okay.

458
00:53:26,593 --> 00:53:29,345
Is Santos
involved in this in any way?

459
00:53:32,848 --> 00:53:34,225
Hell no!

460
00:53:35,226 --> 00:53:39,022
Do you think I would do something
like that without coming to you?

461
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:42,568
I'm sorry, honey.

462
00:53:44,652 --> 00:53:48,865
Goddamned Pucinski, son of a bitch!
- Who, Uncle Pooch?

463
00:53:49,282 --> 00:53:52,785
The son of a bitch who introduced
Santos to you and Clyde.

464
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,079
Johnnie...

465
00:53:56,332 --> 00:53:58,250
That's all the past.

466
00:53:59,126 --> 00:54:02,879
Now what you and I have to do...

467
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:06,299
is think about our future.

468
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:09,344
Do you mean that?

469
00:54:11,429 --> 00:54:14,058
You bet your sweet ass I do!

470
00:54:15,517 --> 00:54:16,852
Gosh.

471
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:21,190
Did I tell you
how great it was to see you again?

472
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:25,611
Just about five times, that's all.

473
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:37,413
Oh God, Johnnie, I love you!
- I love you too.

474
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:43,088
Let's get our backsides
out of this town and go get my Lula!

475
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,659
What's troublin' you, sugar?

476
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,498
You know, Lula...

477
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:23,086
I never told you what all
I was doing before I met you.

478
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:28,299
I just figured
you were out being Mr. Cool.

479
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:30,634
Not exactly, sugar.

480
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:37,308
One reason we're in this trouble
is because of what I was doing.

481
00:55:37,726 --> 00:55:40,186
I tried to tell you this before.

482
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:43,315
You're scaring me, baby.

483
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:47,318
Well, there's a good side
as well as a bad side to it.

484
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,072
The good side is that I knew
your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.

485
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:55,493
You knew my daddy?
- Yes.

486
00:55:56,536 --> 00:55:58,329
I sure did.

487
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,041
The bad side of it...

488
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:04,544
is I did some driving
for a man named Marcello Santos.

489
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,630
Oh Shit.

490
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,591
I quit working for him,

491
00:56:10,008 --> 00:56:13,136
but just before I did,
I ended up one night at a house.

492
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:15,347
I didn't know it then,

493
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:17,849
but it was your house.

494
00:56:19,017 --> 00:56:21,895
I don't know
what they think I saw that night.

495
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:25,734
I was just sitting out in the car,
'til the whole place went up in flames.

496
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:33,031
Oh God, Sailor,
that's the night my daddy died!

497
00:56:34,408 --> 00:56:35,951
I know, sugar.

498
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:43,585
Daddy?

499
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:49,422
That's...

500
00:56:50,465 --> 00:56:54,554
some big secret
you've been carrying, Sail'.

501
00:56:55,637 --> 00:56:57,931
We all got
a secret side, baby.

502
00:56:58,974 --> 00:57:02,645
I hope you don't think
I been lyin' to you about other things.

503
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:34,302
Lula, you there?

504
00:57:35,888 --> 00:57:37,597
Yeah, I'm here...

505
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:44,020
You upset with me?

506
00:57:45,564 --> 00:57:48,441
It just shocking sometimes...

507
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:52,862
when things aren't
what you thought they were.

508
00:58:06,835 --> 00:58:09,545
We're really
in the middle of it now, ain't we?

509
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:40,327
I'm gonna pack real fast,
then I'll meet you downstairs.

510
00:58:40,744 --> 00:58:44,831
My God, what we could've done
on that kingsize bed tonight!

511
00:58:45,249 --> 00:58:49,043
Don't worry, I'll make up for it!
- Alright.

512
00:58:54,006 --> 00:58:56,301
See you in a minute.
- Okay.

513
00:58:58,178 --> 00:58:59,639
Marietta...

514
00:59:36,258 --> 00:59:37,968
What's that?

515
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:42,390
I don't know...
Looks like clothes.

516
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:05,623
Oh God, Sailor!

517
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,125
One bad car accident.

518
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:51,752
What should we do?

519
01:00:52,169 --> 01:00:54,880
I don't know, but we got to
help that girl, get her to a town,

520
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:58,801
and hope nobody finds out
that I broke parole.

521
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:03,681
This bobby pin...

522
01:01:06,307 --> 01:01:07,561
I can't find it.

523
01:01:07,978 --> 01:01:10,813
My mother's gonna kill me...
...it's got all my cards...

524
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:12,480
It was in my pocket.

525
01:01:12,898 --> 01:01:16,235
Now my pocket's gone.
Gotta help me find it...

526
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:22,658
All my cards...
and it was in my pocket, and...

527
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:31,000
My purse is gone!
Now she tells me!

528
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,501
Let's get a hold of her!
- Is she going to make it?

529
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,505
Don't know, but she's gonna
bleed all over our car!

530
01:01:36,923 --> 01:01:39,550
Hey... hello! Girl!

531
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:42,554
Come with us, honey!

532
01:01:42,971 --> 01:01:44,723
Leave me alone!

533
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:51,813
Robert?

534
01:01:52,647 --> 01:01:54,315
Robert!

535
01:01:58,652 --> 01:01:59,821
Shit.

536
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:03,909
Got this damned
sticky stuff in my hair...

537
01:02:07,077 --> 01:02:09,498
...got sticky stuff in my hair.

538
01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:12,166
Better come with us, honey. Come on!

539
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:16,086
Gotta find my wallet...
Don't tell my mother, please.

540
01:02:16,504 --> 01:02:18,089
God, she's gonna kill me!

541
01:02:18,507 --> 01:02:20,592
Can't worry about that...

542
01:02:22,469 --> 01:02:26,516
Where's my hairbrush?
- God, she's dying right in front of us.

543
01:02:35,147 --> 01:02:37,442
Get my lipstick...

544
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:41,656
It's in my purse.

545
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:47,078
She died
right in front of us, Sailor...

546
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:49,664
Why'd she have to go and do that?

547
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,544
Let's get outta here, honey.

548
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:09,350
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

549
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:08,785
I don't understand this one tiny bit.

550
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:13,372
See, he told me to wait
for him here in that lobby there.

551
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:19,378
What I feel is that something
terrible has happened to him.

552
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:24,301
Perhaps we should
call a local law enforcement officer?

553
01:04:24,718 --> 01:04:26,637
No, please! Please no!

554
01:04:27,054 --> 01:04:31,100
The last thing I need
is some damned policeman

555
01:04:31,516 --> 01:04:33,226
moving and going around here...

556
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:37,355
No, I just can't...
no... no.

557
01:04:39,399 --> 01:04:42,778
I am sorry...
I must have overlooked this.

558
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:45,948
I'm truly
'
sorry, ma am.

559
01:04:59,503 --> 01:05:00,754
What?

560
01:05:03,924 --> 01:05:05,343
Could you...?

561
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,765
"Gone fishing with a friend...

562
01:05:12,056 --> 01:05:15,645
and maybe buffalo hunting, too."

563
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:17,563
Buffalo hunting?

564
01:05:18,355 --> 01:05:20,107
"I've gone buffalo hunting."?

565
01:05:21,901 --> 01:05:25,697
What the fuck
does "Buffalo hunting" mean?

566
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,949
Well, I am sure
I wouldn't know, I mean...

567
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:31,327
My God...

568
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,121
He's afraid.

569
01:05:36,498 --> 01:05:38,333
He's done it again!

570
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:40,210
The fucker split!

571
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,966
"I've made a commitment."

572
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:46,718
Marietta!

573
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,804
Santos!

574
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:53,932
Gentlemen, I'd like
to take this opportunity to ask you:

575
01:05:54,642 --> 01:05:58,104
Please, clear out!
- How rude!

576
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,232
Me too?
- Yeah, you too.

577
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:17,916
What did you do to Johnnie?
Where's Johnnie?

578
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:20,210
What's happening here?

579
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:24,757
Tell me what's happening here!
Santos, tell me!

580
01:06:25,174 --> 01:06:26,967
You been crying?

581
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:31,971
You gotta cut out
this crybaby stuff, you know?

582
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:36,059
You're my girl now, and Santos...

583
01:06:37,101 --> 01:06:38,437
Santos...

584
01:06:40,855 --> 01:06:43,359
Santos wants to wipe away the tears,

585
01:06:45,152 --> 01:06:46,946
and make you happy.

586
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,700
I want you to tell me...

587
01:06:52,327 --> 01:06:54,494
I want you to tell me...

588
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:58,581
Did you do anything to Johnnie?
Did you hurt him? I want to know.

589
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:03,003
I did not do anything
to Johnnie Farragut.

590
01:07:04,046 --> 01:07:06,506
You swear, on your mother?

591
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:12,804
I swear. On my mother.
- God! Oh God!

592
01:07:13,222 --> 01:07:14,848
Come on. We have to go.

593
01:07:15,266 --> 01:07:17,434
I got word:

594
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:19,436
The kids are moving through Texas.

595
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:23,649
And I think a happy end
is being arranged there.

596
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:27,153
That's it, give me a smile!

597
01:07:29,739 --> 01:07:31,323
Oh Santos.

598
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:37,080
You're the only one

599
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:40,040
that always came through for me.

600
01:07:53,387 --> 01:07:58,350
I smell your shit now, Johnnie.
Give us one more kiss, Reggie!

601
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:01,813
Oh, fuck me!

602
01:08:04,441 --> 01:08:05,734
Fuck me!

603
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:07,986
Fuck me!

604
01:08:28,089 --> 01:08:30,217
We hunt buffalo now.

605
01:08:30,635 --> 01:08:32,553
Can't wait no more!

606
01:08:41,311 --> 01:08:45,190
Remember the number... ten!

607
01:08:46,442 --> 01:08:49,278
I can't stop her, Johnnie.

608
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:55,576
But I gonna be standing behind you
with this big old gun!

609
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,497
It's a Marine issue!

610
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:09,756
I go out now...

611
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:16,847
Reggie!
- Yes?

612
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:19,766
Show him now!

613
01:09:25,273 --> 01:09:26,898
Honey...

614
01:09:28,568 --> 01:09:30,362
I forget to show you this!

615
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:32,864
Santos?

616
01:09:34,282 --> 01:09:36,658
Oh God, Marietta, honey...

617
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,142
One...

618
01:10:01,559 --> 01:10:04,061
Bye now!
- Two...

619
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:07,316
three... four...

620
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:09,985
Gettin' too hot now, Reggie!

621
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:12,112
Five...

622
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:13,780
...feeling myself...

623
01:10:14,488 --> 01:10:15,531
six...

624
01:10:17,033 --> 01:10:18,075
seven...

625
01:10:18,492 --> 01:10:19,535
eight...

626
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:21,204
nine...

627
01:10:22,412 --> 01:10:24,415
Fuck me now, Reggie!

628
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:26,210
Ten!

629
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:49,441
Why in the hell d'you want
to come to Big Tuna, Sail'?

630
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,819
I know
it's not exactly Emerald City...

631
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:55,530
Not as bad as the weather...

632
01:10:56,697 --> 01:10:59,952
'though it's a long way
off that road to California.

633
01:11:01,537 --> 01:11:04,665
Why in the hell d'you want
to come here, baby?

634
01:11:35,946 --> 01:11:37,614
Oh, look at this!

635
01:11:38,532 --> 01:11:42,662
What do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?

636
01:11:43,162 --> 01:11:45,790
I was hoping you could tell me
if there's a contract out on me.

637
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:48,751
I really need to know.
- By who?

638
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:51,797
Santos. Or Marietta Fortune.

639
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:55,549
I heard you were going
with that bitch's daughter.

640
01:11:55,966 --> 01:12:01,097
You heard right.
- You are one big, stupid asshole.

641
01:12:03,433 --> 01:12:06,852
Don't you know that her mami and
Santos killed her daddy?

642
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,026
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire...

643
01:12:13,443 --> 01:12:15,485
So maybe you're gonna burn.

644
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:20,782
I didn't see nothin'.
- Sure. I did.

645
01:12:40,845 --> 01:12:42,222
Santos!

646
01:12:52,023 --> 01:12:53,651
Is there a contract?

647
01:12:54,068 --> 01:12:57,737
We had a deal once:
We'd tip each other off if we heard.

648
01:12:59,072 --> 01:13:02,910
I know. I remember.

649
01:13:03,493 --> 01:13:04,619
Well?

650
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,584
I heard of nothing.

651
01:13:14,922 --> 01:13:16,340
Thanks.

652
01:13:56,088 --> 01:13:58,507
Sail', honey, is that you?

653
01:13:58,924 --> 01:14:00,467
The one and only!

654
01:14:01,802 --> 01:14:05,347
D'you get that oil, baby?
- Yes siree!

655
01:14:05,765 --> 01:14:07,893
I met a guy called Red.
He owns a garage.

656
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:16,317
What's that smell?

657
01:14:17,693 --> 01:14:19,236
I barfed.

658
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:25,284
I tried to make it to the bathroom,
but it was the wrong door.

659
01:14:26,327 --> 01:14:30,666
I think all this driving
is upsetting me, baby.

660
01:14:31,374 --> 01:14:33,668
D'you think we could stay here
and rest a couple of days?

661
01:14:34,085 --> 01:14:36,046
Are you
carsick, sweetheart?

662
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,049
A little, I guess.

663
01:14:54,856 --> 01:14:56,566
Oh Sailor, honey:

664
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:03,822
I hope seeing that girl die
didn't jinx us.

665
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,796
I got this for you.

666
01:15:20,131 --> 01:15:22,301
It has 40 different flavors.

667
01:15:22,968 --> 01:15:25,638
One for about every reason
I love you.

668
01:15:27,848 --> 01:15:30,141
Sail', I'm gonna save this.

669
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:34,565
But if I ever eat it,

670
01:15:34,981 --> 01:15:37,440
I'll be thinking of you.

671
01:15:56,419 --> 01:15:59,964
"Robert Brenton
and two passengers, William Reese

672
01:16:00,464 --> 01:16:06,430
and Julie Day, were killed
when his car crashed on Highway 118."

673
01:16:06,846 --> 01:16:09,098
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!

674
01:16:10,309 --> 01:16:13,936
That stupid shit was so dumb,
he deserved to die!

675
01:16:14,354 --> 01:16:16,064
That asshole!

676
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:23,070
Timmy, what's going on in No. 4,
where them lights are always on?

677
01:16:27,533 --> 01:16:30,828
Them are making
a pornographic movie, Texas style!

678
01:16:31,454 --> 01:16:33,081
You wanna join in?

679
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:42,090
To survive in Big Tuna, you
need an active sense of humor!

680
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:58,689
This is Bosis Spool.
We call him "OO Spool".

681
01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:00,567
The man is a rocket scientist!

682
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:10,661
My dog barks some.

683
01:17:19,336 --> 01:17:23,757
Mentally, you picture my dog,

684
01:17:25,049 --> 01:17:27,052
but, I have not told you

685
01:17:27,469 --> 01:17:31,723
the type of dog which I have.

686
01:17:34,686 --> 01:17:38,313
Perhaps
you might even picture Toto

687
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:41,441
from the "Wizard of Oz".

688
01:17:46,781 --> 01:17:53,121
But I can tell you
my dog is always with me.

689
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:31,117
Hey everybody!

690
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,912
Bobby!
Hey, Sailor, Lula,

691
01:18:34,621 --> 01:18:38,499
This is the man himself!
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,

692
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:41,127
the 2 most recent strandees,

693
01:18:41,627 --> 01:18:43,296
of the economic variety.

694
01:18:44,505 --> 01:18:47,759
Bobby Peru. Like the country.

695
01:18:48,385 --> 01:18:50,803
Bobby just rolled into town
a few days ago.

696
01:18:51,221 --> 01:18:53,515
Yeah, Bobby is
the most exciting item

697
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:56,310
to hit Big Tuna
since the '86 cyclone

698
01:18:56,727 --> 01:18:58,811
sheared
the roof off the high school.

699
01:18:59,229 --> 01:19:03,108
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

700
01:19:05,444 --> 01:19:07,488
I'm from all over.

701
01:19:10,907 --> 01:19:12,576
You were in the Marines.

702
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:18,915
Four years.

703
01:19:19,623 --> 01:19:23,128
Bobby was at Cao Ben.
- What's Cao Ben?

704
01:19:25,047 --> 01:19:28,508
How old are you?
- Twenty.

705
01:19:35,933 --> 01:19:40,145
A lot of women and kids
and old people died at Cao Ben.

706
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:46,235
You was on a ship, partner.

707
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,697
Pretty hard to make contact
with the people,

708
01:19:50,115 --> 01:19:53,409
when you're out
floating in the Golf of Tonkin.

709
01:19:55,452 --> 01:19:57,747
Come on Bobby,
have another glass of Jack.

710
01:20:03,002 --> 01:20:05,421
Don't mind
if I fuckin' do.

711
01:20:15,807 --> 01:20:17,517
Speakin' of Jack...

712
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,817
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go
peeping in a seafood store...

713
01:20:32,115 --> 01:20:33,491
Alright.

714
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:38,538
Nice meetin' you.

715
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,086
Adios, boys!
- See ya, Bobby!

716
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:49,966
Bobby's got a way...

717
01:20:50,843 --> 01:20:53,386
Can't shake
that institution out of him.

718
01:20:56,972 --> 01:21:01,520
Baby, I still ain't feelin' so well.
I'm goin' to bed.

719
01:21:01,936 --> 01:21:04,856
Will you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come along.

720
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:08,653
Well...

721
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:12,614
Good night!
- Good night!

722
01:21:38,015 --> 01:21:40,392
Lordy, what was that about?

723
01:21:41,768 --> 01:21:43,437
I don't know...

724
01:22:00,954 --> 01:22:03,874
Man, that barf smell
don't fade fast.

725
01:22:05,166 --> 01:22:06,626
Is there anything I can do for you?

726
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:10,548
I don't think so, Sail'.

727
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:13,801
I just need to lie down.

728
01:22:47,668 --> 01:22:49,254
You know what?

729
01:22:50,630 --> 01:22:52,799
I know you ain't
too pleased being here.

730
01:22:58,429 --> 01:22:59,973
It's not that.

731
01:23:08,065 --> 01:23:09,775
I'm gonna write it down,

732
01:23:11,443 --> 01:23:13,737
because I can't say it.

733
01:23:15,906 --> 01:23:17,658
You can't say it?

734
01:23:20,493 --> 01:23:23,329
I can't say this, not out loud.

735
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:36,052
I'M PREGNANT.

736
01:23:42,933 --> 01:23:44,475
Oh God!

737
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,820
It's okay by me, Peanut.

738
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:59,116
Well, nothing personal...

739
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,869
But I ain't so sure
it's okay by me.

740
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:08,041
Really, Sail',
it's nothing against you, baby.

741
01:24:09,084 --> 01:24:10,460
I love you.

742
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,173
I love you too.

743
01:24:15,048 --> 01:24:16,509
I know.

744
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:24,601
I'm just sort of uncomfortable
about how things are going,

745
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:30,648
since we broke down
along that Yellow Brick Road,

746
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:34,652
and this doesn't soothe me.

747
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,701
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna let
things get no worse.

748
01:24:46,998 --> 01:24:49,042
Not in a million years.

749
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:29,249
Hey, pretty woman. Is Sailor here?

750
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:33,087
No, he's changing oil out in our car.
- I gotta take a piss, bad,

751
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,798
can I use your head?

752
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,050
Oh... yeah, I guess.

753
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,221
I don't mean your head head...
I'm not goin' to piss on your hair,

754
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,931
just gonna piss in the toilet.

755
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:50,980
Ya'll take a listen, you'll hear
a deep sound comin' from Bobby Peru!

756
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:12,042
There's a smell in this room of puke.

757
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,046
Have you been puking?

758
01:26:18,008 --> 01:26:19,550
Are you sick?

759
01:26:20,969 --> 01:26:23,804
Pregnant?
- You used the toilet, now go!

760
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,765
It ain't none of your business
what I do around here!

761
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,477
I sure do like a woman
with nice tits like yours,

762
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:35,066
who talks tough and looks like
she can fuck like a bunny.

763
01:26:35,483 --> 01:26:36,902
Can you fuck like that?

764
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:40,822
You like it like a bunny?

765
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:46,160
'Cause if you do, baby,
I'll fuck you good,

766
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:50,207
like a big old jack-rabbit,
jump all around that hole!

767
01:26:51,249 --> 01:26:54,043
Bobby Peru don't come up for air!

768
01:26:55,629 --> 01:26:57,254
Get out!

769
01:26:58,214 --> 01:27:00,175
Am I scarin' you?

770
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,595
Is your pussy wet?

771
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:08,350
Is it wet?

772
01:27:11,186 --> 01:27:13,104
Oh, don't jump back so slow.

773
01:27:13,522 --> 01:27:17,108
I thought you was a bunny!
Bunnies jump fast.

774
01:27:17,984 --> 01:27:20,195
You jump back slow.

775
01:27:21,363 --> 01:27:23,447
Means something, don't it?

776
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:27,077
Means something to me.

777
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:30,539
Means you want Bobby Peru.

778
01:27:31,206 --> 01:27:34,126
You want Bobby Peru
to fuck you hard, baby,

779
01:27:34,544 --> 01:27:36,920
to open you
like a Christmas present!

780
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:43,678
You want me to do it?
Just a simple "yes" or "no".

781
01:27:44,094 --> 01:27:46,555
Just feel me breathin' on ya.

782
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:52,353
And you know I mean business
when it comes to fuckin'! - Out!

783
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:56,690
Bobby Peru will grab ya...

784
01:27:57,732 --> 01:27:59,610
hold ya tight...

785
01:28:00,026 --> 01:28:01,946
feel everythin' in ya.

786
01:28:02,406 --> 01:28:04,030
Be quiet!

787
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:06,324
Say "Fuck me".

788
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:09,119
Then I'll leave.
- No way. Get out!

789
01:28:09,871 --> 01:28:13,875
Say it! I'll tear your
fuckin' heart out, girl!

790
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:16,168
Say "Fuck me".

791
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:18,255
Say "Fuck me"!

792
01:28:18,671 --> 01:28:21,632
Then I'll go. Say "Fuck me"!

793
01:28:22,049 --> 01:28:24,134
Whisper it. Say it!

794
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,263
Say it. Say it!

795
01:28:28,723 --> 01:28:30,391
Say "Fuck me".

796
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:33,227
Whisper it. "Fuck me".

797
01:28:34,437 --> 01:28:37,941
"Fuck me". Say "Fuck me".

798
01:29:16,646 --> 01:29:19,482
Some day honey, I will!
But I gotta get goin'!

799
01:29:23,986 --> 01:29:26,614
Sing! Don't cry...

800
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,197
Hi Bobby!

801
01:30:24,882 --> 01:30:27,968
You need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm about done.

802
01:30:29,803 --> 01:30:31,222
How about a beer?

803
01:30:32,765 --> 01:30:34,392
A beer...

804
01:30:35,809 --> 01:30:37,102
Well...

805
01:30:38,896 --> 01:30:40,566
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.

806
01:30:43,984 --> 01:30:46,153
Where is your
pretty little lady today?

807
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:53,453
She's up in our room, restin'.
Hasn't been feelin' well lately.

808
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:56,497
Sorry to hear it.

809
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:44,296
I've been studying
a situation over in Lobo.

810
01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:47,006
Take two men to handle it.

811
01:31:51,469 --> 01:31:53,347
What's that?

812
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:57,268
A feed store,
keeps up to 5 K in their safe.

813
01:31:57,684 --> 01:32:00,896
Need me a good boy
for backup. Even split.

814
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:03,691
Interested?

815
01:32:04,941 --> 01:32:06,693
No, man.

816
01:32:09,947 --> 01:32:11,574
I don't think so.

817
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:15,244
It'll be easy, Sailor.

818
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:21,917
Two employees. I take 'em in back
to open the safe. You cover the door.

819
01:32:29,008 --> 01:32:30,843
You ain't plannin' on raisin'

820
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:34,681
a family in the Big Tuna, are you?

821
01:32:36,557 --> 01:32:39,019
Wait a minute...

822
01:32:40,061 --> 01:32:42,022
Whad'ya mean by family?

823
01:32:43,065 --> 01:32:44,524
Well, I mean...

824
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:47,234
with Lula...

825
01:32:49,904 --> 01:32:52,449
being in a family way and all.

826
01:32:55,035 --> 01:32:57,662
Did Lula tell you
she was pregnant?

827
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:01,333
Couple of grand or two
sure would help you two out.

828
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:07,254
Get you out West, to Mexico, or
anywhere with a few dollars to spare.

829
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:09,966
I've got it figured out good.

830
01:33:11,133 --> 01:33:14,345
When did you talk to Lula?

831
01:33:16,972 --> 01:33:19,559
I talked to her
this afternoon,

832
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:24,773
when you was out.

833
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:35,157
Did she really say
she was pregnant?

834
01:33:37,745 --> 01:33:40,539
I just took a guess, that's all.

835
01:33:41,998 --> 01:33:44,167
You in or out on this deal?

836
01:33:48,046 --> 01:33:50,465
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.

837
01:33:53,008 --> 01:33:55,346
Don't take too long to think about it.

838
01:34:07,690 --> 01:34:09,109
Had enough?

839
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:12,654
Have now!

840
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:18,285
Let's go outside.
I have something to show you.

841
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:24,458
Right here
is a double-barreled, sawed-off

842
01:34:24,876 --> 01:34:26,501
Ithica shotgun.

843
01:34:27,961 --> 01:34:29,213
Next to it:

844
01:34:29,629 --> 01:34:35,469
A Smith & Wesson.38 handgun
with a 4-inch barrel.

845
01:34:45,771 --> 01:34:47,480
Those'll do her,

846
01:34:47,899 --> 01:34:50,276
really loosen up that 5 grand.

847
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:53,737
Two and a half
for you and the little lady.

848
01:34:55,448 --> 01:34:57,992
How much money you got left?

849
01:34:59,911 --> 01:35:01,746
Forty bucks...

850
01:35:02,289 --> 01:35:04,458
This is easy money, partner.

851
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:07,335
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

852
01:35:08,376 --> 01:35:11,088
And I don't think
you can afford to pass it up...

853
01:35:13,758 --> 01:35:17,929
I'll bring the Eldorado to
the back of the motel at 10 AM.

854
01:35:19,889 --> 01:35:23,185
Really could
set you and that little lady up good.

855
01:35:26,979 --> 01:35:28,648
Yeah, I guess so.

856
01:35:29,649 --> 01:35:31,359
That kinda money

857
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:36,907
will get us a long way down
that Yellow Brick Road.

858
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:42,663
But damn it, this better go real smooth,
you understand me?

859
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,374
Like taking candy from a baby.

860
01:35:58,136 --> 01:35:59,721
Here comes Sailor.

861
01:36:33,297 --> 01:36:35,340
You've been drinkin', huh?

862
01:36:36,383 --> 01:36:38,135
A few beers is all.

863
01:36:40,554 --> 01:36:42,140
Feelin' any better?

864
01:36:42,807 --> 01:36:44,767
Can't tell yet.

865
01:36:51,524 --> 01:36:53,735
That smell's still filling this room
good.

866
01:36:59,742 --> 01:37:01,784
So where d'you say you was?

867
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:08,541
I went with Bobby.

868
01:37:15,255 --> 01:37:16,550
Sail'?

869
01:37:19,761 --> 01:37:21,137
Let's leave here.

870
01:37:21,804 --> 01:37:22,889
We are, Peanut.

871
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:28,561
Real soon.

872
01:37:42,701 --> 01:37:45,871
You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru?

873
01:37:47,704 --> 01:37:49,790
What could I be up to?

874
01:38:02,096 --> 01:38:05,683
That Bobby Peru
is a black angel, Sail'.

875
01:38:07,599 --> 01:38:10,478
You hook up
with him and you'll regret it...

876
01:38:11,272 --> 01:38:13,190
If you live to.

877
01:38:13,983 --> 01:38:15,733
Thanks, darling.

878
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:20,282
I know
you got my interests in mind,

879
01:38:20,698 --> 01:38:23,033
and I appreciate it sincerely.

880
01:38:24,076 --> 01:38:26,705
I love you, but
I got to get some sleep now.

881
01:38:28,747 --> 01:38:34,003
This whole world is wild at heart...
and weird on top.

882
01:38:43,429 --> 01:38:46,141
I wish you'd sing me
"Love me tender".

883
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:51,603
Oh, I wish
I was somewhere over that rainbow.

884
01:38:53,314 --> 01:38:54,816
It's just shit!

885
01:38:56,233 --> 01:38:58,402
Shit, shit, shit!

886
01:39:42,447 --> 01:39:44,449
The whole gang, huh?

887
01:39:44,866 --> 01:39:45,909
Yes.

888
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,542
You know, you look
a whole lot better in the flesh.

889
01:39:57,295 --> 01:39:59,757
The cobra
is waitin' to strike, Chica.

890
01:40:00,715 --> 01:40:02,592
You know that guy, Sailor?

891
01:40:03,009 --> 01:40:05,179
He came by the other afternoon.

892
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:09,098
He wanted to know if there was
a contract on him. - No shit?

893
01:40:10,392 --> 01:40:12,811
You know him?
- I used to.

894
01:40:13,228 --> 01:40:16,022
What did you say?
- "No", of course.

895
01:40:16,607 --> 01:40:18,316
That's right.

896
01:40:20,026 --> 01:40:23,197
He could have
a bad accident, though.

897
01:40:27,618 --> 01:40:28,993
Before,

898
01:40:29,411 --> 01:40:31,539
during or after a hold-up.

899
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:45,011
What am I doing here?

900
01:40:51,933 --> 01:40:54,395
Sailor, what are you doing here?

901
01:40:58,566 --> 01:41:00,109
I can't do this.

902
01:41:12,121 --> 01:41:13,372
Climb in back!

903
01:41:15,209 --> 01:41:16,834
What the hell's she doin' here?

904
01:41:17,252 --> 01:41:21,214
She's my girl.
She's drivin'. That bother you?

905
01:41:21,631 --> 01:41:22,799
Jump in!

906
01:41:23,217 --> 01:41:24,551
You owe me one.

907
01:41:24,968 --> 01:41:27,221
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls,

908
01:41:28,596 --> 01:41:31,015
let's go
and make us some easy money.

909
01:41:37,271 --> 01:41:39,857
They say the eagle flies on Friday.

910
01:43:38,478 --> 01:43:40,480
Get that mask on!

911
01:43:41,397 --> 01:43:44,318
Keep it revvin', Chiquita.
We'll be right back!

912
01:43:44,817 --> 01:43:46,903
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Remember that!

913
01:43:47,987 --> 01:43:49,572
Right, partner!

914
01:44:01,877 --> 01:44:03,503
Okay, boys!

915
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:06,882
Get in the back!
Get into the back! Now! Both of you!

916
01:44:09,717 --> 01:44:12,637
If anyone comes in,
herd 'em back here quick.

917
01:44:13,054 --> 01:44:15,807
Alright,
let's make this nice and easy!

918
01:44:41,041 --> 01:44:43,085
You waitin' for somebody?

919
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:45,045
My husband.

920
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:50,426
He's in the feed store.

921
01:44:54,555 --> 01:44:58,684
Well, watch that cigarette, ma'am.
It's about to burn down to your fingers.

922
01:44:59,101 --> 01:45:01,520
Thank you, officer.

923
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:05,775
I haven't seen you before.
Are you from Lobo?

924
01:45:06,818 --> 01:45:07,861
No.

925
01:45:08,652 --> 01:45:10,237
Over here!

926
01:45:11,864 --> 01:45:13,449
Big Tuna, huh?

927
01:45:13,866 --> 01:45:16,493
That's quite a drive, isn't it?
- Yes.

928
01:45:16,952 --> 01:45:18,204
Let's go!

929
01:45:18,996 --> 01:45:20,079
Say "Cheese".

930
01:45:23,001 --> 01:45:24,293
Stay put!

931
01:45:29,717 --> 01:45:31,258
Cool it, man!

932
01:45:33,803 --> 01:45:35,346
You're next, fucker!

933
01:45:47,443 --> 01:45:50,987
Those are dummies, dummy!

934
01:45:56,785 --> 01:45:59,246
Step up here, hotshot!

935
01:45:59,663 --> 01:46:02,123
I'll slap
that smile right off your face!

936
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:24,230
Stop, you sons of bitches!

937
01:46:25,690 --> 01:46:27,774
This is the police!
Hold it or I'll shoot!

938
01:46:41,788 --> 01:46:43,082
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

939
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:47,878
That poor bastard.

940
01:46:49,755 --> 01:46:51,466
Hands behind your head, cowboy!

941
01:46:54,468 --> 01:46:58,597
Lula, I really let you
down this time.

942
01:47:00,474 --> 01:47:01,851
Peanut!

943
01:47:02,518 --> 01:47:04,312
Look for the damned thing!

944
01:47:04,728 --> 01:47:09,692
We'll find it,
they sew them things back on.

945
01:47:10,109 --> 01:47:11,652
Works good as new.

946
01:47:12,068 --> 01:47:14,154
I can't find it.
Where is the damned thing?

947
01:47:14,571 --> 01:47:16,282
It's gotta be here somewhere.

948
01:47:44,061 --> 01:47:47,647
Pardon me. I'm lookin' for 770378.

949
01:48:01,327 --> 01:48:02,996
Sailor, baby!

950
01:48:33,026 --> 01:48:38,740
Oh my God! Oh my God!

951
01:48:39,156 --> 01:48:43,538
My baby, sweetest one. Oh, sweetheart.

952
01:48:43,955 --> 01:48:46,415
Mama's gonna take you home.
We're gonna go home.

953
01:48:46,833 --> 01:48:48,877
Santos is gonna help us.

954
01:48:49,293 --> 01:48:54,883
He's gonna take us
to the airport in San Antonio.

955
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:58,135
It's OK, baby.
- No... - Yes.

956
01:48:59,678 --> 01:49:01,472
Come!
We're gonna go.

957
01:49:01,889 --> 01:49:03,433
It's OK.
- Mama! - Yes?

958
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:07,227
Sailor's in deep trouble here.
I can't just leave him.

959
01:49:07,645 --> 01:49:10,940
Oh yes, you can!

960
01:49:11,357 --> 01:49:14,109
Yes, you can!

961
01:49:19,032 --> 01:49:21,743
Your mama was
real worried about you, honey.

962
01:49:22,784 --> 01:49:24,412
Me too.

963
01:49:26,914 --> 01:49:29,460
Can you
give your old friend Santos a hug?

964
01:49:40,386 --> 01:49:42,222
Dearest Sailor,

965
01:49:42,888 --> 01:49:46,518
First thing you'll want to know is:
I'm keeping the baby.

966
01:49:46,935 --> 01:49:50,647
Mama wasn't for it at first,
but I think now she is.

967
01:49:51,064 --> 01:49:56,110
I'm gonna name it Pace,
no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

968
01:49:56,528 --> 01:50:01,782
It's kinda hard to believe that
Pace will be six when you get out.

969
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,744
Our child!

970
01:50:05,162 --> 01:50:07,539
I love you, Sailor.

971
01:50:07,956 --> 01:50:10,501
I miss dancing
and talking,

972
01:50:10,917 --> 01:50:13,170
and especially the other!

973
01:50:18,216 --> 01:50:21,594
5 YEARS, 10 MONTHS, 21 DAYS LATER

974
01:50:22,595 --> 01:50:27,684
When... does... Sailor's train get in?

975
01:50:28,977 --> 01:50:30,397
Six.

976
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:38,821
If I asked you
not to go...

977
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,447
It wouldn't make any difference.

978
01:50:42,699 --> 01:50:46,245
Girl, what if I told you
not to go?

979
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:50,374
Mama, if you get in the way
of our happiness,

980
01:50:50,791 --> 01:50:53,127
I'll fucking pull your
arms out by the roots!

981
01:51:13,063 --> 01:51:15,024
No!

982
01:51:22,323 --> 01:51:25,035
Mama,
you almost crashed us!

983
01:51:27,078 --> 01:51:29,039
Oh, an accident, baby!

984
01:51:37,046 --> 01:51:39,088
Oh no, oh man!

985
01:51:41,718 --> 01:51:44,345
Same fuckin' thing
happened to me last year!

986
01:52:43,197 --> 01:52:44,948
You must be my son.

987
01:52:49,703 --> 01:52:51,998
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.

988
01:52:56,918 --> 01:53:01,215
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace.
I read a lot about you.

989
01:53:26,741 --> 01:53:28,576
Are you hungry?

990
01:53:30,828 --> 01:53:32,705
Lead the way.

991
01:53:33,748 --> 01:53:35,208
No!

992
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:37,877
No!

993
01:54:00,816 --> 01:54:02,778
What's wrong, Mama?

994
01:54:03,195 --> 01:54:05,613
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.

995
01:54:18,961 --> 01:54:21,420
I'm sorry, Sailor,
I just can't help it.

996
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:25,591
Just give me one little minute,
then I'll quit.

997
01:54:26,009 --> 01:54:29,471
The boy's frightened,
Lula. This ain't no good.

998
01:54:32,099 --> 01:54:34,434
Really, Sailor, I'll be okay.

999
01:54:41,357 --> 01:54:43,359
It's a mistake, honey.

1000
01:54:43,777 --> 01:54:47,197
You two go on.
I'll walk back to the depot.

1001
01:54:48,532 --> 01:54:52,953
What are you talking about?
That's your son in there!

1002
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:55,290
He never knew me, Lula.

1003
01:54:55,706 --> 01:54:57,583
So there's not
much for him to forget.

1004
01:54:57,999 --> 01:55:02,336
And 6 years apart
makes it almost simple for us too.

1005
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:06,300
How can you say that, Sailor?

1006
01:55:08,218 --> 01:55:10,178
It's what makes sense.

1007
01:55:13,725 --> 01:55:15,767
Please don't do this, Sailor!

1008
01:55:18,312 --> 01:55:19,979
If ever something
doesn't feel right to you,

1009
01:55:20,398 --> 01:55:22,567
remember
what Pancho said to the Cisco Kid:

1010
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:29,199
"Let's win, before we're dancing
at the end of a rope, without music."

1011
01:55:43,128 --> 01:55:45,715
You've been fine without me.

1012
01:55:46,131 --> 01:55:50,094
No need to make life
tougher than it has to be.

1013
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:14,370
Sailor, come back!

1014
01:57:22,687 --> 01:57:24,231
What do you faggots want?

1015
01:58:05,981 --> 01:58:07,274
The Good Witch...

1016
01:58:10,153 --> 01:58:11,738
Lula loves you.

1017
01:58:12,531 --> 01:58:16,284
But I'm a robber
and a manslaughterer.

1018
01:58:16,702 --> 01:58:19,119
And I haven't had
any parental guidance.

1019
01:58:19,538 --> 01:58:22,582
She's forgiven you all that.

1020
01:58:23,792 --> 01:58:27,295
You love her.

1021
01:58:27,712 --> 01:58:29,840
Don't be afraid, Sailor.

1022
01:58:30,966 --> 01:58:34,094
But I'm wild at heart.

1023
01:58:34,554 --> 01:58:37,265
If you are truly wild at heart,

1024
01:58:38,306 --> 01:58:40,725
you'll fight for your dreams.

1025
01:58:44,896 --> 01:58:47,774
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.

1026
01:58:49,651 --> 01:58:52,113
Don't turn away from love.

1027
01:59:19,890 --> 01:59:21,309
Had enough, asshole?

1028
01:59:24,102 --> 01:59:25,854
Yes I have.

1029
01:59:26,439 --> 01:59:28,649
And I want to
apologize to you gentlemen

1030
01:59:29,066 --> 01:59:31,402
for referring to you as homosexuals.

1031
01:59:31,819 --> 01:59:34,405
I also want to thank you fellows.

1032
01:59:34,822 --> 01:59:38,034
You've taught me
a valuable lesson in life.

1033
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,794
I just met
the Good Witch.

1034
02:01:11,794 --> 02:01:21,794
