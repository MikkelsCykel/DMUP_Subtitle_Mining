1
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,253
A case in point in anger's
ability to change us

2
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,262
is my mother.

3
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,696
My mother was always
the nicest person I ever knew.

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,933
She was the nicest, sweetest woman
than anyone who knew her ever knew.

5
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,237
Then things changed...

6
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,107
then she changed.

7
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,477
She got angry.
Good and angry.

8
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:35,988
Anger has turned my mother
into a very sad and bitter woman.

9
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,757
If she wasn't my mother,
I'd slap her.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,927
I would.

11
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,598
I'd look her straight in the face and
tell her what I really think of her...

12
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,507
and then I'd run really fast
in the opposite direction.

13
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,010
- Are you eating?
- Yes.

14
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,451
I want you eating.
I mean it.

15
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,249
Okay.

16
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,387
You ladies
are old enough now,

17
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,397
I'm not gonna pull
any punches here.

18
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,399
He took his wallet...

19
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,401
and he left.

20
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,403
When he didn't come home
the other night,

21
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,405
you know,
I thought we got lucky

22
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,407
and he was just
in a car crash,

23
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,705
dead by the side of the road,
but the fact is,

24
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:01,373
he's run off with his little Swedish
secretary, who, oh, what a coincidence,

25
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,406
mysteriously left work three days ago
and moved back to Sweden!

26
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,050
But where did he go?
Have you spoken to him?

27
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,058
No, I haven't
spoken to him.

28
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
There is
very little to say.

29
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,297
He knows that. But I did cut off
all his goddamn credit cards.

30
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,731
Closed his checking
account, yeah.

31
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,758
See how long she sticks
around when he's broke.

32
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,566
Your father is a...

33
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,596
small man.

34
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,439
Very small.

35
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,604
I hope that's not an allusion
to the man's genitals

36
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,080
- 'cause that'd just be gross.
- Aw, dude,

37
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,276
- I was about to eat a string bean.
- Oh, my god...

38
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,878
Excuse me, excuse me.
Everything is not a joke.

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,911
I am talking.

40
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,600
And as
a jittery nation worries

41
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,504
about a counterstrike, we'll go to the
scene of the anthrax scare in Florida.

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,341
Sheesh.

43
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,797
Hey. Hey, Terry.

44
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,799
What do you want?

45
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,801
Well, I-I...

46
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,803
I wanted to talk
to you and Grey

47
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,203
about them building that
subdivision back there?

48
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,207
- Yeah?
- He's so, um...

49
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,209
He's so damned set
against it,

50
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,211
he hasn't even heard
the proposal.

51
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,213
Grey doesn't
live here anymore, Denny.

52
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,215
He doesn't exist.

53
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,240
Go away.

54
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,083
Officials tell us
that they are worried

55
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,323
about how to manage the fragile US-led
coalition in the days ahead,

56
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,092
but the facts
are already evident

57
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,327
from south Asia, to Africa,
to the Middle East.

58
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,393
Worldwide, thousands
of angry demonstrators

59
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,304
are taking to the streets
to protest US military...

60
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,468
The least he could have done
was taken this stupid jock with him.

61
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,570
There have been plenty
of protests in the world.

62
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,274
And I suspect...

63
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,284
Ugh.

64
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,286
What... what...

65
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,880
what do you mean,
"He doesn't exist"?

66
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,413
Oh.

67
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,694
Are you stoned?

68
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,891
- Yeah.
- Oh... Jesus.

69
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,899
What do you...
what do you mean,

70
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,560
"He... he doesn't exist"?

71
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,728
He's been messing around
with his assistant.

72
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,738
Go talk about it
on the radio.

73
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,070
No, I'm... I'm...
no, I'm-I'm... I'm-I'm be...

74
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm being serious.
I need... I need to talk to him.

75
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,880
Um...

76
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,905
He left me.

77
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,809
- He left you?
- Mm. For Danken Shane

78
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,821
or whatever his
secretary's name is,

79
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,517
so Denny you can go ahead
and build your...

80
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,526
damn subdivision
back there...

81
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,528
I don't know,
whatever it is you want.

82
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,996
It was him who had
the problem with it, not me, okay?

83
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,534
- He left you?
- Yes.

84
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,559
- Really?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,398
Hey, I'm sorry,
Terry.

86
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,043
You know, go ahead and build
your houses back there, Denny.

87
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,549
- He's gone. He won't stop...
- They're not my houses.

88
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,552
They're not.
I'm just, um...

89
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,884
I'm just the front man,
you know,

90
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,616
wave the
World Series ring.

91
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,114
They get the sales,
I'm getting a free lot out of it.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,128
Ooh, a free lot.

93
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,153
- Hmm.
- It's something Shep set up.

94
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,295
He really left?
Really?

95
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,307
This is... true?

96
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,332
Yeah.

97
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,106
Hey, come on.
Just go away.

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,914
Hey. Well... ah... look,
let me come in.

99
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,991
Come on, if yo...
if you don't want,

100
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,360
I won't talk. I'll just sit there
and I'll drink with you.

101
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,032
There was a large mob...

102
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,036
of angry demonstrators
here today,

103
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,096
proving that a number
of people are willing to go and fight.

104
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,973
- The feeling is that...
- I got her to school.

105
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,944
Thank you.

106
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,208
You know I'm going back
to school in the morning,

107
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,340
you're gonna get her
yourself tomorrow.

108
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,267
Billy Edwards on my bus says
that when you get really drunk,

109
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,534
you get friendly and you sign baseballs
without bitching about it.

110
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,699
- He does?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,772
So, you got any
baseballs around?

112
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,044
No.

113
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,610
Why don't you run
down the street to my house.

114
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,621
I got a...

115
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,056
stack of boxes in my garage.
There's a key under my mat.

116
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,152
You grab one of those boxes.
You bring it back here.

117
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,722
One box.

118
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,162
Anything she makes...

119
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,262
I'm gonna split with her.

120
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,446
Buddy, Goddamn you!
Out!

121
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,613
What's the big deal? He wasn't licking
it more than three seconds.

122
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,091
The three second thing is for floors,
not dogs' mouths.

123
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,821
He spends all day
licking other dogs' asses.

124
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,829
Oh, let's just call
for take-out.

125
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,593
It's fine. You guys, it's good chicken.
It's fine.

126
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,101
Like you'd eat it?

127
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,941
It's fine.

128
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,241
You know the Zilwaukees'
Great Dane, "Mo'fo?"

129
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,145
You're licking
his asshole right now.

130
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,781
You know what,
that's really sick.

131
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,083
How's dinner coming?

132
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,750
Good.
We made your favorite.

133
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,656
- Chicken.
- Thank you.

134
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,491
Um, can you make an extra plate?
Denny's staying for dinner.

135
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,690
That was quick.

136
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,667
What was quick?

137
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,135
What was quick?

138
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,161
Denny?!

139
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,508
Please...

140
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,409
Give me more credit than that, Hadley.
He's a drunk.

141
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,413
You make a nice couple.

142
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,853
My life is falling apart
at this moment.

143
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,288
I expect some compassion
from you.

144
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,292
Now you go back up
to school tomorrow,

145
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,726
come back home
at Christmas break

146
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,729
and bust my hump
if you want to,

147
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,324
but right this minute, I want
the benefit of the doubt at every turn!

148
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,335
Are we clear?

149
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,360
Yes.

150
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,863
Thank you.

151
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,438
Mm, this looks good.

152
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,387
What kind of a dick-head
runs away

153
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,892
with his secretary?

154
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,224
That is lame.
Take a right,

155
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,320
make a left
at pathetic.

156
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,855
I think he's coming
back home.

157
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,196
Maybe not soon,
but... I do.

158
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,343
I think we should
call him.

159
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,345
And say what?

160
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,779
"Hey Dad, how's your
new life going so far?

161
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,975
I got an A
in interpretive dance."

162
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,479
He doesn't care about you, Emily.
Get real.

163
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,324
He lost his job, Hadley.

164
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,259
- What?
- Your father was about to be laid off.

165
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,285
He was told
a few months ago.

166
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,291
He was devastated.
He didn't want you girls to know it.

167
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,772
Okay? I think he
flipped out or something.

168
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,774
I read this article

169
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,833
on the internet.
Apparently, it's common.

170
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,004
They lose their jobs,
and they go nuts.

171
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,775
What do you want
from me?

172
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,441
It's the best
that I can come up with.

173
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,245
I don't want
anything from you.

174
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,650
Well, don't take it out on me, Hadley.
You aren't gonna have to be here.

175
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,416
You aren't gonna know
how empty this house is gonna be.

176
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,889
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I hate him too.

177
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,892
Oh, does that mean
you hate me?

178
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,894
You are such a mental.

179
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,919
I have to go, okay?

180
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,123
All right.

181
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,727
I'll see you later,
okay?

182
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,831
Terry.

183
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,457
Hey.

184
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,468
Listen to my show
today, okay?

185
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,494
I'll mention you.

186
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,506
I'm gonna bring you up
as a drinking buddy

187
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,998
- I watched the invasion with.
- I don't want you to do that, Denny.

188
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,274
I know, but...
you don't have a choice.

189
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,713
Yeah, I do. I don't want to be
mentioned on the radio.

190
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,684
You don't want
to be mentioned?

191
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,242
- # She cried more, more, more! #
- No.

192
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,516
#With a rebel yell #

193
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,580
- # She cried more, more, more! #
- Okay.

194
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,115
Oh God.

195
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,999
Hey, come on!
Slow down!

196
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,867
- There's children playing here!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

197
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,896
- There's children playing here!
- Sorry!

198
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,790
And now, once again,

199
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,796
Detroit's own legendary
Denny Davies.

200
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,858
Okay, it's the Denny Davies show.

201
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,870
And if you're
a regular listener,

202
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,930
and you've just tuned in, you know
that you haven't missed much.

203
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,441
And you know that's the beauty
of the show, right, Shep?

204
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,309
You can always just
jump right in here with us

205
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,745
- because...
- Because nothing ever happens.

206
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,749
Nothing ever
happens, exactly

207
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,513
Now what were we talking about
just before the commercial?

208
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,113
Oh yeah.
The invasion, right?

209
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,123
- See?
- Right?

210
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,284
- You still do have your memory.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,794
I know what people are saying.
Were you watching TV?

212
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,797
As a matter of fact,
I was watching it

213
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,799
with my drinking buddy
the very sweet,

214
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,801
the very tall
and absolutely sexy

215
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,803
Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

216
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,305
But you...
but you know what?

217
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,807
- What?
- She doesn't want me to talk about her,

218
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,902
so I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna talk about her.

219
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,572
Not gonna talk
about who?

220
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,343
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

221
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,249
I get it. We're not even mentioning
Terry Ann Wolfmeyer's name.

222
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,810
- Nope.
- Is that the game that you're playing?

223
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,653
- Not even gonna bring her up.
- Terry Ann Wolfmeyer.

224
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,092
- You're getting no play.
- On 101 WRIF Detroit.

225
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,288
You're listening
to the Denny Davies show.

226
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,299
What I don't get, is how come
you won't talk about baseball?

227
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,131
With all they pay you every year,
what's with you not talking about base...

228
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,569
Hey, guess what,
guess what, pinhead?

229
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,573
They don't pay me
that much.

230
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,973
He just got flushed.

231
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,110
Okay, that's...

232
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,114
that's it for me folks,
the Poobah's up next,

233
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,116
Big Daddy Arthur P.

234
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,618
But I'll be with you tomorrow,
and you can all call in

235
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,054
give me hell, the radio equivalent
of dunking the clown...

236
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,058
into the water.

237
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,060
WRIF Detroit at 5:00...

238
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,925
That wasn't too bad,
was it, Shep?

239
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,759
Wasn't too... vicious?

240
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,823
No, you were mild today. You probably
only lost about 6 or 7,000 listeners.

241
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,926
You should feel really good
about yourself.

242
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,460
- WRIF or email the Poobah
at Arthur P...

243
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,439
Hey, but what was
all that about?

244
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,840
- All what?
- That whole thing about the woman

245
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,844
you watched the invasion
with? Who's she?

246
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,846
Just a girl.

247
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,178
Yeah, she's one
of the 20-year-olds, isn't she?

248
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,650
From the college thing.
The one I got you.

249
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,653
No.

250
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,917
No, she's not 20.
She's nowhere near 20.

251
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,584
In fact, look,
don't superimpose

252
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,593
your warped thinking
onto my life, okay?

253
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,094
I got enough problems.

254
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,097
Okay, well,
then while we're at it,

255
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,099
don't knock
my dating habits, okay?

256
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,101
'Cause they keep me young.

257
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,662
I happen to be a walking encyclopedia
of every boy-band that ever existed.

258
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,606
Trust me, you don't get that from dating
Arianna Huffington.

259
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:46,236
Did you, uh, find out about that, uh,
mall opening in Toledo?

260
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,111
- What it's price was?
- Yeah, $10,000.

261
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,207
$10,000 for you
to show up

262
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,151
for one-half an hour.

263
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,552
- You know, it must suck for you...
- You're going.

264
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,386
...not, uh, being me.
- Yeah, almost as much as it must suck

265
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,791
- actually being you.
- And now, your Rock 'n' Roll

266
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,057
- radio chaperone of Detroit...
- Go home.

267
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,554
Seriously. I've got a real
disc jockey to produce.

268
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,624
A die-hard drinking fan
with a serious football problem.

269
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,829
My impression of you
in about 15 minutes.

270
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,033
...WRIF Detroit.

271
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,406
That was said with love.

272
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,051
Where's Mom?

273
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,316
She's upstairs
taking a shower.

274
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,025
What are you working on?

275
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,965
What are you looking
in the want-ads for?

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,991
A job.

277
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,597
I need to work.
I'm not going to college.

278
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,630
Okay.

279
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,576
It's okay with me,
I guess.

280
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,636
Thank you.

281
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,874
- What are you gonna do?
- I want to be a reporter.

282
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,009
- A newscaster.
- Well, you have the face for it.

283
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,790
Oh. Are you staying
for dinner?

284
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,884
Depends.

285
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,157
If you're making any more
of that chicken, I am.

286
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,422
Here you go.

287
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,118
A little something
to get you into second gear.

288
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,126
What are you doing?

289
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,526
I wasn't looking,
relax.

290
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,622
Get out!
Jesus!

291
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,498
I get out, I'm taking
this drink with me.

292
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,593
Have you ever heard
of boundaries?

293
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,604
Okay, that's it.

294
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,629
I'm drinking them both.

295
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,500
Give me the drink.

296
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,948
I-I wasn't looking.

297
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,973
All right?
I, uh...

298
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,376
I didn't see much.

299
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,348
All right, well...
what are you doing here?

300
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,916
- What do you want?
- Well, little Emily invited me...

301
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,394
for dinner.

302
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,023
- She did?
- Yes, she did,

303
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,795
and I think you know
my position on free food.

304
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,199
Which one of you
recites Brownie?

305
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,212
Come on, your mother
told me once that one of you

306
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,412
recites Brownie,
beautifully.

307
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,622
Oh. Browning,

308
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,523
Elizabeth Barrett Browning
and I was telling you that...

309
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,527
um... Popeye,
a few years back

310
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,859
when you were like,
I don't know, nine or 10 or so.

311
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,626
I had her read Browning
and she used to

312
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,292
commit some
of the poems to memory

313
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,301
and recite them here
at the dinner table.

314
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,303
That's right.

315
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,305
That's what it was.
That sounds...

316
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,307
that sounds good.

317
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,309
I've never heard anything
like it before

318
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,311
but it...
it sounds fun.

319
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,313
To who?

320
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,508
To all of us,
if she can remember.

321
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,509
Popeye?

322
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,891
Can we do this tomorrow night
when I've had notice

323
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,326
and can make plans
to eat somewhere else?

324
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,352
I don't remember any
of them anyway.

325
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,133
I do.

326
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,135
- You do?
- Yeah.

327
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,434
Really?
Wow.

328
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,099
I'm impressed.

329
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,473
Good.
You should be.

330
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,554
What's so funny?

331
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,523
Nothing. Just...

332
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,548
You're just all...
I don't know...

333
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,885
very female.

334
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:51,345
I got her number in Sweden...
from Helen Trailer.

335
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,351
It forwards and I...

336
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,980
called last night.

337
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,650
It must've been the middle
of the night there.

338
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,216
It was Grey that answered.
I'm sure of it.

339
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,925
Yeah. I hung up
like a six-year-old.

340
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,736
Ah, he'll marry her.
I'd bet any money in the world.

341
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,901
What do you think
you'll do?

342
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,914
Eh, what can I do?

343
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,916
Well, you're set up,
right?

344
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,918
Right?

345
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,217
I mean Grey's got to be
pretty chunky

346
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,018
in the money department,

347
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,922
- plus, you have...
- I have, what?

348
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,887
Bills?
Responsibilities?

349
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,897
Four girls?
One that hates me,

350
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,422
two or three that are
leaning that way.

351
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,165
You can have your damn lots
back there, Denny.

352
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,669
I'm not here
for the lots.

353
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,113
Then leave.

354
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,415
Any other reason than that
for you to be here, frankly,

355
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,444
is just pitiful.

356
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,741
- Are you okay?
- No.

357
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,769
I'm a wreck.

358
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,873
She's gonna take us
to school.

359
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,214
You see women...

360
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,158
on TV, in the movies,

361
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,494
and they get left
or whatever.

362
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,398
You just wanna kick 'em,
they're so whiny.

363
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,860
Look at me.

364
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,975
I hate his guts.
I hate his guts for what he's done.

365
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,480
Oh.

366
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,483
He's a pig,
your dad.

367
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,384
Just a vile, selfish,
horrible pig,

368
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,251
but you know what?

369
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,381
I'm not gonna trash him
to you girls.

370
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,415
I'm not.

371
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,196
I hate him too.

372
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,198
I hate him so much.

373
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,700
I know you do, baby.

374
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,225
You're human.
How could you not?

375
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,276
#When your eyes
were open wide #

376
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,681
- All right. See you.
- # For the the last... #

377
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,756
Hey, hey, wait.

378
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,257
Who is that?

379
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,259
He's cute.

380
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,261
That's Gorden Reiner.
He's new.

381
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,263
He's from Chicago.

382
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,265
- Go meet him.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,666
I met him. He's not
interested in me.

384
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,728
All he likes to talk about
is bungee jumping.

385
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,964
Tell him you're
from a broken home.

386
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,071
- I'm serious.
- Should I?

387
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,207
Guys think things
like that are great.

388
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,719
Trust me.
I'm gonna use it.

389
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,725
Hi, Gorden.

390
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,750
Hey.

391
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,620
Did you know I'm
from a broken home?

392
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,299
Okay, bye.

393
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,677
Turn it down.

394
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:17,442
- Wolfmeyer residence
- Hey, beautiful.

395
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,451
It's Denny.

396
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,248
- Which one is this?
- It's Andy.

397
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,255
Bingo. You still
lookin' for work?

398
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,315
- I am.
- Well, I want you to come in tomorrow.

399
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,385
And see Shep Goodman
from my show.

400
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,419
He needs
a production assistant.

401
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,659
Denny, you're kidding me.

402
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,667
- You're amazing.
- Yeah...

403
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,726
well, you tell that
to your mom, we're even.

404
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,238
So you come in tomorrow, okay?
I'll set you two up.

405
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,798
Okay!
Thank you so much!

406
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,447
Oh my God.

407
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,506
I might get a job
working on Denny's show.

408
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,518
- Are you kidding me?
- No!

409
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,544
- That would be amazing!
- That would be so cool.

410
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,078
- Oh my God.
- What's up?

411
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,421
Denny just called.
She might get a job on his show.

412
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,551
Oh, really?
Denny just called here?

413
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,425
Yeah, I have an
interview tomorrow

414
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,895
for a job.

415
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,126
Wait, wait.
What about school?

416
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,430
I want a job.

417
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,333
I'm not going to college.

418
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,737
Wha... you're not going
to college?

419
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,937
No, I told Daddy and he wanted me
to wait to tell you, but now...

420
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,104
Oh, but now that he's off
screwing his assistant,

421
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,637
you think you can safely drop
the bomb on me, is that it?

422
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,052
No.

423
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,283
"No" is right.
You are going to college!

424
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,314
You know damn well
how I feel about this.

425
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:39,528
All four of you.
You're all goddamn going to college!

426
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,499
I don't have a job open.

427
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,369
It's that simple, Denny.
It's cut and dry.

428
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,373
This girl has something.

429
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,375
She does, Sheppy,
she's sharp.

430
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,377
She has class.

431
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,778
You could be hiring the next, um...
Diane Sawyer.

432
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,511
I don't have a job open.

433
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,111
I know you don't,
but you could do this

434
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,121
for me, right?
You could do this for me.

435
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,055
No, I can't.
Wanna know why?

436
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,059
- Yes, why?
- Okay, I'm gonna come in there.

437
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,788
I'm gonna tell you.
Hold on.

438
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,796
Jesus.

439
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,525
I'm going on
in a second here.

440
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,795
Because, my lord,
I'm too busy doing

441
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,529
other things
for you.

442
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,334
"My lord"?

443
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,399
#I'm looking for #

444
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:28,674
#A simple kind of life.
Slow and easy #

445
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,681
- # A life that won't #
- Hi.

446
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,683
- # Bring me down #
- Um, I'm Andy Wolfmeyer,

447
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,379
I'm here to see
Shep Goodman about a job.

448
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,048
Um... Denny Davies
asked me to come in.

449
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,422
Oh, okay. Well, if you'd like
to take a seat over there.

450
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,519
- I'll let him know you're here.
- Okay, thank you.

451
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,530
No, you're not
understanding me,

452
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,589
- You're making this really...
- I found one!

453
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,601
I've got an opening.
Something's come up.

454
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,068
I found an opening.

455
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,570
- I'm on the phone.
- Okay.

456
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,506
If you want her to have
the job, I'll make it happen.

457
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,907
You'll just owe me, as usual.

458
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,570
I got the job.

459
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,274
What job?

460
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,578
With Denny, as a
production assistant.

461
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,416
Yes, what?

462
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,319
Are you looking
to get laid?

463
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,324
Is... is this
what's going on?

464
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,485
I mean, are-are you
looking for

465
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,586
another notch in your belt,
or... I don't know...

466
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,097
whatever it is you super
sports heroes call it.

467
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,100
I mean are you
looking to get lucky with me...

468
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,501
- to get me into bed?
- Uh, who's calling?

469
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,505
Be straight with me, Denny.

470
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,269
Be straight. Now, Grey always thought
you had an eye for me,

471
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,139
and I need you to be
really straight with me now.

472
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,044
Uh, okay. Um...

473
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,140
I do like you.

474
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,777
I always have.
Um...

475
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,787
You wanna have sex with me.
Is that it?

476
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,789
No! Uh, no, I mean...

477
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,986
um... well, uh...

478
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,893
yeah, if you're offering,
I guess.

479
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,556
Okay then.

480
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,588
I'll be right there.
Give me 10 minutes.

481
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,867
- Uh, ex... excuse me?
- Give me 10 minutes.

482
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,566
I'm not gonna do much with my face,
though, so don't expect much.

483
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,574
In fact,
keep the drapes shut.

484
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,042
I don't like a lot of light.
It's not very light in there, is it?

485
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,045
No, there, uh...

486
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,411
there's not a lot
of light here.

487
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,416
Okay, well,
have a drink.

488
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,247
Have a couple.

489
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,584
I don't want you to have
a real clear memory of this

490
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,680
when it's over, okay?
I'll see you soon.

491
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,397
Slow down!

492
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,493
- Slow down!
- Oh, please. Come on.

493
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,232
- There's children playing here!
- Ah, get over yourself!

494
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,263
There's children
playing here!

495
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,949
Hello?

496
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,974
I'm here!

497
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,048
Uh, Denny?

498
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,758
Denny?

499
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,756
I'm coming up!

500
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,828
Denny?

501
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,056
Hello?

502
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,067
It's me.

503
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,626
Listen, um,
something came up.

504
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,468
I had a, uh...
I had a call.

505
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,703
They needed me right away
over at the station.

506
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,802
- Shep's in some kind of trouble.
- Oh, yeah.

507
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,370
- You are so full of shit.
- I'm not.

508
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,382
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

509
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,407
I'm not and...

510
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,120
in fact, I'd like
a rain check.

511
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,122
It's not gonna happen.

512
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,124
This was like...
Halley's Comet.

513
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,650
It's not coming around
again for 57 years.

514
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,357
What the fuck
is Halley's Comet?

515
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,131
But this is the main
production booth

516
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,638
This is where you and I will be
doing a lot of working.

517
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,903
- Okay.
- Here, come on, I'll show you this.

518
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,139
This is the live
on-air studio. Arthur?

519
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,271
Say hello to my new
assistant Andy Wolfmeyer.

520
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,772
- Hello, Andy.
- This is Arthur Pennhallow.

521
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,785
- He's a big deal here in town.
- Yeah.

522
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,050
We're friends.
He idolizes me, actually.

523
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:40,080
The fuck I do.

524
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,127
- He does.
- Okay.

525
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,891
That was a joke. We're tight,
and we're good friends.

526
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,898
Okay.

527
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,492
So what is "Andy" short for?
"Andrea?"

528
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,935
- Yeah, "Andrea."
- Cool. See? I'm good with names.

529
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,302
Yeah.

530
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,307
Okay, I'll show you
up at the office now,

531
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,309
- where we work a lot up there, too.
- Okay.

532
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,311
Have you seen
an Emmy in person?

533
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,313
- You've won an Emmy?
- Couple.

534
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,815
Local, but who's counting?
Actually, I have three.

535
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,444
There's only two up there, 'cause one
I keep for the hotel room when I travel.

536
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,750
Wow.

537
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,897
Kids, hurry up!
You're gonna be late!

538
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,431
- How's your lunch, Gordon?
- It's good.

539
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,344
Did you ever see that documentary
on the Chicago Seven?

540
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,780
What about the one...

541
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,790
the one about
the Kent State killings?

542
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:50,021
- No.
- Something like...

543
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,029
six people were killed
by the cops,

544
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,031
there was
all this turmoil

545
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,228
and it got really ugly and just opened
up a lot of old wounds

546
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:58,758
between the police

547
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,794
and the people
of the area.

548
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,643
I'm from
a broken home also.

549
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,843
You are?

550
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,117
Hey, do you bungee jump?

551
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,791
- No.
- Well, I do.

552
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,797
I go up with my dad.

553
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,799
We drive up north
to Fenton Valley...

554
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,734
- and bungee jump off this huge crane.
- That sounds exciting.

555
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,160
Well, I read your letter.

556
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,164
Was it too mean?

557
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,860
I don't want it
to be mean.

558
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,333
Well, I mean I do,
but I don't.

559
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,700
Well, he's your father
and he's...

560
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,934
left you
at a very tough time.

561
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,374
I know and I want him to know
that it pisses me off he hasn't called.

562
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,605
Oh, he knows.

563
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,113
He's not talking to his brother
or his friends at work.

564
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,843
He knows what he's done.

565
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,373
Are you gonna call him?

566
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,886
Please?

567
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,785
This is stupid.
It's just a stupid game.

568
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,551
You said you have
his number.

569
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,287
This letter is good.
I mean, it's good for you

570
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,295
to get your feelings out.

571
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,956
Um...

572
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,262
I want you eating,
though.

573
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,165
You are dancing so much.

574
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,965
Do you think maybe
it's too much?

575
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:43,030
I know you have this out here.
Daddy built it for you,

576
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,975
- but you spend so much time out here.
- You're such a head case.

577
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,241
- What?
- Be happy for me.

578
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,249
Be proud! Shit!

579
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,582
You know? I'm focused!
What is your problem?

580
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,248
The only thing you're focused
on is drinking and Denny!

581
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,280
Be glad that I have
a dream!

582
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,924
I was just going to tell
you how proud I am of you.

583
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,796
That's the sad thing.

584
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,003
What?

585
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,005
Well,
I'm not going to now.

586
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,836
Not after that outburst.

587
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,865
Fine, I don't care.

588
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,638
I'm in the kitchen
making dinner,

589
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,411
and it wouldn't kill you
to come up and help.

590
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,553
Who knows? You may
get there just in time

591
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,578
to pull my head out
of the oven.

592
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:58,337
- Hello?
- What... what are you doing?

593
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,318
- Oh, making the girls' lunches.
- Good for you.

594
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,585
Yeah, what the hell. I'm going after
the Mother-of-the-year award.

595
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,491
See, um...

596
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,291
- You know what I was thinking?
- No.

597
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,163
Maybe it's been...
57 years.

598
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,293
- What are you talking about?
- Halley's Comet, you know?

599
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,327
By the way, it's, uh...

600
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,532
76 years, but I'll give you
that one, smarty pants.

601
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,681
Can I come over?

602
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,683
When?

603
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,685
Now.

604
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,688
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

605
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,750
- Did you hang up?
- Uh, not yet.

606
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,353
Good, then, um...
I'm coming over.

607
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,159
I am, so...

608
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,995
don't go hide
in the yard,

609
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,467
don't pull any
reciprocal crap.

610
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,834
Is that what you did that day?
You hid in the yard?

611
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,431
No, um...

612
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,511
You know what?
Delete that last line.

613
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,513
Look, um...

614
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,515
I'm coming over.
I am.

615
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,540
I'm coming now.

616
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,057
Hold it.
#Hold it! #

617
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,059
Wait, wait, wait.

618
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,720
- What is this?
- Your lunches.

619
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,286
- Our lunches?
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,298
- Are you kidding?
- I make my own lunch.

621
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:23,300
You haven't done
it in years.

622
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,325
I'm back to basics.
What do you want?

623
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,168
- Bye.
- Have a good day!

624
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,005
No!

625
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,262
Oh, shit. Great.

626
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,912
Were you...
you taking off?

627
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,642
Hey. You're taking off,
just like that?

628
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,650
Yeah, I'm going to hide
in your yard.

629
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,175
Oh, come on, that's bullshit.
I was kidding.

630
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,356
- What are you doing?
- Step out.

631
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,381
Just step out.

632
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,329
- Are you stoned?
- Not at all.

633
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,354
- Not a bit.
- Well, you should be.

634
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:04,901
Listen, I, uh...

635
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:08,632
I know that you're fresh.
I know you're good and hurt

636
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,038
and I know that on some level,
this is way too soon...

637
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,043
- and not right.
- Yeah.

638
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,045
What's the other level?

639
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,480
I dial your number
10 times a day and hang up.

640
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,313
Come on!

641
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,478
Just a minute.

642
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,887
Goddamn, Terry, it's not like, you know,
it's not like I'm asking a lot.

643
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,891
It's just...

644
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,893
it's just...

645
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,895
I get it, okay?

646
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,897
I know who I am
for you.

647
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,899
I'm this guy that you sit
and you drink...

648
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,901
and you talk with.

649
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,336
- And now you want to fuck me.
- Well, you offered it.

650
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,340
That was before you hid
in your yard.

651
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,342
Well, I'm not hiding
in my yard, now am I?!

652
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,674
- Hey come on, lady!
- Hey, hey, hey!

653
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,702
Can that horn, now!

654
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,016
Jeez!

655
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,018
Not bad.

656
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,043
Thank you.

657
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,516
You wanna...
go back to my house?

658
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,423
I've seen your house.

659
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,194
I'll make the bed!

660
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,192
Let's go to my house.

661
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,895
Fine, let's go
to your house.

662
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,709
Oh, God.

663
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,405
Now that was
a real misstep.

664
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,684
Aw...

665
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,686
that was
a sweet thing to say.

666
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,484
God, what am I doing?

667
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,514
Why am I here?

668
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:12,920
You're here because
you're sad and lonely.

669
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,931
Desperate.

670
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,298
You need someone,
something,

671
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,303
anything to fill you.
Any...

672
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,135
- port in a storm.
- Mmm.

673
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,141
I asked why I
was here, not you.

674
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,166
What's my story?

675
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,507
Oh, your story is...

676
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,607
you're good
and bent out of shape.

677
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,149
Pissed off like
I've never seen a woman.

678
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,426
What?

679
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,824
Francis Wellard.

680
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,851
Timothy Westerburg.

681
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,722
Matthew Wintergarden.

682
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,959
Hadley Wolfmeyer!

683
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,169
Stephanie Winnington!

684
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,834
Nancy Woodside.

685
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,115
It's a special day
for her. So, just be nice.

686
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,118
- She's excited for you to meet him.
- Oh, really,

687
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,246
how excited can she be?
She's been seeing him for three years.

688
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,018
And she's in love?
She's in love?

689
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,686
- I'm just hearing about this today?
- Be nice!

690
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,288
It's not in my nature.
Why does she hate me so damn much?

691
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,958
She doesn't hate you,
she just thinks that he's stupid.

692
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,197
She thinks he's stupid?!
I thought she loved him.

693
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,170
No, she thinks
you'll think he's stupid.

694
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,173
Well, I won't think that.
That's my point.

695
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,607
She judges me so harshly.
I am her mother.

696
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,543
- Okay.
- I love her. I want her to be happy.

697
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,773
I mean, if she loves
this guy I'm gonna love...

698
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,442
- Okie dokie.
- Hi! Hi! Oh, baby!

699
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,452
Baby!

700
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,852
Oh God, I'm so proud
of you! I am!

701
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,856
I am so proud of you.

702
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,687
- Let me see your face.
- Mother.

703
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:24,489
A college graduate.
I'm so proud of you.

704
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,826
Your father doesn't know
what he's missing today.

705
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,832
I think he might.
Mm-mmm!

706
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,697
This is it.
This is life.

707
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,702
Mom?

708
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,398
- David. Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

709
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,805
My parents are having lunch
at the Wheeler hotel.

710
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,537
- You're all invited.
- The Wheeler, really?

711
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,943
We'd... well, girls,
would you like that?

712
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,948
- We... we had lunch.
- Have it again.

713
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,076
Come on, I want us to go.
I want you to meet David's parents.

714
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,053
David you tell your folks
we'd absolutely love to join them, okay?

715
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,056
- Cool. Okay, see you later.
- See you later.

716
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,058
Bye.

717
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,060
Wow.

718
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,062
He is so handsome.

719
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,064
Nice and...

720
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,066
- intelligent.
- Mother.

721
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,728
Oh! He is, baby.
I can tell by looking at him.

722
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,737
He's incredibly
intelligent.

723
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,739
All right...
um...

724
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,741
there's something
you all should know.

725
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,902
You're pregnant
and you're getting married.

726
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:16,538
How did you know that?
Who told you that?

727
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,543
I guessed?
Really?

728
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,575
I guessed that?
I was right?

729
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,555
No, you've got
to be kidding me.

730
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:28,217
No, I'm... I'm not.

731
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,249
I'm getting married.

732
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,863
This is how I find out?

733
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,798
Through Popeye?
A 15-year-old?

734
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,631
- Don't be condescending...
- Close it!

735
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,637
You are a child.
What do you know?

736
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,639
Oh, that old chestnut.

737
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,641
You close it
as well, please.

738
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,302
Do his parents know?

739
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,970
Yes, they're ecstatic.

740
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,740
Oh, how long
have they been ecstatic?

741
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,975
You know what, can we just
go to the lunch please?

742
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,449
How long have they been
ecstatic, damn you, Hadley?!

743
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:04,817
I need a Bloody Mary as soon
as is humanly possible.

744
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,466
Hi. I'm Terry.

745
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,468
Oh. Gina.
Nice to meet you.

746
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,868
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is David, my husband.

747
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,895
Oh, David Senior.
That's nice.

748
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,907
You're not Jews, obviously.

749
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,443
Oh, well I mean
not that that's a good or a bad thing.

750
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,277
That they don't
just name their children

751
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,613
after... okay,
that was horrible.

752
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,415
Um... these are
Hadley's sisters,

753
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,149
Emily, Andrea
and Popeye.

754
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,656
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

755
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,487
Could we order you
a drink before lunch?

756
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,993
Oh, I'm set for now.
Thank you.

757
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,722
Um, I'll have the same.

758
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,688
Mmn. Mmn!

759
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,793
So, I understand we have something
to celebrate? Some good news, huh?

760
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,428
Oh, we're
very excited, Terry.

761
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,099
We are crazy about Hadley.
We really are.

762
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,337
I knew from the minute
I met her. I did.

763
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,901
- You did not.
- I did.

764
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,378
No, Mother, you didn't.

765
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,381
If she said she did,
she probably did!

766
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,280
Well, I was taken
for a surprise,

767
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,717
- but... but a happy one.
- Yeah, well, you and me both.

768
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,417
- Should we toast?
- Oh, yes. Let's do.

769
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:12,155
Well... to David
and Hadley.

770
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,391
- David and Hadley...
- Oh wait, wait, wait.

771
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,524
My glass is...
this is bad luck. Uh, waiter?

772
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,535
Mother, it's okay.
Here.

773
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,197
Oh.

774
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,206
Oh, just...
a little more.

775
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,208
Just...

776
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,210
Thank you.

777
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,212
So, shall we toast?

778
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,044
- May I?
- Please, do.

779
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,620
To David and Hadley.

780
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,146
A long and beautiful
partnership.

781
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,385
- Aww.
- Thanks.

782
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,394
The... mostly right now...

783
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,488
I'm sorry, David,
this is very emotional for me.

784
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,667
To my baby.

785
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,931
My first born,
my little Hadley-wadley.

786
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,562
Aww.

787
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,574
That's what we called her.
Hadley-wadley.

788
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,406
She was so loved
from the minute she was born.

789
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,412
Just an adorable
little thing.

790
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,472
She was... well,
she grew up too fast didn't she?

791
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,506
She grew up so fast
and had a mouth on her.

792
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,745
Mother!

793
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,412
When she was in her teens
she was her own little boss.

794
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:11,512
Mother!

795
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,216
And she would sometimes
just not come home...

796
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,657
All right, could we just toast, please?
Thank you.

797
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,525
Okay, baby.
We'll toast.

798
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,934
You have to
forgive me. Um...

799
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,765
you all had a chance
to process this,

800
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,737
and I'm just coming
on board, so to speak.

801
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,242
To Hadley-wadley.

802
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:34,267
Hadley-wadley.

803
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,944
Mmn.

804
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,391
Oh.

805
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,393
Oh!

806
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,122
Oh, no, no.
I'm done toasting.

807
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,153
I'm just ordering
another drink.

808
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,600
- It was horrible.
- Maybe it wasn't.

809
00:48:57,634 --> 00:48:59,602
Maybe it wasn't
as bad as you thought.

810
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:01,604
No, it was horrible.

811
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,072
It was. I made an ass
of myself. I was like...

812
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,769
a public service film
against drinking.

813
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,778
Just...

814
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,780
yeah, I was an old lush.

815
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,782
Poor Hadley.

816
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,784
I feel so bad
for her, Denny.

817
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,343
Why are we going
out here?

818
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,090
I hate the way
I come off to my girls.

819
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,217
I just hate that I can't
control my emotions.

820
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,991
Oh God.

821
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,022
This is creepy.

822
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,204
This was all a farm
owned by the...

823
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,206
Firestone family
until the 50's.

824
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,969
This and the whole
subdivision.

825
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,671
It goes on a bit
about another eight acres.

826
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,072
Why are we out
here today?

827
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,976
I wanna do it.

828
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,683
- Out here?
- No.

829
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,692
Don't be an asshole.

830
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:57,717
I wanna sell
my part of it.

831
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,393
Just let your friends develop
the lots and tell them "Yes."

832
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,921
Tell them I don't need
the money, though.

833
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,628
If they think I need the money,
they'll play games with me.

834
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,568
- Do you?
- No.

835
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,166
Yes. No.
I don't know.

836
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,212
I'm in some trouble...

837
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,305
unless I officially
divorce the shitbox

838
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,316
which I refuse to do,

839
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,978
until at least he has
the balls to show his face.

840
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,183
I wanna give
the girls the money.

841
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,694
Just tell your friend Shep
I want to make the deal.

842
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,425
What?

843
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,868
Nothin'.

844
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:44,601
Good.
I'm going in.

845
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,905
This place is a clearinghouse
for Lime disease.

846
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,881
- Hey, this is cute.
- Shep...

847
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:01,220
- How are you, pal?
- I'm doing great.

848
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,226
I'm hanging with Andy,
how could I not be?

849
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,784
Hello, Terry.

850
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,819
Hadley...

851
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,290
Hadley's boyfriend.

852
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,302
Okay, okay.

853
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:15,736
- We're gonna go watch a movie.
- Isn't that sweet?

854
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:19,572
"The Bicycle Thief."
She's never seen "The Bicycle Thief."

855
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,236
He's a nut
for foreign cinema.

856
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,939
Anyone wanna join us?

857
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,607
Snuggle up on the couch?
Watch a classic?

858
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,189
I think we'll, uh,
probably pass.

859
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,590
Is it the subtitles?

860
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,562
You know me too well.

861
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,258
I do and it's a burden.

862
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,235
- I know him too well...
- Okay.

863
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,237
So it's a burden.
That's it.

864
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,704
Okay.

865
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:53,140
I cannot tell you how much
this thing disgusts me.

866
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,144
Oh, come on.
She's doing great at work.

867
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,669
Shep's got her producing
morning drive-time,

868
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,945
plus... I think
he really likes her.

869
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,350
Oh, the whole thing
just infuriates me.

870
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,377
That's probably half
the attraction.

871
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,160
What?

872
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,492
You know what.
Not another word.

873
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,012
The deep hatred that men
have felt for one another

874
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,148
through the ages has blossomed
into one chapter after another

875
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,880
of repression,
violence, hate, rape,

876
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,820
religious slang
and genocide.

877
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,415
I'm still working on it.

878
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:44,222
I need to fix the music.

879
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,195
It's my final
in television production.

880
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,998
You're really handsome,
Gorden.

881
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,368
Thanks.

882
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,812
I should go.

883
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,920
I really do have to go.

884
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,929
The power of stress
and naked anger

885
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,202
is seen over and over again
in the relationships

886
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,937
that exist between the male
and the female of our species.

887
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,673
Here, in rural Botswana,
an unfaithful tribeswoman

888
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,578
is brought to a field
by a group of locals

889
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,175
for a ritualized punishment
of beating and harassment.

890
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,244
Events quickly spiral out of control
for the tribesmen, though

891
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:46,517
as the woman's fury
becomes too great to contain

892
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,719
and the men are quickly forced
to flee for their safety.

893
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,826
Why am I not excited by it?

894
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:34,394
Um, because I don't think
any of these new age arts colleges

895
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,405
are really colleges.

896
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:38,964
Of course, it's a college.
What are you talking about?

897
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,671
Honey, I've been there.
I have.

898
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,679
I wanted to be a poet,
remember?

899
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,681
Just take arts courses
at Ann Arbor.

900
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,979
I don't want to go
to school in Ann Arbor.

901
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,044
No, of course you don't. It's what
I want you to do. Why would you?

902
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,612
Okay, four years learning
dance theory?

903
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,557
I have a theory about that.

904
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,583
It's not going to happen.

905
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,899
How's the show?
You enjoying it?

906
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,177
I wish you would
take me seriously.

907
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,189
Honey, I take you seriously.

908
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,215
I just don't think you have much
capacity for self-evaluation.

909
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,229
You know, you'd think
you'd be happy for me...

910
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,231
considering the way
your life turned out.

911
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:38,325
- The way your parents pushed you...
- To marry your father?
