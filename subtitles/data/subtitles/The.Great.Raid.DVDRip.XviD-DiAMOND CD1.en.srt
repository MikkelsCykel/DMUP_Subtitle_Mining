<i>Unequipped to house or feed

<i>With each new victory.
American forces advance on Japan.</i>

38
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:08,451
<i>And with each new defeat. The
Japanese army becomes more desperate.</i>

39
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:13,982
<i>Fueled by propaganda. They believe
that the Americans will show no mercy.</i>

40
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,289
<i>The government in Tokyo
encourages these fears.</i>

41
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:24,030
<i>Convincing its people they must prepare
to defend their country to the death.</i>

42

<i>dictating the Japanese army's policy
toward prisoners of war.</i>

45
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,042
<i>It reads:</i>

46
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:42,952
<i>"It is the aim not to allow the escape
of a single one.</i>

47
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:47,049
<i>"To annihilate them all.
And not leave any traces. "</i>

48
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,821
Go! Go, go!

49
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,234
<i>The landing at Lingayen Gulf</i>

50
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:46,745
<i>was the largest naval operation
ever undertaken in the Pacific.</i>

51
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,941
<i>Over a quarter million troops
came ashore.</i>

52
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,510
<i>Ready for the final push
into the Philippines.</i>

53
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:59,354
<i>I was a Stanford graduate who'd
entered the service through the R. O. T. C.</i>

54
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,360
<i>I wasn't interested
in being a career soldier.</i>

55
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,194
<i>I just wanted to do my part
and go home to my wife.</i>

56
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,333
<i>I was a captain
with the 6th Ranger battalion.</i>

57
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,067
<i>My commanding officer
was Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci.</i>

58
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,437
- You in this hand, Lieutenant?
- Thinking about it, Colonel.

59
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,280
Well, if you're thinking about it,
you already lost.

60
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:30,254
- Want me to give you a better look?
- No, Colonel, I don't want you...

61
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:35,283
<i>A West Point graduate. Mucci was
one of the most driven men I'd ever met.</i>

62
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,262
<i>He took on what seemed to many
like a hopeless task -</i>

63
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,926
<i>the job of turning a group of raw.
Untested recruits</i>

64
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,993
<i>into a new unit of elite soldiers.</i>

65
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,562
<i>Originally assigned to handle livestock.</i>

66
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,542
<i>They were mostly farm hands
from small towns in rural areas</i>

67
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,011
<i>with little or no combat experience.</i>

68
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,811
First Sergeant, overlays are ready.
Have you seen Colonel Mucci?

69
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,785
Yes, sir.
He's in the Waldorf, playing poker.

70
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:05,187
Wouldn't interrupt him right now.
I think he's losing.

71
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:10,161
Ah, for cryin' out loud. Lieutenant Foley,
get me a new deck. This one's unlucky.

72
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,130
When you stick that pipe in your mouth,
I know you're in trouble.

73
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,497
Just you wait,
you smug son of a bitch.

74
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,162
Colonel, overlays.

75
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,569
Any idea who that is?

76
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,635
<i>- No, sir.
- Corporal of the guard.</i>

77
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,705
- Yes, sir.
- Aliteri, find out who the cowboy is.

78
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,113
Sir.

79
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,755
<i>We'd spent months training
and had seen very little action.</i>

80
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,850
<i>As far as the army was concerned.</i>

81
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,863
<i>We were nothing more
than the colonel's personal experiment.</i>

82
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,422
<i>Mucci was determined
to prove them wrong.</i>

83
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,268
- General.
- Henry.

84
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,069
You know Colonel White,
and this is Major Lapham.

85
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,942
Major, this is Lieutenant Colonel
Henry Mucci, CO, 6th Ranger battalion.

86
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,175
Major Lapham is a stay-behind
from the Bataan campaign.

87
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,877
He runs guerrilla units here
in north-central Luzon.

88
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,730
Philippine guerrillas have
been the primary source

89
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:10,855
of intel for MacArthur
since the fall.

90
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,585
- It's an honor, Major.
- Thank you.

91
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,119
Major Lapham,
tell Colonel Mucci what you told us.

92
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,893
Five miles east
of Cabanatuan City here,

93
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,927
there's a Japanese POW camp holding
about 500 survivors of the death march.

94
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,371
As we advance on this area,

95
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,104
I believe the Japanese will murder
the prisoners rather than release them.

96
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,615
Major Lapham is probably right. There
was an incident in a camp on Palawan.

97
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,516
150 American POWs were herded
into air-raid shelters and burnt alive

98
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,054
on the news that MacArthur had invaded.

99
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,955
Our axis of advance
is headed right for that camp.

100
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,493
Unless we run into
something unexpected,

101
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,964
we're gonna be in Cabanatuan at the
end of the week, and that may be too late.

102
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,728
Horton, what's G2 got to say about this?

103
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,862
Because of our advances, Jap movements
have become increasingly fluid -

104
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,375
retreating at night, hiding during the day
to avoid our aircraft.

105
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,502
What that means is we can't be sure
where the enemy is.

106
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,706
They're only 30 miles
from our front lines.

107
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:13,548
There's over 30,000 Japanese troops
in that area alone, Colonel.

108
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,214
Henry, you develop a plan
and get it to the G3 by the morning.

109
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,622
<i>- Sir.
- I'll make my decision then.</i>

110
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,150
Henry, I'll be
honest with you.

111
00:09:23,151 --> 00:09:25,757
his mission appeals more
to my heart than to my head.

112
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,561
Three years ago
we ordered these men to surrender.

113
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,829
The way I see it, we owe them a great debt.

114
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:35,169
But... I need you
to be a hard-headed pragmatist.

115
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,301
If it doesn't feel right,
you call it off. Understand?

116
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,435
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,673
- Who will you assign it to?
- I'll lead it myself.

118
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,580
Let the rest of your
battalion worry about it.

119
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,814
I trained these Rangers. Everything
I've asked them to do, I've done myself.

120
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,880
I feel like they deserve a shot at this.

121
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,926
And so do I.

122
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,484
All right, Henry.
You show me a plan that works.

123
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,824
Sir.

124
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,356
General Krueger
hasn't made up his mind yet,

125
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,198
so I need you to come up
with a hell of a plan.

126
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,297
The Alamo Scouts are briefing us in five.
After that, you've got till the morning.

127
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,001
Yes, sir.

128
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,704
Sir, when you said
you were going to accompany us...

129
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,408
Don't worry, Captain.
You'll be leading the raid, not me.

130
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,508
<i>How many guards
in the compound?</i>

131
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:24,044
<i>- Could be as many as 200.
- Any tanks?</i>

132
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,958
This building with the metal roof
looks like it's protecting something.

133
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:36,125
If the camp is here, what is the Japanese
strength inside Cabanatuan City?

134
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:40,832
- 9,000 troops, sir.
- Not to worry. That's over 4 miles away.

135
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,603
What's enemy traffic like on this road?

136
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,612
The Japanese are moving their troops
from south to north.

137
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,309
So this is one of their main routes.

138
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,785
Looks like this bridge
is a mile away from the camp.

139
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,843
Half a mile, sir.

140
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,118
We believe it's heavily fortified. We're
not sure how many troops are guarding it.

141
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:03,355
Sir, it's hard to determine the number of
men we'll need without more specific intel.

142
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,866
Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury,
Bob. I selected you for your flexibility.

143
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,130
Now, you've got
a 24-hour jump on us, Lieutenant.

144
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,604
Is that enough time to get Captain Prince
all the dope he needs?

145
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,735
We'll be ready to report to you at 0800
hours on the morning of the 29th, sir.

146
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,406
<i>- Get it done.
- Yes, sir.</i>

147
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,076
Sir, the tough nut is the final approach.

148
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,712
No cover for over 800 yards.

149
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,689
It's as flat as a pancake.

150
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,836
Hey. Hey!

151
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,608
How far do you think
Hewitt's got by now?

152
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,552
What difference does it make?

153
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,022
The Japs are gonna catch him
sooner or later.

154
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,464
You couldn't have got me
something easier to chew?

155
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,198
A mango, banana?

156
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,469
Duke's selling graveyard rats,
but I thought...

157
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,705
I thought that'd be overindulging.

158
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,113
Is it your gums
or your teeth hurting?

159
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,318
Starts at the gums, works its way
around the back of my head

160
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,155
and then ends up
in my neck somewhere.

161
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,320
Don't worry.
It's not malaria.

162
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,725
- Sir.
- Take a knee, Lieutenant.

163
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,993
We've just translated
a telegram to Colonel Mori.

164
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,801
MacArthur's conquered the southern
islands. He's landed here on Luzon.

165
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:33,140
Good ol' Dugout Doug.
He can take in the sun for a few days,

166
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,306
then head on back to Australia
like he did the first time.

167
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:40,409
The information's good, Major.
I'm in that office every day.

168
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:45,583
We don't know how close MacArthur is
or when he'll reach Cabanatuan.

169
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:51,052
Tell the men the best thing to do is sit
tight and stay calm till we find out more.

170
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,961
Yes, sir.

171
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,860
- Make sure McMahon gets that.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,598
<i>Come on, get up!</i>

173
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:04,175
<i>Come on, get up!</i>

174
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,905
- They caught Hewitt.
- Who was watchin' him?

175
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,019
Poor dumb bastard
couldn't even wait till it got dark.

176
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,408
<i>You are responsible for this.</i>

177
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:48,583
You surrender like cowards,
then you run away like dogs.

178
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:53,216
He'll die, because none of you
had the courage to stop him!

179
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,820
Redding.

180
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,126
<i>I need food.</i>

181
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,443
Colvin, watch his back.

182
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,015
- How much?
- Five.

183
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,637
- You should not have come.
- Neither should you.

184
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,975
The guards are getting
harder to bribe.

185
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,674
What we really need is more medicine.

186
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:30,882
Carlos and my father were questioned
by the Japanese last week.

187
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,981
They are watching us.

188
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,424
Then tell Margaret
not to take any more risks.

189
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,758
<i>You think she'll listen?</i>

190
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,359
Is there anything else
you want me to tell her?

191
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,874
Just to take care.

192
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:55,039
There is some quinine in the peanuts.
Take some yourself, huh?

193
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,140
You don't look well.

194
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,415
<i>Who's Margaret, Red?</i>

195
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,692
She's an American nurse who was married
to his commanding officer.

196
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:16,064
He died of malaria about a year ago
in one of the other camps.

197
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,661
<i>- Is the major involved with her?
- What makes you ask?</i>

198
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,536
<i>Nothing.</i>

199
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,741
He just sounded concerned.

200
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,641
Well, he wasn't involved with her,
but he should have been.

201
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,310
Her husband
didn't give a damn about her,

202
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,219
<i>and Gibby couldn't give a damn
about anyone else but her.</i>

203
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,850
- Why didn't he do something about it?
- 'Cause he's a gentleman.

204
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,690
He'd never fool around
with another man's wife.

205
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,889
I, on the other hand, might.

206
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,499
<i>Where is she now?</i>

207
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,661
<i>She's still in Manila.</i>

208
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,968
Who do you think smuggles
all the medicine into the camp?

209
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:07,748
<i>In 1941. Manila was considered
the pearl of the Orient.</i>

210
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,814
<i>An international city where people
from all over the world lived and worked.</i>

211
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,327
<i>That all changed
when the Japanese took over.</i>

212
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,727
<i>They believed
that as a conquered people.</i>

213
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,527
<i>The Filipinos should do
as they were told.</i>

214
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,095
<i>Those who disobeyed were jailed.
Tortured or executed.</i>

215
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:31,438
This made the bond between the Filipinos
and the Americans even stronger.

216
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,502
<i>Resistance grew throughout the country.</i>

217
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,018
<i>By 1945. hundreds of ordinary people
had joined the underground.</i>

218
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:44,283
It's like they have been
watching me for weeks.

219
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,749
The Japanese
have questioned our people before.

220
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,454
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

221
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,760
They know
that the Americans are closing in,

222
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,928
and they know that we have evidence
of their war crimes.

223
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,302
Don Antonio is right. This...

224
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,933
This wasn't like before, Margaret.

225
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,570
Now they know of things
only an informer could have told them.

226
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,740
Then why'd they let you go?

227
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:16,254
I'm sorry, Carlos,
but if you're worried, you're free to go.

228
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,812
I won't hold it against you.

229
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,587
I won't hold it against any of you.

230
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:27,589
I wouldn't leave unless we all go.

231
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,224
You know that.

232
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:35,331
I can't leave, not as long as there is
a single prisoner left in Cabanatuan.

233
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,067
<i>...Margaret.</i>

234
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,045
I saw Daniel.

235
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,275
How is he?

236
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,817
He did not look well.

237
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,251
I think he has malaria again.

238
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:54,588
I know my father said to wait, but if we
do that, it may be too late for Daniel.

239
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,962
No, your father's right.
It's too dangerous. Don't listen to me.

240
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:05,698
No. I will meet you outside the hospital
in the usual place, OK?

241
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,932
I should go.

242
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,075
Company... atten-hut!

243
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,177
At ease.

244
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:25,879
I'm here to tell you men
the latrine rumors are true.

245
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,722
We've finally got a mission
worthy of Rangers.

246
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,188
We're going to push right through
our front lines into the Japs' backyard

247
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:38,396
and rescue 500 American prisoners of war.

248
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,166
It's going to be a rough son of a bitch.

249
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,141
A textbook-style raid
that can only succeed

250
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:48,612
through speed, surprise
and overwhelming firepower.

251
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,148
That's why you've been chosen.

252
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,684
Before you start congratulating yourselves,

253
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,313
remember that you haven't achieved
a damn thing yet.

254
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,723
You're the best-trained,
least-proven battalion in this whole army.

255
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,524
This is your one chance
to do something about it.

256
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,895
And I mean one chance.

257
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,163
How you acquit yourselves
over the next 48 hours

258
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,070
will determine how you are judged
for the rest of your lives.

259
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,808
Men worthy of serving in this army,

260
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:25,339
or an embarrassment that history and time
will eventually forget.

261
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,747
It's up to you.

262
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,311
Now, I happen to think it's the former.

263
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,882
That's why I'm accompanying you
on this raid.

264
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,195
There's not another
group of men in this

265
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,920
or any other army I'd
sooner trust my life with.

266
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:44,435
You're the finest, best-prepared soldiers
this country's ever sent to war,

267
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,494
and I expect you to prove it.

268
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,966
One final thing:

269
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:54,479
I wanna see every last one of you
in the chapel after this formation's over.

270
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:58,778
I do not want any damned atheists
on this raid.

271
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,477
And no fakers either.

272
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:05,455
I want you to get down on your knees
and swear before Almighty God

273
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,620
that you'll give your lives
before you let any of those prisoners die.

274
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,455
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

275
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,363
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir!

276
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,695
Carry on.

277
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,102
Company... atten-hut!

278
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,376
The general liked your plan.

279
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:32,313
<i>... and build an enduring peace
founded upon thy holy laws,</i>

280
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:36,150
and upon that unselfish goodwill
to all those who love justice and peace

281
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:40,385
which thou hast given unto us through
Jesus Christ, thine only son, our Lord.

282
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,985
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

283
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,557
Take charge of your platoon!

284
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,728
Can't believe the colonel said
don't wear no insignia.

285
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,467
He's got that pencil mustache. Even
the Nips are gonna know he's an officer.

286
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,406
- Shut up.
- I mean, I can wear my helmet.

287
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,911
Come on. I use it to cook,
to clean, to wash.

288
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,504
Yeah, the helmets,
they make too much noise,

289
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,550
out in the field.

290
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,848
- Sorry, I didn't hear that, Aldrige. You?
- I heard him.

291
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:16,084
Aldrige, you're the best shot
in the company. Ever fire one of these?

292
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:17,651
No.

293
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,893
- No, sir. I like my M-1.
- Choose yourself a loader.

294
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,425
Lucas.

295
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,402
- Sure about that?
- Yeah.

296
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,079
Rookies.

297
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,846
<i>... Japanese planes have struck
at six different points in the Philippines.</i>

298
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,584
<i>Manila is 13 hours ahead
of Eastern Standard Time.</i>

299
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,353
<i>It is reported that Japanese bombs...</i>

300
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,418
First Sergeant.

301
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,759
- So you really are going.
- Someone told me you had the same idea.

302
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,160
Yeah.

303
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,070
Look, Jim,
I'm already taking four of your men.

304
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,132
All fine combat medics, Henry.

305
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,671
But if we get hit hard, you're gonna need
someone who can operate.

306
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,114
I can't miss this, Henry.

307
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,112
It's why I'm here.

308
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:25,391
Besides, sometimes a young field medic
needs his surgeon around.

309
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,491
Just like a young company commander
needs his colonel.

310
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,065
You win.

311
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,173
Captain, you got a minute for me?

312
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:48,242
Sure, Top.

313
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:58,122
I was going over the personnel roster,
and I ain't on it.

314
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,960
Colonel Mucci said he preferred
unmarried men on this trip,

315
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,966
so I had to take you off.

316
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,832
Well, with respect, sir, you're married.

317
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:10,238
And I imagine your wife would miss you
a hell of a lot more than mine'd miss me.

318
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,370
I'm the one planning this raid, Top.
Don't make me go against my instructions.

319
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:18,678
I'm not, sir. I'm asking you
to be a smart company commander.

320
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,920
We got Rangers out there that ain't heard
the first round go downrange in combat yet.

321
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,485
You need me on this mission.

322
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,461
Just think you need something
on that jungle rot.

323
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:37,364
Top, when I was in R.O.T.C., I was four
weeks away from being shipped to Bataan.

324
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:41,132
I was held back
by an impacted wisdom tooth.

325
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,004
Guys I knew ended up in those camps.

326
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,667
I think I can live with defeat.

327
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,476
That may be, but you're gonna find it
a lot harder to live without me.

328
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,389
All right, I'll talk to the colonel.

329
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:02,187
- Anything else, First Sergeant?
- No, sir.

330
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,057
Thank you. Good night, sir.

331
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:15,702
We left 6th Army Headquarters
with very little information.

332
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:20,074
<i>The only advantage we had
was the element of surprise.</i>

333
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:25,139
<i>We faced a two-day walk through
open terrain patrolled by the enemy.</i>

334
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,413
<i>All it would take
is a single Japanese scout to spot us</i>

335
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,613
<i>and our mission would be over.</i>

336
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,089
Let's go! Riley, load 'em up!

337
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,357
Pack 'em up! Let's move!

338
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,863
Move 'em out!

339
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:44,197
<i>We all knew the idealistic notion
of rescuing POWs</i>

340
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,500
<i>far outweighted its strategic value.</i>

341
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,735
<i>We didn't spent much time
thinking about it.</i>

342
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,109
<i>As far as we were concerned.
We were going to rescue them</i>

343
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,842
<i>or die trying.</i>

344
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,250
- They're gonna just leave us, sir?
- I have no idea what they're doing.

345
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:13,788
Get this quinine to the doctors.
You know the drill - worst cases first.

346
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:23,506
They must be retreating.
Even the brass is leaving.

347
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,601
Hey, Major, Mori's leaving too.

348
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:36,785
Looks like you were right.
General MacArthur's got 'em on the run.

349
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,347
They're not on the run. They've got orders
to fight to the last man.

350
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,392
It's a trap.

351
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,895
A goddamn elaborate one.

352
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,566
We walk out those gates, it'll give
'em the perfect excuse to kill us.

353
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,728
Since when did they need an excuse?

354
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,365
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
out of here before they change their minds.

355
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,171
How far do you think you'll get, Captain?

356
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,543
Even if the Japs are retreating,
the jungle's gonna be crawling with 'em.

357
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,139
What's wrong with that?
We're still soldiers, ain't we?

358
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,710
Major's right, Red. Where we gonna go
when most of us can't walk?

359
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,655
I don't recall inviting you, kid.

360
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,954
What happens
to the ones we leave behind?

361
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,086
I never said we'd all make it,
but at least some of us might.

362
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,631
If we sit tight, all of us will make it.

363
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,065
Our troops can't be far now.

364
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,602
Looks like you got yourself
a disciple, Gibby.

365
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,934
It might do you some good
to listen to him.

366
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:35,004
They're out there, Red.
Don't make it any easier for 'em.

367
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,452
Don't worry, I won't escape
without your permission.

368
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,381
Get the padre, Duke.

369
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,321
Poor son of a bitch still believed in God.

370
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,265
Well, if we can't escape,
we might as well eat.

371
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:53,247
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

372
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,864
Where do you think Mori sits?
I'll take a shit on his plate.

373
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,363
- Where'd you learn to do that?
- I wasn't always this sane.

374
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:55,117
- What's the matter?
- These food parcels were meant for us.

375
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,654
The bastards
were starving us deliberately.

376
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,685
Make sure you get some
to the men in the hospital ward.

377
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,169
Easy, Red.
Your stomach ain't used to it.

378
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:18,539
What do I care? Feels like
I'm sucking on Rita Hayworth's tits.

379
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,272
I was thinking more Mae West.

380
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:47,132
- What is it, Top?
- Japs. Only left a few hours ago.

381
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,597
Must have been hiding from our planes.

382
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:55,476
There's no telling where they are now. We
might wanna look around before we go on.

383
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,379
They're retreating, Captain.
That's all we need to know.

384
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,282
- Let's go.
- Move out.

385
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,788
- Platoons, let's go.
- Charlie Two, to the left.

386
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:07,017
Let's go, Charlie One. Follow me.

387
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:40,988
Damn it.

388
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:46,519
They're Kempei Tai.
I think they're heading towards the camp.

389
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,461
The river branches out
about a half mile to the east of us.

390
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,301
It's not marked. There might be a bridge
that can get us around this convoy.

391
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,274
The Japanese will be guarding
a major artery at a chokepoint like that.

392
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,707
I think we ought to check it out.
This traffic isn't getting any thinner.

393
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,412
Go.

394
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:17,118
It was thanks to me
you met Margaret in the first place.

395
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,755
Sure it was.

396
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,631
When I look up at the sky like this,
I could be anywhere in the world.

397
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,228
- Where are you now?
- Halfway across the jungle.

398
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:32,436
I disobeyed your orders, and now
I'm only a few miles from civilization.

399
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,035
Well, have a drink for me
when you get there.

400
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,513
What do you want me
to tell Margaret?

401
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,008
Assuming she's still interested.

402
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:46,113
Well, if she's not, I'll propose
to her myself, and you know what?

403
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,786
I'll make you best man,
'cause I know you won't run off with her.

404
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:56,232
If I had someone like that waiting for me
on the other side of an open gate...

405
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:07,201
<i>- That's not regular army.
- They're Kempei Tai.</i>

406
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,677
Military secret police.

407
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,426
Don't...
give them the satisfaction.

408
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,553
<i>They'll be dead soon.</i>

409
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,378
You fought in Bataan, Major?

410
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:31,147
You commanded a battalion of the 31 st
Infantry in operations near Mamala River?

411
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:37,222
I can give you my name,
rank and serial number.

412
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,829
We found these in your barracks.

413
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,838
I assume they were smuggled in
by the Filipino resistance.

414
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:00,048
They say, "Take hope.

415
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,451
"MacArthur is coming."

416
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,787
We've lived off rumors like that
for three years.

417
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,225
Only this time they are true.

418
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:16,392
Your forces will recapture the Philippines
within a few weeks.

419
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,900
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because it isn't long to wait.

420
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,965
You are the senior officer.

421
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,567
If you help me keep order,

422
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:31,206
I can make the rest
of your time here tolerable.

423
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:38,485
But if any of the prisoners try to escape,
I will kill ten others in his place.

424
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,289
Are you married, Major?

425
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,132
- No.
- You have a reason to survive this war?

426
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,402
I'd like to be here for your surrender.

427
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,572
Then you had better stay in good health.

428
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,446
You look feverish.

429
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,485
Some quinine would help.

430
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,229
Will that be all?

431
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,308
You were delirious.

432
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,510
- Wittinghill thinks it's malignant malaria.
- How long is he giving me?

433
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,644
Three or four days
unless we get you more quinine.

434
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,986
He tried to convince me
to send you to St. Peter's ward.

435
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,457
Oh, you're my next of kin now?

436
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:27,987
Hey, it's no joke. You die on me,
what's to stop me leaving this place?

437
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,997
I told you what Nagai said.

438
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:36,165
- Stay out of trouble. It will soon be over.
- The problem is I don't believe Nagai.

439
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,265
Which part don't you believe?

440
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:41,072
Ten of us getting killed
for every one that escapes?

441
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:45,206
That's the reason I didn't want to make
any friends here - in case I let 'em down.

442
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:49,218
Unfortunately, you
I was stuck with from before.

443
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,282
You gotta pull through this, pal.

444
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,224
Just think of everything
you got to look forward to.

445
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:01,128
Think of Margaret in a see-through
cheongsam walking on your back.

446
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:07,899
- You ever gonna stop?
- No.

447
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,873
Come on, you bastard.
Pull out of it.

448
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,752
20mls of iodine, please.

449
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,659
Thanks.

450
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,490
They murdered Cora.

451
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,966
I'm being followed.

452
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,370
Behind us in the... the brown vest.

453
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,573
- Is it just him?
- I think so.

454
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,948
Mina, I have to get you out of here.

455
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,917
The quinine's in the bag.
Pack your things and leave.

456
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,683
- No, I'm not leaving...
- Mina, leave!

457
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:56,248
Try to get the medicine to Cabanatuan.
If you can't, head for the mountains.

458
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,851
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

459
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:01,159
Go.

460
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,001
What are you doing?

461
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:37,123
<i>- Balincarin?
- Yes, sir.</i>

462
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,701
Let's get some people in there.

463
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,296
Top?

464
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,281
- All clear.
- What is it, Top?

465
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,188
Tanks.

466
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:24,006
You better go get the colonel.

467
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,143
Yeah, Top.

468
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,993
Bob, hang back a little.
Let me walk ahead.

469
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,818
- Captain Juan Pajota.
- Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci,

470
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,484
CO, 6th Ranger battalion.

471
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,791
Sir.

472
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,229
What happened here?

473
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:20,100
The Japanese came into the village
yesterday, with tanks,

474
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,367
to punish these people
for helping my men.

475
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,365
Over a hundred were killed.

476
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:32,313
Captain, I guarantee you,
this will not go unpunished.

477
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,236
Alamo Scouts. Hold your fire.

478
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,435
<i>- Charlie Company CO.
- This way. Follow me.</i>

479
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,672
The camp is divided into quarters.

480
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,342
We only spotted POWs
in the southeast quadrant here.

481
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,545
The Jap guard barracks
are here in this area.

482
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,747
There are sentries
in each guard tower,

483
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,985
two at the gates,
five in the guardhouses.

484
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,519
We couldn't get precise numbers. Could
be anything between 50 and 100 of 'em.

485
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,430
This isn't enough, sir.

486
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,298
- Enough of what?
- There's too many unknowns.

487
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,930
There's a big difference
between 50 and 100 men.

488
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:07,443
It isn't always about the arithmetic.
Some things you gotta take on faith.

489
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,979
We get into firefight
inside that compound,

490
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:15,144
and a lot of those men we're trying
to rescue are liable to get killed.

491
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,013
Lieutenant Able, you've got 12
hours till this raid kicks off.

492
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,218
Can you get in there
and bring back more detailed intel?

493
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:27,127
It's dicey, sir. All that open terrain
in broad daylight.

494
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,893
We need more time.
Give them a chance to work in closer.

495
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,060
No more delays now, goddammit.

496
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,902
Those poor bastards have had three years
of delays. We'll stick to your plan, Bob.

497
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,135
With respect, sir,

498
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,643
you said you chose me
for my flexibility.

499
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:47,309
Under present circumstances, I cannot
guarantee the safety of those prisoners.

500
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,285
Sir, you may be forced to delay.

501
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,813
Why, Captain?

502
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,791
There's a Japanese convoy
traveling north, division strength.

503
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,385
They will pass
directly in front of the camp tonight.

504
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,523
How is it you came by this information,
Captain Pajota?

505
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,692
From our spies in Cabanatuan City.

506
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,328
Are we talking hard facts
or the bamboo telegraph?

507
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:13,172
The bamboo telegraph told me you
and your men are coming here today, sir.

508
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:21,415
Lieutenant Able, get some of our own
people on this. As of now we leave tonight.

509
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,680
Sir.

510
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,781
<i>Captain?</i>

511
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,987
You heard the colonel.
Do what you can.

512
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,324
Yes, sir.

513
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,498
Captain?

514
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:41,435
You have a minute? I wanted
to discuss this plan with you.

515
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,872
My men have been watching
this camp for three years.

516
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,910
We planned to raid it
many times ourselves.

517
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,846
- Why didn't you?
- Most of your POWs can't walk.

518
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,543
They're either sick or crippled.

519
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:58,019
The healthy ones were shipped
to labor camps in Japan.

520
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:01,751
If we rescued them,
how would we care for them?

521
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:06,654
Well, how did you plan
to move them from the camp?

522
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,664
In carabao carts.

523
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,200
You have enough carts
for 500 prisoners?

524
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:14,726
If you give me 24 hours, I will.

525
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:21,237
But... you have to convince your colonel
to move to another village.

526
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:24,178
It isn't safe to bring them here.

527
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,683
What village do you suggest?

528
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,015
Platero.

529
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,287
Sir.

530
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:46,565
Sorry if I was out of line before.

531
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:49,298
- I spoke to Captain Pajota...
- We'll delay 24 hours.

532
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,863
Get a message to General Krueger.

533
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,172
That'll be all.

534
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,075
Yes, sir.

535
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,291
Margaret Utinsky?

536
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,665
Yes.

537
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:22,034
You work at the Manila hospital?

538
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:24,763
Why?

539
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:28,072
I am with the Japanese Military Police.

540
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,946
Please come with me.

541
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,809
Utinsky is a German name?

542
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,351
Lithuanian.

543
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:38,410
- You were born in Lithuania?
- Kovno.

544
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:42,283
You speak good English.

545
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,623
I was raised in Canada.

546
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:48,687
You have a passport
to prove you are Lithuanian?

547
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,063
My papers are back at the apartment.

548
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:54,365
May I have your keys?

549
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,406
- I can go get them for you.
- Your keys.

550
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,486
<i>Why did you stay in Manila
when the war started?</i>

551
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,045
I'm a nurse. I wanted to help people.

552
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:17,389
You think the people of this country
want American help?

553
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,587
I'm Lithuanian, not American.

554
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,824
Your passport is forged.

555
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,499
I've traveled everywhere
on that passport.

556
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:33,374
Do you know a woman
called Mina Corcurea?

557
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,202
No.

558
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,546
This morning,

559
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:45,077
you assaulted a man
who was following her in the street.

560
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:50,286
I was assaulted myself,
if that's what you're talking about.

561
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,897
Mina Corcurea

562
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:58,025
is a member
of the Filipino underground.

563
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,065
She and her father

564
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,937
are responsible for stealing medicine

565
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,944
from wounded Japanese soldiers

566
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,971
and smuggling it
to American prisoners of war.

567
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:23,281
I'm a citizen of a neutral country.

568
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,295
I have no dealings whatsoever
with any underground

569
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,059
or any American prisoners of war.

570
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:41,799
- Is this your Bible?
- I don't know.

571
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,005
Did you take it from my apartment?

572
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,447
You were married to an American officer
before the war?

573
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,849
I've never been married.

574
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,018
Then...

575
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,150
who is this man?

576
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,286
Your husband?

577
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,201
Your lover?

578
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,233
No.

579
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:17,541
But you keep a picture of him
in your Bible.

580
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,261
<i>From Manila, sir.</i>

581
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,736
Would you like to sit, Major?

582
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,065
You know her?

583
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,293
I knew her briefly.

584
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,470
Why?

585
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,302
She claims she knew you well.

586
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:29,676
She claims she stayed behind
in the Philippines to be near you.

587
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,279
I find that hard to believe.

588
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,784
I didn't make much
of an impression on her.

589
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,344
She clearly left an impression on you.

590
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,391
Would you like to see her again?

591
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,952
What's that to you?

592
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,835
We know this woman

593
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:56,633
is the head
of an underground movement in Manila...

594
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:02,875
responsible for smuggling stolen medicine
into this camp.

595
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,777
If you convince her to confess

596
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:08,841
and give us
the names of her accomplices,

597
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,344
I guarantee the two of you

598
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:16,290
will be free to leave
the Philippines together.

599
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,257
And if I don't?

600
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:27,301
You'll be returned
to your hospital ward to die.

601
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:32,667
I assume your colleagues
made her the same offer?

602
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,575
I wouldn't know.

603
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:40,378
She must've turned 'em down.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here now.

604
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:45,377
I'm offering you your future, Major.

605
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,091
My future isn't in your hands.

606
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:26,658
- Aw, honey, you look great.
- So do you.

607
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,924
Pity there ain't
a Cabanatuan beauty contest.

608
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,829
Shucks.

609
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,632
I got you something.

610
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:49,217
- I hoped it would be quinine.
- Gettin' fussy now, huh?

611
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,310
Sure am.

612
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,855
It didn't get through.

613
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:58,587
Your friend Nagai stopped
all work details to Cabanatuan City.

614
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:02,222
He's got us digging
air-raid shelters instead.

615
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,493
They'll find some other way
to smuggle it in.

616
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,230
It'll be too late for you by then, old pal.

617
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,431
You ain't thinking of leaving me.

618
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:15,909
I don't think Nagai's men
want me here.

619
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:19,107
I can think of ten of us that do.

620
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:23,778
Like I said, you're the only one
I give a damn about.

621
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:27,016
You and the kid sometimes.

622
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:30,852
Don't try it, Red.

623
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,227
I'll see you, Gibby.

624
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:56,685
Tell Duke and Pitt
to keep an eye on him.
