1
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,800
Mrs Dee, this is Frank Galvin.

2
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,480
He's a good friend of ours,
and a very fine attorney.

3
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Well, it's just a shame what happened
to your husband, Mrs Dee. He was a...

4
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,400
I knew him vaguely at the Lodge.
He was a wonderful man.

5
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,880
It was a crime what happened to him.
It was just a crime.

6
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,360
If I can help in any way,

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,760
don't hesitate to call.

8
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Well...

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,240
If this can help in any way...

10
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
What is that?

11
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
It's my card.

12
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,960
What the hell is that?

13
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,440
I was a friend of your father's.

14
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
You never knew my father.

15
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,680
Get out of here.

16
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,080
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Excuse me, Mrs Cleary.

17
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,520
Who the hell do you think you are?!

18
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,280
- Hey, you know me.
- I don't want you coming back here ever!

19
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,880
- You understand?
- I was just talking to the guy!

20
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,560
Those are bereaved people in there!

21
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,800
So Pat says... He says ''They got this new bar,

22
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,680
and you go inside, and for half a buck
you get a beer, a free lunch,

23
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,200
they take you in the back room
and get you laid.''

24
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,000
- Another one, Frankie?
- Yeah. Everyone.

25
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,240
Mike says ''Now wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.''

26
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,240
''There's a new bar, and you go inside,
and for half a buck

27
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,760
they give you a beer,
a free lunch and they get you laid?''

28
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,120
Pat says ''That's right.''
''Have you ever been in the bar?''

29
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
He said ''No, but me sister has.''

30
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,920
Hey!

31
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,080
Oh, yeah. Everyone.

32
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,560
Frankie?

33
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,480
Frankie! Frankie, you all right?

34
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,520
Oh, Frankie.

35
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,000
Come on, get up.

36
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,880
Get up, Frank! Oh, Christ.

37
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,560
What the hell's goin' on here?

38
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,480
What have you been doin'?

39
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,520
I got a call from Sally Doneghy.

40
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,320
Who's that?

41
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,800
You're in court in ten days,
and you haven't even met with them yet.

42
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,200
Sally Doneghy? Who is that?

43
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
One lousy letter in 18 months.

44
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,120
I try to throw a case your way, and look at ya.

45
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Frankie,

46
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
I got these people to trust you.

47
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,800
They're gonna be here at noon,
by the way, and look at this shit.

48
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,920
I got this expert doctor to talk to ya.

49
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,960
<i>Remember his name? Dr Gruber?</i>

50
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,760
It's been 18 months, and I've been
doin' all the fuckin' legwork.

51
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,280
You're due in court in less than two weeks,

52
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,280
and I bet you haven't even
looked at the goddamn file.

53
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,040
What are you, my nanny?

54
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,480
Now listen to me, Frankie.

55
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,240
Frankie, listen to me,
cos I'm done fuckin' with ya.

56
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,080
I can't take this any more.

57
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,000
I mean, you're not gonna change.

58
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,840
Look around ya.
I mean, what's gonna change?

59
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,320
You think it's gonna be any different
next week, next month?

60
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,040
It's gonna be the same goddamn thing.

61
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,520
Now I got you a good case.

62
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,080
It's a moneymaker.

63
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,000
You do it right, it'll take care of ya.

64
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,440
But I'm through, you understand?

65
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,960
I mean, I can't take this shit any more.

66
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,120
Life's too fuckin' short, Frankie.

67
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm gettin' too fuckin' old.

68
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Fuck!

69
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Excuse me, sir.

70
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,520
Mrs Doneghy. Hi. Frank Galvin.

71
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
- Why didn't you go in?
- It's locked.

72
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,640
Locked?

73
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I'm sorry.

74
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
God, I hope this didn't put you out.

75
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,400
Let me see here...

76
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:23,080
Come on in. I'd get you a cup of coffee,
but looks as though my girl went out.

77
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,640
<i>It's not a good case, it's a very good case.</i>

78
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,000
A young, healthy woman goes into a hospital
to deliver her third child, and...

79
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,240
Well, it's just beyond comprehension.
She's given the wrong anaesthetic.

80
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,520
- We love her, Kevin and me.
- I'm sure you do.

81
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
But what can we do?
She don't know who's visiting her.

82
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I know. I went.

83
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,440
- You saw her?
- Oh, yes.

84
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,880
My sister? You know how beautiful she was?

85
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,080
Her husband left her, and he took her kids.

86
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,560
They...

87
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,760
they let you die in there.

88
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,720
They don't care. Nobody cares.

89
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,400
The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care
in Arlington? They'd take her in.

90
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,280
Perpetual care.
$50,000 they want in endowment.

91
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,320
50,000?

92
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,520
I don't wanna leave her. Kevin, he...

93
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,120
And Father Laughlin,
he said it was God's will.

94
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Well, I understand.

95
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,840
My doctor told me I gotta move out West.
That's when we filed in court.

96
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,520
- We didn't wanna sue.
- Oh, I understand that too.

97
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,920
But Kevin's looking for two years in Tucson.

98
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,440
They called him up
and they said to come out.

99
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,360
He's a good man.
He's only trying to do what's right.

100
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,720
Come on in.

101
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,200
This is my husband.

102
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,880
Come on in. Sit down.

103
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,640
I told your wife, I'm sorry we have to meet
out here, but I got a case in superior court.

104
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,800
- The place is full of papers.
- That's all right.

105
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,840
- I was also telling her you got a good case.
- He saw her at Northern Care.

106
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,760
I may get some very important
corroborating testimony from a Dr Gruber.

107
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,760
It'll be a problem getting one doctor to testify
that another doctor's negligent, but...

108
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,040
The archdiocese called and said who was
our attorney, cos the case is coming to trial.

109
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,040
Well... I doubt very much
that the case will ever come to trial.

110
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,960
We told them we didn't want it
to come out this way.

111
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,760
I completely understand.

112
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,680
- See, we just...
- We just can't do it any more.

113
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
This is our chance to get away.

114
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,080
I'm gonna see that you get that chance.

115
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,200
How much is this gonna cost?

116
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,800
It's not gonna cost you anything.
It's done on a contingency basis.

117
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,280
Whatever the settlement is, I retain a third.

118
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,880
But that's normal procedure.
You can check around.

119
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,080
OK?

120
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,480
OK.

121
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,520
His name is Frank Galvin. Boston College,
class of '52, was second in his class.

122
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,520
<i>Editor of the Law Review.
Worked with Mickey Morrissey 12 years.</i>

123
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,480
Criminal law and personal injury.
Married Patricia Harrington, 1960.

124
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,680
Joined Stearns, Harrington, Pierce,
1960, as a full partner.

125
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,160
Resigned the firm, 1969,
over the Lillibridge case.

126
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,720
- He was accused ofjury-tampering.
- Accused, not indicted. He resigned the firm.

127
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,280
Divorced, 1970. Galvin worked with Michael
Morrissey until Morrissey retired in '78.

128
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,120
Since then he's been on his own. Four cases
in three years. He's lost them all. He drinks.

129
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,520
Four cases in three years.

130
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,880
The man's an ambulance chaser.

131
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,680
<i>- Tell me about this case.
- This is a nuisance suit.</i>

132
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,520
He's asking for $600,000
and betting we don't want to go to court.

133
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,760
- No, we don't want this case in court.
- Neither does he. That's where he loses.

134
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,280
He's scared to death to go to court.
We only have to call his bluff.

135
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,600
I want to settle and be done with it. I don't
want the archdiocese exposed, Mr Alito.

136
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,000
No. Absolutely.
And we're going to see that it's not.

137
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,360
So, what I want to do is stop it here.

138
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm going to make him an offer myself.
I want it to come from me.

139
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,040
All right. But let's keep the price down.

140
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,880
I called Ed Concannon. He recommends we
continue to respond as if we're going to trial.

141
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,760
If we were to go to trial,
would we win the case?

142
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,280
Well, of course it's always dangerous.

143
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,200
<i>I know that answer. Would we win?</i>

144
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,680
Yes.

145
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,880
Dr Gruber?

146
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,280
Yes. Galvin, right?

147
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,680
Well... well, I sure appreciate
a man as busy as you are...

148
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,160
It's perfectly all right. Look, I'm kinda rushed.
Do you mind if we walk while we talk?

149
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,720
I read the hospital report on your client.

150
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,280
Deborah Ann Kaye? They called. They want
to settle. It's just a matter ofjacking 'em up.

151
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,600
- Who called?
- The archdiocese. They wanna settle.

152
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,880
- And you're gonna do that?
- Yeah.

153
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,440
- You're gonna settle out of court?
- Well, yeah.

154
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Why?

155
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,080
In the interests of her family.
And you, Doctor.

156
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,280
You can never tell what ajury's gonna do.
St Catherine's is a renowned institution.

157
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,240
- Her doctors are...
- Her doctors killed her.

158
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,600
- I'm sorry?
- Her doctors killed her.

159
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,440
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic,
and she drowned in her own vomit.

160
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,520
- The doctors murdered her.
- Do you know who her doctors were?

161
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,960
Yeah, I read the file. Marx and Towler.
I know who they were.

162
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,760
- Two of the most respected...
- I thought you wanted to do something.

163
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,920
I've no interest in the woman's estate.

164
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,440
No offence, we all know
where the money is going.

165
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,760
I have an interest in hospitals. I don't want
those bozos in the same profession as me.

166
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,560
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic, they
killed her and her kid, and you caught 'em.

167
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
You want a cigar?

168
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,960
No, thank you. The hospital's
owned by the archdiocese...

169
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,040
What are they gonna do?
Not invite me to their birthday party?

170
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,720
Look, I'm sorry I'm rushing,
but I have to be in Cambridge.

171
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,400
When can we get together again
and get a deposition?

172
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,000
OK. We'll meet here Tuesday night.

173
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
I gotta go. Are you goin' my way?

174
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
OK. But we're gonna have to
keep you under wraps, you know.

175
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,000
- You can't discuss the case.
- I understand.

176
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,760
You're gonna meet me here on Tuesday.
We'll go over your testimony.

177
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,360
Right. Seven o'clock in the locker rooms.

178
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,480
- I got it.
- Thank you.

179
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,960
<i>- Thank you.
- My pleasure.</i>

180
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,400
Why are you doin' this?

181
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,080
To do the right thing.
Isn't that why you're doing it?

182
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,600
Sorry. Nobody ever stood here since 1952.

183
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,840
Give me a Bushmill. Who are the civilians?

184
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,800
Lousy weather, good for business,
Frankie. There you go.

185
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,960
- Would you like a drink?
- I'd like an apartment.

186
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,080
Would you settle for a drink?

187
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
No. Thank you.

188
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,280
I had a good day today.

189
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,600
Let me at 'em.

190
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,080
Gentlemen...

191
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,760
- To ya.
- To ya. To ya.

192
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,120
I cut myself so badly shaving this morning,
my eyes almost cleared up.

193
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Bad?

194
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm glad you had a good day.

195
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,080
- Good night.
- Thank you.

196
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, well, well, well, well. Hey.

197
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,480
It's a long road that has no turning.

198
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,880
That's for sure, Frankie.

199
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Yeah. I'm going to the archdiocese tomorrow.

200
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,320
At two.

201
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,560
Yes, I know you don't. I know you don't.
You're just following your own life.

202
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,520
You have a life to live too.
You have to go out West.

203
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,400
You're not gonna do yourself good here.

204
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,000
Well...

205
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,920
I'm sure she knows that you care for her.

206
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,080
<i>- Well...
- She's so unprotected.</i>

207
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,160
Finally, we're none of us protected.
I mean, we just... have to go on,

208
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,480
seek help where we can and go on...

209
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,640
<i>She's stuck there.
Maybe she knows when we're there.</i>

210
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,400
<i>- Will she think we've abandoned her?
- Yes, I know that you love her.</i>

211
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,320
I know that you're acting out of love.

212
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,960
As soon as I know.

213
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,360
<i>- My husband sends his respects.
- Well, you give him my respects, too.</i>

214
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,480
<i>- Thank you. Sorry to call so late.
- Not at all. No, not at all.</i>

215
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,480
Well...

216
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,960
Good night.

217
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,800
<i>- God bless you, Mr Galvin.
- Well, bless you, too.</i>

218
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,080
<i>Good night.</i>

219
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,440
''Jimmy'' I said. ''You don't go
in your pocket if there's nothing there.''

220
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,000
And what did he say?

221
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,880
Sir, you're not allowed to be in here.

222
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,760
You can't be in here.

223
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm her attorney.

224
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,760
It's a question of continuing values.

225
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,160
St Catherine's, to do the good
she must do in the community,

226
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,920
must maintain the position
she holds in the community.

227
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,920
So... we have a question of balance.

228
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,280
On the one hand, our hospital,
its reputation, and so its effectiveness,

229
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,920
and that of two of its important doctors.

230
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,640
And on the other hand,
the rights of your client.

231
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,080
A young woman in her prime,
deprived of her life, her sight, her family.

232
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,760
It's tragic. It's a tragic accident.

233
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,840
Nothing, of course,
can begin to make that right.

234
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,640
But we must do what we can.
We must do all that we can.

235
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,280
Yes, we must try to make it right.

236
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,600
It's a generous offer, Mr Galvin.

237
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:18,040
Nothing can begin to make that woman well,
but we could at least try to compensate,

238
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
make a gesture.

239
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,280
How did you settle on the amount?

240
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
We thought it was just.

241
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,040
You thought it was just?

242
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,520
Yes.

243
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Because it struck me...

244
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,640
how neatly three went into
this figure - 210,000.

245
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,640
That means I would keep 70.

246
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,720
That was our insurance company's
recommendation.

247
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,600
Yes, that would be.

248
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,480
Nothing we can do
can make that woman well.

249
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,360
And no one will know the truth.

250
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,680
What is the truth?

251
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,920
That that poor girl put her trust into the...

252
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,800
the hands of two men who took her life.

253
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,080
She's in a coma.

254
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,120
Her life is gone.

255
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,960
She has no home, no family.

256
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,880
She's tied to a machine.

257
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,680
She has no friends.

258
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,600
And the people who should care for her,

259
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,880
her doctors,

260
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,880
and you and me,

261
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,800
have been bought off to look the other way.

262
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,920
We've been paid to look the other way.

263
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,560
I came here to take your money.

264
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,480
I brought snapshots to show you
so I could get your money.

265
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,520
I can't do it. I can't take it.

266
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,920
Because if I take the money, I'm lost.

267
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
I'll just be a...

268
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,320
rich...

269
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,600
ambulance chaser.

270
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,120
I can't do it. I can't take it.

271
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,240
If we may discuss money, Mr Galvin,

272
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,240
how's your law practice?

273
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,240
Not too good.

274
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,640
I only got the one client.

275
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,000
Mick?

276
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
I gotta talk to you.

277
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,360
Mickey, come on. Hey, let's go get a drink.

278
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,160
Hymie, sit in for me, will ya?

279
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,880
- Are you out of your mind?
- I need your help.

280
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,360
<i>You need my help?
You need a goddamn keeper.</i>

281
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,360
Are you telling me
you turned down 210 grand?

282
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,680
What are you, nuts? What are you
gonna do, bring her back to life?

283
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,560
- I'm gonna help her.
- To do what?

284
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,160
To do what, for Christ's sakes?
Help her do what? She's dead!

285
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,120
- They killed her. They're trying to buy it.
- That's the fuckin' point, dummy!

286
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,320
<i>Let them buy it.
No, we let them buy the case.</i>

287
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,480
That's why I took it. Now, look,
you just drop this, you understand?

288
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,520
We'll go up to New Hampshire.

289
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,840
- We'll kill some fuckin' deer.
- Mick. Mick!

290
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,360
You said... No, listen to me!

291
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,400
- You said ''If not now, when?''
- I know what I said. But not now, all right?

292
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,080
I'll tell you something else.
I can win this case.

293
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,880
But you won, Frank. You won!

294
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,360
When they give you the money,
that means you won.

295
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
Now, look, we don't wanna go to court.

296
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,440
Is this getting through to you?

297
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,320
Do you know who the attorney
for the archdiocese is? Ed Concannon.

298
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,800
- He's a good man.
- ''He's a good man''?

299
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,280
He's the prince of fucking darkness!

300
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,200
He'll have people testifying
they saw her water-skiing.

301
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,760
- Frank, don't fuck with this case.
- I gotta stand up for that girl.

302
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,040
Frank, I know you're trying
to wipe out some old business.

303
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,160
I understand that. I do. But not now.

304
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,000
- Call the bishop, will you?
- I'm gonna try this case. Will you help me?

305
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,280
I'm gonna need your help, Mick.
Will you help me?

306
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,200
Anybody ever hear
''For want of a shoe, a horse was lost''?

307
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,880
Who's going on vacation tomorrow?

308
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,440
Friedman? St Barts, is that right?

309
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,720
Yes, sir.

310
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Send Mrs Friedman a dozen roses
tomorrow morning, please, Sal.

311
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,520
No, wait a minute... Send her a sun lamp.

312
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,960
Friedman, I'm sorry, but you'll have to stay.

313
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,320
There'll be no vacations
until this thing is cleared.

314
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,840
You're all acquainted with this case.
It's been on the calendar for 18 months.

315
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,000
Now I think we have a definite court date.

316
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,320
February 19th.

317
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,600
<i>The plaintiff's attorney is Francis P Galvin.
I trust you're all familiar with his record.</i>

318
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,080
We've been expecting him to call us
to negotiate, and as he did not,

319
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,280
five days before
we're supposed to go to court,

320
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,000
we made him a rather generous offer,
which he refused.

321
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,000
Five days before trial.
What does that mean? I want to find out.

322
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,520
Acquaint yourselves again
with the depositions.

323
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,560
Don't rely on the fact that
we did it last year. Do it again.

324
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,920
We shall be reviewing it here.
You do it at home.

325
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,360
You each have a full file, so know the deps.

326
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,360
I want you all to be here when we work
with the defendants. When is that, Billy?

327
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,520
Wednesday evening.

328
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,360
<i>I want an article as soon as possible
in The Globe:</i>

329
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,400
''St Cat's, neighbourhood giant,
serving the community,'' et cetera.

330
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,200
They've got it in the files.

331
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,880
<i>And I want something in the Herald
Monday morning: ''Our gallant doctors.''</i>

332
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
Be inventive.

333
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,600
And television. We've gotta have television.
Friedman, since you're still with us,

334
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,400
why don't you have a word
with your friend at GBH?

335
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,760
Now, to belabour the obvious for a moment,

336
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,640
our clients are the Archdiocese of Boston,
the St Catherine Labouré Hospital,

337
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,800
and Doctors Marx and Towler, two of the
most respected men in their profession.

338
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,120
The thrust of this defence will be to answer,

339
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,840
in the court, the press, and the public mind,

340
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,480
to answer the accusation
of negligence this completely

341
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,120
that not only do we win the case,
but win the case so that it is seen

342
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,000
that this attack on these men and
this institution was a rank obscenity.

343
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,400
OK, let's get the cobwebs off. Billy?

344
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,320
Please turn to your page four.

345
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,280
We're gonna review the depositions of
the nurse anaesthetist, the scrub nurse,

346
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,960
and all those in attendance in the OR
at the time of the operation.

347
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,400
- So, what have we got?
- Well, we've got her sister.

348
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,080
Says Deborah Ann ate a full meal an hour
before she was admitted to the hospital.

349
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,560
<i>And we got the admittance form
says she ate nine hours before.</i>

350
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,280
The sister's testimony's no good.
The jury knows if we win, she gets the cash.

351
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,160
We got my Dr Gruber. He says
she was given the wrong anaesthetic.

352
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,680
And, anyway, she came in
complaining of nausea.

353
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,400
- Well, Gruber's not bad.
- He's Dr Kildare. The jury'll eat him up.

354
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,200
Yeah. But their guy is Towler.

355
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,960
<i>He wrote the book: Methodology
and Practice in Anesthesiology.</i>

356
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,440
Everybody in that operating room signed
a deposition, from the scrub nurse on up:

357
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,200
''All those guys are God.
I saw them walk on water.''

358
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,680
They had an obstetric nurse.
Did we get a deposition from her?

359
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,640
No.

360
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,360
Maureen Rooney, aged 49, lives in Arlington.
Still works at the hospital.

361
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,400
Think you could talk to her,
ask why she ain't speakin' up?

362
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
Yeah.

363
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,320
- OK. Cases.
- All right.

364
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,960
<i>- Smith versus State of Michigan.
- All right.</i>

365
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,680
<i>Brindisi versus Electric Boat.</i>

366
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,560
Hey, you've got a good memory, Frankie.

367
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
I had a good teacher.

368
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,480
<i>- McClean versus Urban Transport.
- Right.</i>

369
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,040
Jimmy. Couple of Bushmills.

370
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,160
Do me a favour. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.

371
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
What are you doing tonight?

372
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,000
I found this new bar, see,
and for half a buck you can...

373
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,480
I'm gonna get laid.

374
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,880
All right. I'll be at the office.

375
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Just don't leave your best work in the sheets.

376
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,680
These are on me, Frankie.

377
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,400
Did you find an apartment?

378
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,800
Still looking.

379
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,880
<i>I changed my life today. What did you do?</i>

380
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Changed my room at the hotel.

381
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,040
Why'd you do that?

382
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,400
TV didn't work.

383
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
What hotel are you staying at?

384
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,760
And what are you? A cop?

385
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,240
No. I'm a lawyer.

386
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,120
- My ex-husband was a lawyer.
- Nice. Wonderful for you.

387
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,160
Yes, it was, actually.

388
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,240
''It was, actually''?
Well, how come you called it off?

389
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,160
Who says I'm the one that called it off?

390
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,880
<i>Well, a brick house says you divorced him.
I'll put you on your honour.</i>

391
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,840
100 bucks against you have dinner
with me tonight. I'll take your word for it.

392
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,600
Come on. Tell me the truth.

393
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,560
You can't lie to me.

394
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,480
What's your name?

395
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,680
Laura.

396
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Mine's Frank.

397
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,480
Furthermore, you came back
to see me tonight.

398
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,440
What if it wasn't you
I came back here to see tonight?

399
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,920
Well, you got lucky.

400
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,160
Have you eaten yet? Come on.

401
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,680
My God, you are some beautiful woman.

402
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,120
The weak.

403
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,920
The weak have gotta have
somebody to fight for 'em.

404
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,680
Ain't that the truth?

405
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,120
- Want another drink?
- Yeah.

406
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,600
- Jimmy!
- Yeah?

407
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,040
That's why the court exists.
The court doesn't exist to give them justice.

408
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,840
The court exists to give them
a chance atjustice.

409
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,160
Are they gonna get it?

410
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,040
They might.

411
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,680
<i>They might.</i>

412
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,080
<i>See, the jury wants to believe.
I mean, the jury wants to believe.</i>

413
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,040
It is something to see.

414
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,320
I gotta go down there tomorrow
and pick out 12 of 'em.

415
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,720
All of 'em, all their lives, think it's a sham,
it's rigged, you can't fight city hall.

416
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,160
But when they step into thatjury box,

417
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,240
I think you just barely see it in their eyes.

418
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,640
''Maybe.''

419
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,000
''Maybe.''

420
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,640
Maybe what?

421
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,200
''Maybe I can do something right.''

422
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,560
And is that what you're going to do?

423
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,320
Is that what you're going to do?

424
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,000
That's what I'm gonna try to do.

425
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,520
- Would you like a drink?
- Yeah.

426
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,320
- Water? Soda?
- No.

427
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,680
That's all right.

428
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Beat you, you...!

429
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,120
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

430
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh, my God.

431
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,640
- I met him at the club the other night.
- Poor guy.

432
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,440
- You're late, Mr Galvin.
- I know. I'm sorry.

433
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,880
- Why is that?
- Well, I just got held up.

434
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,520
- Ed Concannon.
- Oh, hi.

435
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,000
Frank Galvin. We've met before.

436
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,560
Well... here. Let's do some business.

437
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,080
They tell me no bargain ever was
completed other than quickly,

438
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,720
when both parties really care to make a deal.

439
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,360
Have you boys tried to resolve
your difficulties?

440
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,040
Because that certainly would save the
Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.

441
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,920
Well, it's a very complicated case,
Your Honour.

442
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,480
Oh, yeah, I'm sure it is, Frank.
But let me tell you something.

443
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,040
If we find it so complex, how the hell do
you think you'll make ajury understand it?

444
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,400
You see my point?

445
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,040
Now, let's talk a minute.

446
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,680
Frank, what would you and your client
take now, this very minute,

447
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,760
to walk out of here
and let this damn thing drop?

448
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,760
My client can't walk, Your Honour.

449
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,760
I know full well she can't, Frank.

450
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,640
You see the padre on your way out.
He'll punch your ticket. You follow me?

451
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,280
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Your Honour,

452
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,040
Bishop Brophy and the archdiocese
have offered the plaintiff $210,000.

453
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,840
What?!

454
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,920
My doctors didn't want a settlement.
They wanted this cleared up in court.

455
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,400
They want their vindication.
I agree with them.

456
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,800
But for today the offer stands,

457
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,520
before the publicity of a trial begins.

458
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,680
For today only. But when I walk out
that door, the offer is withdrawn.

459
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,040
Just so long as
you understand that, Mr Galvin.

460
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,920
Got to be that way.

461
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,840
We're going to try the case.

462
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,440
That's it?

463
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,280
Oh, come on, guys.

464
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,360
Life is too short.

465
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,640
Now, you tell me if you're playing chicken
or you really mean it.

466
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,400
Frank, I don't think I'm talking out of school,
but I just heard someone offer you 200 grand.

467
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,240
Now that's a lot of money.

468
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,680
And if I may say,
you haven't got the best of records.

469
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,680
Things change.

470
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,720
That's true.

471
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,920
Sometimes they change,
and sometimes they don't.

472
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,440
- I remember when you were disbarred...
- I wasn't. They dropped the charges.

473
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,720
It seems to me, a fella's trying to come back,
he'd take this settlement.

474
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,080
Get a record for himself.

475
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,680
I myself would take it and run like a thief.

476
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,240
I'm sure you would.

477
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,520
Yeah.

478
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,640
Well, we have the date set.

479
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,240
Next Thursday.

480
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,880
Good.

481
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,440
Well... see you boys in court.

482
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,440
All rise.

483
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,040
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

484
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,200
- Mr Abraham?
- Abrams.

485
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,800
- Mr Abrams, how are you?
- I'm fine.

486
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,880
Have you ever been a patient
in St Catherine Labouré Hospital?

487
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,600
Me?! I'm Jewish.

488
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,600
- Have you ever been a patient in a hospital?
- Yes.

489
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,800
Well, how did they treat you?

490
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,280
I don't know what you mean.

491
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,240
Been a long time, huh?

492
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,760
I'll get it back. Don't worry about me.

493
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,080
- Did you get the obstetric nurse?
- Maureen Rooney?

494
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,920
I went over to the hospital.
She didn't wanna talk to me.

495
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,440
When I get home tonight, I'll go back.
Here. Read this.

496
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,320
- So what?
- ''So what''? The best is yet to come.

497
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600
Check the TV guide. They got
our Dr Towler on GBH this Friday.

498
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,640
<i>- The Healing Hand. The expert speaks.
- Still gotta take it to ajury.</i>

499
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,720
- All I'm sayin' is, they're getting some help.
- What do you want me to do?

500
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,320
Concannon's gonna try the case his way,
I'm gonna try it my way.

501
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,800
You want me to go ''wee wee wee'' all the way
home just cos of stories in newspapers?

502
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,800
I'm gonna win this case.

503
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,120
John, give me a cigar.

504
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,560
- What day is it?
- Tuesday.

505
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,920
I gotta go and meet Gruber.

506
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
- What's a box of your best cigars?
- Macanudos.

507
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,880
Then I gotta meet somebody at O'Rourke's.
Could you meet her for me? Laura Fischer.

508
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,240
- 33 bucks.
- Put it on the tab.

509
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,840
- The one from the other night?
- Yeah.

510
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,880
See you at the office tomorrow.
We're doin' fine.

511
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,600
Hey, Galvin!

512
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,520
You said that you were gonna call me up.

513
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,800
You didn't call me up.

514
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,480
Well, who do you think you are?

515
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,800
Who do you think you are?

516
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,960
They tell me I can have you disbarred.
Do you know what you did?

517
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,240
- I said, do you know what you did?!
- Take it easy!

518
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,160
It's OK. It's OK.

519
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,280
You ruined my life, mister. Me and my wife.

520
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,520
And now I'm gonna ruin yours.

521
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,440
You don't have to go out there
to see that girl.

522
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,200
We've been going for four years now.

523
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,040
See, four years... my wife
has been crying herself to sleep.

524
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,080
What they did to her sister.

525
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,560
Look, I swear to ya, I wouldn't turn down
the offer if I thought I couldn't win the case.

526
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,120
<i>What do you mean, what you thought?</i>

527
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,080
I am a working man,
trying to get my wife outta town.

528
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,200
Now, we hired you, and I am paying you.

529
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,520
And I gotta find out from the other side
that they offered $200,000?!

530
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm gonna win this.

531
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,080
I'm going to the jury with a solid case,
I got a famous doctor for an expert witness.

532
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,400
You're gonna get, what,
five, six times what you...

533
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,600
You guys...

534
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,680
You guys, you're all the same.

535
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,600
The doctors at the hospital, you,
it's always ''What I'm gonna do for ya.''

536
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,360
And then you screw up and it's,

537
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,960
''We did the best that we could.
I'm dreadfully sorry.''

538
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,760
And people like us live with your mistakes
the rest of our lives.

539
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,200
- They took back the offer.
- They...?

540
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,800
- Dr Gruber.
- Dr Gruber isn't here today, sir.

541
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,160
- No, David Gruber.
- Well, he's not on the chart.

542
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,320
He hasn't been here all day.

543
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,240
- Phone book?
- Yup. Right here.

544
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,640
- What is it?
- Dr Gruber.

545
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,920
Dr Gruber's not in.

546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,760
I had an appointment at his office.

547
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,760
I must have got it wrong.
I mean, we had a meeting.

548
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,080
- He's not in, sir.
- Could you call him?

549
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:14,560
You can't reach him, sir.
He's on some island in the Caribbean.

550
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,040
They don't have a phone.

551
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,040
He'll be back in a week.

552
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,200
If you'd like Dr Halfrin's number,
he's taking his calls.

553
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,240
Thank you for seeing me.

554
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,080
What is it?

555
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,360
I need an extension on my case.

556
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,680
You should have taken their offer.
Especially if you were unprepared.

557
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,560
- I had a witness disappear on me.
- That happens.

558
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,120
I could subpoena him if I had a week.

559
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,080
I don't have a week.

560
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,840
This case should never have come to trial.

561
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,360
But you know better. You're Mr Independent.

562
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,360
You wanna be independent?
Be independent now.

563
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,440
I have no sympathy for you.

564
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,720
Stearns, Harrington.

565
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,240
- You know who they are?
- Should I?

566
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,480
Huge law firm.

567
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,800
OK, they put him in the firm,
he marries the daughter,

568
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,040
buys himself a dog, and everything is rosy.

569
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,440
Then Stearns tries to fix a case.

570
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,320
- Stearns did?
- Yeah, that Frankie was workin' on.

571
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,680
Figured he'd need a little help,
so he bribed ajuror.

572
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,080
When Frankie heard about that,
he came to me in tears.

573
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,280
He figured anyone who knew
what a spinnaker was had to be a saint.

574
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,120
I said ''For Christ's sakes, Frankie, wake up.
These people are sharks.''

575
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,760
''How the hell do you think they wound up
with all that goddamn money? Doing good?''

576
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,680
But he didn't wanna listen to me.

577
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,040
He goes back to the boys
at Stearns and Harrington, and...

578
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,040
he tells them that he's very disappointed.

579
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,720
He's gonna go to the judge and rat them out.

580
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,600
Course, they're way ahead of him.
Before he can get there,

581
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,720
he runs into this federal marshal
and is indicted forjury-tampering.

582
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,480
They throw him in jail,
and he's gonna be disbarred.

583
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,960
His life is over.

584
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,520
<i>- Cape Cod Casualty.
- Mr Alito, please.</i>

585
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,400
<i>- Business hours are over, sir.
- I have to reach him. This is an emergency.</i>

586
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,560
<i>- Please give me his home number.
- Sorry, we're not allowed.</i>

587
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,760
What? Well, could you call him,
yes, and have him call me, then?

588
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,560
<i>- I can't guarantee that he'll call you back.
- Yes. Oh, no, I understand, I understand.</i>

589
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,320
Thank you. Thank you.
The name is Frank Galvin.

590
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,720
<i>- Could you spell that, please?
- Yes. G-a-l-v-i-n.</i>

591
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
And I will be at the following number
in about half an hour.

592
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,000
Jimmy, give me a beer, will ya?

593
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,480
- Want one?
- Yeah.

594
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,880
Two.

595
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,680
OK, so now he's in jail
and he finally gets to see the light.

596
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,560
He calls up Harrington and tells him
that he thinks he made a big mistake.

597
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,680
Like that, I mean, like magic.

598
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,680
All charges are dropped,
and he's released from jail.

599
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,360
But he's fired from the firm,

600
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,160
his wife divorces him,

601
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,880
he starts hittin' the booze,

602
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,760
and he mopes around
for about three and a half years.

603
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,040
You like that story, Laura?

604
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,320
What else do you wanna know
about Frankie?

605
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,600
Hello?

606
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,320
Oh, yeah. Thanks for calling.

607
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Frank Galvin.
I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye.

608
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,040
Well, I'd like to discuss
your firm's offer of that 210...

609
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,600
Well, in the sense that,

610
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,200
we'd like to accept it.

611
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,640
Yeah, well, it came as something of a shock
to me too, but it is my client's wishes and...

612
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,240
She changed her mind as of tonight
and, of course, I tried to dissuade her.

613
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,880
On the eve of the trial... Well, you understand.

614
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,960
I think she just came down
with a terrible case of the jitters.

615
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,720
When was that arrived at?

616
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,000
Well, I know what Concannon said, but
I think you guys are making a big mistake.

617
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,960
I think you oughta reconsider, I think you
oughta get the principals back together.

618
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,080
OK.

619
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,760
No, no. I understand.

620
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,640
No, that's fine. I'm really sorry
to bother you at home.

621
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,480
What happened? You didn't talk to Gruber?

622
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,720
Concannon got to him.

623
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,920
I can't even breathe in here.

624
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,240
We're outta time. See if there's
somebody on this list to replace Gruber.

625
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,080
Well, there's Dr Thompson. He's the nearest.

626
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,280
Dr Thompson.

627
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,200
Yeah, Frank Galvin, representing Deborah
Ann Kaye. We had some correspondence.

628
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:39,960
Well, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you,
but the case got postponed.

629
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,960
I had to reorganise my staff.
I'm sorry to call you so late.

630
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,560
Well, we've had a change of strategy.

631
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,400
I was just wondering if you could...

632
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,360
Well, it is kinda short notice, at any rate...

633
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,960
Would you like me to go?

634
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,360
No, I...

635
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,040
I just...

636
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,320
- Why don't you try and get some rest?
- I have work to do.

637
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,800
You can't work if you can't think.

638
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,360
Try and sleep.

639
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,120
I'll stay here with you.

640
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,240
Stay here?

641
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,320
Yeah.

642
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,040
I'll just see if I can get a little sleep.

643
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,520
- What is your name, please?
- Dr Robert Towler.

644
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:49,320
- You were Deborah Ann Kaye's doctor?
- No, actually, she was referred to me.

645
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,040
- She was Dr Hagman's...
- Don't equivocate. Be positive. Tell the truth.

646
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,040
Whatever the truth is, just tell that.
You were her doctor.

647
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,760
- Yes.
- Say it.

648
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,400
I was her doctor.

649
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,640
You were her anaesthesiologist
at the delivery on May 12th, 1976?

650
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:12,920
- Well, I was one of a group of medical...
- No, answer affirmatively, simply, please.

651
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,520
And keep your answers down to
three words. You were not part of a group.

652
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,880
You were her anaesthesiologist. Isn't that so?

653
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:20,720
Yes.

654
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,560
You were there to help Dr Marx
deliver the child.

655
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,480
Yes.

656
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,160
Anything special about the case?

657
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,600
Well, when she had been...

658
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,160
- ''When Debby...'' Thank you.
- Thank you.

659
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,040
- When Debby had been...
- Remember that, Dr Towler.

660
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,040
Who else was with you
in the operating room?

661
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,440
Miss Nevins, nurse anaesthetist. Dr Marx, of
course. Maureen Rooney, obstetric nurse...

662
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,760
And what did these people do
when her heart stopped?

663
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,000
- We went to Code Blue.
- Code Blue?

664
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,520
Do you mind explaining to the jury
what that means?

665
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,400
It's a common medical expression. It's
a crash programme to restore the heartbeat.

666
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,280
Dr Marx cut an airway in her trachea so
she could get oxygen - she and the baby.

667
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,720
- Miss Nevins...
- Why wasn't she getting oxygen?

668
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,480
- Many reasons, really.
- Tell me one.

669
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,920
- She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask.
- She threw up in her mask.

670
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,480
Cut the bullshit, please. Just say it.
''She threw up in her mask.''

671
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,240
She threw up in her mask.

672
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,960
Therefore she wasn't getting oxygen
and her heart stopped?

673
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,800
- That's right.
- And what did your team do then?

674
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,600
You brought 30 years of medical experience
to bear. Isn't that what you did?

675
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,400
A patient riddled with complications, with
questionable information on her charts.

676
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,560
- We did everything we could.
- To save her, to save the child.

677
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:46,640
- You reached down into death.
- We tried to save her. You can't know.

678
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,240
You can't know!

679
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,480
Good. Good!

680
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,000
Now tell us.

681
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,160
Well... this patient...

682
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,600
Mr Galvin?

683
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,480
Dr Thompson.

684
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,560
Good of you to meet me.

685
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,280
- Well, I'm glad you could come.
- My pleasure.

686
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:33,000
Well... I have some errands to run,
and then I thought we'd spend the evening...

687
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,440
- That's what I planned on doing.
- And then I want you to...

688
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,640
to go out to the home and see the girl.

689
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,160
From what I've read, Mr Galvin,
you have a very good case.

690
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,920
Yes, I think so. I think so.

691
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,240
Well...

692
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,800
You will be very comfortable.

693
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,920
- I've put you up at my apartment.
- I made a reservation.

694
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,040
You don't know who you're dealing with.
They'll bring a lot of pressure to bear.

695
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,960
- There's nothing they can do to me.
- Please! Please, sir.

696
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,240
Humour me.

697
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,360
Here is the address. The key is right inside.

698
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,320
341 Worth, please.

699
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,280
Treat the place as your very own and...

700
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,440
But please, please, don't call anybody.

701
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,920
And thank you...
thank you very much for coming.

702
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,640
<i>- How's our new witness?
- Did you find the obstetric nurse?</i>

703
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,040
<i>She's working the night shift at the hospital.
She's home now. I'll take a run over there.</i>

704
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,600
Give me the address. I'm goin'.
We're gonna need her.

705
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,000
Hi. Frank Galvin.

706
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:30,960
I represent Deborah Ann Kaye
in the case against St Catherine Labouré.

707
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:35,320
- I told the guy I didn't wanna talk to anybody.
- It'll just take a second.

708
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,120
Deborah Ann Kaye.
You know what I'm talkin' about.

709
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,400
- Do you know who our chief witness is?
- No.

710
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,720
David Gruber. He's the assistant chief
anaesthesiologist at Mass Commonwealth.

711
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:54,600
He says that your doctors, Towler and Marx,
put my client in a hospital for life.

712
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,560
We can prove that.
See, what we don't know is why.

713
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,880
What went on in there,
in the operating room?

714
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,480
I mean, something happened.
You know what it was.

715
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,000
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic.
Now, something happened!

716
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,480
There was a distraction.
What? The telephone? What?

717
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,720
You have your doctor.
What do you need me for?

718
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,480
We need someone
who was in the operating room.

719
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,840
We're gonna win the case.

720
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,400
There's no question of that.
It's simply a matter of how big.

721
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,920
- Well, I don't have anything to say to you.
- You know what happened.

722
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,840
- Nothing happened.
- Then why don't you testify for their side?

723
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,400
I can subpoena you, you know.
I can put you up there on the stand.

724
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,600
And ask me what?

725
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:42,080
Who turned my client
into a goddamn vegetable?

726
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,440
- I didn't do it.
- Who are you protecting?

727
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,760
- Who says I'm protecting anyone?
- Doctors? What do you owe them?

728
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,840
- I don't owe them a goddamn thing!
- Then why don't you testify for them?

729
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,600
- You're very pushy, fella.
- You think I'm pushy now.

730
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:59,320
- Wait till I get you up there on the stand!
- Well, maybe you just better do that, then!

731
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,680
You know, you guys are all the same.

732
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,520
You don't care who you hurt.

733
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,360
All you care about is a dollar.
You're a bunch of whores!

734
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,760
You've got no loyalty... no nothing.
You're a bunch of whores!

735
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,840
Thank you.

736
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,160
His name is Dr Lionel Thompson.

737
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,520
City College of New York,
class of '28. Bachelor of Science.

738
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,600
New York College of Medicine,
16th in a class of 22.

739
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,720
1976, got a courtesy appointment,
staff of anaesthesiology,

740
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,240
Easthampton Hospital for Women.

741
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,040
Never married. Has no honours
or degrees of any weight.

742
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:47,440
Since 1975 he's testified in 28 court cases.

743
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,440
12 malpractice.

744
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,560
And he's black.

745
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,960
I'll tell you how you handle the fact
that he's black. Don't touch it.

746
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:05,040
Don't mention it. Treat him just like
anybody else, neither better nor worse.

747
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,880
And let's have a black lawyer sit at our table.

748
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,480
- OK?
- Yes, sir.

749
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,160
And what else do you do?

750
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:19,120
Get the record of his testimony
in the 12 malpractice cases.

751
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,920
Do that. We'll be at Locke-Ober's.

752
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,320
They gave her the wrong anaesthetic -
under the circumstances.

753
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,160
Why is that?

754
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,560
Her sister said she ate
one hour prior to admittance.

755
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:39,360
That's what her sister says. The admittance
form says she ate nine hours prior.

756
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,920
She went in complaining of nausea.

757
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,480
A good doctor would have doubted
the information on the chart.

758
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,800
Is that what a good doctor would do?

759
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,560
- How old are you, Doctor?
- I'm 74 years old.

760
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,440
And what makes you
an expert in anaesthesiology?

761
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,560
I'm on the staff of anaesthesiology,
Easthampton Hospital for Women.

762
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,720
The Easthampton Hospital for Women?

763
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,680
What is that, ajoke?
Let me tell you something, Doctor.

764
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,640
Those men at Catherine Labouré, known
not only in this city but in the world,

765
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,960
were trying to save a woman's life.

766
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,880
They were there.
And here you are, four years later...

767
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,640
I made a detailed physical examination
of the patient, sir.

768
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,080
Is she getting good treatment over there?

769
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,320
Well, actually, it's...
Yes. Well, it's by no means bad, but...

770
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,280
What's the point of ruining
the reputation of two men

771
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:38,480
to try to help a girl whose life's
not gonna be changed in the least?

772
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,720
You know what Code Blue is?

773
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,480
Code Blue...

774
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,040
It's a common medical term.

775
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,120
We're gonna lose.

776
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,080
You think it's my fault?

777
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,920
Well, there must be something you can do.

778
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,400
That's not the point.

779
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,960
It's over.

780
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,480
<i>Do you think it's my fault?</i>

781
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,240
That I could have...

782
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,600
No. But...

783
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,600
Oh, God. I never should have taken it.
There was no way I could win.

784
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,160
And it's over?

785
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,280
Yeah, it's over.

786
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,880
But I thought it wasn't over
until the jury comes in.

787
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,280
- Who'd you hear that from?
- From you.

788
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,840
<i>You want me to tell you it's your fault.</i>

789
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,440
OK, it probably is.
But what are you gonna do about it?

790
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,840
- I wanted to talk to you. I thought maybe...
- You maybe could get some sympathy?

791
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,320
You came to the wrong place.

792
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,520
What makes you so tough?

793
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,440
- Maybe I'll tell you later.
- Is there gonna be a later?

794
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,560
Not if you don't grow up. You're like a kid,
coming in here like it's Sunday night.

795
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,800
You want me to say you have a fever
so you don't have to go back to school.

796
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:39,120
- Why won't you understand?
- I do understand, Frank. Believe me, I do!

797
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,720
You say you're gonna lose, ''Is it my fault?''

798
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,920
The damn case starts tomorrow,
and already it's over for you.

799
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,400
<i>- It is over.
- You wanna be a failure?</i>

800
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,480
Then do it someplace else! I can't
invest in failure, Frank, any more.

801
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,280
I can't.

802
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,040
Excuse me.

803
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,560
Frank?

804
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,520
Frank.

805
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,000
Please don't... please...

806
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,920
please...

807
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,240
please don't pressure me.

808
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,520
Please don't.

809
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,560
I'm gonna do the best
that I can for you and your sister.

810
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:22,840
I know how much it means to you,
and it means that much to me, too.

811
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,080
- How ya holding up?
- Good.

812
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,840
All we have is the witch doctor.

813
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,880
- Yeah.
- Well, look at it this way, Frankie.

814
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:05,480
It's refreshing every time a doctor
takes the stand he's not a Jew.

815
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,240
All rise!

816
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,880
Hear ye, hear ye. All persons having
anything to do before the Superior Court

817
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:34,840
now sitting at Boston, draw near,
give your attendance and you shall be heard.

818
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,720
God save the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. Be seated.

819
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,080
<i>Deborah Ann Kaye versus
St Catherine Labouré Hospital</i>

820
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,680
<i>and Robert S Towler MD
and Sheldon F Marx MD.</i>

821
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,080
Is the plaintiff ready?

822
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,360
- We are, Your Honour.
- Defence?

823
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,360
- Ready for the defence, Your Honour.
- Let's begin.

824
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,920
Your Honour,

825
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,520
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

826
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,640
it's a terrible thing to sit in judgment.

827
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,600
So much rides on it.

828
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,640
I know that you have thought
''How can I be pure?''

829
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,400
''How can...

830
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,400
how can I be impartial without being cold?''

831
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:33,680
''How can I be...

832
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,600
merciful, and still be just?''

833
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,960
I know that some of you
have said prayers today

834
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,040
to be helped to judge correctly.

835
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,480
We have the reputation of two men,

836
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,040
two well-respected doctors before us,

837
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,240
and a renowned hospital.

838
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:06,720
And with them we have
my client, Deborah Ann Kaye,

839
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,080
who was deprived of sight,

840
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,920
of speech, of hearing,

841
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,080
of locomotion, of...

842
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,160
Well, in short, everything
that constitutes her life.

843
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:26,840
We will prove that she was deprived
through negligence,

844
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,640
through the negligence
of these respected men.

845
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,800
We will show, one...

846
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,840
Why did he go to see Maureen Rooney?

847
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,440
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying.

848
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,920
- And what did he find?
- Nothing.

849
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,080
How good's your intelligence?

850
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,360
Very good.

851
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:56,000
So what is the rest of his case,
aside from this Dr Thompson?

852
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,680
As far as we know, nothing.

853
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,360
Thank Mr Concannon for me.
Please tell him I'll see him in his office.

854
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,240
Good morning, Doctor. Dr Thompson,

855
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,960
just so the jury knows,
you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.

856
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:15,240
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

857
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,000
I was engaged to render an opinion.

858
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,600
''Engaged to render an opinion''
for a price. That is correct?

859
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,040
- You are being paid to be here?
- Just as you are, sir.

860
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,480
Are you board-certified
in anaesthesiology?

861
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,760
No, I'm not. It's quite common
in New York State to practise...

862
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,080
Yes, I'm quite sure it is,
but this is Massachusetts.

863
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,000
Are you board-certified in internal medicine?

864
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:41,840
No.

865
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,760
- Neurology?
- No.

866
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,600
Orthopaedics?

867
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,360
I'm just an MD.

868
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,480
Do you know Dr Robert Towler?

869
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:54,680
- I know of him.
- And how is that?

870
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,160
- Through his book.
- What book is that?

871
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,760
<i>Methodology and Practice...</i>

872
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:07,240
<i>..in Anesthesiology.</i>

873
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,880
<i>Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.</i>

874
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,200
Yes.

875
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,920
- How old are you, Doctor?
- I'm 74 years old.

876
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:21,800
Do you still practise quite a lot of medicine?

877
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,560
I'm on the staff of anaesthesiology...

878
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,640
Yes. Yes, I've heard that.

879
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:32,120
But you do testify quite a bit
against other physicians.

880
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:37,640
Isn't that correct? You are available for that,
so long as you're paid to be there.

881
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,560
Sir, yes.

882
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,520
When a thing is wrong,
as in this case, I am available.

883
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,040
I'm 74 years old.

884
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,400
I'm not board-certified.

885
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:58,560
I've been practising medicine for 46 years,
and I know when an injustice has been done.

886
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,160
Do you, indeed?

887
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,920
I bet you do. That's fine.

888
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,360
Fine.

889
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,560
Let's save the court time.

890
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,880
We'll admit Dr Thompson
as an ''expert witness''.

891
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,480
Mr Galvin, do you want to continue now?
Or we could resume this afternoon.

892
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,880
I'll continue, Your Honour.

893
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,160
Dr Thompson,

894
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,320
did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye at the
Northern Chronic Care Facility last night?

895
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:31,520
- I did.
- Objection.

896
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:36,920
Sustained. The witness will confine his
testimony to review of the hospital records.

897
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:43,440
Dr Thompson, in your review of
the hospital records of May 12th 1976,

898
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,720
in your opinion,
what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?

899
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,480
Cardiac arrest.

900
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,960
During delivery her heart stopped.

901
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,760
When the heart stops,
the brain is deprived of oxygen.

902
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,000
You get brain damage.

903
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,840
That's why she's in the state she's in today.

904
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,200
Dr Towler has testified that he restored
the heartbeat in three to four minutes.

905
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,400
In your opinion, is that an accurate estimate?

906
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:15,320
In my opinion, it took much longer - nine,
ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.

907
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,880
Are you saying failure to restore
heartbeat within nine minutes

908
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,640
in itself constitutes bad medical practice?

909
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,200
- Your Honour!
- Yes, Mr Galvin?

910
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,600
If I may be permitted to question
my own witness in my own way...

911
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,160
- I'd like to get to the point.
- I am getting to...

912
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,760
I believe I have the right
to ask the witness a direct question!

913
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,200
Now let's not waste these people's time.

914
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,360
Answer the question, Mr Witness, please.

915
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:46,920
Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring
the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?

916
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,120
In that small context, I would have to say no.

917
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,840
Then you're saying there's no negligence,
based on my question?

918
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,520
- Given the limits of your question, yes.
- The doctors were not negligent.

919
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,840
Thank you.

920
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,640
I'm not through questioning...

921
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,400
Your Honour, with all due respect,

922
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,440
if you're gonna try my case for me,
I wish you wouldn't lose it.

923
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,680
Thank you. I think
that's enough for this morning.

924
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,960
I'll see counsel in my chambers.

925
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,360
- Now, please!
- All rise.

926
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,960
Court is adjourned until one o'clock.

927
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:37,200
I'm gonna write to the Board
of Bar Overseers about you today, fella.

928
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,760
You're on your way out. They should have
kicked you out in that Lillibridge case.

929
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,200
Now, this is it, today.

930
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,720
I'm an attorney,

931
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,280
on trial before the Bar,
representing my client.

932
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,720
<i>My client. When you open your mouth,
you're losin' my case for me.</i>

933
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,160
- Listen to me, fella...
- No, you listen to me!

934
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,920
All I wanted out of this trial was a fair shake.

935
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,320
You push me into court five days early,
I lose my star witness,

936
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,080
and I can't get a continuance.
And I don't care.

937
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,480
I'm goin' up there, I'm gonna try it, and
let the jury decide. They told me about you.

938
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,440
Said you're a hard-ass,
you're a defendant's judge.

939
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,720
Well, I don't care.
I said to hell with it. To hell with it!

940
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,720
Look, Galvin, many years ago I...

941
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,920
Come on! Don't give me that shit
about you bein' a lawyer too.

942
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,680
I know about you.
You couldn't hack it as a lawyer.

943
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,000
You were a bagman for the boys downtown,
and you still are.

944
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:31,920
- Are you done?
- You're damn right I'm done.

945
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:36,640
I'm gonna ask for a mistrial. I'll request
that you disqualify yourself from this case.

946
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:40,200
I'll take a transcript of the trial
to the Judicial Conduct Board

947
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,000
- and ask them to impeach your ass!
- You aren't gonna get a mistrial, boy.

948
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,520
We're going back,
and we're gonna try this case to the end!

949
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,320
Get out of here before I call the bailiff
and have you thrown in jail!

950
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,600
What does it mean?

951
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,600
I mean, you have other tactics?

952
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:17,600
Oh, yeah. They present their case, then
I get a chance, and we just cross-examine.

953
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:22,240
Are we gonna win? I mean,
you have other tactics, though?

954
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,760
Yeah.

955
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,760
Thank you, Dr Towler.

956
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,200
No further questions, Your Honour.

957
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,000
- Dr Towler?
- Yes.

958
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,360
- Let's work backwards.
- Yes.

959
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,960
You have a record of what happened
in the operating room.

960
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,560
You made notations every 30 seconds
of the procedures.

961
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:51,680
These notations stop four and a half minutes
after Deborah Ann Kaye's heart stopped.

962
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:56,800
Four and a half minutes after her heart
stopped. They resumed three minutes later.

963
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:01,880
We had more on our minds than taking notes.
We were trying to restore her heartbeat.

964
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,880
- What happened in those three minutes?
- We were trying...

965
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,240
- What happened?
- Objection, Your Honour.

966
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,240
Why did it take so long
to restore her heartbeat?

967
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,000
Almost nine minutes to restore her heartbeat,

968
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,160
which caused massive
irreversible brain damage.

969
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,840
You're not allowing the witness to answer.

970
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,040
Thank you, Your Honour.
I would like to answer.

971
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,560
Brain damage could have...

972
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,480
It didn't necessarily take
nine or eight minutes.

973
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,880
It could have been caused in two.

974
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,280
Wait a minute.

975
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,720
You're saying that her brain damage
could have been caused

976
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,240
by being deprived of oxygen
for two minutes?

977
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,480
Yes.

978
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,000
Why is that?

979
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:51,640
It's right there on her medical chart.

980
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,880
She was anaemic. Less blood, less oxygen.

981
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,240
The brain was getting less oxygen anyway.

982
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,880
I didn't do too well for you.

983
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,000
You did fine.

984
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,520
No, I'm afraid that's not true.

985
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,760
Will you want me to stay on till Monday?

986
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,680
No, thank you. You can go on home.

987
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:32,160
You know, Mr Galvin,
sometimes people can surprise you.

988
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,840
Sometimes they have
a great capacity to hear the truth.

989
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,040
Yeah. Yes.

990
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:47,520
- Sure you don't want me to stay on?
- No. Thank you.

991
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,920
You can go on home.

992
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,800
I'll see you back at the office.

993
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,720
- What happened?
- It's bad.

994
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,640
What are you going to do now?

995
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,520
I don't have a goddamn idea.

996
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,240
- What do you do if you don't have a witness?
- You use their witness.

997
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,080
- That's right.
- Well, I think we've tried that, Francis.

998
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,080
The case is over.

999
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,880
You know, you broke the first rule
I taught you in law school:

1000
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,200
You never ask a question
unless you have the answer to it.

1001
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,080
Even your own expert witness
said there was no negligence.

1002
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,760
It's over, period.

1003
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:00,560
- There'll be other cases.
- There are no other cases. This is the case.

1004
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,640
<i>There are no other cases. This is the case.</i>

1005
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,480
There are no other cases. This is the case.

1006
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,640
<i>No other cases, this is the case.</i>

1007
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,000
I know how you feel.

1008
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,960
You don't believe me, but I do know.

1009
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,680
I'm gonna tell you something
that I learned when I was your age.

1010
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:36,040
I had prepared a case, and old man White
said to me ''How did you do?''

1011
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,560
And I said ''I did my best.''

1012
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,920
And he said

1013
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:48,240
''You're not paid to do your best.
You're paid to win.''

1014
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:52,040
And that's what pays for this office,

1015
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:57,480
pays for the pro bono work
that we do for the poor,

1016
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:05,080
pays for the type of law
that you want to practise.

1017
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,680
It pays for my whiskey.

1018
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,080
It pays for your clothes.

1019
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,320
It pays for the leisure we have to sit back

1020
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,440
and discuss philosophy,
as we're doing tonight.

1021
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,920
We're paid to win the case.

1022
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,560
You've finished your marriage. You wanted
to come back and practise the law.

1023
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,680
You wanted to come back to the world.

1024
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,760
Welcome back.

1025
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,800
Why isn't Maureen Rooney testifying?

1026
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,200
Hey! You with me? You awake?

1027
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,040
- Yeah, I'm awake.
- She's protecting somebody.

1028
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,520
Who is she protecting?

1029
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,880
Doctors?

1030
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,480
If she's protecting the doctors,
she'd be on the witness stand.

1031
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,960
Read me what she said.

1032
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:31,760
''You guys are a bunch of whores.
Loyalty. Don't care who you hurt.''

1033
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:34,360
- ''You guys got no loyalty.''
- One of the nurses?

1034
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,840
Who? Everybody who was in
the operating room is testifying.

1035
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,920
<i>All right. Who wasn't in the operating room?</i>

1036
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,520
The admitting nurse?

1037
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,400
- What does she do?
- She took down the history.

1038
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,120
And she signed it here. ''KC.'' Kaitlin Costello.

1039
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,960
- The history?
- Yeah.

1040
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,440
''How old are you?
How many children do you have?''

1041
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:27,240
''How old are you? How many children
do you have? When did you last eat?''

1042
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,080
Oh, Miss Rooney.

1043
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:26,760
I understand what you're doing,
and I just wanted you to know that it's OK.

1044
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,200
- What are you talking about?
- Well, about Kaitlin Costello.

1045
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,960
I mean, I don't blame you for shielding her.

1046
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:36,800
- I spoke to her today.
- What are you talking about?

1047
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,600
- I talked to her this morning, and...
- I know. She told me.

1048
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,920
- She told you?!
- I just saw her.

1049
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,600
In New York? You saw Kat in New York?

1050
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,560
Or is she in town? Is she in town?

1051
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,480
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1052
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,840
All right. Thank you.

1053
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,120
Don't we have anything
from the New York Nurse Association?

1054
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,880
- That broad has disappeared.
- From the hospital?

1055
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,880
Well, there's no records since she quit in '76.

1056
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,800
She quit two weeks after the incident.

1057
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,720
- Thank you.
- I have to talk to you.

1058
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,920
I can't talk now.

1059
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,920
Call the AMA. Tell 'em you're Dr Somebody
and you need to find a nurse,

1060
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,920
get some forms, somebody's dying.

1061
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:23,040
Mrs Costello? I'm sorry to bother you this
late, but this is Mr Goldberg in Accounting.

1062
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:25,960
We have some money here for you.

1063
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,040
Is this the Mrs Costello, the registered nurse?

1064
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,640
I see. Well, I'm sorry.
Our records must be mixed up.

1065
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,920
Are you related to Kaitlin Costello?

1066
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:41,480
- You aren't. All right, thank you.
- This is Dr Dorchester in Boston.

1067
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,240
Listen, a nurse left my employment
about four years ago.

1068
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,120
A Kaitlin Costello.

1069
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,880
That's correct.

1070
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,080
This is Mr Dorchester in Records.
I'm trying to track down a Kaitlin Costello.

1071
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,600
- Laura? Laura, you got a cigarette?
- Kaitlin Costello.

1072
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,800
Yeah. That's right.

1073
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:05,200
Well, she left about four years ago,
and we're looking for her chart.

1074
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,120
Kaitlin. Kaitlin Costello.

1075
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,880
Laura, don't forget the cigarettes.

1076
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:37,720
Hello. This is Ross Williams calling.

1077
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,120
Yes. I'm calling from California.

1078
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:43,960
I'm sorry. I know it's very late back East,
but this is an emergency.

1079
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,680
<i>- I'd like to speak to Kaitlin Costello, please.
- There's nobody here by that name.</i>

1080
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,320
I see.

1081
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:54,160
Well, our records must have
been mixed up, I guess.

1082
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,240
<i>- Is this the family of Kaitlin Costello?
- You know what time it is?</i>

1083
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,040
<i>- Hello?
- Hello.</i>

1084
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:12,280
<i>I'm calling from
The Professional Nurse Quarterly.</i>

1085
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:16,160
<i>- From the magazine?
- Yes. This is Mr Wallace in Subscriptions.</i>

1086
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:19,560
Is this Miss Costello?

1087
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,040
<i>- Yes... Price.
- Pardon?</i>

1088
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,640
<i>Kaitlin Price.</i>

1089
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,360
Yes. We find that
your subscription has lapsed.

1090
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,880
<i>- It lapsed three years ago!
- That's why we're calling, Miss Price.</i>

1091
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,640
<i>Mrs.</i>

1092
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:35,080
We have a ''renew your subscription'' offer.

1093
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,080
<i>We get the magazine at work.</i>

1094
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,160
Yes, I know. It's in our files. Let me see,
that's the Manhattan Health Center.

1095
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,480
<i>No. At Chelsea Childcare, OK?</i>

1096
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,960
<i>Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.</i>

1097
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:54,120
<i>Eastern Airlines 9am air-shuttle
for La Guardia</i>

1098
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,000
<i>now ready for boarding at gate 10.</i>

1099
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,120
Hello? Frank? Frank, where are you?

1100
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,000
You're going to New York?

1101
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,480
Listen, I have to be in New York
about some business.

1102
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,760
I have some papers to sign about my divorce.

1103
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,600
- Could we meet there?
- Laura, you got a cigarette?

1104
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,080
Could we meet in New York, Frank?

1105
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,200
Yeah.

1106
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:39,280
Yeah. The Russell Hotel.
On 38th Street, isn't it? Yeah.

1107
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,800
OK. At around four?

1108
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,000
I feel the same way, Frank.

1109
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,600
Yeah, I know.

1110
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,680
OK. I'll see you this afternoon.

1111
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,280
Bye-bye.

1112
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,320
Laura, I'm...

1113
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:11,240
I'm gonna go out and get some cigarettes.

1114
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,120
OK, OK, OK. One basketball.

1115
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,040
One football, one more basketball,

1116
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,560
and Duanie gets a little ball!

1117
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:25,320
What did you do with your hand? Come here.

1118
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,880
What did you do to your hand?
What did you do?

1119
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,720
Hi. Let's see this.

1120
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,880
I've been meaning to stop in here
for a long time.

1121
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,440
- You live in the neighbourhood?
- My nephew's comin' to visit.

1122
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,920
- How old is he?
- He's four.

1123
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:47,640
Let's see what we've got here.

1124
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,880
- Let's see this.
- No! Don't take it off.

1125
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,240
You're great with these kids.

1126
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,200
Thank you.

1127
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,680
No, I mean, you really are.

1128
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:05,480
Oh, you're the one they said was a nurse.

1129
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,760
- Who told you that?
- I don't know. Mrs...

1130
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:13,480
- Mrs Simmons?
- Yeah.

1131
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,240
I used to be a nurse.

1132
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:21,520
Well, it's a wonderful profession.
My daughter-in-law's a...

1133
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:24,080
What'd you do? Did you stop?

1134
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,280
Yes.

1135
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,920
Why'd you do that?

1136
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,040
Will you help me?

1137
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,520
What's the matter?
Are you lost or something?

1138
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:05,000
Frankie, we gotta talk.

1139
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,560
Come on. There's a bar around the corner.
We'll get a cup of coffee.

1140
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,960
Did you see that?

1141
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,360
You all right, Miss?

1142
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:19,760
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1143
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,560
I'm all right.

1144
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,440
- Leave him alone.
- Are you OK?

1145
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:35,840
I'm all right. Thank you.

1146
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:00,400
I talked to Johnny White
at the Bar Association.

1147
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:07,040
She used to work for one of
Concannon's partners in New York.

1148
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,480
She wanted to come to Boston.

1149
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:13,880
How bad did she hurt us?

1150
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,120
I don't know.

1151
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,760
We got a mistrial, you know.

1152
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,160
Did you hear what I said, Frank?

1153
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,480
I don't want a mistrial.

1154
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:58,400
<i>- Hello?
- Is Frank there?</i>

1155
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,840
<i>- No. He's not here now.
- When are you expecting him?</i>

1156
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,360
I don't know when.

1157
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:21,080
Doctor Towler.

1158
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:25,800
Page 406. ''Contraindications
of General Anesthetic.''

1159
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,480
''A patient should refrain from
taking nourishment up to nine hours

1160
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,080
prior to induction of general anesthetic.''
Sound familiar?

1161
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,840
Yes. I wrote it.

1162
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:41,000
<i>Methodology and Practice in Anesthesiology.</i>

1163
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,680
A general textbook on the subject,
is that correct?

1164
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,640
I...

1165
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,720
Yes, it is.

1166
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,200
- And you wrote it?
- Yes.

1167
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,440
Page 414.

1168
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,880
''If the patient has taken nourishment
within one hour prior to inducement,

1169
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,960
general anesthetic should be avoided
because of the grave risk

1170
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,280
the patient will aspirate
food particles into his mask.''

1171
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,680
Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
She aspirated food particles into her mask?

1172
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,600
She threw up in her mask, yes.

1173
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:18,600
But she hadn't eaten
one hour before admission.

1174
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:25,160
<i>If she had eaten an hour before
being admitted to the hospital,</i>

1175
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:31,000
then the inducement of a general
anaesthetic would have been negligent?

1176
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:35,800
Negligent? Yes, it would have been criminal.
But such was not the case.

1177
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:41,320
Thank you.

1178
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,760
- Mr Concannon?
- No further questions, Your Honour.

1179
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,840
Thank you, Dr Towler.

1180
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,920
Mr Galvin, rebuttal?

1181
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,880
Kaitlin Costello Price.

1182
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,560
Kaitlin Costello Price.

1183
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,200
State your name, please.

1184
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,200
Kaitlin Costello Price.

1185
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,960
Do you swear the evidence you give
will be the whole truth, so help you God?

1186
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,440
- I do.
- Be seated.

1187
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,120
- Kaitlin Price.
- Yes.

1188
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:46,040
You were the admitting nurse
at St Catherine Labouré on May 12th, 1976,

1189
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:49,320
the night that they admitted
Deborah Ann Kaye?

1190
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,320
Yes.

1191
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,480
Did you sign this admission form?

1192
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,680
- Yes.
- Those are your initials, ''KC''?

1193
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,920
Kaitlin Costello.

1194
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:06,840
That's my maiden name.

1195
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,320
Did you ask the patient
when did she last eat?

1196
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,280
Yes.

1197
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,360
What did she say?

1198
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,720
She said she'd had a full meal

1199
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,560
one hour before coming to the hospital.

1200
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,840
- One hour?
- Yes.

1201
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:43,520
And did you put the numeral ''one''
on this admission sheet?

1202
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:45,760
I mean, standing for ''one hour''?

1203
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:48,040
I did.

1204
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,520
A single hour?

1205
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,160
Yes.

1206
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,640
Thank you.

1207
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,120
Your witness.

1208
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,280
Anything?

1209
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:40,040
You're aware of the penalties for perjury?

1210
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:44,160
<i>- It's a crime.
- It is a crime. A serious crime.</i>

1211
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:46,800
- I wouldn't do it.
- You would not?

1212
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,320
No.

1213
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,560
You've taken an oath
that you would not commit perjury.

1214
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:54,440
- You've just sworn to that, isn't that right?
- Yes.

1215
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,840
- Just now.
- Yes.

1216
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:02,080
You have sworn before God
that you would tell the truth.

1217
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:04,920
Yes.

1218
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,680
Now, I want to ask you something.

1219
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,880
Four years ago,
when you were working as a nurse,

1220
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,520
are you aware that
these doctors, Marx and Towler,

1221
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:20,760
based their treatment of
Deborah Ann Kaye on this admitting form,

1222
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,160
which you signed?

1223
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,040
I...

1224
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:30,040
Wasn't that an oath?
These are your initials, ''KC.''

1225
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:32,480
When you signed this form, you took an oath

1226
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,480
no less important than that
which you've taken today.

1227
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,920
Isn't that right?

1228
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,400
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1229
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,920
Then which is correct?

1230
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:51,160
You've sworn today that the patient
ate one hour before admittance.

1231
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:55,520
<i>Four years ago you swore that
she ate nine hours before admittance.</i>

1232
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,920
All right, which is the lie?

1233
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,520
- I...
- These men could have settled out of court.

1234
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,160
They wanted a trial to clear their names.

1235
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:10,320
And you would come here, and on a slip of
memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.

1236
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:13,920
<i>- They lied.
- They lied?! They lied!</i>

1237
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:16,520
<i>When did they lie?</i>

1238
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,760
- Do you know what a lie is?
- I do, yes.

1239
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,880
You swore on this form
that the patient ate nine hours...

1240
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,280
- That's not what I wrote.
- You just told me that you signed it.

1241
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:28,480
I signed it, yes.

1242
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:32,280
But I didn't write a nine.

1243
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,200
I wrote a one.

1244
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,040
You didn't write a nine, you wrote a one.

1245
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,280
And how is it that you remember
so clearly after four years?

1246
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:50,120
Because I kept a copy.

1247
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:53,000
- I have it right here.
- Objection!

1248
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:56,840
We can't accept a copy
when the court already has the original.

1249
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,520
I'll rule on that presently.

1250
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,400
Please, proceed.

1251
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:12,840
What in the world induced you to make
a photocopy of an obscure record

1252
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,240
and hold it for four years?

1253
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,720
Your Honour, this...

1254
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,720
Why would you do that?

1255
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,080
- I thought I might need it.
- And why would you think that?

1256
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,040
After...

1257
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:49,320
after the operation,

1258
01:50:50,760 --> 01:50:54,880
when that poor girl, she went into a coma,
Dr Towler called me in.

1259
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,040
He told me

1260
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:03,760
that he'd had five difficult deliveries in a row

1261
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,360
and he was tired.

1262
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:12,600
And he never looked at the admittance form.

1263
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,600
And he told me to change the form.

1264
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,480
He told me to change the one

1265
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,400
to a nine.

1266
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:32,760
Or else, he said... He said he'd fire me.
He said I'd never work again.

1267
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,880
Who were these men?!

1268
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,960
Who were these men?!
I wanted to be a nurse!

1269
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,240
No further questions, Your Honour.

1270
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:53,000
You may step down.

1271
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:05,680
Mr Galvin?

1272
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,240
Nothing further, Your Honour.

1273
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,520
Mr Concannon?

1274
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:16,160
Mr Concannon.

1275
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:22,680
Thank you, Your Honour. We object
to the copy of the admitting form,

1276
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,240
<i>and we cite McGee versus
the State of Indiana, United States 131.2.</i>

1277
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:32,640
''The admission of a duplicate document
in preference to an existing original

1278
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:38,200
must presuppose the possibility of
alteration and so must be disallowed.''

1279
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:43,800
And, Your Honour, having
given the plaintiff the leeway,

1280
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:46,880
<i>we would like your ruling on this issue now.</i>

1281
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:50,600
We object to the admission
of a Xerox photocopy.

1282
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,880
One moment, Mr Concannon.

1283
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,600
Yes. The document is disallowed.

1284
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,360
- Objection!
- Overruled.

1285
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,320
- Exception!
- Noted. Thank you.

1286
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:10,600
Legally, he's right.

1287
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:17,520
The jury will not consider the testimony
of Miss Costello regarding the Xerox form.

1288
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:19,720
It is unsubstantiated.

1289
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,200
We cannot accept a copy
in preference to the original.

1290
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:28,800
Thank you, Your Honour. Furthermore,
Miss Costello is a rebuttal witness.

1291
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:33,120
As the court knows, no prior notice
was given of Miss Costello's appearance.

1292
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:37,480
And as a surprise witness, she may
serve only to rebut direct testimony.

1293
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:43,280
As her only evidentiary rebuttal is the
admitting form which has been disallowed,

1294
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,520
I request that
her entire testimony be disallowed,

1295
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:52,320
and that the jury be advised to totally
disregard her entire appearance here.

1296
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,920
- Yes, I'm going to uphold that.
- Objection.

1297
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,720
- Overruled.
- Exception.

1298
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,280
Noted. Thank you.

1299
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:06,080
The jury will be advised not to consider
the testimony of Miss Costello.

1300
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,200
Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.

1301
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:12,960
The sole rebuttal was the document,
which has been disallowed.

1302
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:17,880
Her entire testimony
must be stricken from the record.

1303
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,720
You shouldn't have heard it.
That was my mistake.

1304
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:23,880
You must strike it from your minds.
Give it no weight!

1305
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,720
Legally, it's over.

1306
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,960
Concannon was brilliant.

1307
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:37,000
Tell me about Kaitlin Costello.

1308
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:40,520
There's nothing to tell.
It's been stricken from the record.

1309
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:43,480
I know. But did you believe her?

1310
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,600
Mr Galvin?

1311
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,000
Mr Galvin? Summation?

1312
01:55:26,120 --> 01:55:28,120
Well...

1313
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,000
You know, so much of the time,
we're just lost.

1314
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:36,680
We say ''Please, God,

1315
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:40,280
tell us what is right, tell us what is true.''

1316
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:45,600
I mean, there is no justice.

1317
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,840
The rich win, the poor are powerless.

1318
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:59,880
We become tired of hearing people lie.

1319
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:05,200
And after a time we become dead.

1320
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,600
A little dead. We think of ourselves...

1321
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,120
as victims.

1322
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:18,520
And we become victims.

1323
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,360
We become...

1324
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,000
we become weak.

1325
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:32,840
We doubt ourselves, we doubt our beliefs.

1326
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,440
We doubt our institutions.

1327
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,000
And we doubt the law.

1328
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:45,480
But today you are the law.

1329
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,640
You are the law.

1330
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,600
Not some book, not the lawyers.

1331
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,280
Not a marble statue,

1332
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:08,080
or the trappings of the court.

1333
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,920
See, those are just symbols

1334
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,920
of our desire

1335
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,320
to be just.

1336
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:25,160
They are...

1337
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,680
they are, in fact, a prayer.

1338
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,320
I mean, a fervent and a frightened prayer.

1339
01:57:37,480 --> 01:57:39,760
In my religion

1340
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,560
they say ''Act as if ye had faith,

1341
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,280
and faith will be given to you.''

1342
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:53,360
If...

1343
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,840
if we are to have faith in justice,

1344
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:05,440
we need only to believe in ourselves,

1345
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,760
and act with justice.

1346
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,760
See, I believe there is justice in our hearts.

1347
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,800
Have you reached a verdict?

1348
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,840
We have, Your Honour.

1349
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:11,480
Your Honour, we've agreed to hold
for the plaintiff, Deborah Ann Kaye,

1350
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:16,600
and against St Catherine Labouré,
and Doctors Towler and Marx.

1351
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:20,600
But, Your Honour, are we limited
on the size of the award?

1352
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,200
What I mean, sir...

1353
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:27,720
Are we permitted to award an amount greater
than the amount the plaintiff asked for?

1354
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:33,480
You are.

1355
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:39,120
You're not bound by anything other than
your good judgment, based on the evidence.

1356
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,800
Please retire, and when you've agreed
on the amount of the award...

1357
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,120
You did it, Frank.

1358
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:55,480
Way to go, Frank.

1359
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:23,480
