00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,268
<i>Turn around and let me see</i>

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,279
<i>Your own pineapple wine,</i>
<i>your dollar fifty all the time</i>

166
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,799
<i>Turn around and let me see you...</i>

167
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,239
I wrote my vows.

168
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,351
- What?
- I wrote my vows.

169
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,233
- You?
- Work in progress.

170
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,679
Max, this is Ron and, uh...

171
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,835
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Gail.

172
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,154
- Gail, yes.
- Great to run into you again.

173
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,918
- I met them at the tennis club.
- Oh.

174
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,314
What kind of business you in, Maxwell?

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,271
Pest control.

176
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,799
- This is Sheila and Ed.
- Hey!

177
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,148
- Hi.
- Hi.

178
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,508
They're from Orlando.

179
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,232
I met them parasailing.

180
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,715
So, uh, what kind
of business are you in, Max?

181
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,229
I have a bunch of sweatshops
in the Philippines.

182
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,475
- Oh.
- Oh.

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,909
You should see those kids
make those hats.

184
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,792
- Great, huh?
- Wow.

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,876
- Scootch in.
- Hi.

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,319
Max, this is Wendell and June.

187
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,919
We met snorkeling.

188
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,359
- Max, right?
- Yes.

189
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,754
Yeah, Wendell.

190
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,678
- Oh, I love lobster.
- Oh, yummy!

191
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,677
Wow, look at that!

192
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,994
Stocks may rise and fall,
economies may collapse,

193
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,554
but the American farmer's always
gonna need manure.

194
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,672
My family's been in manure
for three generations.

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,915
No shit.

196
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,599
Holy cow!

197
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,953
Sheila and I like to swoc.

198
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,629
Swoc?

199
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,069
We like to have sex
with other couples.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,989
Check.

201
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,191
Ooh, honey, look at that!

202
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,435
Something wrong?

203
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,870
Six months.
I can't take any more lobster.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,991
There's only one thing
I enjoy eating more than lobster.

205
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,917
Huh, huh, huh?

206
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,598
Man, do I love lobster!

207
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,915
So, I'm setting up
for this 30-foot putt,

208
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,553
I got a chance for an eagle.

209
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,829
An eagle. Now, sweetie...

210
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,871
Steal her bracelet.

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,513
I saw you looking at it.

212
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,629
Steal it.

213
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,829
You know you want it.

214
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,554
We're retired, baby.
All I want is you.

215
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,831
Come on, let yourself go.
Have fun.

216
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,279
I bet you can't get it.

217
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,675
Of course I can, but I won't.

218
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,709
Bet you can't.

219
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,991
Max. Aren't you having a good time?

220
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,635
Please come again.

221
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,593
Maxwell, this one's on me.

222
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,790
Oh, thank you very much.

223
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,436
That's weird, I can't find my wallet.
Did I give you my wallet?

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,515
No, you didn't give me your wallet.

225
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,279
That's so weird! I could swear
I put it in my pocket before I came here.

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,550
It's okay, big fellow.
I got it.

227
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,113
Oh, thanks, Maxwell.

228
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,514
That is so sweet.

229
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,074
Where the hell is my wallet?

230
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,469
Luc, what's in
the Caribbean Romance again?

231
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,953
Light rum, amaretto,

232
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,072
orange juice, pineapple juice,
and a splash of grenadine.

233
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,919
What about the Pink Paradise?

234
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,158
Coconut rum, amaretto, cranberry juice,
orange juice, and pineapple juice.

235
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,273
People actually drink this stuff?

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,198
They love it.
You know, it makes them feel exotic.

237
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,719
Give me a Jack on the rocks.

238
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,274
It doesn't have a fancy name,
but if it was good enough for Frank,

239
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,674
it's good enough for me.

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,153
Frank?

241
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,679
Who's Frank?

242
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,233
Sinatra.

243
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,112
Did Frank take an umbrella?

244
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,837
Not even when it was raining.

245
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,193
Hi, baby.

246
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,515
How was it?

247
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,471
Amazing! You'd love it!

248
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,558
The only sounds are your breath
and your heartbeat.

249
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,117
The reef is like a thousand jewels,
sparkling right in front of you.

250
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,231
You should really try it next time.

251
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,715
Mm-hmm. Well,
I like to breathe unassisted.

252
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,398
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

253
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,193
I thought you liked it
when I give you mouth to mouth.

254
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,629
State your business.

255
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,471
You're gonna shoot
an FBI agent, Burdett?

256
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,511
All I see is an intruder...

257
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,829
...who just swallowed $80 worth
of my whiskey.

258
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,633
Put down the weapon.

259
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,113
Don't make me shoot you again.

260
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,795
Again?

261
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,592
Is that the way we're gonna play it?

262
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,190
What are you doing
in my house, Agent Lloyd?

263
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,039
Sitting, drinking, eating chocolate.

264
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,913
- You have a warrant?
- FBI doesn't have jurisdiction here.

265
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,439
I know, that's why I came down here.

266
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,993
Oh, I don't think it is.

267
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,157
The <i>Seven Seas Navigator</i>
docking here for a solid week.

268
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,033
They're having a nice promotion
for the maiden voyage,

269
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,754
calling it the Diamond Cruise.

270
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,713
A gem exhibit whose star attraction is

271
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,831
the third Napoleon Diamond.

272
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,190
Stop me when I get to the part
you don't know.

273
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,436
It's the only one you two haven't stolen.

274
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,515
Allegedly.

275
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,108
And it's gonna be right here
for a whole week-- the last of the set--

276
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,435
and I suspect you plan to purloin it.

277
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,549
Well, I don't.

278
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,398
So finish your drink and get out.

279
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,919
It's okay to be happy to see me.

280
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,998
Just because you're English doesn't
mean you need to hide your emotions.

281
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,997
I'm Irish.
We let people know how we feel.

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,394
Now fuck off.

283
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,760
And you can take any bugs you planted
along with you.

284
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,353
I'm retired.

285
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,392
A retired guy wouldn't have anything
to worry about from those.

286
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,873
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Take it.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,479
You might learn something from it.

288
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,238
But return it for me.
It's overdue.

289
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,998
Give my love to Lola, will you?

290
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,553
How was the tennis lesson?

291
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,399
Great. The teacher says I'm a natural.

292
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,159
He says I've got the best backside
he's ever seen.

293
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,235
That's <i>backhand</i>.

294
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,395
Don't go in there.

295
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,556
- Why?
- Let's talk.

296
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,076
Okay, you're making me nervous,
and I don't get nervous.

297
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,512
Agent Lloyd just left.

298
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,198
What's <i>he</i> doing here?

299
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,719
He came to show me this.

300
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,835
Damn it, Max.

301
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,359
Is this what we're here for?

302
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,835
No. It's not.

303
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,196
This is not retirement at all.

304
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,595
This is the next setup, isn't it?

305
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,518
Babe, <i>you</i> chose
this island, remember?

306
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,029
I hope you don't think
this is a gift from God.

307
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,550
'Cause this is God messing with us.

308
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,111
Oh, no. Max.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,592
Did Stan do this?

310
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,392
Sort of.

311
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,874
I figured he'd bug the place,
so I started checking.

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,797
Did you find any?

313
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,036
Only what he wanted me to find.

314
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,598
There's another one here somewhere.

315
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,439
Now, don't worry.
I already checked.

316
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,675
There's nothing in there.

317
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,199
That's the problem.

318
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,833
There's nothing in here.

319
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,793
What is it?
What's wrong?

320
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,354
I hid the bullet in the camera.

321
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,993
What bullet?

322
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,190
The one he shot you with.

323
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,753
Oh, no.

324
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,157
I kept it to remind me
of how close I came to losing you.

325
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,635
Lola, you know that bullet
puts me on the scene.

326
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,320
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

327
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,317
I'll get it back.

328
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,828
Good morning, Mr. Lloyd.
Your suite is ready.

329
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,110
- Suite?
- Suite, sir.

330
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,037
It's a larger room.

331
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,513
Atlantis reserves this bridge suite
for our more dignified guests.

332
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,638
Breakfast is on the house, these are
vouchers for free tennis lessons,

333
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,469
complimentary skin exfoliant,
seaweed body wrap and facial scrub,

334
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,068
located in the spa on the club level.

335
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,519
Also, please remember.

336
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,191
Shoes and shirt are required
in all public spaces at all times.

337
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,995
State your business.

338
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,998
You can't bribe me
with a seaweed body wrap, Max.

339
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,633
This doesn't buy you one bit of space.

340
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,716
I'm gonna be on you wherever you go.

341
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,875
It's no bribe, Stanley.

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,230
I just want you to see
that if you lead the kind of life I do,

343
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,396
stealing is the last thing on your mind.

344
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,159
Mr. Lloyd.

345
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,191
Are you ready for your massage?

346
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,238
I'll do your back.

347
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,112
I'll do your front.

348
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,673
You son of a bitch.

349
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,872
- Lola?
- Yeah.

350
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,238
- He hid it in a black jewelry box.
- Good job.

351
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,554
Thank you.

352
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,432
Talented masseuse.

353
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,349
You get rid of it this time.

354
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,879
I will.

355
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,517
Good evening.
May I take your order?

356
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,391
No, thank you.
I just lost my appetite.

357
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,635
Just as well.

358
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,399
I don't take orders from criminals,
I arrest them.

359
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,953
Or fall asleep trying.

360
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,118
So you're admitting you were there.

361
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,038
No. I read about it in the papers,
just like everyone else.

362
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,991
You're famous.

363
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,273
I'm a punchline.

364
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,833
But like my grandma used to say,
he who laughs last laughs loudest.

365
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,598
By the way,
return that movie, would you?

366
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,199
The store called.

367
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,912
I haven't finished it yet.

368
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,998
They catch the thief,
but it's not who you think it is.

369
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,951
I don't like those twist endings.

370
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,399
Well, we don't like you.

371
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,114
- Aw.
- Lola.

372
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,153
They're playing your song.

373
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,078
Why don't you take Stanley
for a dance?

374
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,679
He's feeling lonely.

375
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,268
And I am feeling charitable.

376
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,513
Let's go, Stan.

377
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,675
Really?

378
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,156
I'll try to have her back by dawn.

379
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,275
Constable...

380
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,388
Can I help you?

381
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,238
I wanna talk to Mooré.

382
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,554
Get out of the way.

383
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,353
Monsieur Mooré is currently socializing.

384
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,233
Interrupting a man's leisure
is harassment.

385
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,555
That's not harassment.

386
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,114
You feel that?

387
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,356
- Ooh.
- That's harassment.

388
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,393
And you tell your boss
this is just the beginning.

389
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,637
I have two hands,
and I can't be bought.

390
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,715
Ooh.

391
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,114
Excuse me, constable.
May I have a word with you?

392
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,036
<i>Audrey, where you get that sugar?</i>

393
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,116
Listen, Stan,
I know what you're doing.

394
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,074
But if you drag Max into your game,
he will not lose.

395
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,111
Eventually, they all lose.

396
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,719
Not my Max.

397
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,115
Do yourself a favor--
leave us alone.

398
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,994
We're just a couple of retirees
trying to enjoy the island life.

399
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,396
All the same, I'll stick around,
see what develops.

400
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,995
Excuse me.

401
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,678
In a second, honey.
You'll get your chance.

402
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,439
Damn, I got the stink on me tonight.

403
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,152
Step off the dance floor, sir.

404
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,313
Hey!

405
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,032
- Have fun, Stan.
- Hey. Lola!

406
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,594
Police.
Raise your hands, sir.

407
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,194
I'm law.
Federal B.I.?

408
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,679
It is illegal on this island to carry
a concealed weapon without a permit.

409
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,358
I'm working a suspect.

410
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,880
Are you not supposed to inform
local authorities when you arrive,

411
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,355
Agent Stanley P. Lloyd?

412
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,596
- You know him?
- He's my suspect.

413
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,632
Well, we're still gonna have to
take this to the station and register it.

414
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,034
You're letting the criminal go.

415
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,275
This is crazy.

416
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,833
You think this is crazy?

417
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,599
Your dancing, <i>that</i> was crazy.

418
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,153
This way, Agent Lloyd.

419
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,111
Welcome to paradise.

420
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,114
Okay.

421
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,993
- The watermarks and holograms match.
- Oh.

422
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,076
But I still have to register the gun.

423
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,119
You have a nice smile.

424
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,912
I haven't smiled at you.

425
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,519
You will.

426
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,309
That's just the way I feel about it,
and they have to deal with it.

427
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,509
Yes, sir.

428
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,392
Ah, Sophie.

429
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,238
I need to speak to you.

430
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,794
I'm getting complaints
about you bothering Henri Mooré.

431
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,751
Just doing my job, Zacharias.

432
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,791
The man is practically
the unofficial mayor of the island.

433
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,433
In one year, he's made
everyone here like him,

434
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,278
something you haven't been
able to do in a lifetime.

435
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,994
I guess we can't all be
the kiss-ass politician you are.

436
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,553
I want you to stay behind tonight
so we can discuss your attitude.

437
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,193
You knew about my attitude
the day we got married

438
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,719
and knew about it
the day we got divorced.

439
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,479
You're not gonna learn
any more about it tonight.

440
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,309
Besides, I have plans
with Special Agent Lloyd of the FBI.

441
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,351
He's just arrived on the island.

442
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,109
Is that so?

443
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,955
Shall we?

444
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,593
We shall.

445
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,832
She's feisty.

446
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,076
Mmm. Isn't it beautiful?

447
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,509
Yeah.

448
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,278
Is it enough?

449
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,155
Of course it is.

450
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,711
Some people say the only way
to rid yourself of temptation

451
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,831
is to yield to it.

452
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,552
I don't know about that.

453
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,355
I say turn your back on temptation...

454
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,154
...or substitute something
more tempting.

455
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,075
See how easy that was?

456
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,235
What's the shortest amount of time
you've ever known a guy

457
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,670
before you kissed him?

458
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,959
I see what you're thinking,
and you can forget it.

459
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,755
Guys come down to this island looking
for a slice of paradise with a local girl,

460
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,030
and they will say anything to get it.

461
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,628
I resent being lumped in with all guys,

462
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,797
though, admittedly,
I would say anything right now.

463
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,036
How long have you been chasing Max?

464
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,794
Seven years-- ever since the first
Napoleon Diamond went missing.

465
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,798
I got to the scene,
took a few shots at the getaway car.

466
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,357
Next day, bottle of champagne arrives
at FBI Headquarters for me,

467
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,996
with a note says,
"Aim for the tires next time."

468
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,678
He was baiting you.

469
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,553
- Hmm.
- Is there a money trail?

470
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,513
Everything's plain--
taxes, bank accounts.

471
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,677
He doesn't buy
expensive paintings, yachts, nothing.

472
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,590
I think it's more about the challenge
and the alibi-- that's his work of art.

473
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,392
Sounds like you admire him.

474
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,790
Would I like to live one day
in his velvety slippers?

475
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,239
Maybe.

476
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,112
But I don't admire him.

477
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,117
He's beat me too many times for that.

478
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,276
Maybe you need the female touch.

479
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,717
That's exactly what I need.

480
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,150
Listen, I want a big arrest,
you need local help.

481
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,475
I'll extend the FBI courtesy on this one.

482
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,795
As long as I'm riding shotgun.

483
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,395
What's going on?

484
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,476
I'm expanding the deck.

485
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,113
You're trying to stay busy.

486
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,232
Look, on this deck,
we are going to sit here

487
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,158
and watch sunsets until we get old.

488
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,439
Can't wait.

489
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,913
Where are you going?

490
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,598
You said I need a hobby.

491
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,551
I guess I'll go find one.

492
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,635
Really?

493
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,671
I'll call you later.

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,989
He's here.

495
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,396
The centerpiece of our exhibit.

496
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,751
Napoleon had three priceless diamonds
set into the hilt of his sword.

497
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,838
After his defeat, they were pried out
and dispersed around the globe.

498
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,669
This is one of the rare occasions the last
remaining diamond is on public display.

499
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,268
And next, we have
some rare Egyptian gems.

500
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,353
Cute little rock.

501
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,072
I'm just here to look.

502
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,235
Just as well.

503
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,477
With six cameras--
four stationary, two revolving,

504
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,192
a dozen I.R. motion sensors--

505
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,834
Sixteen.
You missed the ones at ankle level.

506
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,269
Plus your standard
24-hour rotating guards.

507
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,755
Unbreakable polycarbonate display,

508
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,519
controlled by an uncopyable
magnetic key card.

509
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,239
I just realized--
you could never get it anyway.

510
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,749
You're right.

511
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,672
When you're right, you're right.

512
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,668
It's impossible.

513
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,514
Give me a ride.

514
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,709
I don't think so.

515
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,876
Maybe you should think again.

516
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,359
May I present Monsieur Henri Mooré.

517
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,274
Mr. Burdett.

518
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,399
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.

519
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,272
Oh, you're an American.

520
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,789
Hmm. Henri Mooré?

521
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,751
Ah. My name is Henry Moore.

522
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,189
I placed the thing on the "e".

523
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,197
I felt it more appropriate
to my surroundings.

524
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,117
- Oh.
- Please.

525
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,953
I imagine you're wondering
why you're here.

526
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,877
Well...

527
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,230
Forgive Jean-Paul's tactics, Mr. Burdett,

528
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,638
but to put it bluntly, the impoverished
people of this island need your help.

529
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,113
Hmm.

530
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,038
Five years ago, I was
a successful businessman in Detroit.

531
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,151
While vacationing on this island,

532
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,236
I was sitting on the beach
drinking a...

533
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,078
Citron martini.

534
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,797
I don't recall what I was drinking--
it's not important.

535
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,592
But I experienced a revelation--

536
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,599
that I had been brought to this island to
provide the commensurate social services

537
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,757
that were sadly lacking
for the poorer elements of society here.

538
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,673
And you want me to buy a table
at your next fundraiser.

539
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,429
No, Mr. Burdett.

540
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,278
But I am offering you the opportunity

541
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,119
to participate in the vital growth
of my infrastructure.

542
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,468
Uh-huh. How's that?

543
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,877
I want you to steal me that diamond.

544
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,829
I'm not a criminal.

545
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,110
Right. Neither am I.

546
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,639
Good.
Then we understand each other.

547
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,079
- Yes.
- Yeah.

548
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,191
Let me show you around, Mr. Burdett.

549
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,028
Do you think it fair
that the indigenous of this island

550
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,799
are not allowed to enter the casinos
unless they work there?

551
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,515
Why is it that only the rich should enjoy

552
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,633
pharmaceutically-assisted moments
of personal introspection?

553
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,275
The safety and security found
in owning your own machine gun.

554
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,514
The pleasures derived

555
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,713
from financially-procured
female companionship.

556
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,957
The underprivileged should not be
denied these essential diversions.

557
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,230
I mean, look around you, Mr. Burdett.

558
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,839
No one is turned away.

559
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,279
All I do, I do for the people.

560
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,833
And why do you need
the diamond for that?

561
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,990
I have an urgent need to expand
my humanitarian program.

562
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,192
A cash injection
in the tens of millions of dollars

563
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,992
would relieve the entire Caribbean.

564
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,719
What I'm suggesting
is a partnership, Mr. Burdett.

565
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,910
You are a stranger to this island.

566
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,871
I can give you what you don't have--

567
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,791
access to the marina, the crews,
rotation schedules, whatever you need.

568
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,791
I couldn't sleep.
Didn't wanna wake you.

569
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,395
I saw you on the ship yesterday.

570
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,553
I had a feeling you might be there, too.

571
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,520
Don't you ever feel
we weren't quite finished?

572
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,711
Look, Max, I miss it, too.

573
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,592
We were great.

574
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,871
And we went out
at the top of our game, undefeated.

575
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,195
The best time to quit.

576
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,399
Maybe.

577
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,439
Max, I cased it.

578
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,916
It's not a one man job, and there's
no way you're pulling me into it.

579
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,359
We're retired.

580
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,517
Now the challenge is
to find joy in simple things.

581
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,074
And I like that challenge.

582
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,595
Yeah?

583
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,675
I lied on the ship.

584
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,119
I <i>could</i> get it.

585
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,195
<i>Here's how.</i>

586
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,788
<i>I'd cut the camera feed</i>
<i>and go in from behind the exhibit.</i>

587
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,718
It's blowable from the storage room,
and I'd do it after 10 p.m.

588
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,353
Why?

589
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,199
The retired arthritic cops
always get that shift.

590
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,991
So that's how you do it.

591
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,473
And now I've told you.

592
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,556
So now I can't.

593
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,553
Oh, my God.

594
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,671
- What are you doing?
- I'm cooking.

595
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,756
- Since when?
- This morning.

596
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,438
We are decent law-abiding people,

597
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,358
and decent law-abiding people
cook omelets for breakfast.

598
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,229
Oh.

599
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,434
State your business.

600
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,879
<i>You almost had me last night</i>

601
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,151
<i>with that old David Copperfield</i>
<i>smoke and mirrors trick.</i>

602
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,273
"Look at my assistant with the big tits
while I take the Rolex right off your wrist."

603
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,389
What do you want about her?

604
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,238
I wanna know
how you're really gonna do it,

605
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,238
and you're gonna tell me
while we're fishing.

606
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,429
Fishing?

607
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,788
I don't fish.

608
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,717
I got a boat stacked with beer.

609
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,795
Drink it yourself.

610
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,638
<i>You might as well come.</i>
<i>You're paying for it.</i>

611
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,478
<i>I charged it to my suite.</i>

612
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,034
All the same, Stanley, I'll pass.

613
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,115
There is an option.

614
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,869
I get the local police to bring you down
to the station, we sweat you there.

615
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,115
<i>And I do mean sweat.</i>

616
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,437
<i>There's no air conditioning,</i>
<i>so dress light.</i>

617
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,357
The eggs on this island taste funny.

618
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,789
They must have some weird chickens.

619
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,629
<i>What'll it be, Max?</i>

620
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,749
I'll see you soon.

621
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,157
Tell me this isn't better
than standing in some lineup.

622
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,519
I've never been in a lineup.

623
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,309
Ooh, that's a hell of a watch.

624
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,589
What's that kind of thing run you?

625
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,676
A couple of grand.

626
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,838
Why don't you pick one up
on the Bureau's expense account?

627
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,838
Oh, they keep me on a real tight leash.

628
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,518
I got you to thank for that.

629
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,959
Ah.

630
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,719
Whoo! It's cookin' out here.

631
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,596
So if I didn't shoot you,
where'd you get the screen door?

632
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,473
Knitting accident.

633
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,037
Dab some of this on my back, will you?

634
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,635
Are you serious?

635
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,399
Yeah. I've got delicate skin.
I don't wanna burn.

636
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,512
I bet you were the best kid in the
neighborhood at hide-and-seek, huh?

637
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,834
So you joined the Bureau.

638
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,155
Yeah, I found them all.

639
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,478
No one ever found me.

640
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,319
Once I found a good spot,
I'd stay there for days.

641
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,954
There you go.

642
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,071
Now, turn around.
I'll do you.

643
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,189
I'll handle it.

644
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,038
No, come on.
You're gonna burn.

645
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,789
Good.

646
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,795
Okay.

647
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,558
There. That's good.

648
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,352
Wait. Don't you want me
to coat everything?

649
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,833
That's good. My pole.

650
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,552
No way, man!
I'm only doing your back!

651
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,635
My pole!

652
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,988
Hey, we got something.
Come on.

653
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,075
Oh, oh, oh. Look at this!

654
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,872
Oh. We got something here, Stanley.

655
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,955
Ooh! Aah!

656
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,957
Shit! Come on!

657
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,559
Come on! Help me pull it up.

658
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,477
Don't lose it, don't lose it!

659
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,634
- It's a monster.
- We can do it!

660
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,716
This is big.
Okay, come on, pull!

661
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,193
- Are <i>you</i> pulling?
- I'm pulling, man.

662
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,275
Jesus Christ!

663
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,994
Stanley!
One, two, three!

664
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,872
Oh! Aah!

665
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,675
Jesus Christ!

666
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,313
It's a shark, it's a shark.

667
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,395
Yeah.

668
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,753
Why is it not moving?

669
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,871
- Maybe it's in shock.
- What do you wanna do?

670
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,560
Maybe it's dead.
I mean, it looks dead.

671
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,315
Go over and shake it.

672
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,510
- Why me?
- Well, you're FBI.

673
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,993
What's that have to do with anything?

674
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,759
If it bites your arm off,
you get disability for the rest of your life.

675
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,074
- Go!
- <i>You</i> hooked it.

676
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,189
<i>You</i> go see if it's alive.

677
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,833
Yeah, I hooked it,
so <i>you</i> go see if it's alive.

678
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,154
- Go!
- Hey, hey!

679
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,999
Oh, okay.
Here I go.

680
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,918
I'm just gonna sneak up on it.

681
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,595
Why are you whispering?

682
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,392
So it won't know the plan.

683
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,679
Hey.

684
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,194
- Aah!
- Aah! Shit!

685
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,673
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

686
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,958
You have the right to remain silent!

687
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,235
Yeah, it's dead.

688
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,718
Yeah.

689
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,675
Look at them.

690
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,917
If you didn't know any better,
you'd think they were friends.

691
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,792
You must be Lola.

692
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,475
Sophie?

693
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,469
Nice gun.

694
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,874
Sig Sauer P228.

695
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,718
Custom trigger action.

696
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,875
Oh.

697
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,513
- Nice shoes.
- Thank you.

698
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,676
- Chanel?
- Cruz collection.

699
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,039
How bad was it?

700
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,393
Oh, not too bad.

701
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,354
Sophie seems nice.

702
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,314
Yeah, for a cop.

703
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,158
Lola seems cool.

704
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,349
For a thief.

705
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,353
Yes!

706
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,713
I resign. You win.

707
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,114
Make a wish.

708
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,037
Okay.

709
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,197
I wish you'd write your vows.

710
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,268
<i>I'm so tense.</i>

711
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,391
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Let me relax you.</i>

712
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,159
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Why are you taking off your clothes?</i>

713
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,235
Now we're talkin'.

714
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,839
<i>Are you being naughty?</i>

715
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,439
<i>Naughty enough to spank.</i>

716
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,790
Oh, yeah!

717
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,753
<i>I'll bite you.</i>
<i>Can I bite you?</i>

718
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,269
<i>The door.</i>
<i>Are we expecting anyone?</i>

719
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,356
<i>Yeah. A friend.</i>

720
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,038
- <i>A friend?</i>
- A friend?

721
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,309
<i>A girlfriend.</i>

722
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,395
<i>You didn't.</i>

723
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,873
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

724
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,434
<i>You know I'll do anything for you.</i>

725
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,789
<i>Wait here.</i>

726
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,353
<i>What's she gonna do?</i>

727
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,671
Tell him.
Tell him.

728
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,791
<i>She's gonna help me relax you.</i>

729
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,353
<i>You're kidding.</i>

730
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,109
Nice.

731
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,719
<i>You're gonna like this.</i>

732
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,034
Lucky bastard.

733
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,116
- <i>Who is she?</i>
- <i>You'll see.</i>

734
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,673
<i>Max, I'd like you to meet Stan's mom.</i>

735
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,149
<i>Night, Stan.</i>

736
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,149
Son of a...

737
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,392
You're only in port 48 more hours.

738
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,112
Stay on high alert.

739
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,993
Agent Lloyd, we have the most sophisticated
security system

740
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,475
ever installed on a seagoing vessel.

741
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,874
And you'll need it.

742
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,749
Excuse me, sir.

743
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,517
There's been a security breach.

744
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,035
Don't move!

745
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,355
Turn around.

746
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,669
Turn around!

747
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,389
- No!
- Stan!

748
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,874
Damn it.

749
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,951
The other side!

750
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,915
Just stop him!

751
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,359
Let's do it, come on!

752
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,238
<i>Although the famed</i>
<i>Napoleon Diamond was undisturbed,</i>

753
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,998
<i>the unknown intruder knocked out</i>

754
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,554
<i>a</i> Seven Seas Navigator
<i>maintenance worker,</i>

755
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,797
<i>stole his uniform.</i>
<i>and slipped onto the ship.</i>

756
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,232
You're cheating on me, aren't you?

757
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,358
What are you talking about?

758
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,153
Maybe not with a woman,
but with a diamond.

759
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,875
You want her.

760
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,877
And I'm jealous.

761
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,877
You've got nothing to worry about.

762
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,718
Where were you tonight, Max?

763
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,515
I've been home, writing my vows.

764
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,595
Oh! Let me see.

765
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,598
Sorry.
You have to wait.

766
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,556
Well, I'm not gonna let
that little bitch take my man.

767
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,238
I'm gonna fight for what's mine.

768
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,349
Really?

769
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,710
And how exactly are you gonna do that?

770
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,319
I'm a thief.

771
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,555
I know a thing or two about distraction.

772
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,354
It's a beautiful jewel, Max.

773
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,319
But I guarantee you,
it's no fun in the tub.

774
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,439
Mmm.

775
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,754
I had him.
You shoulda stayed out of my way.

776
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,110
I didn't want you to get hurt.
I'm sorry.

777
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,879
You're the one who's hurt.
You should ice that.

778
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,195
Why are men always trying
to protect women?

779
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,034
'Cause you smell good.

780
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,718
It's all about sex, isn't it?

781
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,308
Why can't we just be
two cops working a case?

782
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,998
Hey, I happen to agree with you.

783
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,031
From now on,
we're just partners on this.

784
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,229
Fine.

785
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,510
- So, let's have dinner and discuss it.
- No, thanks.

786
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,914
How about a steam?

787
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,271
What-- I-- no, I always steam
with my partners.

788
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,395
Okay, you wanna go
for a Jacuzzi, partner?

789
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,875
I have a big tub in my room.

790
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,999
We have to talk.

791
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,680
Max. Great timing.
Ride with us.

792
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,358
Can we just do this one on one?

793
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,799
Oh, of course.

794
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,392
<i>California dreaming...</i>

795
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,876
Are you familiar with the pleasures
of anonymous love, Max?

796
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,315
No.

797
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,875
Recently I found myself experimenting
with alternative lifestyle parameters

798
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,070
based largely
on the free love philosophy

799
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,078
as found in the collected works
of The Mamas and The Papas.

800
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,793
I never made that connection.

801
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,955
Oh, it's there.

802
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,674
That Michelle Phillips,
she could walk it like she talked it.

803
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,995
Earl, burn one of my CDs for Max.

804
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,553
Yes, sir.

805
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,639
This is it, Max.

806
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,988
My vision.

807
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,308
My infrastructure growing
before our eyes.

808
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,195
It used to be a children's hospital,

809
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,995
but I'm revitalizing it
into a paramilitary training facility.

810
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,635
More importantly,
that ship is leaving in two days.

811
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,075
What's this?

812
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,474
Everything you need.

813
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,116
Schematics, detailed plan.

814
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,151
You can do it yourself.

815
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,677
Go in through the air conditioning vents.

816
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,519
The exhibit is accessible
from the storage facility behind it.

817
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,712
There's cameras there, so you're
gonna have to cut the central feed.

818
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,432
Red wires in the control panel here.

819
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,632
If you don't cut the red wire,
they'll see everything.

820
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,228
- What next?
- Blow the wall.

821
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,634
- C-4?
- Uh-uh.

822
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,354
I'd use a shape charge
with a detonation cord.

823
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,755
Smaller but more effective.

824
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,839
And... you'd wanna blow it
after 10 p.m.

825
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,872
- Why is that?
- Graveyard shift.

826
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,560
Always the retired cops
with arthritis.

827
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,272
That's how I'd do it.

828
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,959
Then that's how I'll do it.

829
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,316
You know, we're not
partners anymore, Max.

830
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,474
In fact, you see me,
cross the street.

831
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,675
<i>You gotta go</i>

832
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,438
<i>Go where you wanna go</i>

833
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,312
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

834
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,399
<i>With whoever</i>
<i>you wanna do it with</i>

835
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,159
<i>You gotta go</i>
<i>where you wanna go</i>

836
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,396
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

837
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,479
<i>With whoever</i>
<i>you wanna do it with</i>

838
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,833
<i>You don't understand</i>
<i>that a girl like...</i>

839
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,716
Good afternoon. Atlantis.
How may I help?

840
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,035
Mr. Lloyd,
the Bridge Suite, please.

841
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,515
<i>Hello.</i>

842
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,914
- Stanley.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

843
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,600
- It's Max, just checking in.
- <i>Cut the crap, Max.</i>

844
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,950
<i>You're making sure I'm in my room</i>
<i>and not following you.</i>

845
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,753
How could you be following me
if you're in your room?

846
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,155
- See you soon, Stanley.
- <i>Okay.</i>

847
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,589
Hello!

848
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,675
What?

849
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,995
What?

850
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,157
If you're gonna forward your calls,
don't tail me so close.

851
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,669
Aah!

852
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,799
Hey.

853
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,638
I heard the call
over the radio.

854
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,797
Every year there's one white boy
that goes down at Junkanoo.

855
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,875
Here's what I found out.
Max closed escrow,

856
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,514
and then a month later
the cruise booked the diamond.

857
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,835
- Maybe he <i>is</i> retired.
- I doubt it.

858
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,598
He met with Henri Mooré today,

859
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,631
the biggest gangster on the island.

860
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,314
Thanks for coming.

861
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,193
You know, this one
you really do have to ice.

862
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,515
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

863
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,155
Better?

864
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,473
There's another one here.

865
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,995
Now?

866
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,315
This one's particularly painful.

867
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,198
There's some referred pain.
It's somewhere around... here.

868
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,356
I'll have to get hurt more often.

869
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,755
And in more interesting places.

870
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,749
- Oh, God, I'm vibrating!
- So am I.

871
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,394
No. No, no.

872
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,476
- I'm getting a call.
- What?

873
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,591
Is nothing sacred?

874
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,755
Shit, I have to go.

875
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,633
Go? No, you can't go.
I just unwrapped my head.

876
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,318
Sorry, I need a rain check.

877
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,670
What, are you crazy?
It never rains here.

878
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,835
Just give me five minutes, all right?

879
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,349
Five minutes?
You should be embarrassed.

880
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,674
Okay, three.

881
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,756
Oh, Stan, come on.

882
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,269
Okay, two!
Please don't make me beg. Please.

883
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,594
A quick two?

884
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,188
Oh, don't worry, I'm quick.

885
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,915
Hello.

886
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,758
Mr. Burdett, it's Luc from the bar.

887
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,838
There's a guest down here
that's bombed that's shouting your name.

888
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,633
Welcome to paradise, Frank!

889
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,032
Well, it's only paradise
for criminals, like Max Burdett.

890
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,755
Yeah. I hear him.
I'll be right there.

891
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,673
- Where'd he go?
- Over there.

892
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,994
Oh, thanks, Luc.

893
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,518
What are you doing to yourself?
What's wrong?

894
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,629
- Nothing.
- Nothing's wrong?

895
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,676
Me and Sophie hooked up.

896
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,472
And it was beautiful.

897
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,278
But it's only gonna
last for one more day.

898
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,594
Why is that?

899
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,234
Because the ship's only gonna
be here 24 more hours,

900
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,918
and you're gonna clip Napoleon Ill

901
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,837
and make me look
like a jerk again.

902
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,351
- I'll have another one!
- You've had enough.

903
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,198
You are not my daddy.

904
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,517
I didn't take you as an umbrella
kind of guy, Stan.

905
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,471
These remoras really have
a kick to 'em.

906
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,556
Hey, Stan, buck up.
You're a good agent.

907
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,557
No, I'm not.

908
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,433
You know, I used to blame you,
but now I see it clearly.

909
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,835
It's not you, it's me.

910
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,757
You've got genius, man.

911
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,032
If I had an ounce
of what you have, I'd never stop.

912
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,675
You've got a gift, man.
It's inspiring.

913
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,596
I love these remoras!

914
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,473
Bartender! Give me another one!

915
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,438
It's okay, Stan.
It's okay.

916
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,950
Luc, you're not working tonight, right?
Give us a hand here.

917
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,718
Come on, Stan,
here you go. Come on.

918
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,717
Here you go, buddy.
Yeah.

919
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,519
Come on, come on.

920
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,151
What about me?!

921
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,277
That's it, Stanley.

922
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,913
Here you go.

923
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,155
That's it.

924
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,673
That's it. Here we go.

925
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,955
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

926
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,359
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

927
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,192
- Max.
- Okay.

928
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,835
Lola!

929
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,429
It's locked.
And don't try to break in.

930
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,629
You're not welcome.

931
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,473
I finished the deck.

932
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,797
You promised to spend
the first sunset on it together.

933
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,990
- Lola.
- That's not all.

934
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,319
I found your notebook.

935
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,236
Lola.

936
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,715
I'll sit down right now
and write my vows, okay?

937
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,238
The vows are not for me,
they're for you.

938
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,318
You have to figure out if what
we have means anything to you.

939
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,475
Come on, Max.

940
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,236
Do you really think the third one's
gonna make you whole?

941
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,472
- I don't know.
- Well, don't come back until you do.

942
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,077
Where am I supposed to go?

943
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,675
She threw me out.

944
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,838
Why is it my problem?

945
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,235
'Cause every hotel
on the island is booked.

946
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,710
Can I move
this surveillance stuff?

947
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:32,832
Don't mess with it!
It's very expensive.

948
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,229
Listen, I'm not gonna
sleep on the floor.

949
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,033
Well, I guess you're
out of luck.

950
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,388
We both are.

951
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,595
Move over.

952
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,035
Shit.

953
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,594
So what'd you do?

954
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,111
I missed our first sunset
on her new deck.

955
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,395
That's it?

956
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,077
I'm no good at sunsets.

957
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,593
Of course you're not.

958
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,836
The world is divided up between people
who like to watch the sunset

959
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,194
and those who don't.

960
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,148
Yeah.

961
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,999
People like you
are never happy.

962
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,750
You're anxious, type-A, egocentric
perfectionists who can't sit still

963
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,589
and die alone with a million bucks
and a thousand regrets.

964
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,120
The people who can relax,
enjoy the sunset,

965
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:48,233
hold hands at the end of the day--
they're the happy ones.

966
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,672
So why can't you do that?

967
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,834
Because of you.

968
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,232
Don't hog the blanket.

969
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,998
- Good night, Max.
- Good night.

970
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,396
You know, the Bureau's got
a "don't ask, don't tell" policy,

971
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,317
but this is pushing it, Stan.

972
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,635
Kowalski, Stafford.

973
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,715
Sophie?

974
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,354
The L.A. office got a call
from Inspector Bethel here.

975
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,597
He wanted to know the scope
of the FBI's operation on the island.

976
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,711
Since we don't have
an operation on the island,

977
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,512
we felt we'd
come here and check it out.

978
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,914
What's he talking about, Stan?

979
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,189
Let me explain.

980
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,675
He's on suspension.
He has been for three months.

981
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,835
Suspension?

982
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,349
He was deemed unstable
after he lost Napoleon II.

983
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,879
You told me
you were here on the case.

984
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,399
I am here on the case,

985
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,990
and once I bust this guy,
get reinstated, upped,

986
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,439
these slobs will be saluting me.

987
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,788
Are you guys dating?

988
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,672
He's nothing but a suspect to me.

989
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,234
- Oh, really?
- That's not what these show.

990
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,472
Your suspect's paying
for this suite.

991
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,033
And the seaweed body wraps.

992
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,752
You two look pretty chummy.

993
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,590
So you lied to me, Stan.

994
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,314
And you got your
slice of paradise, hmm?

995
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,956
I hope it was everything
you thought it would be.

996
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,229
Sophie...

997
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,432
You might want to do more
of a background check next time

998
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,959
before you partner up.

999
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,553
She didn't have to be
so hard on you, you know?

1000
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,193
Storming out like that.

1001
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,072
She's got grounds.

1002
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,112
The thing you gotta understand
about us law enforcement types

1003
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,310
is we don't much
appreciate lying.

1004
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,273
Come on, Stan, you fibbed,
maybe withheld a little.

1005
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,753
But lie? Nah.

1006
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,835
You are an FBI agent
working a case.

1007
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,836
You know, when you put it like that,
it doesn't sound so bad.

1008
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,678
I could explain it to her.

1009
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,154
What about you?

1010
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,555
You are a hell of a catch.

1011
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,955
I've seen the way
you are with Lola.

1012
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,195
You love that girl.

1013
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,754
So you're working out
some personal issues.

1014
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,757
All you need is a little support.

1015
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,915
Exactly.

1016
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,235
Hell, I could
make her understand.

1017
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,758
Max can't eat, can't sleep.

1018
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,711
He's like an injured bird.

1019
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,990
Stan's hurt.
He's in pain.

1020
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,758
He's like a wounded dog.

1021
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,440
He needs you, Lola.
You're his better half.

1022
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,754
Just give him one more chance.

1023
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,677
He's a good guy, Sophie.

1024
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,951
I'm sure he's a liar,
but that comes with the job.

1025
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,633
I don't know.
This is all a bit strange.

1026
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,398
What do you think, Lola?

1027
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,795
- I don't buy a word of it.
- I'm with you.

1028
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,194
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1029
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,435
- Listen, hear us out.
- Come on, one second.

1030
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,515
Look...

1031
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,068
Tonight the lies stop.

1032
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,599
He's serious. It's over.

1033
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,234
He's not chasin' it,
and I'm not chasin' him.

1034
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,670
I'm sorry, but I won't believe you
until that ship is gone.

1035
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,756
And we still got a few hours
before she sails.

1036
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,916
Look, I can't make
that ship disappear tonight,

1037
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,234
but I can make us disappear.

1038
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,557
- What are you talking about?
- I found a hobby.

1039
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,152
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell me about this.

1040
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,998
When we come up for air,

1041
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,749
that ship will be headed to Paris
and the diamond will be gone forever.

1042
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,152
So, where you taking us?

1043
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,350
We're headed to a hidden reef
where there's rumored to be

1044
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,755
100 million in gold
somewhere among the wreckage.

1045
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,829
You're kidding.

1046
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,995
Wow!

1047
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,758
Look at this.

1048
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,792
Yeah, these ships have
been down here since the '40s,

1049
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,115
but nobody's ever
found any gold.

1050
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,959
Well, maybe with the help
of the FBI we'll get lucky.

1051
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,798
My money's on Max.

1052
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,674
100 million four ways--
that's 25 million apiece if we split it.

1053
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,115
Have any idea where to start?

1054
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,710
It could be anywhere down here.
Let's split up, look around.

1055
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,553
You guys sure this is safe?
I'm allergic to shellfish.

1056
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,116
You've got nothing to worry about.
I've seen how you handle sharks.

1057
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,716
When we get back,
I'm buying everyone umbrella drinks.

1058
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,035
Hey, little guy,
have you seen any gold down here?

1059
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,910
Hey, Max, I'm counting on you
to make me a rich man.

1060
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:36,240
Lola, hypothetically speaking,

1061
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,999
what's it like to hold
25 million in your hands?

1062
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,075
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1063
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,835
Right.

1064
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,759
- Good night, old-timer.
- Eat shit.

1065
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,232
What the hell is that?

1066
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,748
There is an intruder
in Storage Facility B.

1067
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,871
- <i>Attempted break-in in progress.</i>
- Son of a bitch!

1068
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,275
<i>All security</i>
<i>to Storage Facility B.</i>

1069
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,435
<i>Hey, Max.</i>

1070
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,195
What's up?

1071
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,117
Where are you?

1072
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,549
Oh, I'm somewhere inside the ship.

1073
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,797
Oh, yeah, me too.
Thanks, that helps a lot.

1074
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:26,037
Max, did you say
you were <i>inside</i> the ship?

1075
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,149
Yeah, it's amazing.

1076
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,317
Hmm. Really?
What do you see?

1077
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:36,069
<i>It's pretty dark.</i>
<i>I think I'm in the captain's quarters.</i>

1078
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,713
That's interesting.

1079
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,988
Max, suddenly I don't feel like
having an umbrella drink.

1080
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,274
I'm beginning to think we're gonna
go home empty-handed.

1081
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,709
Where are you, Max?
I'm gonna come hunt with you a while.

1082
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,956
I'm coming to you.

1083
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,479
How you see me?
I cut the red wire.

1084
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,513
Ah, nice work, genius.
You cut the heating to the Jacuzzi.

1085
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,195
<i>Max, you at the stern?</i>

1086
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,549
<i>Max?</i>

1087
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,314
<i>Stan Lloyd to Max Burdett.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

1088
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,509
Who'd he think he was,
the Invisible Man?

1089
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,674
Dear God.

1090
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,791
Shit.

1091
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,876
It was a diversion.
Get back to the diamond!

1092
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,671
<i>Max, where are you?</i>

1093
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,039
<i>Will you answer me?</i>

1094
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,354
<i>Hello!</i>

1095
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:56,629
There!

1096
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,315
He's in the vents!
He got the diamond!

1097
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,998
Max, what was that?

1098
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,678
<i>Max!</i>

1099
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,518
I think he left his radio.

1100
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,835
I thought I heard
something else.

1101
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,715
<i>Where'd you go?</i>
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

1102
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,197
Nice costume.

1103
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,953
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1104
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,989
<i>Party all the time,</i>
<i>party all the time</i>

1105
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,429
<i>Party all the time</i>

1106
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,472
<i>My girl wants</i>
<i>to party all the time...</i>

1107
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,909
Go back to your cabin, please.

1108
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,157
Aha, there you are!

1109
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,429
Hey, Max, come on.

1110
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,631
Last night we were spooning.
Now you're running away?

1111
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,313
<i>Come on!</i>

1112
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:01,076
Yoo-hoo, Max.

1113
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,038
Oh, I get it.
A little hide-and-seek.

1114
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,872
Like I told you on the boat,
I caught 'em all.

1115
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,634
You're good,
but you're not that good.

1116
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,794
You know what they say--
the FBI always gets their man.

1117
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,593
Max!

1118
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,233
I'm having an air problem!

1119
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,032
Stan, are you okay?

1120
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,799
I can't breathe! Help!

1121
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,114
Where are you, Stan?

1122
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,513
I'm coming, Stan.

1123
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,279
It's okay, Stan.
I'm right here.

1124
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,515
Take off your mask.

1125
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,475
I got him, honey.

1126
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,033
I'm right here.

1127
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,838
You're okay, Stan.

1128
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,997
Nothing to worry about, partner.

1129
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,074
I saw my life flash
before my eyes.

1130
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,430
Leave it to me to get
the faulty regulator.

1131
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,875
You know,
I never dove before.

1132
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,432
- I would like to propose a toast.
- What are we celebrating?

1133
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,235
Retirement.

1134
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,359
- I'll drink to that.
- Good.

1135
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,355
Hello.

1136
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,314
What?

1137
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:55,589
How?

1138
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,511
- What's wrong?
- The diamond's been stolen.

1139
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,313
- What?
- Half an hour ago.

1140
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,549
You set us up.

1141
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,795
Come on.

1142
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,194
This whole thing.

1143
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,079
You got your perfect alibi-- me.

1144
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,838
Hey.

1145
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,598
Get your hands up.

1146
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,438
Are you serious?

1147
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,118
No wonder you just retired.

1148
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,232
You don't have
anything left to steal.

1149
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,873
I've got to get to the ship.

1150
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,909
You couldn't resist, could you?

1151
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,951
You had to screw me
one last time.

1152
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,514
You had to make an ass
out of me!

1153
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,354
Hey, Lola.
Lola, wait.

1154
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,195
Hey.

1155
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,477
You really did save me down there.

1156
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,316
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.
I was only trying to protect you.

1157
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,475
How generous of you.

1158
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,955
You were right, you know.
I couldn't do it without you.

1159
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,470
You gotta admit, though,
the look on Stan's face was sheer poetry.

1160
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,113
Shut up, Max.

1161
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,195
Hey.

1162
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,589
Lola, please.

1163
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,353
Max, I helped you
because I love you.

1164
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,038
But now I'm leaving you.

1165
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,598
Lola, I thought you'd
appreciate how I did it,

1166
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,553
you of all people.
Hey, hey.

1167
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,792
I do.
It was a smart plan, Max.

1168
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,990
You're a great thief.

1169
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,114
But I want a great man.

1170
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,279
Lola.

1171
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,109
Move inside.

1172
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,109
What, you thought this was over?
Turn around!

1173
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,195
I tried to deal with you
from an elevated place, man,

1174
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,595
appeal to your intellect,
spit poetry and shit at you.

1175
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,154
But no, man, you had to bring me
down to the gutter.

1176
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,315
Where is the diamond?

1177
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,954
- She's got nothing to do with this.
- Oh, she does now.

1178
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,196
You kill my dog,
I'm gonna slay your cat.

1179
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,548
Don't get--

1180
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,269
Aah!

1181
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,509
Nice throw, bitch!

1182
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,073
No!

1183
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,113
Where'd you come from?

1184
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,713
He asked me to help him steal it
a week ago. I turned him down.

1185
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,239
He must have stolen it himself,

1186
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,113
then he came back here
to make sure there were no loose ends.

1187
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,549
So why didn't you come to me,
tell me what they were planning?

1188
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,113
He said he'd kill us.

1189
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,832
You wouldn't have believed him anyway.

1190
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,916
You thought Mooré was
the Second Coming for this island.

1191
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,837
Don't tell me
what I think, woman.

1192
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,190
- Where's the diamond?
- I have no idea.

1193
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:44,232
- They were trying to frame us.
- Are we finished here?

1194
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,514
You know, I don't believe a word
of what you're saying.

1195
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,315
I know.

1196
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,114
Don't leave.

1197
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,719
Good luck, Max.

1198
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,909
Lola, wait.

1199
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,993
Hear me out.

1200
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,998
It's not gonna work, Max.
Not this time.

1201
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,351
I know it's too late,
but I finally wrote them. See?

1202
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,235
Lots of words.

1203
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,749
But I don't need to read them
because I know it by heart.

1204
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,349
I've spent my whole life chasing things
which I thought were valuable,

1205
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:58,631
when the only thing I really cared for
was right in front of me all along.

1206
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,672
You are my heart, Lola.

1207
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,314
From this moment on,
you are my only jewel.

1208
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,839
I want a life
filled with sunsets.

1209
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,390
And I never wanna watch
one of them without you, not ever.

1210
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,830
The first diamond I've ever bought.

1211
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,112
I love you, Lola Cirillo.

1212
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,228
Marry me.

1213
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,635
- On one condition.
- Anything.

1214
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,673
I want the receipt.

1215
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,555
Here you go, Luc.

1216
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,113
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1217
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,391
Jack on the rocks, with an umbrella.
What the hell, I'm celebrating.

1218
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,673
Forget the Jack on the rocks,
let's have remoras all around.

1219
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,199
Remoras all around.

1220
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,550
Stanley, what the hell
are you doing here?

1221
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,035
Well, I thought I'd stick around.

1222
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,796
Oh, yeah, look familiar?

1223
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,070
Treated myself,
maxed out the credit card.

1224
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,679
But it suits me,
don't you think?

1225
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,439
Well, it must take a bite
out of a government salary.

1226
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,391
Ah, I can afford it all right.

1227
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,159
Come on, let's sip
our remoras and talk, shall we?

1228
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,437
I thought you said
these things have a kick.

1229
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,033
Luc, what's in this?

1230
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,197
Orange juice, mango juice,
grenadine, and coconut milk.

1231
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,795
No liquor?

1232
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:01,395
<i>Nada.</i>

1233
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,310
I love these remoras!

1234
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,271
Bartender, give me another!

1235
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,475
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

1236
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:20,274
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

1237
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,719
- Max.
- Okay.

1238
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,592
You know,
I really like that cove.

1239
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,994
Are you okay?
'Cause you don't look too good.

1240
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:51,398
As an underwater enthusiast, you should
know what a remora really is, Max.

1241
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,353
A remora is
kind of a stowaway,

1242
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,792
a suckerfish that sticks
to the shark's body and feeds off it.

1243
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,478
The shark does all the work,

1244
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:03,558
but the remora gets the spoils.

1245
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,669
You did it, Stan.

1246
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,754
Right from the start.

1247
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,035
It's the only one
you two haven't stolen.

1248
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,519
You set me up.

1249
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,234
I revel in it.
I revel in it!

1250
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,869
Could it be that the great
Max Burdett has finally lost?

1251
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,075
No, I didn't.

1252
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,268
I got Lola.

1253
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,999
Congratulations, Stan.

1254
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,151
I'm looking at it right now.

1255
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,748
My plane takes off
in ten minutes.

1256
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,509
Tomorrow morning the bidding
will start at $30 million,

1257
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:09,154
and if I were you,
I'd bring cash.

1258
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,638
You win some,
you lose some.

1259
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,511
We still have the sunsets.

1260
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:25,755
Yeah.

1261
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,917
Don't worry,
one day you'll find a hobby.

1262
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,557
You know,
I think I already have.

1263
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,558
Bye-bye, paradise.

1264
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,315
No.

1265
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,953
No!

1266
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,276
Max!

1267
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,709
No, you bastard!

1268
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,957
Last time, right, Max?

1269
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,593
Last time.

1270
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,397
You son of a bitch!

1271
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,673
Max!

1272
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,594
<i>If you want it,</i>
<i>come and get it</i>

1273
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,595
<i>I've got it</i>

1274
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,869
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

1275
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,752
<i>If you need it,</i>
<i>come and get it</i>

1276
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:24,835
