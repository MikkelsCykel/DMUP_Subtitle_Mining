1
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,549
- Come on, come on, come on.
- All right, here we go.

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,112
Take a seat, buddy!

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,036
Come on. It was a good play.

4
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,429
Are you gonna be like this all day?

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,589
I don't know. Is it gonna be like this all day?

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,874
- I don't know.
- It's up to you.

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,995
- I have no room to sit.
- I got no room to sit.

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,115
I'm sitting next to a guy who's sitting

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,553
like he's at home on the toilet
with his legs spread.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,119
Please don't crowd people.
Relax, please. Look at me.

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,474
- I am relaxed.
- Look how I'm sitting.

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,630
- Why are you sitting like that?
- Because... What do you think?

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,789
Why'd you wake me up for this shit?

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,552
Because I'm trying to relax
and have a nice day.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,471
Sweating in the sun like a Tijuana whore.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,797
Ice-cold soda!

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,392
Get your soda here!

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,274
On the right. Coming down there.
Pass that on down there.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,590
Hey, hot dog guy, can I get six hot dogs
down here, please?

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,113
Right away.
And make it right, please.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,270
You know, with the mustard
and the ketchup and the relish.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,713
Don't make me hit you up for more.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,518
I thought we were going
to Wiener Circle after this.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,909
- We will.
- Then why are you getting hot dogs?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,072
Pass this down, please.
You can keep the change.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,869
Do you want one of the hot dogs?

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,632
You can have a hot...
You want a hot dog?

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,789
Do you want a hot dog, miss?

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,029
- No. Thank you.
- You can have one.

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,269
- That's okay.
- Go ahead. You can have a hot dog.

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,395
- No, I don't want one.
- Excuse me, sir?

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,754
Would you mind passing the lady
one of the hot dogs?

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,875
- I'm good, thanks.
- You don't have to share.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,598
- You can have your own.
- Thanks. That's really nice of you.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,908
- Just have one, please.
- Okay, give me a hot dog.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,833
Somebody give her a hot dog. I got...
The big guy can't eat all of them. Have one.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,751
- Have you ever had one before?
- A hot dog?

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,070
- At the ballpark?
- I have. I believe I have.

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,275
- Okay, good.
- Thank you.

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,793
- Well, enjoy this one.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,192
- Do you like mustard?
- No, I'm okay.

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,748
It's much better with a topping. Here.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,437
I'm just kidding, I'll give you two.

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,998
- Cheers!
- Thanks.

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,194
We'll share it.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,997
It's a good dog. I like the hot dog. I know.

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,829
That's nice.

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,712
You have a problem
with me eating a hot dog, guy?

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,313
I'm trying to watch the game
and have a hot dog.

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,550
- I'll smack him in his head.
- No, just leave him alone.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,197
- Hey, you want to go get a drink?
- No.

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,992
I'm with somebody, sorry.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,230
Who? The guy with
the tucked-in shirt and the visor?

54
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,993
What, is that like a brother?
The guy was not your brother, then.

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,195
- Who is this guy?
- He's not my brother.

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,191
Who's this... I'm getting mad now.
I'm jealous. Who is this guy?

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,679
- Who are you?
- I don't know. I'm kidding with you.

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,671
Who's the guy with the tucked-in stuff?
Is that a boyfriend?

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,909
Uh, it's...

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,072
- I'm going.
- Do you think you'll marry him?

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,958
- What?
- 'Cause I know you've thought about it.

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,429
The first time you laid eyes on him,
you probably thought,

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,830
"I wonder if I could marry this guy in
plaid shorts who tucks his shirt in. No way. "

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,433
Then when you kissed him,
you said, "I can't believe it.

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,080
"I had a lot to drink tonight.
I'm kissing the tucked-in guy. "

66
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,116
- My point is, if you're not gonna marry him...
- Yeah.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,595
...and if it's not forever,

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,148
then you really don't have anything to lose
in taking me up on my offer.

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,959
- Uh-huh. Well, I'm gonna go.
- Okay. Me, too.

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,917
- Okay.
- To where? On an ice-breaking first date?

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,638
- Well, no, I don't think...
- Listen.

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,517
If you want to stay off the market
while you're with

73
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,875
I'm-not-the-one-but-I'm-comfortable,
then you can do that.

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,279
But for all you know, I just offered you

75
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,749
a get-out-of-bored-love-for-free card
with no strings attached.

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,193
- God, you're crazy.
- No, I'm not crazy.

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,998
And a lot of times people go,
"Oh, that's crazy,"

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,354
and then they go, "It's genius. "

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,032
That's what happened
when the person invented fire.

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,078
They burned that witch. And guess what,
then they got warm and they ate good stuff.

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,878
Now, where are we headed to?
Let's not make this weird,

82
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,279
- 'cause I'm not good on dates.
- No. You know what?

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,157
I'm better just to kind of hang out and,
if we don't have fun,

84
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,275
- I might go my separate way.
- Okay.

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,794
I'm not committing to anything.
I'll go hang out with you for a little bit.

86
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,632
- That's not gonna happen.
- But I can't say for sure.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,313
<i>All right, all right, everybody.
Welcome to Three Brothers Bus Tours.</i>

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,278
<i>I'm brother number two.
It's good to have you here.</i>

89
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,316
<i>That's right, there's plenty
of seats here up front.</i>

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,676
<i>I promise I won't bite. I'm not a biter.
I'm psyched to have you here.</i>

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,070
<i>Okay, a couple quick ground rules.
Please don't jump off the bus.</i>

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,388
<i>Weird. Not fun for anybody.</i>

93
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,391
<i>Also, no throwing objects at pedestrians,</i>

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,232
<i>unless, of course, they deserve it. Okay?</i>

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,153
<i>We are not at work today.
We are on vacation today.</i>

96
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,310
<i>And if you can't blow it
out here on the big funny bus,</i>

97
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,913
<i>where the hell can you?</i>

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,116
<i>I do split the tips
with my driver, Shondra.</i>

99
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,713
<i>We don't want her back out turning tricks.</i>

100
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,031
<i>That was a weird time for everyone.
Seriously. Honest to God.</i>

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,350
<i>And I was a customer. Long time ago.</i>

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,749
<i>Come on, everybody, let's get loose!</i>

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,915
<i>I'm gonna ask you once.
Show me that you mean it.</i>

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,753
<i>Don't make me ask you twice.
Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

105
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,151
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?</i>

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,118
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Shondra, put this baby in the air.</i>

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,112
<i>Let's get the blood flowing.
Let's get everyone up and let's loosen it up.</i>

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,519
<i>Coming up here, you're gonna notice</i>

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,478
<i>one of the only buildings
to survive the fire of 1871.</i>

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,950
<i>That is the original Chicago Water Tower
and Pumping Station.</i>

111
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,390
Happy Holidays.
Marilyn Dean Gallery.

112
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,436
The artist was inspired
by the neoclassical movement.

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,555
No, she doesn't.

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,279
But wanted to reflect it
with an abstract bent.

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,395
Okay, bye-bye.

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,789
- And how much is it?
- $35,000.

117
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,429
Happy Holidays. Marilyn Dean Gallery.
Hold, please.

118
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,592
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Sure. Go ahead.

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,189
- Christopher?
- Yes, sweetie.

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,474
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

121
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,988
- Christmas was months ago.
- Don't remind me. I miss it so much.

122
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,792
Yeah, I know. But today is not a holiday.

123
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,673
I know for a fact that people like
my spirit on the phone

124
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,478
and they dig the energy that I give them.

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,269
Okay. I'm just saying, I don't think
Marilyn Dean will "dig" the energy.

126
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
Oh, no. She's the one that told me
to be creative. So...

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,554
I know. It's just... Okay.
What is the next holiday coming?

128
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,073
The Fourth of July, is that what's next?

129
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,752
Well, if you want to get technical,
there's Memorial Day,

130
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,751
there's Flag Day.

131
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,479
Some people recognise Father's Day
as a holiday. I don't.

132
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,917
I get it. I get it. Well, on those days
you can say, "Happy Holidays. "

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,150
Every other day,
"Good morning, good afternoon,

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,435
"good evening, Marilyn Dean Gallery. " Okay?

135
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,115
Okay.

136
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,952
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

137
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,555
So, now this is a new piece by Zakrzewska.

138
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,392
What do you think of this?

139
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,911
- Can I be honest with you?
- Please.

140
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,749
Other than taking
an art history class in college,

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,675
which I pretty much slept through,
I don't have the first clue about art

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,275
or how to go about buying it.
I mean, like that painting.

143
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,153
I mean, I don't see the point in buying
something that I could have done myself.

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,189
Yeah. I completely agree with you.

145
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,597
You know, an art teacher of mine once said,

146
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,990
"Never buy a piece of art
that you don't have to have. "

147
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,396
You know, don't worry about who
the artist is or how much it's worth.

148
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,189
I mean, you have to live with it every day.
You have to walk by it every day.

149
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,670
You know, you have to really love it.
You have to really appreciate it.

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,432
It's kind of like picking a mate.

151
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,238
- Hey, honey!
- Hi.

152
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,151
- How's it going?
- It's good.

153
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,390
- Oh, wow. You got a lot happening.
- I know.

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,153
- Very exciting.
- I am starving.

155
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,993
- Oh, careful. That's really... That's very hot.
- Oh, that's hot, hot, hot.

156
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,559
- Yep.
- Jesus.

157
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,598
Hey, honey, you've got to really...
You should get ready, okay?

158
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,113
- Oh, you look great.
- Thank you.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,475
Got a lot of nice stuff. Got a pizza.

160
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,517
- All kinds of stuff.
- Terrific.

161
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,149
I just need you to decide what to...
You know, I did everything.

162
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,879
- Gary?
- Yeah?

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,672
- Oh, come on! Really?
- You got three lemons.

164
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,950
What my baby wants, my baby gets.
You know that.

165
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,508
Yeah, but I wanted 12. Baby wanted 12.

166
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,716
Why would you want 12 lemons?

167
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,470
Because I'm making a 12-lemon centrepiece.

168
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,472
So, no one's actually even eating them?
They're just show lemons?

169
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,870
Yeah. They're just show lemons.
Shown in the centre of the table.

170
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,029
I'm glad you find that amusing,

171
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,236
but I cannot fill a vase
with only three lemons.

172
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,629
Well, can't you just use, like,
maybe a drinking glass?

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,755
I'm not gonna use a drinking...

174
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,432
We could have a smaller version
of a centrepiece.

175
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,431
I'm not gonna use a drinking glass
for our centrepiece.

176
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,555
You know what? I've got an idea.

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,677
Why don't we go ahead and scratch
the centrepiece idea altogether,

178
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,512
because the chicken that burnt my mouth

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,431
could maybe use
a little bit of lemon on top of it.

180
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,832
Guess what? Now we've made a better meal
versus something visually nice to look at.

181
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,590
What are you do... What's happening here?
What are you doing?

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,749
What are you doing?

183
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,273
Oh, I had such a long day on the bus.

184
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,430
I need a little bit of down time.
My feet are killing me.

185
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,351
- Gary, come on, my feet are killing me, too.
- I'm exhausted.

186
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,317
I worked all day. Went to the market.

187
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,631
I cleaned this entire condo and then
I've been cooking for the last three hours.

188
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,756
Come on. Help set the table.

189
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,435
- Sweetheart.
- What?

190
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,557
You've done such a great job already.
Don't you want to finish it yourself

191
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,029
and have that personal power
of that accomplishment?

192
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,872
- Set the table.
- Listen to me.

193
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,997
Do you think that when Michelangelo, right,

194
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,548
was painting the Sixteenth Chapel,
that he said,

195
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,234
"Hey, guys, you know, I did pretty good
on the first 15 chapels,

196
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,356
"but why don't you help me
design this one?

197
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,396
"And maybe you could help me...
Give me a brush

198
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,472
"and you guys can grab brushes,
and we can all make a great chapel. " Uh-uh.

199
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,597
No, he didn't.
And you wanna know what the results were?

200
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,999
A masterpiece.

201
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,559
Okay.
It's the Sistine Chapel, not the Sixteenth,

202
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,031
and I bet when Michelangelo asked
for 12 brushes, they didn't bring him three.

203
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,588
Yeah. Okay, all the talking
is really starting to drain me,

204
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,672
and now I'm gonna have to watch the
highlights later to see what I missed here.

205
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,079
- Honey, look, Gary, just...
- Down time's important.

206
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,991
- Gary, please just take a shower, okay?
- Down time's important.

207
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,274
'Cause this is what
I don't want to have happen.

208
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,397
I don't want the doorbell to ring.
I'm then forced to answer the door,

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,357
entertain people,
and I'm still cooking dinner.

210
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,475
- Yeah.
- Okay?

211
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,314
You're absolutely right. Let's do that.
The second that this inning's over...

212
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,833
- Gary.
- There's one out all ready.

213
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,194
They're gonna be here in 20 minutes.

214
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,589
Baby, have you ever seen a shower of mine
take more than four minutes?

215
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,715
Yes, I have. Come on.

216
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,915
Oh, great!

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,230
They're here. Okay.
Table's not set. Dinner's not ready.

218
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,594
Would you please just let my parents in?

219
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,113
- I gotta jump in the shower.
- What?

220
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,599
I gotta go.

221
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,238
Gary. Gary.

222
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,640
Well, seeing how our families
haven't had many opportunities

223
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,077
to get to know one another, we figured,
what better way than to break some bread?

224
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,357
So, everyone, thank you for coming
and enjoy the meal.

225
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,715
- Cheers.
- Cheers, honey.

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,437
- Mrs Grobowski. Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

227
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,988
Cheer with the sons.
Sweetheart, cheers to you.

228
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,155
Darling, I see that you put
those Feng Shui books

229
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,310
that I sent to you to good use.

230
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,834
- This place is so well balanced.
- Thanks, Mom.

231
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,797
Yeah, the energy in this place
is just amazing.

232
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,869
Yes.

233
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,554
Well, the energy in the condo
might be a little more amazing

234
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,392
if we had a pool table.

235
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,758
Gary, we've already discussed that.

236
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,515
We're gonna get a pool table
when we get a bigger place.

237
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,670
The place is plenty big now,
if you wanted a pool table because...

238
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,557
- Gary.
- Yeah. You could take the dining room table,

239
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,709
go ahead and move her in the living room.

240
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,869
Really?
Plenty of room.

241
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,110
And put a dining room table
in the living room? Okay.

242
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,558
How do you... I mean, what do you do
with a dining room table?

243
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,471
- Eat on it.
- We'd have no furniture in the living...

244
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,073
- Where's the furniture go?
- All I'm saying is,

245
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,559
it would be nice
to be able to shoot some pool.

246
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,596
- Well, this isn't a dorm.
- Look, baby, I completely understand.

247
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,113
There's halls and stuff. I mean, you can go...

248
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,714
We will wait and get a pool table
when we have a bigger place.

249
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,074
Thank you.

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,279
- The food is outstanding.
- It is delicious food.

251
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,395
It's outstanding.

252
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,277
Yeah, it really is nice.
- Okay, everybody.

253
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,238
- Time for the joke of the day. Knock, knock.
- Dad. Dad, come on.

254
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,548
- Who's there?
- Norma Lee.

255
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,709
Norma Lee, who?

256
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,234
Normally, I don't go around
knocking on doors,

257
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,958
but would you like to buy
an encyclopaedia?

258
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,109
I got a joke. I got a joke.

259
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,072
How's it going? I got a joke for you.

260
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,709
What do you get when you cross
a gay Eskimo and a black guy?

261
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,239
All right, look, I think we've had enough
with the jokes for tonight.

262
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,470
Thank you, though.
Let's just talk with each other.

263
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,595
All right.

264
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,240
<i>I saw that Three Brothers
article in the Trib this week.</i>

265
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,709
Sounds like you guys are up
to some pretty exciting stuff.

266
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,510
Basically, our big goal is to try to
take Chicago tourism by air, land and sea.

267
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,910
We're still in the ground
phase with the buses.

268
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,753
But as soon as we get
our infantry established,

269
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,071
- then we'll take it to the squids.
- Yeah.

270
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,510
- Boats. Boats.
- Oh, boats.

271
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,592
As soon as we control the waterway,
then we'll bring in air supports

272
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,399
and then we'll pretty much
control everything.

273
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,272
You know, Dennis,

274
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,035
the way your face lights up
when you describe your ambitions,

275
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,872
it's really inspiring.

276
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,835
- Oh, thanks.
- Because I understand

277
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,639
how you feel that passion.

278
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,191
And sharing it with other people,
I think that's what life's about.

279
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,397
I don't feel that about boats and squibs...
Squids?

280
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,549
- Squids.
- Sorry.

281
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,871
- Yeah.
- But I do feel it about singing.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,515
<i>With my a cappella group,
The Tone Rangers.</i>

283
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,714
Although it's not
as aggressive as your dream,

284
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,588
it's really more of a brotherhood.
It's like a musical team.

285
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,397
It's like a symphony of guys.
Guy symphony.

286
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,991
And it's very hard to describe the true magic

287
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,115
of a group of guys
singing in perfect harmony.

288
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,192
It's transcendent.

289
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,556
But it's still very real.

290
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,437
I guess the best way
to put it in words is just...

291
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,192
Even that doesn't do it.

292
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,352
That doesn't do it
because that's just one person.

293
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,512
And what I'm talking about is
the pulse of the collective.

294
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,671
Oh, heck.
Let me just show you how it's done.

295
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,273
Dad, how about a little percussion?

296
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,032
- Tap-tap-tappy.
- Tap-tap-tappy.

297
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,634
And, Mom, high-hat.

298
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,113
Good, Mom.
Excellent. And Gary!

299
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,789
On the kick drum!
Come, come! On the kick drum! Come, come!

300
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,639
That's Gary! Come,
come with the kick drum. Come!

301
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,269
Come, come with the kick drum.
Gary, on the kick drum. Come, come.

302
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,035
That's Gary on the kick drum.
Go! And Gary. In the house.

303
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,155
- Come, come.
- I'm not with you.

304
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,470
Come, come. With the kick drum.
Come, come.

305
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,118
I'm just not really
the kick drum kind of guy.

306
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,476
I'd rather be just a listener and enjoy
all the banging that he's doing and the...

307
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,791
You know, Gary, that's your prerogative.
That's your right, to listen.

308
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,110
Meantime, I've gotta talk
to Brooke about something.

309
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,838
- It's called the bass line. Excuse me.
- Okay.

310
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,394
Good, Carol.

311
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,348
Good, Brooke.

312
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,593
Yes, Dennis.

313
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,112
- Be nice.
Totally awesome.

314
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,278
<i>Move yourself</i>

315
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,157
<i>You always live your life</i>

316
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,477
<i>Never thinking of the future</i>

317
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,278
<i>Prove yourself</i>

318
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,952
<i>You are the move you make</i>

319
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,157
<i>Take your chances
win or loser</i>

320
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,151
<i>See yourself</i>

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,152
<i>You're every step you take</i>

322
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,073
<i>You and you
and that's the only way</i>

323
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,195
<i>Shake
Shake!</i>

324
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,269
<i>Shake yourself</i>

325
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,873
<i>You're every move you make</i>

326
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,555
<i>So the story goes</i>

327
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,834
Thank you so much.

328
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,433
Okay, bye.
Thank you so much.

329
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,033
- It was great to see you.
- Okay. Come on.

330
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,439
- Have a good night.
- It was really nice, Gary.

331
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,431
- Nice to see you. You, too.
- Good to see you guys.

332
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,794
- Thanks, Brookie.
- Oh, honey. Thank you, sweetie.

333
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,348
- You're still my favourite singer.
- Stop it.

334
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,319
Love you, sis. And I'd love for you
to come to a live performance

335
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,437
of The Tone Rangers singing live.
That's something you'd really enjoy.

336
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,555
- It was good seeing you.
- Okay.

337
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,675
- Thank you.
- All right.

338
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,876
- Bye, darling. Thank you for such a...
- Okay. Okay, Mom.

339
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,837
- We'll see you soon.
- Bye, dear. Thanks, darling.

340
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,148
- See you later.
- Okay, buddy.

341
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,356
Oh, now, are you sure
that we can't help you clean up?

342
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,396
- No, no. I think we're gonna be great. We'll...
- Yes?

343
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,913
So nice of you to offer, but we got it.
Thank you.

344
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,319
- Oh, it was such fun.
- Great.

345
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,914
- I love you.
- Great to see you.

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,353
- Good night, sweetie.
- Thank you so much.

347
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,829
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

348
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,114
- All right, guys.
- Bye-bye.

349
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,394
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks for coming.

350
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,078
Love you, too.

351
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,593
<i>Are you blind?</i>

352
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,550
<i>Oh, no, no! My demos!</i>

353
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,829
- Well, I'm gonna go do the dishes.
- Cool.

354
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,429
- It'd be nice if you helped me.
- Damn it.

355
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,555
<i>Way to go!</i>

356
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,870
No problem. I'll get them a little bit later.

357
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,871
I'm just gonna hit the streets here
for a little bit.

358
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,075
Gary, come on, I don't want to do them later.

359
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,832
Let's just do them now. It'll take 15 minutes.

360
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,798
Honey, I am so exhausted.
I just honestly want to relax for a little bit.

361
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,395
If I could just sit here,
let my food digest,

362
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,393
and just try to enjoy the quiet for a little bit.

363
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,988
Get some! Get some! Get some!
That's what happens.

364
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,310
And we will... You know,
we can clean the dishes tomorrow.

365
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,675
Gary, you know I don't like
waking up to a dirty kitchen.

366
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,115
- Who cares?
- I care! All right? I care!

367
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,995
I busted my ass all day cleaning this house
and then cooking that meal.

368
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,355
And I worked today.
It would be nice if you said thank you

369
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,032
and helped me with the dishes.

370
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,032
- Fine. I'll help you do the damn dishes.
- Oh, come on. You know what?

371
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,599
No. See? That's not what I want.

372
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,671
You just said that you want me
to help you do the dishes.

373
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,833
- I want you to want to do the dishes.
- Why would I want to do dishes?

374
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,509
- Why?
- See, that's my whole point.

375
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,278
Let me see if I'm following this, okay?
Are you telling me that you're upset

376
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,316
because I don't have
a strong desire to clean dishes?

377
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,915
No. I'm upset because you don't have
a strong desire to offer to do the dishes.

378
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,230
- I just did.
- After I asked you!

379
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,949
- Jesus, Brooke, you're acting crazy again.
- Don't you call me crazy. I am not crazy.

380
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,314
- I didn't call you crazy.
- You just did.

381
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,435
I didn't call you... No, I didn't.

382
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,397
- I said you're acting crazy.
- You know what, Gary?

383
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,675
I asked you to do one thing today,
one very simple thing,

384
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,751
to bring me 12 lemons
and you brought me three.

385
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,877
God damn it. If I knew that
it was gonna be this much trouble,

386
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,349
I would have brought home 24 lemons.
Even 100 lemons.

387
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,749
You know what I wish? I wish everyone
that was at that goddamn table

388
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,319
had their own little private bag of lemons.

389
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,515
- Honest to God!
- Gary, it's not about the lemons.

390
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,715
Well, that's all you're talking about.

391
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,155
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you did
things that I asked.

392
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,471
It would be even nicer if you did things
without me having to ask you!

393
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,798
Well, I do seem to remember
doing something for you this morning

394
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,154
without you asking.

395
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,470
- Gary, come on.
- What? I'm serious. Come here.

396
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,391
- You know what? I'm serious. I really am.
- I am, too.

397
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,552
Come on. You knew I was working today
and I made that meal.

398
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,996
And you could have thought to yourself,
you know, you could have said,

399
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,833
"Yeah, I think I'm gonna
get Brooke some flowers. "

400
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,112
You said on our very first date
that you don't like flowers,

401
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,633
that they're a waste of money.

402
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,474
Every girl likes flowers, Gary.

403
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,709
You said that you don't like flowers.

404
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,916
I'm supposed to take that to mean
that you do like flowers?

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,639
No. This is not about... You're not...
God, you're not getting it.

406
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,950
You're not getting this, Gary, okay?
It's not about the lemons.

407
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,270
It's not about the flowers.
It's not about the dishes.

408
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,636
It's just about... How many times
do I have to drop hints about the ballet?

409
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,870
You know I can't stand... Brooke, come here.

410
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,157
We've talked about the damn ballet.
I hate the goddamn ballet!

411
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,800
You got a bunch of dudes
in tights flopping around for three hours.

412
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,711
It's like a medieval techno show.
It's a nightmare.

413
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,358
I sit there in a sweat. The whole thing, I do,

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,431
wondering when the hell's the
goddamn nightmare gonna end.

415
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,988
- Go to a damn ballet.
- It's not about you loving the ballet, Gary.

416
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,196
It's about the person that you love
loves the ballet

417
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,157
and you wanting to spend time
with that person.

418
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,275
Not when they're at the ballet.

419
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,316
- Okay. Forget the ballet! Forget the ballet!
- I will.

420
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,516
We don't go anywhere together.

421
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,551
- We just went to Ann Arbor together.
- To Ann Arbor.

422
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,517
To the Michigan-Notre Dame game.

423
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,917
You think screaming, drunk kids
and leprechauns doing backflips, that's fun.

424
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,912
That's fun for me. Come on, man.
I did that for you.

425
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,399
What do you... How do you show up for me?

426
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,994
I'm up on the bus
every goddamn day for you!

427
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,593
- Come on. You...
- I'm busting my ass

428
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,557
to be the best tour guide in the damn city,

429
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,596
so I can make enough money
to support both of us

430
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,318
and hopefully you won't
have to work one day.

431
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,470
- I want to work.
- All I ask, Brooke,

432
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,551
is that you show a little bit of appreciation.

433
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,074
That I just get 20 minutes
to relax when I come home,

434
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,715
instead of being attacked with questions
and nagged the whole damn time.

435
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,439
- You think that I nag you?
- That's all you do!

436
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,919
All you do is nag me!

437
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,036
"The bathroom's a mess. "
"Your belt doesn't match. "

438
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,031
"Hey, Gary, you should
probably go work out. "

439
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,031
Nothing I ever do is ever good enough!

440
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,998
I just want to be left the hell alone!

441
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,990
Really? Is that what you want, Gary?

442
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,354
- Is that what you want?
- Yeah.

443
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,429
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

444
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,272
Fine. Great. Do whatever the hell you want.

445
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,272
You leave your socks all over this house,
dress like a pig,

446
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,871
play your stupid-ass video game.
I don't care, I'm done.

447
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,350
- What?
- I'm done! I don't deserve this.

448
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,115
I really do not deserve this.
I deserve somebody who gives a shit.

449
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,716
I'm not spending one more second
of this life with some inconsiderate prick!

450
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,479
You're a prick!

451
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,471
Addie, it just became so clear tonight

452
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,232
how much he takes me for granted.

453
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,070
<i>- What happened?
Just the same old shit.</i>

454
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,230
I asked him to do one thing
and he didn't do it.

455
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,278
Then he complained
that he had to do anything,

456
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,828
and I just felt like I had no choice.

457
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,399
No, sweetie, you did have a choice, okay?

458
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,472
And it sounds like you made the right one.
You respected yourself.

459
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,831
But it's just not what I want.
I don't want to break up with him.

460
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,834
I don't. I just want him to say thank you.
I want him to want to do the dishes.

461
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,514
I just want him to want
to take me to the ballet.

462
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,997
I want him to get me 12 lemons! You know...

463
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,270
I just want him to care enough
about this relationship to want to work on it.

464
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,358
Okay, you know what?
I'm putting on my shoes

465
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,795
- and I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes.
- No, Ad. Don't.

466
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,235
Please, I really don't want to see anybody.
I really don't.

467
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,594
But, look, I'm worried about you, okay?

468
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,796
And I can hear you in there
banging around your dishes.

469
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,553
And I don't want you getting out your Clorox
and your rubber gloves,

470
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,438
- and taking this out on the kitchen.
- Look, look, look.

471
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,796
Okay. Tonight just...
It just got a little out of hand,

472
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,834
and hopefully he's just gonna realise

473
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,196
that he's got some changes
to make and he's gonna...

474
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,875
He's gonna come home and apologise.

475
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,839
Okay? That's what's gonna happen.

476
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,872
I feel like, I don't... You know, like,
you dress however you want to dress.

477
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,234
You know, do whatever you want to do.

478
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,355
- I'm done with the relationship.
- Whatever.

479
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,510
So, it's just kind of,
"You're done with the relationship?"

480
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,953
Well, you're obviously hurt about it.

481
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,439
- She got to you. You're hurt.
- I'm not.

482
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,999
It's nothing to be ashamed of. She hurt you.

483
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,195
Will you look at me? I'm not heartbroken.

484
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,508
I'm a little shocked. I'm a little surprised.

485
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,273
Gary, you're devastated. Now, what's
the name of the guy she's doing?

486
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,998
I'm gonna solve your problem.
What's his name?

487
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,116
- What are you talking about?
- Have you checked her e-mail?

488
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,235
I don't check e-mails. I don't...

489
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,878
You can get a programme
that records keystrokes.

490
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,349
It costs, like, 20 bucks.
Very easy to use. Okay?

491
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,750
You get a password, you check her e-mail.
You find out everything about her.

492
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,068
That's how I found out
about the Puerto Rican

493
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,673
- that Stacy was running around with.
- Okay.

494
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,671
You are reading a little too much
into this situation.

495
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,318
There is no one she's
running around with, okay?

496
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,719
We had a fight over the groceries
I brought home.

497
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,756
You're probably right.
She's probably not sleeping with anybody.

498
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,068
- No. Not what it's about.
- Okay.

499
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,639
- Maybe she's with another guy, maybe not.
- She's not.

500
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,029
I don't know. I'm not Columbo. Okay?

501
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,510
But what we do know is that
she doesn't want to be with you anymore.

502
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,516
I mean, I hate to be shitty about it,
and so cut and dry, but let's face it.

503
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,512
She says she doesn't want to be with you,
and I believe her.

504
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,511
Now, we gotta figure it out.
And you're gonna need a place to go

505
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,670
and lick your wounds while
you get your head right over this thing.

506
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,829
I don't need a place to go
and lick my wounds.

507
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,955
You're gonna stay with me.

508
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,234
- I'm not gonna hear it.
- Look it...

509
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,231
- I'm not moving out of the place.
- Oh, you're not moving out.

510
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,151
No. I put money in the place.
I put half my money in the place.

511
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,470
You're obviously not
the one calling the shots in this case.

512
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,471
Yeah, but I own the place.

513
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,675
- With her.
- Yeah.

514
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,432
But it's not up to her who gets to keep
the goddamn place.

515
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,556
If you find out who she's sleeping with,
maybe we could leverage it.

516
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,198
- I want you to listen to me.
- You listen to me.

517
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,554
- I'm gonna leave you a key.
- I don't need a key.

518
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,834
- Why?
- 'Cause she's gonna put...

519
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,273
She's gonna move out of the place, Johnny.

520
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,715
- Did she say she was moving out?
- She will. She's gonna move out.

521
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,358
Oh, she's... I'm gonna keep the place.

522
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,873
I'm not moving out of the place.

523
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,313
I'll leave you a key.

524
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,116
- Hey, how's it going?
I almost got it.

525
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,952
- Yeah.
- You know, I was thinking.

526
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,314
You know what you should do,

527
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,197
is you should find somebody
who looks like Brooke,

528
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,510
but even hotter and, you know,
bang the shit out of her.

529
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,114
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What?

530
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,752
- Logs.
- Just fix the damn engine.

531
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,274
- I am fixing the goddamn engine.
- I need your tour logs.

532
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,952
I'm off the clock, okay?

533
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,113
Well, I cannot file the quarterlies
until I have your log.

534
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,156
I'm going through a little bit of a
life change here, Dennis.

535
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,869
I would really appreciate
a little bit of sensitivity, please.

536
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,759
I know they're both French,
but that has nothing to do with it.

537
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,549
Because Manet was earlier and... No. Monet
and Manet are very different things.

538
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,834
I'm sorry, I beg to differ.

539
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,229
Excuse me, sir, can I have her
call you back personally?

540
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,675
Yes. Okay, thank you. Sorry. Brooke?

541
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,949
- I am so sorry.
- What?

542
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,715
Come here.

543
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,478
Oh, honey, your mom called
and told me everything.

544
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,834
Oh, Jesus.

545
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,516
Good morning, Marilyn.

546
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,075
Morning. I'll go water the plants.

547
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,273
I understand you had a long night.
Tell me everything.

548
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,713
"Everything. "
I couldn't possibly...

549
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,358
Then don't. My time is pressing.

550
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,715
What I want is for you
to take the rest of the day off.

551
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,756
Oh, no. No, that's not necessary.

552
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,039
Who am I?

553
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,990
- Marilyn Dean.
- And where are we?

554
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,349
- The Marilyn Dean Gallery.
- And of whom is that portrait?

555
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,676
- That is Marilyn Dean.
- Yeah.

556
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,957
You know, your personal life
is your personal life.

557
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,119
But you look like shit.
And when you look like shit,

558
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,351
Marilyn Dean looks like shit,
and now it is my business.

559
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,228
And when it comes to my business,
I don't like anything that's distracting.

560
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,309
So, I want you to take
the rest of the day off to be sad

561
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,756
and then come back to work tomorrow
ready to take care of business.

562
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,435
Got it?

563
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,032
Oh, hey, Brooke. How are you?

564
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,751
What the hell are you doing?

565
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,594
Well, my whole life, I always wanted
my own place with my own pool table.

566
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,079
I finally got my own place,

567
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,391
but you would not allow me
to have a pool table.

568
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,033
I just kind of figured I'd rectify that today.
And it does feel good.

569
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,749
I'm gonna go ahead and put the four ball
in the corner pocket.

570
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,989
Nice.

571
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,197
I'm sorry, can I...
A little room for the shooter, please?

572
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,840
It's hard to shoot with someone standing...
Thank you.

573
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,788
Wow.

574
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,191
Well, I guess he feels threatened that
you broke up with him and he's acting out.

575
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,112
Okay, look, Brooke, men are like children.
You know? And they...

576
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,270
Sweetie, it's a figure of
speech. It's Brooke. And I love you so much.

577
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,956
And you're my man and you know that.
You're amazing. I love you.

578
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,477
<i>Listen, and they're gonna test boundaries
to see what they can get away with.</i>

579
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,516
<i>I think there's three things
that Gary needs to know.</i>

580
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,833
One, this type of behaviour is not unnoticed.
Two, it's not acceptable.

581
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,913
And three, you know,
you're definitely not gonna tolerate it. Right?

582
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,309
Yes.

583
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,472
<i>And Brooke, remember, we're always
owning our actions, right?</i>

584
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,074
<i>And we're always healthy with it, yes?</i>

585
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,314
Yes.

586
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,830
I don't wanna finish the game.
I got showings, okay?

587
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,911
I gotta buy the cookie spray.
I gotta clean up the dog.

588
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,514
And now I'm really leaving
'cause I don't want to hear that. Okay?

589
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,795
Thank you for the pool.
Thank you for the snacks.

590
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,908
- I'm going to get a cab.
- I'll split it with you.

591
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,031
What are you, 12?
Brooke, that is not healthy.

592
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,111
- I'm trying to make a point.
- And what is that point?

593
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,589
My point's your point. Your three points.

594
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,673
That it's not unnoticed,
that it was not acceptable,

595
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,234
and that it would definitely not be tolerated.

596
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,992
Not exactly what I meant.

597
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,799
Unbelievable.

598
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,598
- I knew it!
- Hey, gang.

599
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,319
Found my shirt on the floor.
Thanks for laying it out.

600
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,478
- Gary, are you here for couples bowling?
- Yeah.

601
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,357
Well, don't you think
you and I should discuss something first?

602
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,670
Like what?
How your 47 average is killing us?

603
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,228
Okay. Great. No.

604
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,393
Gary, this is couples bowling.
And since you and I are no longer a couple,

605
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,312
because you have chosen

606
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,154
not to participate constructively
in our relationship,

607
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,912
we're now singles.

608
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,436
So, there's not room
for two singles on the team.

609
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,717
Why do you look confused?

610
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,873
I don't have any idea what's happening.
I've come to play on the team.

611
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,633
Look, Gary, I just don't think
it's a good idea

612
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,393
for you and I to be around each other
any more than we have to right now.

613
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,516
I completely agree.
Maybe you should go play some pinball.

614
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,478
- No, I think you should leave.
- Okay.

615
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,470
Brooke, when a man makes a commitment
to a team, he honours that commitment.

616
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,994
He doesn't let emotions or personal issues
get in the way of victory.

617
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,389
And I've made a commitment to this team.

618
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,950
- They don't want you here either, Gary.
- Yeah. Sure, they don't.

619
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,712
They don't. They're my friends.

620
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,315
- But you're not a strong bowler.
- That's not the point.

621
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,671
You know what? Let's just...
Why don't we let them decide?

622
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,196
Gary, don't. No. Don't involve them, okay?
That's unnecessary.

623
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,952
- What's wrong, Castro?
- Castro?

624
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,712
Well, Castro doesn't
let people vote as a team.

625
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,836
- Okay. Ask them.
- Thank you.

626
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,468
Okay, everyone. Team vote here.

627
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,877
By a show of hands,
just put it up when you make a decision,

628
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,755
who here agrees with Brooke
and thinks I should leave the bowling team?

629
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,354
Shocker.

630
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,917
<i>Band of Brothers.
You should rent it sometime.</i>

631
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,029
Good luck, everyone.
Riding Miss Gutter Ball to the finals.

632
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,319
- Hey, Gary.
- Yeah.

633
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,993
- I'm gonna need your shirt back.
- What?

634
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,711
Well, we're gonna have to replace you,
and you know we get docked 10 pins

635
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,439
if everyone's not in matching
Pin Shakers uniforms.

636
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,351
- My shirt says "Gary" on it.
- Granted.

637
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,591
But actually, we know a guy named Gary.

638
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,795
And he's not as tall as you,
but he's a pretty good bowler.

639
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,752
I'm gonna have to request
that I have my wrist guard back then.

640
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,031
I'm sorry. That's mine.

641
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,074
Just give me the goddamn wrist guard,
please. Thank you.

642
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,037
I hope your wrist snaps.

643
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,876
Wow. Okay? You see that?
You know what I mean?

644
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,473
Yeah. That was awesome.

645
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,074
You just had your ex-boyfriend,
who you wish you were still dating,

646
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,116
voted off the bowling team.

647
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,350
Well, I had to do that to get him
right where I want him.

648
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,158
Where's that? Shirtless in the parking lot?

649
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,515
Addie, you're not getting this.

650
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,031
Gary loves this bowling team.
He's hurt right now.

651
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,633
He's feeling pretty bad.

652
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,314
He's gonna go out there
and he's gonna get drunk.

653
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,868
He's gonna make a complete fool of himself.

654
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,315
And he will be sitting there
feeling pretty lonely

655
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,517
and pretty pathetic,
and then it's just gonna hit him.

656
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,032
What's gonna hit him?

657
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,753
That not only is he out a girlfriend,

658
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,193
but his life is just falling apart piece by piece

659
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,032
and maybe that life was pretty great.

660
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,793
And maybe I was the glue
that was holding it all together.

661
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,359
And if he wants that life back,

662
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,034
he's gonna have no choice but to change.

663
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,956
- How about this, huh?
- I feel like we just found hell.

664
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,951
When did you start coming
to knobby joints like this?

665
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,996
I might be the greatest you've ever seen, pal.

666
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,389
I'm conquering new frontiers. Hello, babe.

667
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,869
Yeah, you've got to put up
with the bad music and the $15 drinks,

668
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,952
but this place is stacked
with top-shelf, young, dumb ass.

669
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,190
All you gotta do is just
separate the weaker ones from the herd.

670
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,429
Come on, I'll get you into the VIP.

671
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,192
- Can I get a couple drinks from you?
- Okay, L.G.

672
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,316
Lupus, I got to be totally...
I got to be honest with you.

673
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,469
I'm not feeling it here.

674
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,879
You're gonna like it in here.
You're gonna love it.

675
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,951
- I don't like it out here.
- Look, listen to me, will you, please?

676
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,109
How you doing, Buzz?

677
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,316
While you were on the inside
locked up for the past two years,

678
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,594
the game has changed.

679
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,835
Do you remember
when you were an outdoor cat

680
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,390
and you used to have to hunt
and kill for your food?

681
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,833
Well, you've become an indoor cat.

682
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,353
You've been getting your milk brought to you

683
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,509
in a silver bowl, and guess what?

684
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,158
Now, you've been tossed back outside

685
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,277
and the alley has changed.
For example, your MTV generation,

686
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,158
your technology, your text message,
your TiVo. You name it.

687
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,310
People want their information faster.

688
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,278
People e-mail each other because
they want to exchange information, Gar.

689
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,828
They don't want to connect,
they want results.

690
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,470
- Okay.
- You gotta get to the message quicker.

691
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,471
Now, I want you to watch.
It's real simple. Okay?

692
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,754
How you doing, ladies?

693
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,875
Now, here's what I'd like to do to you.

694
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,235
First, I'd like to get you naked.

695
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,878
And then I'm gonna take some Saran Wrap

696
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,598
and I'm gonna wrap you up in it, head to toe.

697
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,715
Then I'm gonna cut out two holes.

698
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,597
One for your mouth,
so you can breathe, obviously.

699
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,749
- And the other one...
- Asshole.

700
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,398
It could be a gorgeous evening for us, babe.

701
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,674
The pink is gorgeous. Jesus, God.

702
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,591
Come here. Lupus, listen to me.
I want you to listen to me.

703
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,908
There are our drinks. You want your drink?

704
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,036
- No, I'm fine.
- Thank you. The L.G. Thanks you.

705
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,998
Will you listen to me, please?
You're my brother and I love you very much,

706
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,469
and maybe you do get laid tonight,
but maybe you get arrested.

707
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,596
Arrested for what, babe? Being awesome?

708
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,116
Come on, babe, listen.
You want to tell your jokes, tell your jokes.

709
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,670
But sooner or later you're gonna get hungry
and you're gonna wanna eat.

710
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,476
And jokes might make you feel better,
but they don't get you fed.

711
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,152
I'm gonna go take a lap.

712
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,393
- What are you doing?
- I'm sketching.

713
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,671
And where are you sketching?

714
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,116
- In the living room.
- No, in my bedroom.

715
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,713
And I didn't say anything to you, Brooke,

716
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,995
when you so arrogantly
claimed the bed without asking me,

717
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,277
but you can't just waltz into my room
and turn it into a damn art fair.

718
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,590
Gary, I've only taken up
a little bit of space, so...

719
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,557
I don't care if you only took an inch.

720
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,950
There might not be a door here,
but this is my domain. Okay?

721
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,270
I don't go into your bedroom
and set up a goddamn sawhorse.

722
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,920
Well, then what the hell
is that pool table doing in the dining room?

723
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,309
Because that's a common area.
And that's where this belongs.

724
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,839
- Not in my room.
- Hey, what are you doing?

725
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,512
- It belongs in another common area.
- Gary.

726
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,955
People want to come home
and they want to relax in their room.

727
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,679
Gary, it is 2:00 in the morning!

728
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,194
- Don't you drop my things.
- I don't know what to tell you, kid.

729
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,315
This is how I am when I'm single.

730
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,311
My hours start to get pretty strange.

731
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,231
Might be time for you
to think about moving out.

732
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,231
Why would I... No, I'm not moving anywhere.

733
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,311
Gary, just please turn the volume down.

734
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,470
Yeah, but I don't tell you
what the hell to do in your room.

735
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,993
You can doodle. You can dance.

736
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,433
You can bake
a goddamn gingerbread house.

737
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,555
I don't give a shit.

738
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,200
But in my room, I want to relax
and watch my highlights

739
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,748
in complete surround-sound experience.

740
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,149
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're not even gonna watch it!

741
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,753
Don't tell me what I am or aren't not doing.

742
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,353
Oh, what you are not, not doing?

743
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,590
- Go learn some English.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

744
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,990
I didn't have a grandfather
on the board of some fancy college.

745
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,719
Key word being "was. "
Did he touch the Filipino exchange student?

746
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,994
Did he not touch the exchange student?

747
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,559
- I don't know, Brooke. I wasn't there.
- Okay.

748
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,868
No, don't start with the family stuff.

749
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,871
Like your family's so perfect?
Your brother's a pervert!

750
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,235
Don't talk to me about
the sexual habits of family members.

751
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,713
What about your sister?

752
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,877
- My sister's been through a lot.
- Of dick.

753
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,309
There are some problems, Gary,
but can we please just leave it...

754
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,313
Problems? She slept with
the entire Arizona Cardinals offensive line.

755
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,948
That's not problems.
That's she's the problem!

756
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,873
- She was on vacation!
- She was on vacation.

757
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,668
Don't even get me started,
by the way, on your brother.

758
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,069
If I have to hear
that guy sing just one more time,

759
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,230
I'd hang myself with wax dental floss.

760
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,959
Could the guy just
come out of the closet, please?

761
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,235
Richard is not gay.

762
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,796
Okay, lassie, I want you to listen to me
and listen good.

763
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,074
I'm not saying he won't get married.

764
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,276
I'm not saying he won't even have kids.

765
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,588
But then one day his wife will come home,

766
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,636
and then she'll find him
with a guy named Majulio,

767
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,280
wearing leather helmets and
clubbing each other to Yanni's greatest hits.

768
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,873
Yeah. Right. Whatever. You're an infant.

769
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,439
Yeah, I'm an infant.

770
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,829
Go enjoy your room, Brooke,
'cause I'm gonna enjoy mine!

771
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,035
- Okay.
- You know what?

772
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,076
I might enjoy some pay-per-view
options tonight.

773
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,354
It's gonna be a long one, sweetheart,

774
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,317
<i>and I got nothing to do maana but sleep in.</i>

775
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,592
<i>Boogie nights
Ain't no doubt we are here to party</i>

776
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,874
What are you doing?

777
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,678
<i>Boogie nights
Come on now, got to get it started</i>

778
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,034
Ricky, you and the Get Along Gang leave

779
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,951
or I'm gonna throw you out of here
personally, you understand?

780
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,678
Actually, Gary, this is Brooke's bedroom.

781
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,228
So, technically,
you don't have jurisdiction here,

782
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,118
but I think it'd be really fun
if you sang with us.

783
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,792
Come on, Gary. I think you'll like it.

784
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,154
You got 10 seconds to get out of here

785
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,639
or I'm gonna break
your damn magic whistle.

786
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,597
You understand what I'm saying to you?

787
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,716
Move this group out of my house, now!

788
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,712
Gary, you can't take
a pitch pipe out of a guy's hand

789
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,268
when he's in the middle
of a very funky groove.

790
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,952
You can get hurt doing something like that.

791
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,632
I'm tapping out, I'm tapping out!

792
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,233
Here we go. From the bridge.

793
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,871
<i>Party night
Get on down with the sound of the music</i>

794
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,554
<i>Boogie nights Do it, do it</i>

795
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,269
What kind of bullshit move was that?

796
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,639
- I'm sorry. What? What happened?
- Oh, don't be coy with me.

797
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,315
You sent that animal over here
to attack me when I was hung over and weak.

798
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,359
Oh, no. Look, all I know
is The Tone Rangers,

799
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,759
they needed someplace to rehearse,

800
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,150
so I very clearly told Richard,
"Stay in my room,"

801
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,790
which you explained to me
was my space to do with what I want.

802
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,475
Is that how you want to play it?
'Cause I'll play it like that.

803
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,629
I'll play it like Lionel Richie.

804
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,188
All night long, lady. Oh, yeah.

805
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,038
I'll call some guys
from my neck of the woods.

806
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,189
And we're not talking, Brooke,

807
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,430
about a couple of queens
who know a few grapples.

808
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,671
We're talking about Polacks
that don't have a goddamn future.

809
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,954
- Right.
- That's right!

810
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,837
We can make shit real uncomfortable
around here,

811
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,989
and that's what we're gonna do.

812
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,433
Please. Come on. You know what?

813
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,829
You're just embarrassed
because Richard kicked your ass.

814
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,837
Richard did not kick my ass.

815
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,509
What Richard did was attack me
when I was half asleep.

816
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,397
Really? Is that how you see it?

817
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,552
There's a really big gap
between getting your ass kicked

818
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,349
and having a dancing, singing sprite
fool you with trickery

819
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,716
and then strike your throat
before you know that you're even in a fight.

820
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,836
And I wouldn't expect
someone like you to understand that,

821
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,754
because all you ever do
is make moves from up in your ivy tower.

822
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,677
Wow. You have officially
gone off the reservation.

823
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,593
I'm an adult. I talk through shit.
He ran out of ideas.

824
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,630
God. Listen, by the way,
there's messages on the voice mail

825
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,870
regarding game night,
which is obviously not gonna happen,

826
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,270
so you might want to
call people and tell them that it's cancelled.

827
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,078
- Why would I cancel game night?
- Well, I mean...

828
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,355
If it's our turn to host game,
I'm gonna host goddamn game night.

829
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,078
- You want to host game night?
- I'm fine, Brooke.

830
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,993
I don't have any strangeness
over what happened here today.

831
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,149
Okay.

832
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,754
If there's anyone that should feel weird
about seeing people,

833
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,513
that's you, Tonya Harding.
Me? I'm gonna honour my commitments.

834
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,874
- Great.
- Great.

835
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,029
- Fine.
- Fine.

836
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,633
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.

837
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,911
Let's honour the commitment.

838
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,751
- Hey, there's no food in there!
So?

839
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,071
Well, people are gonna be here in an hour.
What are they supposed to eat?

840
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,957
You're a big boy. Figure it out.

841
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,399
Oh, great. Well, that's what we got.

842
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,156
We have only tap water
because, you know, Gary didn't shop.

843
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,516
And we don't have
any ice either 'cause he didn't fill the trays.

844
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,311
- That's trash. It's your shot.
- What is your name again?

845
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,435
- Diane.
- Diane.

846
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,555
Did you call?
I called the five.

847
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,153
Well, yeah,
but you didn't call the second ball,

848
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,275
so that's trash, so it's your shot.

849
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,759
You got to play by the rules.
It's your shot.

850
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,315
- Hi.
- Hi.

851
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,470
- Andrew.
Oh, hi.

852
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,957
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

853
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,554
These two Benedict Arnolds
aren't welcome in my condo.

854
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,710
- Who sent an invite to them?
- I'm sorry.

855
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,554
These are very loyal friends
and they are always welcome in my condo.

856
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,677
Oh, really? Why don't we take it to a vote
and see who has the numbers this time?

857
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,988
All right.
Show of hands here.

858
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,789
Who thinks that these two traitors should
leave and not be a part of game night?

859
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,871
And maybe take their shirts
off when they leave.

860
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,997
Raise your hand.
I know I feel that way. Who else?

861
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,079
Come on, Johnny O,
put your hand up, please.

862
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,799
Come on. Thank you. You, Miss? New girl.

863
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,879
Who's the girl? What's her name?
What's her name?

864
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,520
- The girl you're with. What's her name?
- Her name's Diane.

865
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,433
Oh, I'm sorry. You might want to go ahead
and touch some sky.

866
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,273
- Thank you. Come on, Riggleman, please?
- What are you doing?

867
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,476
No. We need the eight
to count towards a running tally.

868
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,595
You know that. Come on.

869
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,636
Show her whose side that you're on.
Put your hand in the air.

870
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,473
You know whose side I'm on.
You know we need eight, though. Come on.

871
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,198
Put your hand down.

872
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,074
Please don't touch my Ruffles.

873
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,354
Put that one back.
Those are my Ruffles.

874
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,714
Don't eat them, please. Thank you.

875
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,233
- Oh, Gary.
- They're mine.

876
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,469
- Come on.
- Here we go. All right.

877
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,199
Eyes front. Ready?
- Hold on. Get the timer going, please.

878
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,271
- Ready?
Now I gotta do it. Go.

879
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,873
Okay.
- It's a brick.

880
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,598
Square. Square.
- Box. Box.

881
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,109
Corner. Corner. A dot in the corner.

882
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,713
- A house.
- Home plate!

883
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,917
Football! Baseball! Sports. A house.
A triangle. It's algebra.

884
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,831
- Okay, it's a house.
It's a house.

885
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,239
It's a house.
Two words.

886
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,799
Banana?
Chimney, chimney, chimney!

887
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,474
A fruit. House. Fruit.

888
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,039
Oh, restaurant. Or...

889
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,394
No, chimney, chimney.
Smoke...

890
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,391
Oh, a house call.
- House call!

891
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,632
Oh! House call!
Yeah, well, I thought it was a house call.

892
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,597
- Like a hotel, then it hit me it was a house.
Yeah!

893
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,591
You're terrific. Absolutely terrific.

894
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,669
All right, beat that.

895
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,875
Okay, guys, listen.
The next one wins, okay?

896
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,518
So let's stay focused. Let's stay calm.

897
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,511
We can do this. High fives.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

898
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,716
Let's get a mind-meld.
Let's try and get a mind-meld, okay?

899
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,153
Here we go. Let's go. Mind-meld.
- I heard you!

900
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,639
- Don't over-think it. Mind meld.
Ready?

901
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,392
- I heard you!
- Well, just keep it simple.

902
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,515
Shush.

903
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,909
- Ready? Wait. Go!
- Here we go! We're mind-melding.

904
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,592
Draw faster. It doesn't have to be beautiful,

905
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,954
- just has to be something we can get.
- Shoe, shoe...

906
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,712
Shoe! Shoe, shoe, shoe.

907
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,270
Shoeless Joe Jackson. Draw something
different. No one's getting it.

908
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,952
- Shoe. What, is that a smaller shoe?
Baby shoe.

909
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,951
- Smaller shoe. Baby shoes.
Shoes.

910
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,553
Baby shoes. Smaller shoe. Gumshoe.

911
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,755
Smaller shoes.
Gumshoe? Gumshoe?

912
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,115
- Running Olympics.
Inside the shoe.

913
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,996
- Inside a shoe. A bubble...
Lining.

914
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,196
Stop pointing at the shoe.
We're not... No one's guessing shoe.

915
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,679
Stop pointing at the shoe
and draw something different.

916
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,795
Draw something different. You...

917
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,269
Goddamn it! No one's guessing shoe!

918
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,318
You drew a big shoe,
then a small shoe, and no one got it.

919
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,551
You gotta draw something different.
Everyone said "shoe" seven times.

920
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,312
It's a sock, asshole.

921
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,589
- You call yourself an artist?
- Yes!

922
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,194
A three-year-old with a box of crayons
could do a better job than this.

923
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,874
I'm sorry, I don't have the great talent
of standing on top of a big red bus

924
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,076
and pointing out architecture
that other great men have built!

925
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,309
I'm the one who should be sorry, Brooke.

926
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,038
- I shouldn't sit here and pick on your art.
- No.

927
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,111
Because you got
the nuts part down, Picasso.

928
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,713
All you have
to do is cut off your frigging ear.

929
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,915
That's Van Gogh, you idiot!

930
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,831
And your insults are much more effective
when they're accurate.

931
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,955
Don't talk to me about
being goddamn accurate!

932
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,109
I can talk to you about anything that I want.

933
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,394
'Cause you couldn't even draw a sock.

934
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,515
You don't do anything right! You're a lazy...

935
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,237
Everyone said, "Shoe, shoe, shoe!"

936
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,188
At first, I figured that the split
was just something temporary,

937
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,238
something that you two
would work out and get past,

938
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,833
but after tonight I think it's pretty clear

939
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,639
that you two genuinely
do not want to get back together.

940
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,717
- There's not a shot in hell.
- Gary.

941
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,392
- I'm just...
- I got you.

942
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,594
As your friend and as your realtor,

943
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,749
I'm not gonna leave here tonight

944
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,398
until we decide what to do about this condo,

945
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,632
because this living situation
is obviously not working out.

946
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,835
Gary?

947
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,593
Well, the only logical thing that I can think of

948
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,993
is for her to move out of the condo,

949
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,675
and then to pay me some
sort of a penalty as compensation for

950
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,876
- the labour that I did all around the condo.
- What? What?

951
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,872
What? Pay you compensation
for your labour?

952
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,953
- We fixed this place up together.
- Are you nuts?

953
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,632
- Stop calling me nuts, I swear to God.
- I fixed the...

954
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,789
You went around with a sponge,

955
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,279
and you went in the bathroom
and you dotted foofy shit.

956
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,839
- That's what you're saying that I did?
There's no...

957
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,399
That was...
That's called aesthetics.

958
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,391
It warmed this place up so it didn't look like

959
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,596
an army barracks, which it was about to.

960
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,511
I'll tell you what it's called in his language,
depreciated.

961
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,511
- That's what it's called.
- You don't even know what that means.

962
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,830
Unless the next buyer happens to have
your same Zulu-voodoo-land taste.

963
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,148
- All right.
- Let me tell you something else.

964
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,515
It's gonna cost money
to cover up the holes in the wall.

965
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,876
The holes that you drilled in the wall there
to hang up whatever that thing is called.

966
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,949
Oh, please. Gary.

967
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,029
You're gonna have
to cost money to fix that.

968
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,509
What I did, Brooke,
has concrete value to the condo.

969
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,318
I added concrete...
Well, let's just go on record.

970
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,119
We're dealing with facts here.
I did the tiling in the bathroom.

971
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,838
- Have you seen...
- I did the new track lighting.

972
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,672
- That tile is the shittiest tile job.
I did the plumbing!

973
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,113
- The plumbing!
- That's realty terms.

974
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,872
Okay. Let's talk about your plumbing.
This is his plumbing.

975
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,029
We have two temperatures in our bathroom.

976
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,714
We get either scalding hot
or we get frostbite.

977
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,233
- That's it. That's all we get.
- It's my problem

978
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,514
that she doesn't know how
to pace a shower?

979
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,635
Now all of a sudden
that's my fault.

980
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,709
I get one minute to take a shower.

981
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,949
- One minute?
One minute of warmth?

982
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,076
- Oh, Jesus. One minute.
- That's it. That's correct.

983
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,754
Thank God you're not in charge of keeping
all the clocks in Chicago on time.

984
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,195
- This is basic logic.
- You are out of your mind. You have lost it.

985
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,998
Let me explain this to you
in plain chapter and verse.

986
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,959
Cheese and rice, you guys are gonna
kill each other. Now, let's just...

987
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,429
Realistically speaking, neither one of you

988
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,556
can afford this mortgage on your own, okay?

989
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,110
And that's a shame, because this building
will continue to increase in value.

990
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,350
I get nothing but phone calls about it,
all right?

991
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,953
Waiting for a unit to open up.

992
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,555
So, as your realtor,
the last thing I would suggest is selling.

993
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,030
But as your friend,
I just, I don't see any other solution.

994
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,152
You take your halves,
you go your separate ways,

995
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,117
and you get on with your lives.

996
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,356
I know that selling is not the easiest thing,
but I do think that it's the best.

997
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,397
And to be honest, this is a situation

998
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,597
where I would just as soon
not take a commission.

999
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,072
- That's great. Thank you.
- That's great. Thank you for that.

1000
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,832
I wish I didn't have to, you know,

1001
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,673
but company policy says I cannot waive that.

1002
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,476
But I was just...
You know, I'm saying in theory, you know.

1003
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,758
In this situation, 'cause we're friends,
I wish I could waive it.

1004
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,193
No can do, though.

1005
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,359
As soon as you can, I would love to get
a set of keys from you guys.

1006
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,193
You just drop them off.
Okay. Great. There they are.

1007
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,316
I'll be bringing by people all week.

1008
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,279
You won't even know I'm here.
The good news is, should move quickly.

1009
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,829
All right.

1010
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,791
Okay to leave you two alone now?

1011
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,390
Got to get back to Jen.
Very excited about the win tonight.

1012
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,589
Okay.

1013
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,155
Addie, if the condo sells,
I think I'm gonna lose him.

1014
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,832
<i>Yeah, but game night
was so light and fun,</i>

1015
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,876
<i>I'm really surprised to be hearing this.</i>

1016
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,155
Okay. You know what?
That's not constructive. Really.

1017
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,515
I just... Yeah,
I need a new plan, Addie. I don't...

1018
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,708
I'm just kidding. It's me.

1019
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,870
I'm gonna have to call you back.

1020
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,077
Whenever one of my friends is down,
we all go on, like, happy patrol.

1021
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,673
I was actually having
a very serious conversation.

1022
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,193
Christopher, do not sing.

1023
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,716
<i>If you're happy
and you know it clap your hands</i>

1024
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,437
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands</i>

1025
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,159
<i>If you're happy and you know it
You're going to smile to...</i>

1026
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,190
Pack up your shit and go home.

1027
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,633
Okay. You know what? This is not his fault.

1028
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,473
He was just really trying
to cheer me up and it...

1029
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,750
Did I or did I not give you
the day off to be sad?

1030
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,274
- Yes. But I...
- Well, today's not that day,

1031
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,358
and unfortunately for you,
I can't afford to look weak.

1032
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,509
No, please.

1033
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,309
You have warned me so many times
and you have yet to fire me.

1034
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,195
I think you and I both know
that to find and train somebody new,

1035
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,919
it's gonna cost you time,
and it's gonna cost you money,

1036
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,992
and I don't think you want
to spend either one of those.

1037
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,992
Now, look, I'm just gonna
take a wild guess here,

1038
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,197
but you don't become Marilyn Dean

1039
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,156
without knowing how to handle men.

1040
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,269
Okay? Now, just listen to my problem,

1041
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,877
tell me how to fix it,
and then we'll all go back to work.

1042
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,556
Okay. What is this problem so severe

1043
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,079
that has caused you to blaspheme
in the synagogue of Marilyn Dean?

1044
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,595
Well, it's Gary. I broke up with him

1045
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,877
in hopes that losing me
would make him want to change,

1046
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,916
and that's, you know...

1047
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,148
And I've just ended up pushing him,
you know, farther and farther away.

1048
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,478
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1049
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,035
Honey, this is not surrealism or cubism,
it's paint-by-numbers.

1050
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,674
Go see Mischa,
my personal waxer at the spa.

1051
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,314
Ask her for the Telly Savalas.

1052
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,312
The Telly Savalas.

1053
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,638
Compliments of M. Dean.

1054
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,353
Then go show Gary your immaculate canvas

1055
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,115
and let him see another man
eager to paint it. Got it?

1056
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,708
- Got it?
- Uh-huh.

1057
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,229
Ow!

1058
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,432
Who loves you, baby?

1059
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,796
<i>Wow, impressive. Three sharp hands landed.</i>

1060
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,917
<i>What an amazing display
of punching technique.</i>

1061
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,514
<i>The crowd jumps. That punch rocked him.</i>

1062
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,955
<i>They sense he's on the verge
of hitting the canvas.</i>

1063
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,918
<i>The roaring for anticipation of a knockout.</i>

1064
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,594
<i>We are witnessing a great fight.</i>

1065
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,911
<i>He's displaying incredible
rhythm with his hands.</i>

1066
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:18,116
<i>Bulldog terrorising his opponent.
Down he goes!</i>

1067
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,634
<i>Hard punch slams him to the canvas.</i>

1068
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,712
<i>One, two, three,</i>

1069
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,271
<i>four, five, six, seven, eight,</i>

1070
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,909
<i>nine, ten.</i>

1071
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,109
<i>It's over.</i>

1072
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,553
Is... Did... Is Brooke here?

1073
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,109
I don't know.

1074
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,275
- Brooke?
I'll be right there.

1075
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,193
<i>Cool, baby, cool.</i>

1076
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,709
So, how do you and Brooke
know each other?

1077
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,837
Well, how don't we know each other,
you know what I mean?

1078
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,270
Hi, Paul.
- Oh, hey. Wow, you look great.

1079
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,395
Thank you.

1080
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,711
Are you ready to go?
- Yeah. All set.

1081
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,750
- So, it was great meeting you.
- Apple martinis.

1082
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,796
- All right, come on.
- That normally does the trick.

1083
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,030
- Just ignore him.
- But just two. Three, she'll get sloppy.

1084
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,269
You'll become a babysitter.

1085
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,318
Oh, and fantasy role playing.
She's got a real thing for lifeguards.

1086
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,358
Put some zinc oxide
on your nose and she'll lose her mind.

1087
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,475
It'll all be over with.

1088
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,511
<i>Y'all want me to stop running?</i>

1089
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,191
I mean, the most challenging part
of what I do

1090
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,238
is between February and April 15th.

1091
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,551
That's what we in the biz
like to call crunch time.

1092
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,278
That sounds fascinating.

1093
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,873
- Good evening.
- Hi.

1094
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,598
Can I start you two off
with something to drink?

1095
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,753
Yeah, you know, we're gonna
start with a couple of apple martinis, please.

1096
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,159
No, you know what?
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna start with a water.

1097
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,515
Well, you can just bring those, just in case.
What was I saying?

1098
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,749
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1099
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,673
So, you know,
it's not like it's all work and no play.

1100
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,350
You know, I mean,
after April 15th, that's what we in the biz

1101
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,476
like to call party time.

1102
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,795
Excuse me.

1103
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,274
Oh, I have to get this. I'm so sorry.

1104
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,349
Hello.

1105
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,793
<i>Okay, is this when
I'm supposed to call?</i>

1106
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,869
What?

1107
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,190
What do you mean? What?
Where? What happened?

1108
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,670
<i>- Okay, that's great.
- Wait. What? Oh, all right.</i>

1109
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,955
Listen, where... Just don't move.
Where are you?

1110
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,951
<i>- I'm sitting in my kitchen.
- Sitting? Okay.</i>

1111
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,917
Don't move.

1112
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,754
Don't... I'm gonna be right there, honey.
I'm gonna be right there, okay?

1113
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,558
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, my gosh.

1114
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,039
That was my best friend.

1115
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,749
She just had an accident and she...
She has this knee thing

1116
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,673
- and she's just very fragile, and I have to go.
- What?

1117
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,109
- I can give you a ride.
- No. No. That's okay.

1118
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,794
I'm gonna grab a cab, so... I'm so sorry.

1119
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,313
I like your dress.

1120
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,959
I think he's fascinating.
He's obviously read a lot of books.

1121
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,553
Yeah. Yeah, I bet he has.

1122
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,791
He reads a lot of books
because nobody wants to talk to him.

1123
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,436
He's a friend of Andrew's
who's always been polite.

1124
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,795
It's the best I could do
on such short notice, okay?

1125
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,836
Well, you know what?
Polite is not gonna do it.

1126
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,754
We've got to find somebody
who is really gonna make Gary jealous.

1127
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,879
Can I just say something?

1128
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,279
You sound a little jealous, Gary.

1129
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,191
Why would I be jealous
of some guy with computer skills?

1130
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,670
Let's say he doesn't have computer skills,
but he's got a big old elephant hog on him?

1131
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,398
Would that bother you
or would you be okay with that?

1132
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,799
Not nearly as much as the way
that your mind works.

1133
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,108
My mind works great.

1134
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,317
So, what's this bullshit
I hear about you selling the condo?

1135
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,391
Selling that condo is ludicrous.

1136
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,959
I was waiting for when I was gonna get

1137
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,508
the how-Gary-always-screws-his-life-up
speech again.

1138
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,158
- This must be the right time.
- Look, you tell me,

1139
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,196
- you just tell me, tell me.
- Is it happening now? Yeah. Okay.

1140
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,748
Tell me how losing that asset

1141
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,798
is gonna get us on the river?

1142
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,429
Go ahead, just tell me. Tell me.
Somebody tell me. What is this?

1143
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,757
- What is this? What is it? What is it? Hey!
- Don't patronise me.

1144
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,717
- Helicopters.
- Helicopters. Exactly!

1145
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,677
How does losing the asset
give us helicopters?

1146
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,309
Dennis, I'm being totally serious with you.
I don't need this shit right now.

1147
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,391
Hey, you want to cry, cry to Mom.

1148
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,991
Nobody's crying. I'm not crying.

1149
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,719
- I just don't feel like hearing it.
- There's no feelings here.

1150
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,349
This is about money and business.
Fine, you broke up.

1151
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,758
You broke up. Fine.

1152
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,713
You know, sad.

1153
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:22,152
Sad is, instead of putting $1,000
into your mortgage every month,

1154
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,073
you waste it on rent. That's what sad is.

1155
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,797
Oh, you're broke up.
You're confused, brokenhearted.

1156
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,032
Heartbreak is not having that money

1157
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,669
as part of your net worth
and then not saving the money,

1158
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,679
so that after taxes you can invest!

1159
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,711
You know, you're confused.

1160
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,870
- Are you finished?
- Look, I need the damn tour logs.

1161
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:52,915
Yeah.

1162
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,068
Well, I really, really appreciate
the heart to heart.

1163
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,435
It was a great talk, Dennis. Thank you.

1164
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,512
Oh, well, you're behind three months.
You're still behind three months.

1165
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,558
And those logs are imperative
to insuring that our books are straight!

1166
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,154
I'll tell you what those logs are.
Those logs are bullshit is what they are!

1167
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,037
You got the receipts.
Tally the goddamn things yourself!

1168
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,189
I do, I do!

1169
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,556
And I don't appreciate it,
because it cuts into my time with my family.

1170
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,473
I could be spending that time
with my family instead of doing your books.

1171
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,630
I already do the taxes. I do the billing.

1172
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,837
I do the hiring, the firing.
I do the maintenance.

1173
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,798
Come on, what do you do?
What is it that you do?

1174
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,553
- You do the tours!
- I am the talent, Dennis!

1175
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,349
They sign up a month in advance to see me.

1176
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,632
They'll wait in line for the next bus
to see me! All right?

1177
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:40,272
So don't drain me with all this bullshit
about the goddamn tour logs!

1178
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,591
<i>How big's your TV?
Oh, shut up!</i>

1179
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,955
How big's your TV, 'cause I wanna know
if you can see what's happening.

1180
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,632
<i>Oh, wow. You beat a 12-year-old.</i>

1181
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,439
I don't care if you're 12 years old.
You have more time in the day to play.

1182
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,555
I live in the real worid, my man,

1183
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,233
With bills and responsibilities.

1184
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,909
That's right.

1185
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,550
You can't have a handle called
Mad Dog Killer if you complain every time...

1186
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,596
- Brooke?
- Hi, Mike.

1187
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,398
- Hi.
- Come on in.

1188
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,595
<i>Hold on, Mom. I'm coming.</i>

1189
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,669
Is your mom in the room with you?

1190
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,830
'Cause I hope she can't see
what's happening.

1191
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,433
I hope she can't see what's happening.

1192
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,318
I'm gonna be just a few more seconds.
So, just sit down and relax.

1193
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,152
Oh, yeah, no problem.

1194
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,878
I'm sorry?
Yeah, why'd you do that?

1195
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,149
You take the fun out of beating you,
because you have an excuse to lose.

1196
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,275
<i>Get a life, dude.</i>

1197
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,715
Do you think it's possible that your mom
won't love you anymore

1198
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,438
if she sees how bad
you're losing in the game.

1199
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,555
<i>Shut up!</i>

1200
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:03,755
Okay.

1201
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,155
All right.

1202
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,996
That's great. You're gonna
stay man-to-man with me.

1203
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,399
What happens when I make a play?

1204
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,119
Making plays, making plays! Making plays!

1205
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,470
Well, you know, that's how my people
like to handle their business.

1206
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,630
While your guys are out partying,
mine are running routes.

1207
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,353
Try to make a difference.

1208
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,749
Mike? I'm ready to go.

1209
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,993
Oh, hey,

1210
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,269
do you mind if we finish the game?
We got a real nail-biter going here.

1211
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,394
Yeah, sure. Of course. Great.

1212
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,192
Awesome, all right?

1213
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,436
- Touchdown.
- Oh, God, is that pretty.

1214
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,797
God, is that pretty. Yeah, I'm a gentleman.

1215
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,191
I like to be humble.
I'm old school. I don't like to talk a lot.

1216
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,511
But at the same time, am I talented?

1217
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,916
Tell me how you felt about
what just happened there.

1218
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,831
That's him going deep. That's him going...

1219
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,559
Work ethic. Work ethic.

1220
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,311
I could play this game forever.

1221
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,436
- Oh, I could, too. I love it, yeah.
- I love it, don't you?

1222
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,794
I mean, it's the kind of thing where literally

1223
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,440
I play the game and it's like,
four hours go by.

1224
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,072
Fate has me highly skilled
and loaded with talent.

1225
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,509
Oh...

1226
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,114
'Cause I think I'm good enough
to figure out how to beat myself.

1227
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,235
You push yourself.

1228
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,151
You push yourself trying to achieve
the impossible,

1229
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,390
because you know
that when that moment comes

1230
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,678
that everything you've done up to
that moment has prepared you for victory!

1231
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,798
I can't take credit for it, Mike.

1232
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,236
I got to thank these little digital guys
with the big hearts.

1233
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,880
Does it feel good to be a champion? Yeah.

1234
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,157
- Yeah, it feels good to be a champion.
- Good game.

1235
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,120
Hey, Brooke, are you ready to go now?

1236
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,640
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Great.

1237
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,711
Hey, Gary, thanks a lot, man.
It was great to meet you.

1238
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,119
Absolutely, man.

1239
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,237
Come on, Mike.
I know a great little martini bar.

1240
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,189
<i>Yo.</i>

1241
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,157
Hey, man, saddle up.
It's time to rope in some talent.

1242
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,275
<i>What's up? What do you got?</i>

1243
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,794
My place. Tonight. Poker.
Call some giris up.

1244
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,959
Your roommate is awesome.

1245
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,234
Mmm.

1246
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,158
Yeah, he's something.

1247
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,478
- So, where did you go to law school?
- Oh, Northwestern.

1248
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,431
God, Gary's hilarious.

1249
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,993
Yeah, he's okay.

1250
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,954
Okay? I mean, the guy's all time.

1251
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:50,430
But he's gonna take Chicago tourism
by air, land and sea.

1252
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,191
And he asked me to join
his new bowling team.

1253
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,191
I mean, how cool is that?

1254
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,349
Mmm-hmm.

1255
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,236
You know what? I can't do this. I'm so sorry.

1256
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,710
Excuse me, would you please pull over?
Can you pull over, please?

1257
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,037
Hey, wait.

1258
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,118
Tell Gary to call me.

1259
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,429
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

1260
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,671
to the first annual Texas Hold'em No-Limit
Strip Poker Tournament.

1261
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,270
Now, per the e-mail that Lupus sent,
we each have eight articles of clothing.

1262
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,476
Now, if you want to bet,
you take off an article of clothing,

1263
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,595
you put it in the centre.

1264
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,831
If you win, you take back the clothes,
you put back on what you bet.

1265
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,911
The extras that other people bet
will stay in front of you,

1266
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,194
much the same as chips would.

1267
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,633
You can go all in at any point,

1268
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,632
but as I outlined, you must take off
all your clothes to do so.

1269
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,790
The game shall last an hour, maybe two,

1270
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,509
at which point we will begin
the dance portion of the evening.

1271
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,995
Let's get going here.

1272
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,229
I need to see the blinds.
Small blind. Big blind.

1273
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,389
The blinds are one and one.

1274
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,708
Come on, ladies.
All right.

1275
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,756
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's get going here.

1276
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,391
- Shuffle up and deal.
- All right.

1277
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,753
I mean, just because
they were playing video games,

1278
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,229
that doesn't mean
it didn't bother him, right?

1279
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,551
Honestly, Brooke,
I wish I could tell you, but I wasn't there.

1280
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,478
All right, Sally,
get the soap out of your mouth.

1281
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,391
We're gonna save that for when you're 12.

1282
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,391
Mike was really, really good-looking.

1283
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,994
I mean, he's a little bit of a goof,
but Gary doesn't know that.

1284
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,435
I mean, for all he knows, a sophisticated,

1285
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,159
really good-looking guy
took me out on a date tonight.

1286
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,595
I could be in bed
with this guy right now for all he knows.

1287
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,829
You know?

1288
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,718
I'm telling you, if you saw the look
on his face,

1289
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,599
Mike got to him.

1290
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,949
Hello.

1291
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,231
<i>Hey, it's Riggleman. Great news.</i>

1292
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,113
So, how does this work?

1293
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,668
I'll bring the car around front
and you wrap them up to go?

1294
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,671
Oh, no, no. We take care of everything.

1295
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,753
We deliver it. We hang it.
We check the light and the sun exposure.

1296
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,512
- Oh. Perfect.
- Yeah.

1297
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,315
Listen, I don't want to be too forward,

1298
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,032
but would you like to have
some dinner with me sometime?

1299
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,000
I'm sorry. I have a boyfriend.

1300
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,792
- Of course.
- So...

1301
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:07,440
- Well, he's a lucky man.
Oh, thank you.

1302
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,753
I guess I will just have to keep it to
home deliveries and gallery purchases.

1303
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,951
Thank you, though. See you.

1304
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,076
- Have a good day, Brooke.
- You, too.

1305
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,917
Okay, are you out of your mind?

1306
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,436
Gary's throwing Greek orgies
in your living room

1307
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,511
and you're telling hot rich guys
you have a boyfriend?

1308
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,637
- Are you nuts?
- Hey, look. I'm not exactly innocent here.

1309
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,268
Brooke, as an outsider
with some perspective, I really think you...

1310
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,112
Christopher, stop. Stop it.
I don't want to hear it.

1311
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,394
This has already gotten way out of hand.

1312
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,517
I know what I have to do now, all right?
I know what I have to do.

1313
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,075
Hi.

1314
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,835
Hi.

1315
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,596
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah.

1316
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,708
Two weeks.

1317
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,355
Yep.

1318
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,715
I brought some boxes from work,

1319
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,358
so, you know, if you need any
just help yourself.

1320
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,836
Great. Thanks.

1321
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,389
Oh.

1322
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,758
Listen, a while ago I got these tickets

1323
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,879
for the Old 97's tonight,
and I completely forgot about it, so I...

1324
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,231
You know, if you want to go.

1325
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,030
Well, how many tickets did you get?

1326
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,675
I got two.

1327
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,836
How much do you want for them?

1328
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,157
Oh, no, I'm going. I'm going.

1329
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,395
So, then it would just be the two of us?

1330
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,994
Well, yes, and 2,000 other people.

1331
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,036
I mean, it's not a big deal,

1332
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,839
but, you know, look, you know,
I was going to invite Addie,

1333
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,878
but I just figured I'd gotten them for you,
so...

1334
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:29,914
Sure. Why not?

1335
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,358
Are you sure?
I mean, if you don't want them,

1336
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,079
- I can definitely give them to somebody.
- No. No, I'll be there.

1337
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,630
That sounds... It sounds great.

1338
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,395
Okay. All right. It's at the Riv.

1339
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,994
So, I'll just leave your ticket at Will Call.

1340
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,793
- Good?
- Okay.

1341
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,915
Okay.

1342
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,669
- Yeah, so, there. I'll just leave that for him.
- Okay, great.

1343
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,829
- Okay, so.
- Gary Grobowski?

1344
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,433
Grobowski, yeah.
He should be here in a minute.

1345
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,829
- He's really... He's oddly tall, so.
- Oh, okay. Great.

1346
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,592
- You won't miss him. Thanks.
- All right, have a good night.

1347
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,316
- Hi. Can I get a beer, please?
- Sure.

1348
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,197
Actually, make that two beers.

1349
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,310
It's gonna be $8.

1350
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,719
Excuse me. Sorry.

1351
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:55,079
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

1352
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,320
<i>Good evening, Chicago. We're the Old 97's.</i>

1353
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,395
Brooke?

1354
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,190
- Are you up?
- Yeah.

1355
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,189
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1356
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,837
- Are you sure?
- What's up? What do you want?

1357
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,517
I just want to say
I'm sorry that I missed the concert,

1358
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,630
and let me know what that ticket cost,
I'll pay you back for it.

1359
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,392
Just leave me alone, Gary.

1360
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,516
I planned on going to the concert.

1361
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,999
It's just, I stopped by Johnny O's and we...

1362
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,354
It doesn't fucking matter, okay?

1363
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,000
Would you just leave my room
and shut the door?

1364
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,351
- Jesus.
- Please.

1365
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,838
I didn't really know that the concert
mattered all that much to you.

1366
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,955
Exactly.

1367
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,512
Hold on a second here.
Let me talk for a second.

1368
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,669
Gary...

1369
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,116
Brooke. You broke up with me.

1370
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,157
Then you have guys
coming over here for dates,

1371
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,310
and all of a sudden
you ask me to go to some concert.

1372
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,958
I mean, I just figured that, you know.

1373
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,268
Gary.

1374
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,035
I just... I don't know how we got here.

1375
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,272
Our entire relationship

1376
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,589
I've gone above and beyond for you, for us.

1377
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,996
And I mean, I've cooked.

1378
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,470
I've picked your shit up off the floor.

1379
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,950
I've laid your clothes out for you
like you were a four-year-old.

1380
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,792
I support you. I supported you, your work.

1381
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,674
If we ever had dinner or anything,
I make the plans.

1382
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,311
I take care of everything and
I just don't feel like you appreciate any of it.

1383
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,711
I don't feel you appreciate me.

1384
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,750
And all I want is to...
Is for you to just show me that you care.

1385
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,470
Why didn't you just say that to me?

1386
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:04,550
Gary, I've tried. I've tried.

1387
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,952
Yeah, but never like that.

1388
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,000
You might've said some things
that you meant to imply that, Brooke,

1389
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,718
but I'm not a mind reader.

1390
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,598
I doubt it would matter.
You are who you are.

1391
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,957
Just leave me alone, okay?

1392
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,637
Right now. Just shut my door.

1393
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,075
Listen.

1394
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,469
All right, Gary, just, please.
Just leave the room.

1395
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,595
- Listen to me.
- Gary, just...

1396
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,035
- I don't want to be near you right now.
- Listen to me. I just want to...

1397
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,032
Please, just shut the door. Please.

1398
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,395
I know. Look, I know you feel
bad, but, you know, what are you gonna do?

1399
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,119
I mean, what does she expect, for me to
want to go with the girl who dumped me?

1400
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,839
I don't know. She probably just wanted you,
you know, to show her the respect

1401
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,638
of not standing her up
or some shit, who knows?

1402
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,472
Well, damn it.
I should have just said no in the first place.

1403
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,549
I don't know why I called...

1404
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,629
You know what? It's her fault she got hurt.

1405
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,110
You shouldn't even feel bad about it.
She should have expected it from you.

1406
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,549
You're a fun guy, okay?
Everybody likes you.

1407
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,996
You're the quickest guy I know.
Anytime we go out, I have a blast.

1408
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,399
All right? But, you know,

1409
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,392
everybody who knows you knows
you're gonna do what you want to do.

1410
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,916
And if it's not what the other person
wants to do, well, that's their problem.

1411
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,994
- That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1412
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,718
There's plenty of times
I do shit that I don't want to do.

1413
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,119
- That's ridiculous. No.
- Like when?

1414
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,235
That's bullshit to say about me.

1415
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,788
When have we ever
done something you didn't want to do?

1416
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,233
You know, I don't know,
off the top of my head. I don't keep score...

1417
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,436
When's the last time we went to a Sox game?

1418
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,794
The Sox.

1419
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,269
Not when they're playing the Cubs, either.

1420
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,912
We always do what you want to do
and she always did what you want to do.

1421
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,319
It's who you are.

1422
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,789
Everybody thinks
that you're their friend, okay?

1423
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,711
But the fact of the matter is
that there's not one person

1424
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,472
that I know that you trust enough
to let close enough

1425
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,549
that they could hurt you.

1426
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,315
And her big problem
is that you really liked her.

1427
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,914
I mean, she is the one girl you really liked.

1428
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,797
And no matter what she did
and how hard she tried,

1429
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,916
you were never gonna let your guard down.

1430
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,070
That poor girl never stood a chance.

1431
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,155
Marilyn?

1432
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,237
- Marilyn?
Yeah.

1433
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:03,512
I'm sorry. I just...

1434
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,195
Oh, just get in here.

1435
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,430
Oh, okay. I'm sorry, excuse me.

1436
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,673
Marilyn, I just...

1437
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:13,036
I just wanted to let you know
that today is gonna be my last day.

1438
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,870
I'm gonna be travelling for a bit.

1439
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,513
Here's a blank cheque.

1440
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,354
Write down a number, I don't want to know
what it is, and go back to work.

1441
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,755
No, no. It's not about that.

1442
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,673
I can't accept that.

1443
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,029
Brooke.

1444
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,634
Travis, get your gorgeous
tuckus out of here.

1445
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,030
If you make it to Rome,

1446
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,995
search out an establishment
called the Padre Negro.

1447
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,949
Ask for a strapping young
fellow named Alberto.

1448
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,671
Compliments of M. Dean.

1449
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,433
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

1450
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:13,108
Yeah. And, honey,

1451
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,708
take as long as you want,
because when you're done,

1452
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,268
your job will be right here waiting for you.

1453
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,233
And if you discover a path
that doesn't lead back here...

1454
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,151
Well, I hope you'll text.

1455
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,474
I will.

1456
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,191
And, like I said, the apartment's a mess,
but I'm moving, so...

1457
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,840
It's okay. Relax about the place. I don't care.

1458
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,195
- Okay. This'll just take a second.
- Okay.

1459
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,955
Hello?
Hey. I'm in here.

1460
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,275
Don't say anything. I...

1461
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,879
How're you doing?

1462
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,629
Could I talk to you in private for a second?

1463
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,436
You know what?
This is really not a good time,

1464
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,954
and obviously you have
something happening here,

1465
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,315
- so we'll just be in...
- No, no, I don't have anything going on.

1466
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,595
This is actually for you.

1467
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,110
- I'm just gonna wait outside.
- No, no. Wait.

1468
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:38,156
No, no. Really. It's okay.

1469
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,791
I really can't do this right now.

1470
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,633
Brooke, this whole thing
has been really tough on me

1471
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,918
and I've tried to act like it
hasn't been that tough on me,

1472
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,514
but the first Sunday
after me and you broke up,

1473
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,591
it all kind of really hit me.

1474
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,473
And I think it partially hit me

1475
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,836
because Sunday was sort of always our day
that we would do stuff together.

1476
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:02,390
But I didn't have any idea
you still cared so much.

1477
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,437
And, you know,
when I saw you crying the other night,

1478
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,672
that was honestly
the worst moment of my life.

1479
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,789
Gary.

1480
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,713
Let me just try to say
some of these things here. It's just...

1481
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,709
Look,

1482
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,630
I know that I've caused you a lot of pain.

1483
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,828
And the funny thing is,
all I really want to do is make you happy.

1484
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,637
I just want to make you smile.

1485
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,598
Now, I've had a lot of time
to think about some of the things

1486
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,752
that went on, and I know, Brooke,
that I don't always do the right thing

1487
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:38,717
or always say the right things,

1488
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,473
but I am willing to try
to do things differently.

1489
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,069
And I'd be happy to go take a dance class.

1490
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,596
Well, I would. Honestly.
I would like to go do that. Or go travel.

1491
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,280
I mean, I'd even be willing to go to the ballet.

1492
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:55,070
Although I would much rather
do the dance class or take a trip somewhere.

1493
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,992
But I realise that's not the point.

1494
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,116
I realise that the point isn't that at all,

1495
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,113
because it's not really about doing things
that you love to do always,

1496
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,636
but it is about doing things
with the person that you love.

1497
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,510
And I love you.

1498
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,678
- Gary.
- Just give me one second here.

1499
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,637
I've missed you so much.

1500
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,193
I promise you, Brooke,

1501
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,478
I will do whatever it is that I have to do
to never hurt you again.

1502
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,075
I love you and I'm sorry.

1503
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,676
Okay, that's it. That's all I...

1504
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,038
- Oh, God.
- That's all I wanted to say,

1505
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,510
so you can go ahead now
with anything that you're feeling to say.

1506
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,199
I don't know what to say.

1507
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,716
Just say whatever you feel inside.

1508
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,310
I don't feel the same way.

1509
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,915
I don't. I just... I don't know.

1510
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,188
Oh, God.

1511
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:16,232
I just, I think... I don't know,

1512
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,390
but I don't think I have

1513
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,310
anything left to give.

1514
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,159
I'm sorry.

1515
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,792
I was hoping for...

1516
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,473
It doesn't matter.

1517
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,196
Oh, this is now beyond awkward.

1518
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,953
There's some new guy
standing out in the hallway

1519
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,794
and I think I'm gonna go.

1520
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,669
Okay.

1521
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,639
Thank you.

1522
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,839
I made a dinner,
and I don't know if it's any good or not,

1523
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,751
but you're welcome to have it.

1524
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,075
Okay.

1525
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,354
Gary, that's really...
That's not what you think that it is.

1526
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,509
It's okay.

1527
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,711
I'm gonna go take a walk.

1528
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,315
- I'm sorry about that.
- No.

1529
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,751
- I'm sorry I imposed.
- No, that's fine. Please.

1530
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,029
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're right.

1531
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,350
- I think it's great.
- Good.

1532
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,553
- Okay.
- Okay.

1533
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,709
So,

1534
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,358
I will have that wrapped up.

1535
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:15,034
Packed up, sorry, and delivered.

1536
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:17,711
Thank you for taking the time
to show it to me, okay?

1537
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:18,869
Sure.

1538
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,514
- Yeah. I'm gonna run.
- Okay, I'll walk you out.

1539
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,795
No, no, no. I can... It's okay.

1540
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,198
So, the thing that
I was most afraid of happening happened

1541
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:44,592
and I don't regret it at all,
because now she knows how I feel.

1542
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,439
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1543
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,513
I think, what you got to do now
is really think hard,

1544
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,551
because you have to find somebody

1545
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,955
that can't be traced back to either of us

1546
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,792
to visit this guy.

1547
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,276
What are you talking about? I don't...

1548
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,998
The guy who came with her.

1549
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,389
I don't need anything to happen to the guy.

1550
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,072
But if they could trace him
back to either one of us...

1551
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,196
- It's not about him. I don't care about that.
... it's a problem.

1552
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,748
- The guy, he's not a...
- They're not dumb. Cops are smart, trust me.

1553
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,671
- Okay, but he's not a problem to me.
- Right.

1554
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,432
Listen to me.

1555
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,796
Promise me that you're
not gonna do anything.

1556
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,915
I got you.

1557
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,835
It's better if nobody...
You don't know anything.

1558
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,353
- What are you talking about?
- I'll take care of it.

1559
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,317
I don't want you to take care of anything.
John, do me a favour.

1560
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,312
- I'm being serious with you.
- I know, I know. Smart. You're smart.

1561
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,628
No, I'm not. I'm being honest with you.

1562
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,073
- I don't want anything to happen to him.
- Me, either.

1563
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:38,116
Promise me you're not gonna have
anyone do anything to this guy.

1564
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,997
But you've gotta tell me exactly
what you're gonna tell them,

1565
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,877
if the cops come to you.
Because if we tell a different story...

1566
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,678
- Nothing. Promise me one thing.
- We don't care...

1567
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,671
John, I'm gonna go home.
I can't do this. I'm exhausted.

1568
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,955
Right, go home. Just make sure
your neighbours know you're going home.

1569
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,589
Do me a favour. They got phone records.
Make a couple phone calls tonight.

1570
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,318
Especially around 10:00.

1571
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,549
- Okay. Please don't do anything.
- All right.

1572
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,232
I don't mean it like... I mean, honestly.

1573
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,594
No, no, I got it.

1574
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,155
For all you know, nothing's happening.

1575
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,910
- I don't want anything to happen.
- Right.

1576
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,274
Say it louder.

1577
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,631
What are you doing here so early?

1578
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,269
Hey.

1579
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,471
- Everything okay with you and...
- Yeah, everything's gonna be great.

1580
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,838
I just wanna get my day started,
but I just wanted to say that

1581
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,234
I'm sorry it took so long for me to...

1582
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,233
I love you, Dennis.

1583
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,310
It's all right. It's okay.

1584
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,593
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go do the stuff.

1585
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,076
So, that's it for all my stuff.

1586
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:59,953
If you want, you could give me
your key and I'll drop it off at Riggleman's.

1587
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,634
All right.

1588
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,749
Thanks.

1589
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:13,915
Gary.

1590
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:18,036
You know, there's a thousand things I...

1591
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,911
I would have done differently.

1592
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,115
Me, too.

1593
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:30,358
Sort of, actually, when I see this space,
I realise that if we didn't have

1594
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,069
such a big coffee table
and that oversized couch

1595
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:39,678
a pool table would have fit nicely.

1596
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:40,909
Yeah.

1597
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:46,475
Although the oversized couch did come in
very useful the last couple of weeks, so...

1598
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,232
Yes, it... I guess.

1599
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,239
Have a good trip.

1600
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:58,788
Thanks.

1601
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,236
<i>Chicago is called the Second City</i>

1602
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,392
<i>because after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,</i>

1603
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,152
<i>Chicago was rebuilt on its ruins.</i>

1604
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:18,755
<i>The city came back even bigger and stronger
than it originally was.</i>

1605
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,628
<i>So it's not really an insult,
it's more of a badge of honour to be called...</i>

1606
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,753
The Second City!

1607
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,238
<i>Okay. People, you might be able to get away</i>

1608
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:29,550
<i>with that reaction at work,
but you are on vacation here.</i>

then where the hell can you blow it out?</i>

1610
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,677
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
show me that you mean it.</i>

1612

<i>- Are you ready to see Chicago?
Yes!</i>

1613
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,550
<i>- I said, are you ready to see Chicago?
Yes!</i>

1614
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,758
<i>Are you ready to see Chicago?
Shondra, put this babe in the air.</i>

1615
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,829
<i>Let's go!</i>

1616
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,840
<i>There is a bar downstairs.
Please enjoy yourself.</i>

1617
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,956
<i>I know it's early in the morning,
but it is Chicago in the summer.</i>

1618
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:53,075
<i>Who are we kidding? It's fine.</i>

1619
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,912
<i>Go get hopped up,
make some bad decisions.</i>

1620
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,070
<i>My jokes get better.
The buildings look bigger.</i>

1621
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,679
It's not so important
that everything is finished.

1622
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,035
It's important that everything is right.

1623
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,190
Well, what time's the presentation?

1624
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:25,993
All right, I'll pick up the rest of the stuff
and I'll see you at 6:45.

1625
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,559
Great. Bye.

1626
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,035
Brooke!

1627
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,233
- Hi.
- Hi.

1628
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,949
Wow.

1629
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,673
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1630
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:48,913
I'd give you a hug, but my hands
are kind of full with all the bags here.

1631
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,470
- How've you been?
- I've been really good.

1632
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,915
- How have you been?
- I've been good.

1633
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,708
Yeah.

1634
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:00,597
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1635
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,797
- The hair's a little different. Looks nice.
- Yeah? Oh, yeah.

1636
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,156
- You've lost some weight.
- Well, it's very deceiving, actually.

1637
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:12,870
I've managed to become thin without having
any real muscle on me whatsoever.

1638
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,111
Very tough thing to accomplish, by the way.
I'm proud of myself.

1639
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,555
- Well, you look terrific.
- Thanks.

1640
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,871
- I heard your trip went really well.
- It did. It went really well.

1641
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,473
- Oh, good.
- It was fun. It was amazing.

1642
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,994
I saw so many amazing places. It was just...

1643
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,399
But, you know, you do realise
how much you love home.

1644
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:35,316
- It's good to have you back.
- Yeah. It's good to be back.

1645
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,952
- And the boat. Congratulations on the boat.
- Thanks.

1646
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,799
I'm waiting for it to get warm,
and I'm gonna come by and take a ride.

1647
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,599
Well, anytime you want.
It'll be on the house. Come on by.

1648
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,636
Well, I will, then.

1649
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,473
I hope you do.

1650
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:53,875
Definitely.

1651
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,439
Well, I got to... I'm going to a meeting, so...

1652
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:05,116
I got to drop these bags off anyway,
but it's really good to see you, Brooke.

1653
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,034
- Really good to see you.
- Shouldn't...

1654
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,199
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1655
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:13,477
I'm just saying we shouldn't
wait so long the next time before we...

1656
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,834
- Yeah.
- ...catch up.

1657
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,229
- We have a lot more to talk about.
- Yeah.

1658
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,635
So.

1659
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,398
- Be good.
- Okay.

1660
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,629
- Bye.
- Bye.
