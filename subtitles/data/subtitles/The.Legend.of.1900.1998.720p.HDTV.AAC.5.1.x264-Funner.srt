00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:08,012
I still ask myself
if I did the right thing

2
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:11,432
when I abandoned his floating city

3
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,269
And I don't mean only for the work

4
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:21,484
fact is, a friend like that
a real friend

5
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:24,696
you won't meet one again

6
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:28,449
If you just decide to
hang up your sea legs

7
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:32,829
if you just want to feel something
more solid beneath your feet

8
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:40,128
and if then you no loner hear
the music of the gods around you

9
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,591
But, like he used to say

10
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:49,679
You're never really done for
as long as you got a good story

11
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:52,140
and someone to tell it to

12
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,144
Trouble is

13
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,274
nobody'd believe
a single word of my story

14
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:31,054
It happened every time

15
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:34,682
Someone would look up and see her

16
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,310
It's difficult to understand

17
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,397
There'd be more than
a thousand of us on that ship

18
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:47,237
Traveling rich folks, immigrants
and strange people, and us

19
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,781
Yet there was always one

20
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:54,702
One guy alone
who would see her first

21
00:02:55,286 --> 00:03:00,208
Maybe he was just sitting there
eating or walking on the deck

22
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:04,754
Maybe he was just fixing his pants

23
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:09,509
He'd look up for a second. A quick
glance out to sea and he'd see her

24
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:14,973
Then he'd just stand there rooted
to the spot, his heart racing

25
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:20,853
And every time
every damn time, I swear

26
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:27,110
he'd turn to us, towards the ship
towards everybody and scream

27
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,487
America

28
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:46,838
The Legend of 1900

29
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,164
New York

30
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:14,050
The one who sees America first

31
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,344
There's one on every ship

32
00:05:16,344 --> 00:05:18,888
And don't be thinking
it's an accident

33
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:23,309
Or some optical illusion
It's destiny

34
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,228
Those are people who always

35
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:30,441
have that precise instant
stamped on their life

36
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:34,612
And when they were kids
you could look into their eyes

37
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:40,201
and if you looked carefully enough
you'd already see her

38
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,996
America

39
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,631
And I've seen a few Americas

40
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:57,594
Six years on that ship
five crossings a year

41
00:05:57,594 --> 00:06:03,600
Europe, America and
back always soaking in the ocean

42
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,893
When you stepped on land

43
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,605
you couldn't even
piss straight in the john

44
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:11,816
It was teady. The john, I mean

45
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:14,360
But you'd keep
bobbing like an idiot

46
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:20,033
You can get off a ship all right
But off the ocean

47
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:21,576
I was just closing

48
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:24,204
What can I do for you?

49
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:29,459
When I boarded, I was 24 years old

50
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:33,129
And I only cared
about one thing in life

51
00:06:34,672 --> 00:06:36,758
Playing the trumpet

52
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:43,181
I'm selling it

53
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,479
Conn

54
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:51,606
Not bad

55
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,697
Best brass money can buy

56
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:06,955
Six pounds, ten shillings
Best I can do

57
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:09,332
That horn's my whole life, mister

58
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:11,042
Even being a nobody

59
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:13,628
has got to be worth
more than twenty lousy bucks

60
00:07:13,628 --> 00:07:18,841
It that's how things are, I suppose
it's barely worth half a crown

61
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:22,345
Shut the door when you leave
please

62
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:29,018
Okay, pops

63
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,646
you win

64
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,860
You just bought yourself
a piece of musical history

65
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,864
Now if you want my advice

66
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,413
got out, treat yourself
to a decent meal

67
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,726
At least let me play it
one last time

68
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,979
Young man
I don't have time to waste

69
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:16,566
All right

70
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:19,527
Hurry up, then

71
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,071
I'm closing

72
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,698
Thank you

73
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:49,492
Two peas in a pod, wouldn't you say

74
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,204
It's the music
you were just playing

75
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:54,664
What is it?

76
00:09:58,042 --> 00:09:59,836
It doesn't have a name

77
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:06,885
Just a handful of people have
had the privilege of hearing it

78
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:16,269
That style. I was wondering
since this morning, but...

79
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:22,025
I can't work out
who this amazing piano player is

80
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:24,152
I don't think you ever heard of him

81
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:25,153
Who is he?

82
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:30,199
If I told you
this pianist never existed

83
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,743
I wouldn't be lying

84
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:33,369
I don't like secrets

85
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:38,499
Come on now, Yank
who the devil is playing?

86
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,669
That's my secret

87
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:57,810
It was the first year
of this frigging century

88
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,523
as defined by an unknown colored
coal stoker on the Virginian

89
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:05,485
Fucking rich-ass bastards
Can't lose nothing

90
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:09,155
but cigarette butts
and dirty-ass handkerchiefs

91
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:13,785
Can't lose no watch

92
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:17,121
not even a beat-up Elgin
or a sorry-ass cufflink

93
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:21,626
What am I talking about?
Not even a fake fucking ring

94
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:24,170
Look here

95
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,256
A whole cigar

96
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:28,925
Must've been somebody poor
at the party

97
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,303
Look at this shit

98
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,347
Nasty fucker

99
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:40,687
Damn rich. Don't forget nothing
unless they owe you some money

100
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,237
What in the scuts you doing here?

101
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:54,492
"T.D. Lemons"

102
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:06,963
Howdy do there, Lemon

103
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,631
Immigrant bastard

104
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,885
You said it
That's the way the immigrants do it

105
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:13,136
Have a baby on the ship

106
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:16,472
and then leave on board
another mouth to feed

107
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:20,351
And, like that, avoid trouble
with the immigration office

108
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,146
What's a boy like him
going to be when he grows up?

109
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:25,023
Another immigrant

110
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:28,693
Don't pay those bastards no mind
Lemon

111
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:30,737
Go on, lap it up, boy

112
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:35,158
This one they left in first class
on top the piano

113
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:37,285
They are hoping
some rich guy will come

114
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:39,787
and stick a silver spoon
in his mouth

115
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:41,956
And who does
the little ape get instead?

116
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:44,375
A poor coal stoker

117
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,629
Someoe is taking you
for a sucker, Danny

118
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,091
They have the fun
You have the misery

119
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:54,469
Fuck poverty

120
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,013
You stinking sewer rats

121
00:12:57,013 --> 00:13:00,683
T.D. was wrote on that box. Any of
you shitheads know what that means?

122
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:03,061
I forgot. You all can't read

123
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:05,521
It means, "Thanks, Danny."
"Thanks, Danny"

124
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:07,357
They left him for me
and I'm gonna keep him

125
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:09,234
Rest of you all
can go fuck yourselves

126
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:13,947
Danny, what are you going
to call the nino?

127
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:16,699
Hell, I ain't think about that

128
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:21,371
To start off
I'm going to name him after me

129
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:23,373
Danny Boodman

130
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:24,916
Then I'll put "T.D." in the middle

131
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:29,045
Iike rich folks puts that
in the middle, don't you think?

132
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,506
That give it class, to put that
in the middle, don't you think?

133
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:35,385
All fucking lawyers gots initials
in the middle of their names

134
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:38,721
Well, my lawyer
was Jonathan PTK Wonder

135
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:42,225
My son grow up to be a lawyer
I swear I'll kikk him myself

136
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:46,396
But the boy's name is still going
to be Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon

137
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:49,232
He ain't the son of
no fucking duke, Danny

138
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:53,236
You found him on a Tuesday
Call him "Tuesday"

139
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,574
You ain't as dumb as you look
colored boy

140
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,534
I found him the first month

141
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,996
of the first year
of this frigging new century

142
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:07,041
So I calls him: Nineteen Hundred

143
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,628
Nineteen Hundred?
But that's a number

144
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:12,755
It was a number, now it's a name

145
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:18,636
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon
Nineteen Hundred

146
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:22,098
Danny, your little bambino
is not so happy

147
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:26,144
Come on, hurry. Hurry up
Don't worry, your mama's here

148
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:34,903
Damn. How can something
that small shit so much?

149
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:42,327
And that's how
little Nineteen Hundred grew up

150
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:45,747
Inside that cradle as big as a ship

151
00:14:45,747 --> 00:14:48,917
But since Danny was afraid
they'd take him away

152
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,212
on account of some business
concerning documents and visas

153
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:54,547
the boy lived his early years

154
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:58,259
always hiding
in the belly of the Virginian

155
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:21,032
Okay, now try one for yourself

156
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:24,160
Put your finder
up here against these words

157
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,538
so the letters can't run off on you

158
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:28,122
"Man"

159
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,542
All right, keep going

160
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:31,501
"Go"

161
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:33,503
Go on

162
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:34,796
"Ma"

163
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:36,214
Just a little bit more

164
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:37,882
"Ma"

165
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,511
Boy, you read like a god, Lemon

166
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:42,804
Now go on, put them all together

167
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:44,556
kind of like them boiler valves
Come on

168
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,650
"Man... go...Mama"

169
00:15:57,527 --> 00:16:00,530
Mango Mama. All right. Deep going

170
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:06,244
Yank...My...Chain

171
00:16:08,037 --> 00:16:10,790
Danny, why are you laughing so much

172
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,668
Because these are names of horses
Don't that make you laugh?

173
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:18,339
I"m just crazy about these horses'
names. Look at this one here

174
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,634
"Happy Hoofers"

175
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:25,221
Listen to this

176
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:29,309
"Sassy Lassy"

177
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:30,602
And this one

178
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:34,564
"Red Hot Mama"

179
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:38,359
What's a mama, Danny?

180
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,445
A mama?

181
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:44,365
A mama's a horse

182
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:45,617
A horse?

183
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:46,868
Racehorse

184
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:51,623
Matter of fact, you know what I say
Mama's the best horse in the world?

185
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,209
Thoroughbred
You bet on a mama, you always win

186
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,757
"Tano D'Amato

187
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:03,927
The King of Lemons"

188
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:07,180
Dad, put your finger here and read

189
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,101
T.D. doesn't mean "Thanks, Danny"

190
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:14,938
Who's this pansy ass?

191
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:17,106
That's enough reading for tonight

192
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:19,609
Too much reading is bad for you

193
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,779
What else is bad, Danny?

194
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,698
Everything off the Virginian is bad

195
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,577
Everything

196
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:32,163
They got sharks on the land
they eat you alive

197
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,456
You keep away from they, you hear?

198
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:37,210
Danny, what's an orphanage?

199
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,464
Well, a orphanage
is like a great big prison

200
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,633
where they lock up folks
that ain't got kids

201
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:49,847
So if I wasn't with you
they would put you in an orphanage?

202
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:52,308
You got that right, little Lemon

203
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:53,685
Night-night

204
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:31,014
Watch out, Danny

205
00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,194
Roll over. Roll him over

206
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:48,615
My God. Doctor

207
00:18:48,615 --> 00:18:52,118
Call the doctor. Get the doctor

208
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:54,621
Danny, you bloody cow. Talk to me

209
00:18:55,705 --> 00:18:59,542
Ain't nothing
but a pat on the back, boys

210
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:03,087
"Holy Shoot...

211
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:09,719
and Times Were Good

212
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:14,599
was disqualified

213
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:18,228
"Saucy Bossy"

214
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:22,899
It took him three days
to go toes up, old Danny

215
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:26,653
He let go
on the sixth race in Chicago

216
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:30,281
Drinkable Water
by two lengths over Vegetable Soup

217
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:33,618
and five over Blue Foudation

218
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:36,913
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death

219
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:39,749
I will fear no evil
for Thou art with me

220
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:42,126
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me"

221
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:46,297
"Thanks Danny"

222
00:19:47,382 --> 00:19:52,595
In the name of the Father and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost

223
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:54,222
Amen

224
00:20:09,153 --> 00:20:10,780
Music

225
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:26,588
Nineteen Hundred
was eight years old then

226
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:29,465
He'd made the trip
between Europe and America

227
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,718
about fifty times, I imagine

228
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,889
The ocean was his home

229
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:39,017
He never set foot on dry land
Never

230
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,978
Though he'd seen it
from the ports a hundred times

231
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:45,315
But he never got off the boat

232
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,858
Problem was

233
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:50,403
as far as the world was concerned
he didn't even exist

234
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:55,992
There wasn't a city, a parish
a hospital, jail or baseball team

235
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:58,494
that had his name any place

236
00:20:58,494 --> 00:21:04,250
He didn't have a country, he didn't
even have a birth date. No family

237
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,503
He was eight years old
but officially

238
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:09,923
he had never even been born

239
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,693
"No Entry"

240
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,435
Captain. Captain, wake up

241
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:34,901
What's his name?

242
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:36,986
Nineteen Hundred

243
00:23:37,737 --> 00:23:39,864
Not the song, the boy

244
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:41,908
Nineteen Hundred

245
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:43,618
Like the song

246
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:18,820
Nineteen Hundred, all of this
is entirely against the regulations

247
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:22,156
Fuck the regulations

248
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:28,872
But I don't understand

249
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,875
what the record
has to do with any of this

250
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,086
This record shouldn't exist

251
00:24:35,086 --> 00:24:39,424
The only existing matrix was
destroyed right after it was cut

252
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,176
This is a matrix

253
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:48,349
Quite handy for on-the-spot
recordings, that sort of business

254
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,687
How did you get your hands on this?

255
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,400
I spend the better part of the day

256
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,444
putting the bits
and pieces together

257
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:05,742
I found them by accident. Hidden
inside one of those two pianos

258
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:09,162
I bought them
from a second-hand dealer

259
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:12,290
They've emptied out an
old hospital ship down at Plymouth

260
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,178
It's over there, mate

261
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:22,944
Slow down
not so fast with that pulley

262
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:24,988
Easy up there, easy

263
00:26:24,988 --> 00:26:27,282
Watch that!
These aren't bananas, you know

264
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:54,350
Where are you from?
Liverpool

265
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,102
What do you do?
I'm a barber

266
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:58,104
Sign him on
Thanks very much

267
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:01,024
Next. What's your trade?

268
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:03,026
I'm a carpenter. A good mechanic

269
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:04,527
Get out

270
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,530
What do you do?

271
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,116
I play the trumpet

272
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:13,494
We've already
got musicians on board. Next

273
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,855
Where the hell is he going?

274
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:20,270
What's that?
I don't know

275
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,649
When you don't know what it is
it's jazz

276
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,778
It was the happiest day of my life

277
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:31,864
All those people
hope in their eyes

278
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:34,325
The goodbyes, the sirens

279
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:37,662
And that big floating world
starting to move

280
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:42,792
It felt like one big party
A huge bash, just for me

281
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:47,922
But just three days later, the
ocean got tired of the festivities

282
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:23,458
Hey, Conn?

283
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:26,044
What's the matter?

284
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:27,587
Lose your sea legs?

285
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:32,717
YOu're the new trumpet man
aren't you? And you blow a Conn

286
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:40,058
Come with me
I have a cure for your misery

287
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:41,559
Follow me

288
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:18,263
Take the brakes off, please

289
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:21,683
That's crazy

290
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:25,228
Trust me. Just take the brakes off

291
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:41,286
Hop on next to me

292
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,206
What are you, some kind of nut case

293
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:47,542
You better get on now
or you never will

294
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:22,118
Tell me something
do you have children?

295
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,623
They'll lock you up
in the orphanage one of these days

296
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,124
He's nuts

297
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:35,256
Oh, mama

298
00:31:35,256 --> 00:31:37,133
I see you know your horses

299
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:38,176
Just a litte

300
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:39,427
Good man

301
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:10,351
Good evening, Captain

302
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:11,811
Care for a ride?

303
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,736
Tell me again
how big the fucking window was

304
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:21,571
It was a big fucking window

305
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:27,911
We're going to be shoveling coal
on this ship till eternity

306
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:29,370
No shit

307
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:39,380
Least you know what you'll
be doing when you grow up

308
00:33:42,342 --> 00:33:43,676
Conn

309
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,347
You're from New Orleans, right?

310
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:49,140
How'd you know that?

311
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,268
I love that town

312
00:33:52,268 --> 00:33:55,563
Really?
I haven't been there in a while?

313
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,817
In winter, it's beautiful

314
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:03,321
And in March

315
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:08,409
you can always
count on one afternoon

316
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,079
when you least expect it

317
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:14,332
the fog slides in

318
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:16,459
a milky barrier

319
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:21,381
hangs just below the street lamps

320
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:23,800
It cuts everything off

321
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,555
Iike a white blade. And it's magic

322
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:32,308
Houses lose their top floors

323
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:35,144
trees lose their branches

324
00:34:35,144 --> 00:34:38,147
St. Louis Cathedral
loses its spires

325
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:41,150
People passing by
they lose their heads

326
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,696
So from the neck up
everything disappears

327
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:46,781
All you can see in Jackson Square

328
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:50,159
is decapitated bodies
stumbling around

329
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,164
bumping into each other saying
"How's your mama and them?"

330
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:58,126
That's it
Too bad it doesn't last long

331
00:34:58,126 --> 00:35:01,170
How do you know all these things?

332
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:08,720
You know ever since I came on board

333
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,472
I been hearing
a lot of talk about a guy

334
00:35:11,472 --> 00:35:15,393
He's supposed to
have been born on this ship

335
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:17,937
and never been off it since

336
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:20,481
Crazy story

337
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:22,901
Twenty years without
ever setting foot on land?

338
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:24,068
Twenty seven

339
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:28,740
They say this guy makes music
that's never been heard before

340
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,575
I've heard of him too

341
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:34,871
First off
I thought you were the guy

342
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,624
But then something didn't add up

343
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:41,169
I figured: if he's Nineteen Hundred

344
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:44,297
how could he
know New Orleans so well?

345
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:48,468
Because you've been to New Orleans

346
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:52,680
If I told you I'd never set foot
in that town, would you believe me?

347
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:58,686
Whoever you are

348
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:00,939
Max Tooney

349
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,941
Gald to meet you

350
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:17,038
How we doing?

351
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:19,624
We're supposed to blow it up

352
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:23,086
not wait for it
to be eaten by the fishes

353
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:25,588
You're not going to
blow up a goddamn thing

354
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:28,925
because my best friend is
on this ship

355
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:30,927
You'll all
be responsible for murder

356
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:34,847
Get him out of here! Do whatever
you want, but get him off my case

357
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:37,559
I'm not making this up
and I'm not crazy

358
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,894
If I tell you there's a man
aboard the Virginian

359
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:43,314
Jesus Christ, it means
there's a man aboard the Virginian

360
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:46,150
We cleaned that scuttle
from stem to stern

361
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,113
Not even doorknobs were left
Only dynamite. Dynamite

362
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:51,906
How can you be so sure
that's a man on board?

363
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:53,866
If you've any proof, out with it

364
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:56,202
Because I'm the horse's arse
who has to throw that switch

365
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:58,204
I'm sure he's there

366
00:36:59,247 --> 00:37:02,500
I spent the best years of my life
on the Virginian

367
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:40,246
End of line

368
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:05,271
All right! Run it down

369
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:49,626
What the hell do you think about
when you're playing?

370
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:53,296
Where does your mind go
when you hit the keys?

371
00:39:54,088 --> 00:39:56,799
Last night
I was in a beautiful country

372
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:01,137
Women had perfume in their hair
Everything glowed

373
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,349
And it was full of tigers

374
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:08,728
He traveled. And each time
he ended up someplace different

375
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:12,899
In the heart of London, on a train
in the middle of the country

376
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:18,321
on the edge of a giant volcano
in the biggest church in the world

377
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:22,700
counting the columns
and staring up at the crucifixes

378
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,328
He traveled

379
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:29,415
Hey, Kid, give us a good tarantella

380
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:32,794
And you show me
how a tarantella goes paisa

381
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:42,238
America

382
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,555
Why the hell don't you get off?

383
00:42:07,555 --> 00:42:10,308
Just once? One time?

384
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,061
See the world for yourself

385
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,313
with your own eyes?

386
00:42:17,941 --> 00:42:21,194
You ever think about it?
You could do anything you wanted to

387
00:42:21,194 --> 00:42:24,155
People would go crazy for you

388
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:28,451
You could make beaucoup bucks, man

389
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:31,329
Get yourself the finest house

390
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,207
Get yourself a wife

391
00:42:34,207 --> 00:42:35,667
Why not?

392
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:43,299
God knows you can't
spend the rest of your life

393
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,677
traveling back and forth
like some yo-yo

394
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:47,512
The world is out there

395
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:50,640
Nothing but a gangplank to cross

396
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,269
And what's a gangplank?
A few stupid steps

397
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:58,898
Christ, everything is waiting
at the bottom of those steps

398
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:00,483
Why don't you just do it

399
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:02,860
one time?

400
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,281
Why don't you just get off?

401
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,166
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

402
00:43:18,668 --> 00:43:21,045
I think land people

403
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,507
waste a lot of time wondering why

404
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:29,095
Winter comes
and you can't wait for summer

405
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:33,099
Summer comes
and you live in dread of winter

406
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:35,810
That's way
you never tire of traveling

407
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,731
Always chasing someplace far away

408
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:41,399
where it's always summer

409
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:47,155
Doesn't sound like a good bet to me

410
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:02,795
Hold it! Stop everything

411
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:22,625
Forgive me for allowing myself
to your music was so strong

412
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:44,772
You don't look too happy
to be going to America

413
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:46,316
It's not America

414
00:45:52,947 --> 00:45:55,074
It's everything I leave behind

415
00:45:55,825 --> 00:46:00,038
Until a few years ago
I know only my field

416
00:46:00,038 --> 00:46:02,498
The world for me
started and ended there

417
00:46:02,498 --> 00:46:04,834
in that little piece of the land

418
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:08,087
I never walked down
the main street of a city

419
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,258
Maybe you can't understand but

420
00:46:13,134 --> 00:46:14,969
I understand perfectly

421
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,142
I know someone who
went through something very similar

422
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:24,562
And one fine day
did his field go dry too?

423
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:27,941
And did his wife
also run off with a priest?

424
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:36,199
And did the fever
take his five children?

425
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,952
No. But he ended up alone too

426
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:42,997
Then he is more lucky than me

427
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:47,669
I still have a daughter
The young one

428
00:46:47,669 --> 00:46:49,379
She survived

429
00:46:49,379 --> 00:46:55,301
And it's for her that I decide one
day to fight against my bad luck

430
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:58,680
and travel all over
without a destination

431
00:46:59,973 --> 00:47:01,641
And then one day

432
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:07,230
when I go through one of the
many towns I never see before

433
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:10,024
I come to a hill

434
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:15,655
And then I see
the most beautiful thing in my life

435
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:18,449
The sea

436
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:20,451
The sea?

437
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:22,370
I never see it before

438
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:31,045
It was liek lightning hit me
Because I hear the voice

439
00:47:31,045 --> 00:47:32,297
The voice of the sea?

440
00:47:32,297 --> 00:47:35,508
Yeah, the voice of the sea

441
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:38,553
I never heard it

442
00:47:39,888 --> 00:47:43,349
The voice of the sea
it is like a shout

443
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:48,021
A shout big and strong
screaming and screaming

444
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,565
And the thing it was screaming was:

445
00:47:50,565 --> 00:47:52,567
You

446
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:58,656
with shit instead brains

447
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:03,161
Iife is immense
can you understand that?

448
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:05,997
Immense

449
00:48:06,623 --> 00:48:09,083
I never think of it that way

450
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:12,170
A revolution was in my head

451
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,716
That's how I suddenly
decide to change my life

452
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:20,386
to start fresh

453
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:24,599
Change life. Start fresh

454
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:26,392
Tell that to your friend

455
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:28,728
Nineteen Hundred

456
00:48:29,854 --> 00:48:33,608
Nineteen Hundred

457
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:38,404
It's Max Tooney, your friend

458
00:48:38,404 --> 00:48:42,825
Come on out, Nineteen Hundred!
I'm your friend too

459
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:45,119
Even if we never met

460
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,956
Don't worry, no cops

461
00:48:58,758 --> 00:49:01,761
You said something about a piano
Where was it exactly?

462
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:03,429
We found it over there

463
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:11,688
Nineteen Hundred

464
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:17,485
On the violin
yours truly, Bill Douglas

465
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,073
Tuba and bass, Freddie Loycano

466
00:49:23,283 --> 00:49:25,952
Max Tooney on trumpet

467
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:30,790
And finally, on piano

468
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,669
Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Hundred

469
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:36,713
the greatest

470
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:45,972
For the last time
Nineteen Hundred, just...

471
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:47,724
just the normal notes

472
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:49,559
End of the line

473
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:34,354
Where do yu get it?

474
00:50:35,939 --> 00:50:36,814
What?

475
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:38,149
The music

476
00:50:38,149 --> 00:50:41,653
I don't know. You see
that woman over there, for example?

477
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:47,242
She looks like someone

478
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:50,787
who's killed her husband
with the help of her lover

479
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:53,748
And now she's running off
with the family jewels

480
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:55,750
Don't you think this music's her?

481
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,877
Damn, it's true

482
00:51:01,422 --> 00:51:03,341
You see that guy over there?

483
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,511
He can't forget a thing

484
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:10,431
Listen to his music

485
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:15,311
His nead bursts with memories and
there's nothing he can do about it

486
00:51:20,984 --> 00:51:22,527
And look at that one there

487
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,990
She looks like a prostitute
who's thinking of becoming a nun

488
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:32,912
That's incredible

489
00:51:40,753 --> 00:51:42,213
Now, look at this one

490
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:44,757
See how he walks?

491
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:58,313
I'd say he's in someone else's suit

492
00:51:59,272 --> 00:52:01,524
judging by the way he wears it

493
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:11,910
I'd say he's a stowaway
slipped into first class

494
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,329
Iooking for an amorous adventure

495
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:19,083
This one's got America
stamped on his eyes

496
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,169
I can already hear him screaming

497
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:26,507
America!

498
00:52:34,349 --> 00:52:35,600
I'm going to get my money back

499
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,851
That'll be the day

500
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:33,950
Singleton, Lee Claire

501
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:53,761
You don't know me

502
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:57,181
But I was wondering
if we could have a little chat

503
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,435
A little chat? What about?

504
00:54:00,435 --> 00:54:03,313
About anything you like
Weather conditions?

505
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:05,773
Anything
You pick or chuck the subject

506
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:08,318
Is this an obscene phone call?

507
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:12,864
Christ

508
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:19,913
You the fish
with the twenty-dollar name?

509
00:54:19,913 --> 00:54:22,040
Man, where you going?
We got to talk

510
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:32,759
That way

511
00:54:32,759 --> 00:54:35,386
Wait, we just want to talk to you

512
00:54:36,304 --> 00:54:38,223
Where the hell are we, man?

513
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:41,476
Hold still
you little son of a bitch

514
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:45,939
Come on out!
We don't want to hurt you

515
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:49,567
We're players, man! Sidemen

516
00:55:01,788 --> 00:55:03,248
Bon appetie

517
00:55:03,248 --> 00:55:07,126
You can say that again, brother
You can say that again

518
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:17,595
You the one that plays
ten kinds ofjazz rolled into one?

519
00:55:17,595 --> 00:55:20,640
I've never counted them
I'm just a piano player

520
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,228
Better start counting, buddy. The
man who invented jazz sent us here

521
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:26,396
Really?

522
00:55:27,272 --> 00:55:28,231
What does he want with me?

523
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:31,734
He challenges you to a piano duel

524
00:55:40,451 --> 00:55:43,788
Jello Roll, what's the reason
for a trip to Europe on a steamer

525
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:45,290
when you've never been on anything

526
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,875
bigger than
a Mississippi riverboat?

527
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,460
I don't give a damn about Europe

528
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,838
The only reason
I'm hopping this crappy tub

529
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,299
is because there's a gentleman
I want to meet

530
00:55:54,299 --> 00:55:57,844
They say he plays a hot piano

531
00:56:00,638 --> 00:56:04,058
But I hear he has a little thing
about setting foot on land

532
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:06,269
Is he talking about me?

533
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:08,479
You bet he's talking about you

534
00:56:08,479 --> 00:56:10,773
He say, Hey, Jelly

535
00:56:10,773 --> 00:56:14,777
Someone plays better piano than you

536
00:56:15,987 --> 00:56:20,867
So I say to myself, Self
how can this cat play so well

537
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,913
when he don't even have the balls
to get off the goddamn ship

538
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:26,998
Hey, hot damn, Jelly

539
00:56:26,998 --> 00:56:30,376
You invented jazz

540
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,841
I said, Goddamn you can afford
a first-class ticket to Europe

541
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:38,718
and the boat
that's going to take you

542
00:56:38,718 --> 00:56:43,097
just by lifting a finger
Get a shot of it, boys, get a shot

543
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:46,684
Tell the truth. Are you scared?

544
00:56:46,684 --> 00:56:48,144
I don't know

545
00:56:49,103 --> 00:56:53,149
Why a duel?
What happens when you have a duel?

546
00:57:02,492 --> 00:57:05,370
I hope this Jelly Roll Morton guy
is as good as they say

547
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,664
Heard a lot about him
back in the States

548
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,110
He's a Negro

549
00:58:54,103 --> 00:58:56,064
I believe

550
00:58:56,064 --> 00:58:58,399
you're sitting in my seat

551
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:10,537
You're the one
who invented jazz, right?

552
00:59:10,537 --> 00:59:12,580
That's what they say

553
00:59:13,498 --> 00:59:15,416
And you're the one

554
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:20,838
who can't play unless you
have the ocean under your ass?

555
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:22,757
That's what I say

556
00:59:32,058 --> 00:59:35,853
(Franch)

557
01:00:15,184 --> 01:00:17,478
Jelly Roll Morton did not play

558
01:00:17,478 --> 01:00:19,856
He caressed those notes

559
01:00:19,856 --> 01:00:23,776
It sounded like a silk slip
sliding down a woman's body

560
01:00:23,776 --> 01:00:27,780
His hands were butterflies
so light

561
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,784
He got his start in the famed
tenderloin districts of New Orleans

562
01:00:31,784 --> 01:00:35,705
And did he learn to stroke
the keyboard in those whorehouses

563
01:00:35,705 --> 01:00:39,125
People doing the deed upstairs
didn't want any uproar

564
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:43,755
They wanted music to slip behind
the curtains and under the beds

565
01:00:43,755 --> 01:00:46,090
without disturbing the passion

566
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,509
That's the kind of music he played

567
01:00:48,509 --> 01:00:49,719
And in that

568
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:53,306
he truly was the best

569
01:01:18,289 --> 01:01:21,417
Bravo!

570
01:01:43,481 --> 01:01:46,818
Your turn, sailor

571
01:02:01,124 --> 01:02:02,500
Come on

572
01:02:28,276 --> 01:02:29,694
What's he doing?

573
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:36,868
"Silent Night"?

574
01:02:36,868 --> 01:02:38,745
Isn't that a Christmas carol?

575
01:02:38,745 --> 01:02:41,539
Does he understand it's a contest?

576
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:43,875
"Silenet Night" is jazz?

577
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:46,169
Is it Christmas already?

578
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:12,403
Come on, Jelly Roll
show us what jazz is all about

579
01:04:07,584 --> 01:04:10,086
What is wrong with you?

580
01:04:10,086 --> 01:04:13,590
I can't help it. Music makes me cry

581
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:17,802
The whole crew bet on you
I put a year's pay on the line

582
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:22,348
Now you cut that out
and start thinking your music

583
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:23,308
Can I bet too?

584
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:25,018
No!

585
01:04:25,018 --> 01:04:27,395
It's bad luck to bet on yourself

586
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:30,940
I don't want to bet on me. I want
to bet on him. He's the greatest

587
01:04:32,609 --> 01:04:34,444
You are crazy, you know taht?

588
01:04:34,444 --> 01:04:37,530
That way, if you lose
you'll get your money back

589
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:36,839
It's exactly
the same piece of music, darling

590
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,847
This is really the end of the line

591
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:49,852
Unbelievable

592
01:06:15,587 --> 01:06:18,006
Come on
you can do better than that

593
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,888
Jelly, show them how to sink a ship

594
01:06:31,436 --> 01:06:33,771
You stick this up your ass

595
01:07:30,787 --> 01:07:31,996
Hey, Max

596
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,041
Give me a cigarette, will you?

597
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:37,293
You're not handling this well

598
01:07:37,293 --> 01:07:38,711
Just give me a cigarette

599
01:07:38,711 --> 01:07:41,005
You don't smoke

600
01:07:41,005 --> 01:07:45,552
What is the matter with you? You
could lick this guy with one hand

601
01:07:45,552 --> 01:07:47,136
Come on

602
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,572
Are you going to
give me a cigarette?

603
01:08:05,572 --> 01:08:08,032
We'll be chucking coal
a couple hundred years

604
01:08:08,032 --> 01:08:09,117
and all you can say is...

605
01:08:09,117 --> 01:08:11,578
Give me a fucking cigarette
will you?

606
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:35,351
You asked for it, asshole

607
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:29,150
You smoke it

608
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:31,069
I don't know how

609
01:12:22,787 --> 01:12:27,083
Jelly Roll Morton spend the rest
of that trip locked in his cabin

610
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:28,501
When we got to Southampton

611
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:31,963
he got off the Virginian
and went back to America

612
01:12:31,963 --> 01:12:36,801
I remember Nineteen Hundred watched
him as he walked off down the dock

613
01:12:36,801 --> 01:12:38,970
and all he said was

614
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,722
Fuck jazz too

615
01:12:43,641 --> 01:12:46,978
And that's just what he said
"Fuck jazz too"

616
01:12:46,978 --> 01:12:49,397
This is an incredible story

617
01:12:49,397 --> 01:12:51,107
Did I miss anything important?

618
01:12:51,107 --> 01:12:52,108
You couldn say that

619
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:53,401
Damn

620
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:56,654
Don't worry, our friend
will fill you in later. Won't you?

621
01:12:56,654 --> 01:12:57,614
You can count on it

622
01:12:57,614 --> 01:13:01,326
Thanks
He's so good at telling tales

623
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:02,994
This is no tale, sir

624
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:04,329
There's nobody here

625
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:06,414
Because there's too many of us
We scared him

626
01:13:06,414 --> 01:13:11,085
You leave this ship
or I'll have to have you arrested

627
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:13,087
Get back to work. Quickly

628
01:13:14,672 --> 01:13:15,673
Give me another chance

629
01:13:15,673 --> 01:13:19,636
Piss off, friend. Noon tomorrow
this ship is history

630
01:13:29,562 --> 01:13:30,855
Stop or I'll shoot

631
01:13:30,855 --> 01:13:32,440
Gotcha

632
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,276
Pops, easy, it's me

633
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:39,322
You again?

634
01:13:39,322 --> 01:13:40,990
Yes, lower that cannon, will you?

635
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:44,035
See your instrument
and then steal it back again

636
01:13:44,035 --> 01:13:47,330
That's an old trick. I should have
guessed that you were a thief

637
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,624
I was looking for this

638
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:51,709
And what do you need that for?

639
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:54,712
It's a matter of life and death
And I need a phonograph too

640
01:13:54,712 --> 01:13:55,880
A thief and a liar

641
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,049
Pops
I don't have a whole lot of time

642
01:13:58,049 --> 01:14:01,386
Well, I do! Seeing as I have a gun

643
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:02,637
And now that I think of it

644
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:06,224
since when were records
made on board steamships

645
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:08,059
If that music
was played by your friend

646
01:14:08,059 --> 01:14:12,480
it means that at some time in his
life he got off that ship! Correct?

647
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,357
Not a chance, pops

648
01:14:14,357 --> 01:14:17,318
He cut this passionate
recording personally

649
01:14:17,318 --> 01:14:19,237
I think it's his best work

650
01:14:19,237 --> 01:14:23,408
But he didn't jump ship
to do it not even for a second

651
01:14:23,408 --> 01:14:26,452
The sky's the limit
Mr. Nineteen Hundred

652
01:14:26,452 --> 01:14:30,582
If this record sells like hotcakes
and we think it will

653
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:33,126
you'll go far, Mr. Nineteen

654
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:36,212
Do you mind if I call you Nineteen?

655
01:14:36,212 --> 01:14:37,505
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

656
01:14:37,505 --> 01:14:38,923
Ready now, gentelmen

657
01:14:38,923 --> 01:14:43,928
On the count. And one, two, three

658
01:17:39,938 --> 01:17:42,315
Nineteen

659
01:17:42,315 --> 01:17:48,488
That is one amazing piece of music
What is it called?

660
01:17:48,488 --> 01:17:51,950
It's going to
have people crying buckets

661
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:55,537
It's got to have the right title
though, something catchy like

662
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:58,289
"Swinging in the Breeze" or...

663
01:17:58,289 --> 01:18:00,416
Great, as usual

664
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,085
"Sweet Nineteen," that's it

665
01:18:02,085 --> 01:18:04,504
You are going to be bigtime

666
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:07,799
And all you got to do is
take that big step

667
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:13,471
What big step?

668
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:17,267
Getting off. Getting off
these lousy planks of wood

669
01:18:17,267 --> 01:18:19,811
and going after...

670
01:18:19,811 --> 01:18:23,314
going after your fame and fortune

671
01:18:23,314 --> 01:18:27,110
I don't mean to butt in
fellas, but

672
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:31,364
with this
you can have anything you want

673
01:18:31,364 --> 01:18:35,034
and never have to
set foot off this boat

674
01:18:50,008 --> 01:18:53,887
We'll print millions of copies

675
01:18:53,887 --> 01:18:56,681
so that people all over the world

676
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:59,934
can hear your wonderful music
Nineteen

677
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:02,687
Mr. Nineteen?

678
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:05,523
I won't let my music
go anywhere without me

679
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:08,693
No! Don't touch

680
01:19:08,693 --> 01:19:10,361
What are you doing?
You can't do that

681
01:19:10,361 --> 01:19:13,406
We have a contract
You can't go back now

682
01:19:14,157 --> 01:19:15,700
I always go back

683
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,366
Darling
what are you going to America for?

684
01:20:14,717 --> 01:20:16,427
Miss

685
01:20:19,138 --> 01:20:24,394
I'd be pleased if...

686
01:20:35,196 --> 01:20:36,781
Miss

687
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:44,122
I'd be thrilled

688
01:20:46,624 --> 01:20:48,960
if yu'd accept this...

689
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:54,465
small token

690
01:22:04,744 --> 01:22:08,414
Miss Padoan, what are you doing
here all alone? Counting the waves?

691
01:22:08,414 --> 01:22:11,543
The captain said we'd be
passing the Tropic of Cancer soon

692
01:22:11,543 --> 01:22:14,212
Great! At least
we'll have something to look at

693
01:22:14,212 --> 01:22:17,715
You ever notice how the sea
changes colors? Ten times a day

694
01:22:17,715 --> 01:22:19,175
Even more

695
01:22:20,176 --> 01:22:21,970
I could look at the sea
all day long

696
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,888
You know
farmers don't ever look at the sea

697
01:22:23,888 --> 01:22:26,599
It scares them
At least that's what I heard

698
01:22:26,599 --> 01:22:29,060
That's not true

699
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:33,690
Once, my father told me
he heard the ocean's voice

700
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:36,734
Really? What did it say?

701
01:22:36,734 --> 01:22:41,155
I can't tell you. It's a secret
And secrets should be kept

702
01:22:41,155 --> 01:22:44,909
Gosh, it's really coming down now
Let's get back inside

703
01:22:46,202 --> 01:22:47,871
Let me take your arm

704
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:49,140
Women's dormitory 3 class

705
01:26:55,952 --> 01:26:57,328
Next

706
01:27:00,999 --> 01:27:02,083
Next

707
01:27:13,011 --> 01:27:14,012
Excuse me

708
01:27:16,848 --> 01:27:18,266
Excuse me

709
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:20,852
Excuse me

710
01:27:22,061 --> 01:27:23,354
Please, miss

711
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:28,192
I have to talk to you

712
01:27:29,652 --> 01:27:32,697
You're meeting your father
aren't you?

713
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:34,365
Yes

714
01:27:34,365 --> 01:27:36,117
How did you know?

715
01:27:36,117 --> 01:27:37,952
I think I've met him

716
01:27:41,497 --> 01:27:43,541
On this ship

717
01:27:43,541 --> 01:27:45,335
quite a few years ago

718
01:27:46,211 --> 01:27:49,297
I don't know
if he took this same ship

719
01:27:49,297 --> 01:27:51,966
I'm sure of it

720
01:27:53,885 --> 01:27:57,180
He has a musette

721
01:27:58,598 --> 01:28:00,683
I think we played together

722
01:28:01,893 --> 01:28:05,230
I don't know if he'd remember, but

723
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,689
say hello to him

724
01:28:06,689 --> 01:28:08,149
I will

725
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:12,779
But how did you know who I was?
It's very strange, no?

726
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:14,614
It's a secret

727
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:19,244
And secrets should be kept

728
01:28:19,244 --> 01:28:22,372
Although I think your father
felt differently back then

729
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:49,023
Please accept this...

730
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,567
small musical token

731
01:28:50,567 --> 01:28:53,736
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you

732
01:28:54,612 --> 01:28:57,282
I want you to...

733
01:28:57,282 --> 01:29:01,619
accept this small token

734
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:03,913
I can't hear you

735
01:29:08,793 --> 01:29:10,295
Good luck

736
01:29:10,295 --> 01:29:13,131
Thank you. Good luck to you too

737
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:16,801
Why don't you come
and visit us some day?

738
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:19,971
We live on Mott Street. Number 27

739
01:29:19,971 --> 01:29:22,599
My father has a fish shop

740
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:25,059
Maybe

741
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,568
Padoan, okay. Next

742
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:34,819
Next

743
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:15,568
He never mentioned her to me again
And I never asked

744
01:30:15,568 --> 01:30:18,696
At least
not for the next twelve crossings

745
01:30:18,696 --> 01:30:22,033
Besides, he was happy
just like always

746
01:30:22,033 --> 01:30:25,078
His popularity was its peak

747
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:27,413
Then, one evening in spring

748
01:30:27,413 --> 01:30:32,377
halfway between Genoa and New York
right it the middle of the ocean

749
01:30:32,377 --> 01:30:35,380
In three days
when we get to New York

750
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:39,008
I'm getting off this ship

751
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:43,429
Cat got your tongue?

752
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:49,894
I'm glad

753
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:51,980
But all of a sudden?

754
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:57,402
My man...

755
01:30:57,402 --> 01:30:58,778
That's aces

756
01:30:58,778 --> 01:31:00,572
I've got to
see something down there

757
01:31:00,572 --> 01:31:02,031
What?

758
01:31:02,031 --> 01:31:03,700
The ocean

759
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:10,707
You're pulling my leg

760
01:31:10,707 --> 01:31:13,626
You've seen nothing but the ocean
since the day you were born

761
01:31:13,626 --> 01:31:15,420
But from here

762
01:31:17,046 --> 01:31:20,133
I want to see it from there
It's not the same thing at all

763
01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:22,135
Wait till we dock
lean over the side

764
01:31:22,135 --> 01:31:25,096
take a good look
It's the same thing

765
01:31:25,096 --> 01:31:27,765
No, it's not

766
01:31:27,765 --> 01:31:31,895
From land, you can hear its voice
You don't hear that from a ship

767
01:31:32,896 --> 01:31:35,106
What do you mean, its voice?

768
01:31:35,106 --> 01:31:37,066
Its voice

769
01:31:40,778 --> 01:31:42,572
It's like...

770
01:31:44,449 --> 01:31:46,784
a big scream...

771
01:31:48,286 --> 01:31:52,624
telling you that life is immense

772
01:31:52,624 --> 01:31:58,171
Once you've heard it, then you know
what you have to do to go on living

773
01:31:58,171 --> 01:32:02,091
I could stay here forever

774
01:32:02,091 --> 01:32:06,262
But the ocean
would never tell me a thing

775
01:32:07,347 --> 01:32:11,226
But if I get off
live on land for a couple of years

776
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:13,519
then I'll be normal

777
01:32:13,519 --> 01:32:16,189
just like the others

778
01:32:16,189 --> 01:32:22,362
Then maybe one day, I'll make it
to the coast look up, see the ocean

779
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:25,657
and hear it scream

780
01:32:25,657 --> 01:32:28,159
I don't know who's been
telling you this bullshit

781
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,119
or if you're just making it up

782
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:31,871
But you want to know what I think?

783
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:34,165
I think...

784
01:32:34,165 --> 01:32:39,170
the real reason
you want off this ship is the girl

785
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:41,214
It's always the girl

786
01:32:41,214 --> 01:32:44,884
But even if it's not the reason
that suits me just fine

787
01:32:44,884 --> 01:32:47,929
Because I've always wanted you
to leave this ship

788
01:32:47,929 --> 01:32:49,931
and play for the people on land

789
01:32:49,931 --> 01:32:53,560
and marry a nice woman
and have children

790
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:59,774
and all those things
in life which are not immense

791
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,193
but are worth the effort

792
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:08,199
You'll come visit me
won't you, Max? On land?

793
01:33:08,199 --> 01:33:09,826
Of course

794
01:33:11,661 --> 01:33:16,499
That way, you'll introduce me
to the mother of your children

795
01:33:16,499 --> 01:33:19,669
And invite me for Sunday dinner

796
01:33:19,669 --> 01:33:22,797
I'll bring the dessert
and a bottle of wine

797
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:26,217
and you'll tell me I shouldn't have

798
01:33:26,217 --> 01:33:31,890
and while you're showing me around
your house shaped like a ship

799
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:34,517
your wife will be cooking a turkey

800
01:33:34,517 --> 01:33:35,977
And then we'll sit at the table

801
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:39,772
and I'll tell her
she's an excellent cook

802
01:33:39,772 --> 01:33:43,776
and she'll say
how you talk about me all the time

803
01:33:46,362 --> 01:33:51,409
You know
I'm going to give you my camel coat

804
01:33:51,409 --> 01:33:54,537
You'll cut a fine figure
when you get down there

805
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,919
How many people I have seen
saying goodbye on the docks

806
01:34:00,919 --> 01:34:02,962
without giving a damn

807
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:08,885
But when I said goodbye to Nineteen
Hundred, it was a real blow

808
01:34:08,885 --> 01:34:12,222
We laughed and kept saying
"See you soon"

809
01:34:12,222 --> 01:34:16,851
But inside we both knew
we'd never see each other again

810
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:36,329
Goodbye, Nineteen Hundred!
Take care

811
01:34:36,329 --> 01:34:38,414
Good luck
Have a good time

812
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:43,628
Take care
Nineteen Hundred, take care

813
01:34:43,628 --> 01:34:45,213
Write us a letter sometimes

814
01:34:45,213 --> 01:34:47,549
Give my regards to Broadway

815
01:35:21,332 --> 01:35:23,501
What'd he do, step in shit?

816
01:35:24,669 --> 01:35:26,212
Maybe he just forgot something

817
01:35:26,212 --> 01:35:28,590
Maybe he's forgotten
why he's getting off

818
01:37:13,903 --> 01:37:15,655
What do you want?

819
01:37:24,122 --> 01:37:27,208
He was strange
for a long time after that

820
01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:30,378
He wouldn't talk to anyone

821
01:37:30,378 --> 01:37:34,966
He preferred keeping to himself
for days and days

822
01:37:34,966 --> 01:37:38,428
He seemed taken
by very personal matters

823
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:44,100
Then one day
while I was sitting at the bar

824
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:54,819
Thanks for the coat, Max
Fit like a glove

825
01:37:56,029 --> 01:37:57,989
It was a real shame

826
01:37:59,991 --> 01:38:04,037
I'm much better now
I'm done with all that

827
01:38:22,472 --> 01:38:24,265
Just like old times

828
01:38:37,987 --> 01:38:43,159
I left the Virginian
on August 21st, 1933

829
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:47,747
with my leave papers and back pay
everything in order

830
01:38:47,747 --> 01:38:51,084
I knew that sooner or later I'd
have been through with the ocean

831
01:38:51,084 --> 01:38:53,044
So that's what I did

832
01:38:53,878 --> 01:38:58,049
I heard no more about
Nineteen Hundred or the Virginian

833
01:38:58,049 --> 01:39:00,426
Not that I ever forgot them

834
01:39:00,426 --> 01:39:02,595
On the contrary

835
01:39:02,595 --> 01:39:05,682
During the war
I'd always ask myself

836
01:39:05,682 --> 01:39:09,394
Who knows what Nineteen Hundred
would do if he were here?

837
01:39:09,394 --> 01:39:11,938
Who knows what he'd say?

838
01:39:11,938 --> 01:39:14,440
Fuck war, he'd say

839
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:19,070
But said by me
it wasn't the same thing

840
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:36,754
A lot of time's gone by, you know

841
01:39:36,754 --> 01:39:38,256
who's to say he really didn't leave

842
01:39:38,256 --> 01:39:42,927
Maybe he actually went to the
fish shop and asked for that woman

843
01:39:42,927 --> 01:39:44,387
Maybe

844
01:43:10,802 --> 01:43:12,762
Conn

845
01:43:12,762 --> 01:43:15,014
What's the matter?
You lose your sea legs?

846
01:43:18,434 --> 01:43:21,312
Where the hell
did you find that record?

847
01:43:25,525 --> 01:43:28,236
What have you been up to
all these years

848
01:43:34,826 --> 01:43:36,411
Making music

849
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,997
Even during the war?

850
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:46,713
Even when no one
was dancing anymore

851
01:43:49,799 --> 01:43:52,093
Even when the bombs were falling

852
01:43:54,429 --> 01:43:56,389
And I kept playing

853
01:43:57,849 --> 01:43:59,809
till the ship got here

854
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:06,274
Call this a ship?

855
01:44:07,442 --> 01:44:11,195
It's more like a mountain of
dynamite about to explode

856
01:44:12,697 --> 01:44:15,158
A bit dangerous, don't you think?

857
01:44:20,371 --> 01:44:22,290
And you, Max?

858
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:26,419
Where's your trumpet?

859
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:30,673
I gave it up as well, as while back

860
01:44:31,341 --> 01:44:35,845
But, you know, now I'm
in the mood for starting again

861
01:44:36,596 --> 01:44:39,557
I'm busting with new ideas

862
01:44:40,558 --> 01:44:43,645
Let's start a duo. You and me

863
01:44:44,687 --> 01:44:47,440
Or our own band

864
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,234
The Danny Boodman

865
01:44:49,234 --> 01:44:54,113
T.D. Lemon
Nineteen Hundred Big Band

866
01:44:54,113 --> 01:44:56,115
It's gets the blood going

867
01:44:56,115 --> 01:44:58,117
We'd be a smash

868
01:45:01,246 --> 01:45:05,124
Come on, Nineteen Hundred
Come with me. Let's get off

869
01:45:05,124 --> 01:45:07,418
We'll watch the fireworks
from the pier

870
01:45:07,418 --> 01:45:10,088
and then we'll start from scratch

871
01:45:11,714 --> 01:45:14,676
Sometimes that's the way
you have to do it

872
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:17,887
You go right back to the beginning

873
01:45:29,148 --> 01:45:31,734
You're never really done for...

874
01:45:31,734 --> 01:45:38,283
as long as you've got a good story
and someone to tell it to

875
01:45:38,283 --> 01:45:39,617
Remember?

876
01:45:41,786 --> 01:45:43,705
You told me that

877
01:45:46,708 --> 01:45:50,587
Well, what a stack of stories
you got now

878
01:45:51,671 --> 01:45:55,800
The world would be
hanging on your every word

879
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,387
crazy for your music

880
01:46:01,848 --> 01:46:03,600
Believe me

881
01:46:05,476 --> 01:46:07,478
All that city

882
01:46:13,151 --> 01:46:15,778
You just couldn't see an end to it

883
01:46:18,197 --> 01:46:19,949
The end...

884
01:46:21,034 --> 01:46:23,453
please?

885
01:46:23,453 --> 01:46:26,623
You please just show me
where it ends?

886
01:46:29,667 --> 01:46:35,298
It was all very fine on
that gangway. And I was grand too

887
01:46:35,298 --> 01:46:37,842
in my overcoat

888
01:46:37,842 --> 01:46:40,887
I cut quite a figure

889
01:46:40,887 --> 01:46:43,973
And I was getting off

890
01:46:43,973 --> 01:46:45,767
Guaranteed

891
01:46:47,185 --> 01:46:49,312
That's wasn't the problem

892
01:46:54,025 --> 01:46:57,278
It wasn't
what I saw that stopped me, Max

893
01:46:58,821 --> 01:47:01,115
It was what I didn't see

894
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,035
Understand?

895
01:47:05,495 --> 01:47:07,747
What I didnt' see

896
01:47:08,665 --> 01:47:13,336
In all that srawling city
there was everything except an end

897
01:47:14,921 --> 01:47:16,881
There was no end

898
01:47:19,259 --> 01:47:25,223
What I did not see was where
the whole thing came to an end

899
01:47:27,016 --> 01:47:28,935
The end of the world

900
01:47:36,776 --> 01:47:38,528
You take a piano

901
01:47:40,822 --> 01:47:42,907
Keys begin

902
01:47:42,907 --> 01:47:44,784
The keys end

903
01:47:46,077 --> 01:47:50,582
You know there are 88 of them
Nobody can tell you any different

904
01:47:50,582 --> 01:47:52,959
They are not infinite

905
01:47:52,959 --> 01:47:56,754
You are infinite

906
01:47:56,754 --> 01:48:01,551
And on those keys, the music
that you can make is infinite

907
01:48:02,594 --> 01:48:04,178
I like that

908
01:48:05,179 --> 01:48:07,223
That I can live by

909
01:48:07,849 --> 01:48:10,518
You get me up on that gangway
and you roll out in front of me

910
01:48:10,518 --> 01:48:14,439
a keyboard of millions
and billions of keys that never end

911
01:48:14,439 --> 01:48:18,610
and that's the truth
Max, that they never end

912
01:48:18,610 --> 01:48:20,737
That keyboard is infinite

913
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:27,118
And if that keyboard is infinite
then there is no music you can play

914
01:48:28,203 --> 01:48:30,663
You're sitting on the wrong bench

915
01:48:31,456 --> 01:48:33,750
That's God's piano

916
01:48:36,961 --> 01:48:39,964
Christ, did you see the streets?
Just the streets.

917
01:48:39,964 --> 01:48:42,759
There were thousands of them

918
01:48:42,759 --> 01:48:47,847
How do you do it down there?
How do you choose just one?

919
01:48:47,847 --> 01:48:49,307
One woman

920
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,227
One house

921
01:48:53,311 --> 01:48:58,191
One piece of land to call your own
one landscape to look at

922
01:48:58,191 --> 01:49:00,109
one way to die?

923
01:49:04,155 --> 01:49:06,783
All that world
just weighing down on you

924
01:49:06,783 --> 01:49:08,868
You don't even know
where it comes to an end

925
01:49:08,868 --> 01:49:10,995
I mean, aren't you ever
just scared of

926
01:49:10,995 --> 01:49:12,956
breaking apart
at the thought of it?

927
01:49:12,956 --> 01:49:15,625
At the enormity of living it?

928
01:49:17,961 --> 01:49:20,421
I was born on this ship

929
01:49:24,008 --> 01:49:26,761
And the world passed my by

930
01:49:27,512 --> 01:49:31,349
But two thousand people at a time

931
01:49:33,184 --> 01:49:35,520
And there were wishes here

932
01:49:37,355 --> 01:49:42,360
But never more than
fit between prow and stern

933
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:47,198
You played out your happiness, but
on a piano that was not infinite

934
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:50,159
I learned to live that way

935
01:49:53,872 --> 01:49:55,582
Land?

936
01:49:58,042 --> 01:50:01,504
Land is a ship too big for me

937
01:50:03,882 --> 01:50:07,176
It's a woman too beautiful

938
01:50:08,678 --> 01:50:11,306
It's a voyage too long

939
01:50:11,306 --> 01:50:13,808
perfume too strong

940
01:50:14,559 --> 01:50:18,980
It's music I don't know how to make

941
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:21,357
I could never get off this ship

942
01:50:24,736 --> 01:50:26,905
At best

943
01:50:26,905 --> 01:50:29,824
I can step off my life

944
01:50:31,701 --> 01:50:34,120
After all

945
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,706
I don't exist for anyone

946
01:50:40,585 --> 01:50:43,338
You're the exception, Max

947
01:50:45,215 --> 01:50:48,384
You're the only one
who knows I'm here

948
01:50:50,428 --> 01:50:53,056
You're a minority

949
01:50:53,056 --> 01:50:55,808
And you'd better get used to it

950
01:50:59,938 --> 01:51:02,232
Forgive me, my friend

951
01:51:04,067 --> 01:51:06,611
but I'm not getting off

952
01:52:33,114 --> 01:52:34,532
Hey, Max

953
01:52:37,076 --> 01:52:40,205
Picture the scene
at the Golden Gates

954
01:52:40,205 --> 01:52:44,083
Some guy searching a list trying to
find my name, not finding it

955
01:52:45,126 --> 01:52:46,961
What did you say
your name was again?

956
01:52:46,961 --> 01:52:49,047
Nineteen Hundred

957
01:52:49,047 --> 01:52:53,968
Niemann, Nightingale, Ninestock...

958
01:52:53,968 --> 01:52:55,136
Nittledeen?

959
01:52:55,136 --> 01:52:58,723
Well, you see, sir
I was born on a ship

960
01:52:58,723 --> 01:52:59,933
Beg your pardon?

961
01:52:59,933 --> 01:53:04,604
Born, raised, and died on a ship
Maybe I'm not registered there

962
01:53:04,604 --> 01:53:07,899
Shipwreck?

963
01:53:07,899 --> 01:53:12,028
Six and a half tons of dynamite
Boom

964
01:53:13,821 --> 01:53:15,448
Feeling better now?

965
01:53:15,448 --> 01:53:20,203
Yeah, I'm fine except I lost an arm

966
01:53:20,203 --> 01:53:21,996
An arm?

967
01:53:21,996 --> 01:53:24,415
Yes, in the explosion

968
01:53:24,415 --> 01:53:30,088
Well, you should be able to
find one over there

969
01:53:30,088 --> 01:53:32,423
Which one did you say
you were missing?

970
01:53:32,423 --> 01:53:34,259
Left, sir

971
01:53:34,259 --> 01:53:39,389
I'm dreadfully sorry

972
01:53:39,389 --> 01:53:42,934
we only seem to have two rights

973
01:53:42,934 --> 01:53:44,310
Two right arms?

974
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:48,147
Afraid so

975
01:53:48,147 --> 01:53:52,777
Would you mind awfully if...

976
01:53:53,486 --> 01:53:54,737
If I want?

977
01:53:54,737 --> 01:53:59,242
Well, if you take a right arm
instead of a left?

978
01:54:02,036 --> 01:54:08,293
Well, all things considered better
a right arm than nothing, I suppose

979
01:54:08,293 --> 01:54:10,795
Couldn't agree more

980
01:54:12,922 --> 01:54:15,425
No laughing matter, Max

981
01:54:16,968 --> 01:54:18,887
What a cock-up

982
01:54:18,887 --> 01:54:23,641
Spend eternity with two right arms?

983
01:54:23,641 --> 01:54:26,269
I mean, how would you
make the sign of the cross?

984
01:54:41,201 --> 01:54:42,577
Hey, Max

985
01:54:44,996 --> 01:54:47,624
Imagine the music
I could play with two right arms

986
01:54:49,209 --> 01:54:51,669
Hope I can find a piano up there

987
01:56:33,271 --> 01:56:36,232
What would you have done
in my shoes?

988
01:56:37,942 --> 01:56:39,569
I don't know

989
01:56:42,363 --> 01:56:47,160
I wouldn't probably
have felt quite useless

990
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:56,294
Sooner or later, all stories end

991
01:56:56,294 --> 01:56:59,130
and there's nothing left to add

992
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,430
Anyhow, thanks, pops

993
01:57:26,699 --> 01:57:28,076
Conn

994
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:31,996
There's just one thing I don't get

995
01:57:32,747 --> 01:57:36,459
Who hid the broken record
inside the piano?

996
01:57:36,459 --> 01:57:38,253
You're looking at him

997
01:57:40,004 --> 01:57:43,841
So you weren't so useless after all

998
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:52,517
Conn

999
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:57,772
Here

1000
01:58:01,693 --> 01:58:03,361
Take your trumpet

1001
01:58:04,195 --> 01:58:06,281
Well, you'll be needing it

1002
01:58:09,993 --> 01:58:12,245
Never mind the money

1003
01:58:12,245 --> 01:58:15,999
A good story's worth
more than an old trumpet

1004
01:58:23,548 --> 01:58:25,425
Okay, pops

1005
01:58:26,425 --> 01:58:36,425
