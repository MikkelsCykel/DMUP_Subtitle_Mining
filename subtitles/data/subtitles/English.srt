- Honey, don't start anything.
- I'm just getting a screwdriver.

456
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:20,876
- What difference does it make?
- I'm sick of being the thimble.

457
00:48:21,004 --> 00:48:25,132
Well, I'm the top hat.
Be the battleship.

458
00:48:25,258 --> 00:48:27,796
I'm the battleship.

459
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:31,838
- What's this?
- Monopoly.

460
00:48:31,973 --> 00:48:36,386
- Two.45s and a MAC-10.
- Just some macho trip.

461
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:39,603
- Where did they come from?
- Ron traded with the guerrillas.

462
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,858
- We're getting into pirate waters.
- Pirates?

463
00:48:43,984 --> 00:48:50,521
- Pirates of the Caribbean.
- Been to Disney World too many times?

464
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:55,818
- It's true. They have speedboats.
- I've never been to Disney World.

465
00:48:55,954 --> 00:48:59,038
- Dollywood...
- You made me lose count!

466
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:04,160
- No guns on this boat.
- We need to fight off pirates.

467
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:10,879
- They can steal the boat.
- There are no pirates here.

468
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:16,348
- You said that about the guerrillas.
- I was right!

469
00:49:16,473 --> 00:49:20,685
He said "gorilla". Not "guerrilla".
"Guer", "go".

470
00:49:20,811 --> 00:49:24,808
Huge difference!

471
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:44,242
- What was that?
- Automatic weapons. How about that?

472
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:50,627
Captain Ron thought
we would have to hold off pirates!

473
00:49:50,756 --> 00:49:54,504
He actually traded... Hold on.

474
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:58,418
- Captain Ron!
- Yeah, Boss?

475
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:04,806
- What did you trade?
- There's the beauty. Nothing. Nada.

476
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:09,064
They needed a lift to San Juan
and since we're...

477
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,393
This is my boat. You understand?

478
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:16,654
We don't give lifts
to armed revolutionaries.

479
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:22,201
Whatever you say. I'll return the guns
and the whole thing's off.

480
00:50:25,038 --> 00:50:27,825
Is there a problem?

481
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:36,329
All right, fellas, give me a break.
Sit down.

482
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:40,584
Stand by to set the mainsail!

483
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:45,593
Set the mainsail!

484
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:50,887
Babe, don't just watch!
Jump up and guide those lines.

485
00:50:51,939 --> 00:50:55,189
- Careful.
- Honey, be careful.

486
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:58,982
- Got it, Mom.
- Control your excitement, Caroline.

487
00:51:13,459 --> 00:51:17,587
Wait! Come here.
Keep us on a heading of 270.

488
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:20,630
Guys, you've been through this!

489
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:25,668
Babe, get on the winch,
Boss, come up here with me.

490
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:29,551
Let her up, let her up!

491
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:33,059
Come on up here, Boss!

492
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:36,849
Bring it down!

493
00:51:45,656 --> 00:51:49,523
OK, take it up. Today, guys!

494
00:51:52,204 --> 00:51:54,873
Wait, wait, wait!

495
00:51:56,833 --> 00:52:02,788
Come around on the other side.
Watch what I'm doing. Take it up.

496
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:16,805
Go below and cut the engine,
then kill the fuel lines. Ready?

497
00:52:24,818 --> 00:52:31,781
Guys, vamanos al frente! Kitty!
Come jump on this mizzenmast.

498
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,943
- See what I'm talking about?
- All right, Mom!

499
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:18,152
<i>Day 17 finds me in the clutches
of revolutionaries,</i>

500
00:53:18,285 --> 00:53:21,784
<i>and my family in the clutches
of Captain Ron.</i>

501
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,118
<i>Next stop, carnival in San Juan.
Or so we thought...</i>

502
00:53:31,214 --> 00:53:36,718
Trust me, you have not been kidnapped.
Captain Ron is a jerk.

503
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:41,636
He gets lost.
This is his second time in two days.

504
00:53:47,313 --> 00:53:53,148
They don't know English, I don't
know Spanish. No communication.

505
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:13,660
Well, everything is cool. When you
get lost, all you got to do is ask.

506
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:15,623
What?

507
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:22,339
San Juan is behind us. About 20 miles.
But General Armando hardly blames you.

508
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:28,343
I explained it to him. It's the tides.
They work for you or against you. Hey!

509
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,895
I don't think she's waving at you.

510
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:37,107
- She's not?
- I sincerely doubt it.

511
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:40,853
Hey, Clarice!
Babe! Who are you waving at?

512
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:51,122
Yeah, I thought so. When I saw
Clarice, I knew where we was.

513
00:54:51,248 --> 00:54:55,625
Confidentially, I've had
these problems with the tides before.

514
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:57,211
I'm coming!

515
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:04,795
You know,
every time I'm up this way she,

516
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:08,462
well, she wants my manhood, you know.

517
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:12,469
Have a good time, Boss,
'cause I'm gonna.

518
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,563
Hang on, I'm coming.

519

(LAUGHING AND GIGGLING)

520
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:56,051
No, just rise above it, Marty.
You'd probably miss and hit the girl.

521
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:59,268
- Dad.
- Don't sneak up on me like that!

522
00:55:59,396 --> 00:56:01,471
Dad, it went through the deck!

523
00:56:01,689 --> 00:56:03,896
Dad, the boat's on fire!

524
00:56:05,026 --> 00:56:09,734
MOM! MOM!

525
00:56:38,808 --> 00:56:40,966
Martin, what happened, honey?

526
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:50,360
- Are you all right?
- Why do you think I'm not all right?

527
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:53,728
You still there?

528
00:56:54,156 --> 00:57:01,118
I have to say this was worth getting
lost for. It's absolutely gorgeous.

529
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:04,540
I just wish that you could see it.

530
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,750
I can see it.
I just have these, you know, spots.

531
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:11,042
Sweetie! Ouch.

532
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:15,383
I'm fine. What about Captain Ron?
Can we talk about him?

533
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:18,842
We can't get rid of him.
Who's gonna drive?

534
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:21,545
I can drive the boat.

535
00:57:21,682 --> 00:57:26,224
The doctor says that by tomorrow
my retinas will be fine.

536
00:57:26,436 --> 00:57:33,352
Let's wait till we're in San Juan.
We'll figure out what to do.

537
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:36,059
- Tree.
- Thank you.

538
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:39,279
I have to admit,
I was against all this.

539
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:44,697
But getting the sails up today
was quite a rush for all of us.

540
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:49,739
And today I discovered
something in the cabin.

541
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,751
I could show it to you if you want.

542
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,081
American girls are very,
what's the word? Superficial?

543
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:08,265
I hate that! Like, I'm into different
cultures and ways of doing things.

544
00:58:08,392 --> 00:58:13,552
Like, we saw "Mr Ed" on TV
the other day? He spoke French!

545
00:58:13,689 --> 00:58:16,773
It was like, he speaks French!
That is so cool.

546
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,937
All right, General. You're up.

547
00:58:31,706 --> 00:58:36,166
Boardwalk with three hotels.
That's $6,000.

548
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:40,422
A penny to the dollar,
that's $60, U.S.

549
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:49,002
- That's all the general's money.
- Shit happens. Cough it up.

550
00:58:51,516 --> 00:58:55,728
It's not like I hate the guy.
I don't hate anybody.

551
00:58:55,854 --> 00:59:00,350
I can't wait for you to see this.
It's so amazing.

552

- Come here.
- Mom, can we get some drinks?

553
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,948
- Yes, honey, they're in the...
- The blue cooler.

554
00:59:08,991 --> 00:59:14,151
- Could you get them?
- You're a big boy. You get them.

555
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:17,372
I found this while I was...

556
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:21,658
stripping these cabinets down here.
Look here.

557
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:28,464
- Isn't that amazing?
- Oh, that's great.

558
00:59:28,593 --> 00:59:32,128
Oh, your poor eyes. Come here.

559
00:59:32,555 --> 00:59:37,846
Here. Feel. CG.

560
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:44,264
Plus. CL. Can you believe it?

561
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:51,563
Didn't the boat belong to Clark Gable?
Clark Gable plus Carole Lombard!

562
00:59:51,698 --> 00:59:53,940
That is great!

563
00:59:54,075 --> 00:59:58,702
Think about it.
Gable and Lombard in this bed.

564
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:04,286
With those cute little cherub guys
up there. Isn't it just so amazing?

565
01:00:04,419 --> 01:00:09,579
And the ocean outside. It's the most
romantic thing I've ever imagined.

566
01:00:12,384 --> 01:00:17,544
- In San Juan, no more Captain Ron?
- Whatever you say, honey.

567
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:23,181
Hey, who's rocking
the boat down there?

<i>Charged by the best sex
we've had in three years,</i>

<i>if you don't count
that one time in the car,</i>

571
01:00:36,157 --> 01:00:40,450
<i>and the knowledge that Captain Ron
is about to leave our lives,</i>

01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:43,116

Hi, how's it going?
Good seeing you.

576
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:14,561
Hola. Buenas dias.
And como esta?

577
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:18,311
How are you doing, guys?
Good to see you. Over there.

578
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:27,035
Good morning, Boss.

579
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:33,877
I spent the night ashore.
I figured the boat might be crowded.

580
01:01:34,003 --> 01:01:36,043
That's mighty nice of you.

581
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:39,007
How long will it take us
to get to San Juan?

582
01:01:39,258 --> 01:01:41,085
Four or five hours, tops.

583
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:45,216
- And you know the way?
- Any fool could find it.

584
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:48,016
Well, let's hope so.

Listen, everybody!
You shouldn't worry about this.

Right about that, Boss.
I got it right here.

It's OK!
We still have our compass.

604
01:03:31,531 --> 01:03:36,442
The only instrument Columbus had
to get him to the New World

605
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:38,368
was his trusty compass.

606
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:40,951
Don't lose that!

607
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:44,867
Hang on a second.
Go ahead, grab onto that line!

608
01:03:45,085 --> 01:03:48,288
Everybody listen to me!

609
01:03:48,422 --> 01:03:53,167
The boss is right!
We should be OK.

610
01:03:53,301 --> 01:04:00,182
- I know we're near land.
- Great! You hear? We're almost there!

611
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:05,468
Explain to the kids how you know that.
Translate for the general.

612
01:04:09,275 --> 01:04:12,229
All right. Stay with me.

613
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:19,699
When we left, we had just enough fuel
to make it to San Juan.

614
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:24,618
And we are out of fuel!

615
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:36,876
He's gone crazy!
I've seen this before!

616
01:04:37,009 --> 01:04:41,967
Grab his tongue.
Shove a stick in his mouth!

617
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,636
I see something!

618
01:04:48,395 --> 01:04:50,637
Light!

619
01:05:02,825 --> 01:05:05,696
Honey, look!

620
01:05:09,707 --> 01:05:14,036
<i>Day 20. Survived storm at sea.</i>

621
01:05:14,169 --> 01:05:18,831
<i>Captain Ron is more cunning
than I originally suspected.</i>

( CALYPSO MUSIC)

623
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:37,606
Honey, we can't fire him now.
He got us through the storm.

624
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:41,980
He almost got us killed in that storm!

625
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:48,909
I'm sorry. You don't totally
understand it. He's eating my brain!

626
01:05:49,036 --> 01:05:54,456
- He's taking over our lives.
- Honey, you're exaggerating.

627
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:58,708
- He was dancing with all the girls.
- This is great!

628
01:05:58,837 --> 01:06:01,754
You don't have to wear those glasses.

629
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:05,713
- Let's not wear them.
- No, Mom, I'm fine.

630
01:06:05,843 --> 01:06:11,299
Kitty's right. Sometimes I go
without the patch. It puts people off.

631
01:06:11,432 --> 01:06:14,801
I don't like
to draw attention to myself.

632
01:06:17,688 --> 01:06:21,388
I got news for you, Ron.
If I had a hand mirror...

633
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:26,733
Caroline, honey...

634
01:06:26,946 --> 01:06:30,814
- That was so cool!
- Let's take a walk, shall we?

635
01:06:31,034 --> 01:06:33,785
You kids keep up. Let's go.

636
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:48,090
Yes, I admit that Captain Ron
is a little rough around the edges.

637
01:06:48,216 --> 01:06:55,678
- No, he is a psycho.
- Well, what does that mean?

638
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,432
Help me out. I lost my eye.
You see it? There it goes.

639
01:07:00,561 --> 01:07:06,813
I love this. I love it!
This is an experience of a lifetime!

640
01:07:07,026 --> 01:07:10,858
Hang on! There it is!

641
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:14,357
Would you please back off!
I lost my eye, man!

642
01:07:14,491 --> 01:07:18,619
Caroline hasn't mentioned
being engaged. And Ben...

643
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:24,581
Let me tell you about Ben. I wanted
this to be a bonding experience.

644
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:29,336
Father and son. Now he's bonding
with Captain Cyclops!

645
01:07:29,464 --> 01:07:32,299
He's such a character.

646
01:07:34,552 --> 01:07:36,877
Honey, where are the kids?

647
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:39,385
They're there. Ben!

648
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:43,466
They were right there. Caroline!

649
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:47,647
Benjamin!

650
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:52,646
Caroline!

651
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:57,403
Benjamin!

652
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,774
Ben!

653
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,454
- Did you find them?
- What? No.

654
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:11,707
Forget it. Never did fit, anyway.
You gotta get them custom made.

655
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,411
Hey! Where's Mom and Dad?

656
01:08:18,468 --> 01:08:24,055
It wasn't smart to mention we brought
revolutionaries to the island.

657
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:27,717
I'm not starting a fight.
It's just my opinion.

658
01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:31,980
I was trying to show
the kind of person Captain Ron is.

659
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:36,234
I'm Bill Zachary from the U.S.
State Department. Good news.

660
01:08:36,444 --> 01:08:38,851
- You found our children?
- No.

661
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:42,736
But you are not being charged
with subversion.

662
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:46,069
You are being expelled
from the island.

663
01:08:46,286 --> 01:08:49,489
- What? When?
- Now.

664

( CALYPSO MUSIC)

665
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:36,701
What is going on?

666
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:03,099
- Caroline!
- You guys are back early.

667
01:10:03,317 --> 01:10:06,271
- What are you doing?
- The merengue.

668
01:10:06,404 --> 01:10:10,899
- Where is your brother?
- He's around. You guys!

669
01:10:11,116 --> 01:10:16,276
Captain Ron didn't want us wandering
around. So we found this band

670
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:19,497
and these people,
and we just had a party!

671
01:10:19,624 --> 01:10:23,408
We were worried sick
the whole time we were in jail.

672
01:10:23,545 --> 01:10:28,123
- In jail?
- Don't worry. Who's this guy?

673
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:34,177
Mamba! He doesn't speak English,
but he's cute. Guess what?

674
01:10:34,388 --> 01:10:38,386
- You're engaged.
- No, I didn't get engaged.

675
01:10:38,517 --> 01:10:43,677
I got tattooed. Mamba did it.
It's a cool little rose.

676
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:47,432
- Where did you get this tattoo?
- At Mamba's shop.

677
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:53,154
- Where on your body?
- Mom, it's kind of private.

678
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:57,658
A guy with a spider on his head
tattooed you somewhere private?

679
01:10:57,869 --> 01:11:00,538
- It could be a lot worse.
- How?

680
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:04,696
Hey! What happened to the music?

681
01:11:05,668 --> 01:11:07,495
Uh-oh. Coming through!

682
01:11:09,255 --> 01:11:12,789
- Come back here! Ben!
- Excuse me, folks.

683
01:11:14,843 --> 01:11:16,172
Ben!

684
01:11:22,267 --> 01:11:24,010
Ben!

685
01:11:28,481 --> 01:11:32,775
Are you hurt? I told you
not to leave bottles lying around.

686
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:35,144
You cretin!

687
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:39,271
Angeline's no Cretan.
She's Puerto Rican.

688
01:11:39,408 --> 01:11:44,034
- I'm not talking to her.
- We're playing strip Monopoly.

689
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:48,492
- We ran out of money. She's...
- Where's Ben?

690
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:51,460
- He went that way.
- You tattooed my kids!

691
01:11:51,586 --> 01:11:56,711
- Who is he?
- Dad, it's fake. It washes off.

692
01:11:56,841 --> 01:12:00,424
- Thank God!
- And Caroline's?

693
01:12:00,553 --> 01:12:05,096
- No, that's real. Primo work.
- You're fired.

694
01:12:08,936 --> 01:12:12,139
Boss, wait a minute!

695
01:12:12,398 --> 01:12:15,683
Let's at least have a dialogue here.

696
01:12:15,817 --> 01:12:21,274
Giving the children beer
and bringing that woman around...

697
01:12:21,406 --> 01:12:26,910
- Angeline's OK. Roscoe is the jerk.
- Yeah, we saw Roscoe.

698
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,536
You'll see him again
if I don't get paid $500.

699
01:12:30,665 --> 01:12:33,915
She had Park Place with three hotels.

700
01:12:34,043 --> 01:12:40,211
Curve it a second, boss - former
boss. The woman had a system.

701
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:43,460
I just figured it out
before you got back.

702
01:12:43,594 --> 01:12:47,722
Let us back in that game,
and I can whittle that down.

703
01:12:47,848 --> 01:12:50,552
Whittle yourself out of my life!

704
01:12:50,684 --> 01:12:54,681
And you! Tell Roscoe
you're not getting jack!

705
01:12:54,813 --> 01:12:58,478
- I wouldn't do that.
- I would. Beat it.

706
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:02,190
- Get back on the boat!
- You're embarrassing me.

707
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,234
I'll do more than that
if you don't get going. Move!

708
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:26,917
Oh, man!

709
01:13:48,572 --> 01:13:52,901
Well, you know.
It'll take some time to get over this.

710
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:59,831
We'll get by somehow. We always do.
I didn't think we'd survive this.

711
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:05,664
Don't worry. We'll be in Florida soon.
We'll sell this thing and go home.

712
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:11,040
We'll just forget the whole thing.
It seemed like a good idea.

713
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:18,182
Martin...
Martin, you know that Roscoe man?

714
01:14:23,438 --> 01:14:25,395
The Pirates of the Caribbean!

715
01:14:25,607 --> 01:14:29,900
- What?
- Oh, no.

716
01:14:38,702 --> 01:14:42,700
So, think we'll ever
see our boat again?

717
01:15:23,161 --> 01:15:25,200
Hey, guys. Wake up!

718
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:27,999
- Sharks!
- We're gonna die!

719
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:30,959
- No, land! Paddle!
- We're gonna live!

720
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:43,172
It's land! It's land!

721
01:15:46,016 --> 01:15:47,676
Sorry.

722
01:16:00,947 --> 01:16:05,608
- Where is this?
- I don't care. It's dry land.

723
01:16:05,743 --> 01:16:11,863
First things first. Stay here.
I am going to find out where we are.

724
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:16,791
In five hours the stores open.
We can get some clothes.

725
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,546
Until then, I want you to dry off
as best as you can.

726
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:23,881
Back to the raft!

727
01:16:24,094 --> 01:16:27,593
Do it! Get in the raft!
Honey, get in.

728
01:16:27,722 --> 01:16:29,596
Martin, what is it?

729
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:35,347
Prohibit to pass.

730
01:16:35,563 --> 01:16:40,224
Let's just go to the most
important part of the sign, shall we?

731
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:42,518
"Cuba". We're in Cuba?

732
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:46,187
- Wouldn't you just know it?
- What's so bad about Cuba?

733
01:16:46,406 --> 01:16:49,692
I agree with Caroline. It's land.

734
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:53,954
Her world view is based
on "I Love Lucy" reruns.

735
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,997
The world's changed a lot
since Ricky Ricardo.

736
01:16:57,208 --> 01:17:00,458
Honey, they did
the "Today" Show in Cuba.

737
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,789
Well, let's just
get some cigars and relax.

738
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,394
Dad!

739
01:17:59,684 --> 01:18:01,012
Martin!

740
01:18:02,603 --> 01:18:08,688
Have we ended up
in the same spot as our boat?

741
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:13,527
- Isn't that a little odd?
- Strictly speaking, no.

742
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:18,569
Hey! Stay out of my...!

743
01:18:21,037 --> 01:18:25,366
- Good one, Caroline!
- Keep quiet. Be quiet.

744
01:18:26,251 --> 01:18:29,038
- What are we gonna do?
- What can we do?

745
01:18:29,253 --> 01:18:35,671
The sun's coming up, we have no money,
no passports and no explanations.

746
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:42,172
- We've got our boat.
- No, the pirates have our boat.

747
01:18:42,391 --> 01:18:46,969
It's still our boat. We cleaned
the stupid thing, and we sailed it.

748
01:18:47,187 --> 01:18:52,014
- What do you expect us to do?
- Get it back.

749
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:58,437
Bloodthirsty, heavily-armed pirates
against the Harvey family?

750
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:02,402
Guys, it would take a miracle.

751
01:19:08,791 --> 01:19:10,368
Yeah!

752
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:18,752
- It's Captain Ron!
- Get in!

753
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:21,719
- What the hell are you doing?

- Just like you said, Captain Ron.

- Borrowed it, Boss.

We gotta bring her around!

825
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:15,884

- Got it?

- Yeah, maybe.

- Adiós!

- It's the U.S. Coast Guard!

We're the Harvey family from Chicago!

- No, it's a piece of junk.

Oh, boy! Look at that, Barbara.

886
01:36:14,634 --> 01:36:17,635
Do you think we'll be able to do that?

887
01:36:17,846 --> 01:36:20,930
Sure you will, Boss. I guarantee it.

888
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:25,185
Let's light the fires
and kick the tyres. Push that back.

We bought it yesterday.

Get her out on the ocean.
If it's gonna happen, it's out there!

There's a lot of boats!

They'll get out of our way.
I learned that on the "Saratoga".
