3
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:30,653
Every night, the same dream, the same strange planet.

4
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:32,655
But why?

5
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:36,648
What are they trying to tell me?

6
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:44,667
It's been 34 years
since they arrived on this planet.

7
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,669
And not a day passes that the survivors...

8
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,673
...forced to live in barrier cities, do not live in fear.

9
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:53,676
I have vowed to end that fear.

10
00:02:53,676 --> 00:02:55,678
I believe my dreams hold the key.

11
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:59,671
The question is, will I be in time to save the Earth?

12
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:56,788
Where are you?

13
00:08:01,984 --> 00:08:03,986
This is a restricted area.

14
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:05,988
Do not move!

15
00:08:05,988 --> 00:08:08,991
-What's she doing here, Captain?
-I don't know. We're getting her out.

16
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:12,984
-You're coming with us.
-Behind you!

17
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:15,998
Hold it!

18
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:19,991
Damn. Let's move, people!

19
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:27,009
Two coming through the wall!

20
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:31,002
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!

21
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:37,008
Ryan, Neil, let's go!

22
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:43,025
-What are you doing?
-There's a life form.

23
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,027
-Not in years.
-There is now.

24
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:48,030
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.

25
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,023
Arrest me. But I'm not
Leaving without that llfe form.

26
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:57,028
It's one of those days.

27
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:14,056
Captain, the transport won't wait for us much longer.

28
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,058
I understand that.

29
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,059
It's in bad shape.

30
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:20,062
Tell me we're not risking our necks for this plant!

31
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:23,065
Really, it's a weed.

32
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,065
I wouldn't even call it a weed.

33
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,468
I need a minute to extract it.

34
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:29,071
That's a minute we do not have.

35
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:33,075
I'm afraid he's right about that, man.

36
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:34,076
Phantoms! We have incoming.

37
00:09:34,076 --> 00:09:37,079
-Captain, we need to get moving.
-Understood, sergeant.

38
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,081
-Could you hurry, Miss?
-Done.

39
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,083
-Captain?
-Yes, Neil?

40
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:43,085
I'm for "Let's get out of here."

41
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:47,089
Duly noted.

42
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,082
Can I have this, please? Thank you.

43
00:09:57,099 --> 00:10:01,103
-We're surrounded!
-No shit!

44
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:05,107
-Just relax.
-We gotta get to higher ground.

45
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:09,111
Everyone, up top!

46
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:13,104
Go, go, go!

47
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:18,120
-Transport, Requesting immediate evac.
-Affirmative.

48
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,113
Up here!

49
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,122
-They're right behind you!
-Come on!

50
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:36,138
I've got you!

51
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,140
-You okay?
-Yeah.

52
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,133
All right, everybody, here they come.

53
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,182
You okay?

54
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:24,186
You're gonna be all right.

55
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:27,189
So, why shouldn't I arrest you?

56
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:30,192
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.

57
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:32,194
Not unlimited clearance. Not without authorization.

58
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:34,196
I don't have time for this.

59
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:36,198
Do you realize you risked the lives of my squad?

60
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:39,201
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is...

61
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:42,204
-...it was worth the lives of you and your men.
-You and your men?

62
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,206
-She thinks you're a man.
-I think she's an idiot.

63
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:47,209
-I know you're not a man.
-I think you're an idiot, too.

64
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,212
-Very funny.
-I want to talk about it.

65
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,213
Did it occur to you...

66
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:55,217
...that we would've volunteered
had we been given a choice?

67
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:57,219
Nobody asked you to save me.

68
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:01,223
I don't believe this. You have not changed a bit!

69
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:05,216
Gray?

70
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:14,225
Yeah. Nice to see you too.

71
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,294
-Welcome back, captain.
-We're clean.

72
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:16,298
-Let's make sure of that, shall we?
-I hate getting scanned.

73
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:19,301
Sir, this scan is probably worse for us than the Phantoms.

74
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,304
And I about it, Captain.
These machines are suspected of causing sterility.

75
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:25,307
I want to have a little Neil Jr. calling me daddy someday.

76
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:28,310
-That's a spooky thought.
-Why you always bust my chops?

77
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,313
People, let's just do this thing. All right?

78
00:13:31,313 --> 00:13:32,314
Yes, sir.

79
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:36,307
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:49,331
Okay, next.

81
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,332
You've gained weight.

82
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:53,335
It's called upper-body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.

83
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,337
I'm working on it.

84
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:59,341
You know my security rating allows me to bypass this.

85
00:13:59,341 --> 00:14:02,344
Not today it doesn't.

86
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:04,346
Something's not right.

87
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:07,349
-About this mission? Or that woman?
-Both.

88
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:08,350
Next.

89
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,352
Listen, Captain, I think...

90
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,354
I don't care what you think, Doctor.

91
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:16,347
You're getting scanned
just llke everybody else.

92
00:14:22,364 --> 00:14:24,366
Shit!

93
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:25,367
-Captain!
-They got him.

94
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:27,369
There must be a mistake.

95
00:14:27,369 --> 00:14:29,371
You came in contact with the Phantom, sir.
Please remain calm.

96
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:32,374
Administering treatment shield.

97
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:36,367
-What level is he?
-Blue. Code red in 3-1/2 minutes.

98
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,381
We have to treat him.

99
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:42,384
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.

100
00:14:42,384 --> 00:14:46,377
There's no time for that.

101
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,392
Get him to the table.

102
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:54,385
Hang in there, captain.

103
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:09,400
Locating pathogens.

104
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,419
Jesus, look at that thing!

105
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,421
How much time?

106
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:23,425
Not enough. When he reaches code red,
the treatment shield won't hold the alien particles.

107
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:27,418
Engaging bio-etheric laser.

108
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:45,447
-What's going on?
-Where'd it go?

109
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,449
What the hell is going on?

110
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,452
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.

111
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,454
-Tracking.
-There's no time.

112
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:56,458
-Tracking.
-You'll lose him!

113
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,461
His treatment shield is failing.

114
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,454
Found it.

115
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:14,465
Come on.

116
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:50,512
It's all right.

117
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:54,516
You'll be back to normal in no time.

118
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:58,520
Doctor, we need to scan you for infestation.

119
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,513
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.

120
00:17:05,527 --> 00:17:08,530
Hey, doc.

121
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,534
Thanks for saving him.

122
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:16,538
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, but the military impounded my ship.

123
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:19,541
-What's with her?
-What's with her and the captain?

124
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,545
What's with her and that stupid plant?

125
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:27,538
What?

126
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:34,556
Forward me the phantom data, and
everything regarding the five spirits
we have collected so far.

127
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:35,557
Yes, doctor.

128
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:39,561
I thought we weren't supposed to use the "s" word.

129
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,564
Don't get smart with me.

130
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:46,557
Now let's see if that plant does the trick.

131
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,581
It's a match. We've found it.

132
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,582
Yes.

133
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,584
The sixth spirit.

134
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,587
You broke nearly every protocol.

135
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,590
How long do you think this would
have survived outside the barrier?

136
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,583
There are elements in the council and
military waiting to shut us down.

137
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:17,588
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered
this energy in the Phantoms? You.

138
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,593
And who proved the same energy source
existed in humans and every llfe form?

139
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:27,609
You. You made it possible
to harness that energy...

140
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,611
...for ovo-pacs, scanners,
and even the barrier.

141
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:33,604
The council knows. They trust you.
We're so close to proving--

142
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,618
But we still need these parts.

143
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:40,622
Two more pieces and we've solved the puzzle!

144
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:42,624
We need to be free to find those pieces.

145
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:46,628
I want to show you something, Aki.

146
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,630
-What is this?
-Read.

147
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,634
"All llfe is born of Gaia and each llfe has a spirit.

148
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:55,637
Each new spirit is housed in a body."

149
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,638
Go on.

150
00:18:56,638 --> 00:19:00,631
"Through their experiences on Earth,
each spirit matures and grows.

151
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:04,646
When the physical body dies...

152
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:08,639
...the mature spirit, enriched by llfe
on Earth, returns to Gaia...

153
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:12,654
...bringing with it the experiences...

154
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:15,657
...enabling Gaia to llve and grow."

155
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:17,659
It's my old diary.

156
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:21,652
I wrote that 43 years ago,
when I was the age you are now.

157
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:24,666
Dr. Sid!

158
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:28,670
Remember Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...

159
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,673
...he said the Earth was not
the center of the universe.

160
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,676
That could happen to us.

161
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:37,679
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.

162
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,682
If you have any notes
that could be used against you...

163
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,684
...destroy them.

164
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:45,687
-Keep them up here.
-Right.

165
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,690
And stay away from your friend the captain.

166
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,694
He saves your llfe, you save his,
this leads to that.

167
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:53,695
I was young once.

168
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:57,699
Doctor, there is a war going on.

169
00:19:57,699 --> 00:20:01,692
No one's young anymore.

170
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,765
Members of the council...

171
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:06,768
...could you please explain why?

172
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,771
Zeus was completed a month ago.

173
00:21:09,771 --> 00:21:13,775
If we attack the meteor with this, we will
eliminate the Phantoms at the source.

174
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:16,778
General Hein, calm down.

175
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:17,779
At our last meeting, we voted 6 to 2...

176
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:21,772
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon
to attack the Leonid Meteor.

177
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:25,787
We have re-convened today to vote that very issue again.

178
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:29,791
I'd llke to ask the director of
the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.

179
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,792
Dr. Sid, please.

180
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,795
Thank you.

181
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,798
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest
is in the Leonid Meteor...

182
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,801
...that landed here 34 years ago.

183
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:43,794
What you see now are the records
of every assault on the meteor to date.

184
00:21:44,806 --> 00:21:48,810
Physical attacks have had
utterly no effect.

185
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,814
This took place three months ago
during a full-scale bombardment.

186
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:56,818
Please note the Phantoms outside
the meteor are destroyed.

187
00:21:56,818 --> 00:22:00,822
However, inside, many that
were dormant come to llfe...

188
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:04,815
...and as you see, overall
Phantom density remains the same.

189
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:08,830
The newly risen aliens respond to the attack...

190
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,833
...by burrowing deeper into the Earth.

191
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,836
This is very interesting to me, Dr. Sid.

192
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:17,839
...because we see the same thing during surgery...

193
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,832
...when using bio-etheric lasers
on Phantom particles, do we not?

194
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:23,845
Yes, indeed we do.

195
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:26,848
The injured particles escape...

196
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:30,852
...digging themselves deeper into a patient's body.

197
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:34,845
When we increase the laser power
to destroy these deeper particles...

198
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:39,861
...we have had incidents of
further injury to a patient...

199
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:41,863
...and in some cases...

200
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,865
...death.

201
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,867
What exactly does that mean, Doctor?

202
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,869
It means there's a very good chance...

203
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:51,873
...the beam from the Zeus cannon
will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.

204
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:52,874
Exactly! Thank you.

205
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:56,867
However, it also means that
the beam energy may be too strong...

206
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,881
...injuring the Earth.

207
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,883
Injure the Earth?

208
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,885
You mean the Gaia.

209
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:07,878
-I mean--
-You mean the spirit of the Earth.

210
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,892
Yes...

211
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,894
...the spirit of the Earth.

212
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,896
Did he say what I think he said?

213
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,898
What are you doing?

214
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:19,901
I know what I'm doing.
Keep your mouth shut.

215
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,902
This is ridiculous.

216
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:22,904
With all due respect...

217
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:26,908
...did you come here to talk
about some Gaia theory?

218
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,911
To tell us that the planet is alive?

219
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:30,912
That it has a spirit?

220
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:33,915
That's a fairy tale. And I'm sorry,
but we don't have time for that.

221
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:37,908
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.

222
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,924
So if I point a gun
at the Earth and fire...

223
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:46,928
...I'm not just making a hole,
I'm killing the planet.

224
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,930
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory
has not been proven.

225
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,923
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we
still have to remove the Phantoms?

226
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:57,939
If there's a chance of success,
we should take it.

227
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:59,941
-Don't you agree?
-Of course.

228
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:02,944
But there is an alternative
to the space cannon.

229
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:03,945
Another method?

230
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:07,938
-A means of disabling the Phantoms.
-Please.

231
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,943
As we know, the aliens display
a distinct energy pattern.

232
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,958
It is a fact that
two opposing bio-etheric waves...

233
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,961
...placed one over the other
cancel each other out.

234
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:23,965
It is theoretically possible
to make a wave pattern...

235
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:25,967
...in opposition
to the Phantom energy.

236
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,970
We are assembling such
a wave and are near completion.

237
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,972
Members of the council...

238
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:33,975
...gathering plants and animals from around the world...

239
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:37,968
...to fight the Phantoms
is utter nonsense.

240
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,983
The Zeus cannon is a proven,
effective weapon.

241
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:44,986
It will kill Phantoms.

242
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:47,989
Can we afford to wait
for some crazy invention...

243
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:51,982
...some army of
touchy-feely plants and animals...

244
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:55,997
...that offers no evidence
that it will destroy the aliens?

245
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:56,998
There is evidence!

246
00:24:56,998 --> 00:25:00,001
Our partially completed energy wave...

247
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:03,004
...has successfully stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...

248
00:25:03,004 --> 00:25:06,007
...through a terminally infected patient.

249
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:09,010
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that
a terminal patient has been cured?

250
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,013
Not cured. The wave is not complete.

251
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:16,006
But we've succeeded in containing the
particles safely inside the patient.

252
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,022
Where is the proof?

253
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:25,015
Here.

254
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:39,040
You may have bought us some time, Aki.
But I wonder at what cost.

255
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,044
I can't keep hiding in the back
while you protect me.

256
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:46,047
I want what llfe I have left
to mean something.

257
00:25:46,047 --> 00:25:50,051
When we find
the seventh and eighth spirits--

258
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:53,054
If we find them.
What we need now is luck.

259
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,057
Luck has nothing to do with it.

260
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:59,060
Faith and hard work, girl...

261
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,053
...because I'll be damned
if you're going to die before me.

262
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:34,095
The council decided to postpone
firing the Zeus cannon.

263
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:36,097
I guess I put on a good show.

264
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:38,099
Mind if I tag along?

265
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:42,092
You'll probably get bored.

266
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:56,106
So, what are you doing?

267
00:26:57,118 --> 00:27:01,122
Oh, I see. You're giving me
the silent treatment.

268
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:05,115
I'm scanning the city
for the seventh spirit.

269
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,138
Hurry up, Neil.

270
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:20,141
-Almost got it.
-What are you doing?

271
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,144
We're gonna strand them for a while.

272
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:25,146
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.

273
00:27:25,146 --> 00:27:27,148
This was your idea?

274
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:29,150
We're just helping the captain out.

275
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,152
Where's your sense of romance?

276
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:35,145
You've seen how
the captain looks at her.

277
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:41,162
It's amore, baby.

278
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:43,164
What's going on?

279
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,166
It's probably just a glitch.

280
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:49,170
-Listen, Aki--
-I'm still mad at you.

281
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,172
-You're mad?
-Leaving your helmet on.

282
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:54,175
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?

283
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:58,168
I was upset when you left for
the Zeus Station without a word.

284
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,183
-Now you know what was going on.
-Yeah.

285
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:04,185
My operation had
to be done in zero grav.

286
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:06,187
Fine.

287
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:09,190
I was there on a job
and you wouldn't even see me.

288
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,193
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collect
spirit waves.

289
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,194
-Now I know.
-I'm sorry!

290
00:28:13,194 --> 00:28:17,187
Well, me too! We're both sorry.

291
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:25,206
Will you tell me about them?

292
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,208
About what?

293
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,211
About the spirits you've collected.

294
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:34,215
I was infected by a Phantom
during an experiment.

295
00:28:34,215 --> 00:28:37,218
-Normally, no one could have survived.
-How did you?

296
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:41,222
Dr. Sid created a membrane around
the infection, keeping me alive.

297
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:44,225
So the first spirit wave was me.

298
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,227
The second was a fish.

299
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:47,228
A fish?

300
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:51,221
The third was a deer I found
in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.

301
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,235
The fourth was a bird.

302
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:58,239
Ever tried to track a sparrow
from outer space? It's no fun.

303
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,242
-You'd probably love that.
-Right, I probably would.

304
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:04,245
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.

305
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:06,247
-I thought that was number six.
-What?

306
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:10,240
You skipped one.

307
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:15,245
The fifth was a llttle girl dying
in a hospital emergency room.

308
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:20,250
I retrieved the sample
in time, but she....

309
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:25,255
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, llttle girls.

310
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:29,270
Even the Earth.

311
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,274
I told her she wasn't dying,
but returning to the Earth's spirit...

312
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:37,278
...to Gaia.

313
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,271
She told me that she was ready to die.

314
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:48,278
She said I didn't have to make up
stories to make her feel better.

315
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:56,297
Only 7 years old and ready to die.

316
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,299
I'm sorry.

317
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:02,292
I have work to do. I have to find
the seventh and eighth spirits.

318
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:06,307
Don't, please.

319
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:09,310
You don't believe any of this, do you?

320
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,303
I just don't know, Aki.

321
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:18,319
Is this why you shut me out?

322
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,322
You should have told me.

323
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:25,326
I don't know
how much time I have left.

324
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:29,319
Who does?

325
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:36,326
I'd better get back to scanning.

326
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,353
Captain Edwards...

327
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:56,346
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago?

328
00:30:57,358 --> 00:31:00,361
-Yes, sir.
-What were your impressions of her?

329
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:04,365
She seemed very capable
and determined, sir.

330
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:08,369
You and the Deep Eyes are being
temporarily reassigned.

331
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:12,373
You will guard Dr. Ross
when she reenters the wasteland.

332
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:13,374
Understood, sir.

333
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:15,376
You don't understand yet, captain.

334
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:19,369
Report any aberrant behavior
in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.

335
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:21,382
Aberrant behavior?

336
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:25,375
The woman carries an alien infestation.
We don't know what it may be doing to her.

337
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:29,390
Alien presence might affect her judgment.

338
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,393
It may be manipulating the doctor for their very own purpose.

339
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:36,386
Is the general suggesting
that Dr. Ross is a spy?

340
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,402
The general is wondering why
he's explaining himself to a captain.

341
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:44,405
She's had prolonged exposure
to Phantom tissue.

342
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:47,408
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...

343
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:51,401
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest
and transported here for observation.

344
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:57,418
It is, in fact, for her own good, Captain.

345
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:01,411
Of course, sir.

346
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:10,420
Major, send some of our men
to keep an eye on the good captain.

347
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,530
I'm convinced these dreams
are some form of communication.

348
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,533
The message still eludes me...

349
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:56,526
...but they're coming faster now
and that can only mean one thing.

350
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:00,541
The Phantoms inside me
are beginning to win.

351
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:04,545
Our target is 50 klicks
west of Tucson.

352
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:05,546
Phantom concentration?

353
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,548
Not good.
We've got big metas everywhere.

354
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,551
It's gonna be a real picnic.

355
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:14,555
Stick close to me. No heroics today.
Everything by the book.

356
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:18,548
By the book. Right.

357
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:26,567
If we drop energy buoys
here, here and here...

358
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:30,571
...we can acquire the target and get
out before they know we were there.

359
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,573
The buoys attract the Phantoms?

360
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:36,566
-Yeah.
-For a while.

361
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,588
So you're from the 307th, right?
Under General Hein?

362
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:51,581
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.

363
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,612
Captain, rendezvous for evac at
vector 6, coordinate 279.

364
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:28,618
Roger. Stay alert for hostiles.

365
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:49,639
Looks llke they've taken the bait.

366
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,667
The seventh spirit should be
just beyond that llne of wreckage.

367
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,670
How could any llving thing
survive out here?

368
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,674
We'll find out soon enough.

369
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,677
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.

370
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:20,670
It was supposed to end the war.

371
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:25,675
My father's in here somewhere.

372
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,690
All right.

373
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:33,683
Let's move out, people.

374
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,709
I'll be damned.

375
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,711
A survivor.

376
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,713
What's it doing out here?

377
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,716
Hoping for llfe to return.

378
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:59,720
Is that our spirit, doc?

379
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,713
No.

380
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,737
We're closing in on the llfe form.

381
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:20,730
-Distance?
-Hard to say. We're very close.

382
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:25,735
I don't see anything.

383
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:32,742
-You're not gonna tell me it's him?
-That's impossible.

384
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,763
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.

385
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:46,767
How do you explain that? The pacs power
our weapons, the barrier cities....

386
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,769
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.

387
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:52,773
To create that energy we use
llving tissue. Single-cell organisms.

388
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,776
-You're telling me that his backpack is the seventh spirit?
-Yes.

389
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,778
We have incoming.
Captain? Do read me?

390
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,779
Say again?

391
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,781
We have incoming.

392
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:04,774
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.

393
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,794
I need a hand! Sarge!

394
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:30,800
-Those buoys? They're not working.
-Yeah.

395
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:35,816
-Are you all right?
-Of course, I am.

396
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:39,809
Let's get the hell out of here!

397
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,824
Something's not right. This shouldn't be happening.

398
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,827
Something's attracting them.

399
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:50,820
Aki!

400
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,826
-They're right on us, sir, closing in fast!
-Jane, take the lead.

401
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:14,844
Fire in the hole!

402
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,868
Get us out of here, Neil.

403
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,861
-Sir, I would love to, but I ...
-Just do it!

404
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:57,898
Okay, that's it.

405
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:00,901
That doesn't look good.

406
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,903
We have to get her to a hospital.

407
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:06,907
-You have your orders, sir.
-What the hell's going on?

408
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:10,900
Dr. Ross is to be taken
into custody now, sir.

409
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,917
Lower your weapons. That's an order!

410
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,919
Sir, we have no choice, but to relieve you of your command.

411
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,922
I won't let you do this, soilder. You'll have to shoot me.

412
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:25,915
Stand down, Captain!

413
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:22,600
Aki!

414
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:51,000
Hang on, everyone!

415
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:58,007
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them now.

416
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:13,022
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!

417
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:26,035
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!

418
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,058
The Deep Eyes are returning from the wastelands, sir.

419
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,060
Apparently there was an incident.

420
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,063
It would seem the Phantoms
were attracted to Dr. Ross.

421
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:47,067
The crew barely escaped
with their lives.

422
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:50,070
Captain Edwards is still in command.

423
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,071
Issue an order.

424
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:54,074
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross
placed under arrest.

425
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:58,078
All research materials pertaining
to Dr. Sid's wave theory...

426
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,080
...are to be confiscated immediately.

427
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,083
That might not go over
well with the council.

428
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,086
What a tragedy that would be.

429
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:10,079
This is perfect. The good captain
has opened the door for us.

430
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,093
By tommorow morning, the council will be at our feet...

431
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:17,097
...thanking us for exposing
the traitors and imploring us...

432
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:21,090
...to save them from the Phantoms.

433
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:26,106
How is she, doctor?

434
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:30,110
-She is dying.
-There must be something you can do.

435
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,112
Aki is fighting with
only six of the spirits.

436
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:36,116
We'll have to implant the seventh
directly into her chest plate.

437
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,118
It took a bullet. I think it might be damaged.

438
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:41,121
We have to repair this panel quickly.

439
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:45,114
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.

440
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:51,120
She needs a sympathetic spirit
to help hold her in this world.

441
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:56,136
I can think of none better suited
for that task than yours, captain.

442
00:43:56,136 --> 00:44:00,129
-I don't understand.
-You don't have to understand.

443
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:04,144
You just be with her now.

444
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:08,137
You keep her here with us.

445
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:00,200
Aki? Where are we?

446
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,203
On an alien planet.

447
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:06,206
How is that possible?

448
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:08,208
I'm not entirely sure.

449
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,210
You seem pretty calm.

450
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,213
I've been having this dream
every night for months.

451
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,215
Dream?

452
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:19,219
Well, whatever it is.

453
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:23,223
You're really here, aren't you?

454
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,225
What's happening to me?

455
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:29,218
Sid is implanting the seventh spirit
directly into your body.

456
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,233
Then you're my spiritual support.

457
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:36,236
Gray, how sweet of you.

458
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:40,229
Look, I don't think you realize
how serious this situation is.

459
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:47,236
Something you should see here, sir.

460
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,256
And I am watching what, major?

461
00:45:56,256 --> 00:46:00,260
It seems Dr. Ross has been
recording her dreams.

462
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,264
And why would I be interested in...

463
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:05,265
...her dreams?

464
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:08,268
This is it. This is our evidence.

465
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:12,261
She's under the influence
of the Phantoms.

466
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:19,268
The dreams should be all the council
needs to authorize the Zeus cannon.

467
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,283
The council is content to hide cowardly
inside this barrier...

468
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:26,286
...while the world dies
more every day.

469
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:29,289
I believe they need a push
in the right direction.

470
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:33,282
Get together a group
of your most trusted men.

471
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:26,346
What are they doing ?Why are they staring at us?

472
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:30,339
Not at us.

473
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:22,391
Welcome back, captain.

474
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:25,405
Is it over?

475
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,407
How is she, doctor?

476
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,409
She'll be fine.
But this is only temporary.

477
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,402
We'll need to find the eighth
and final spirit to cure her.

478
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,409
Aki, can you hear me?

479
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,423
I finished it.

480
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,425
I know what it means.

481
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:49,429
I know what the Phantoms really are.

482
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:53,422
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!

483
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:06,446
We have them, sir.

484
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,447
Sir?

485
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:11,440
My wife and daughter...

486
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:16,456
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier when the city was attacked.

487
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:20,449
Did I ever tell you that?

488
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:25,465
I try to imagine what
that must have been llke...

489
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:29,458
...seeing everyone around you
fall over dead for no apparent reason.

490
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,463
And then, at the end,
feeling something next to you...

491
00:49:35,475 --> 00:49:37,477
...invisible...

492
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,479
...touching you...

493
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:43,472
...reaching inside your body....

494
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:47,487
You've lost family, haven't you?

495
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,489
Yes, sir.

496
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:52,492
That's why I trust you.

497
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:53,493
All of you.

498
00:49:53,493 --> 00:49:57,486
You know what must be done.

499
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:06,506
Security override.

500
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:06,310
Perimeter breach.

501
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:06,510
What's happening?

502
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,513
Major, arrest these men.

503
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:16,516
-Take it easy.
-Stand up. Go.

504
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:20,509
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask questions.

505
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:24,524
Reduce power to Sector 31.

506
00:50:24,524 --> 00:50:26,526
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms--

507
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,528
What I realize...

508
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:32,521
...is we must force the council
to take action.

509
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:42,542
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.

510
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:46,546
Lowering power output to Sector 31.

511
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:49,549
Barrier breach in Sector 31, General.
They're coming through now.

512
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:53,542
We can handle
a few Phantoms in a contained space.

513
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:58,547
Relax, major. When this night's over,
you're going to be a hero.

514
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:04,564
-Aki I don't think ...
-You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it.

515
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:07,567
I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?

516
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:09,569
Captain, please, let her continue.

517
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:13,573
Why do you think
we've never been able to determine...

518
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:17,566
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?

519
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:22,582
Excuse me, doc,
but what frigging relationship?

520
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:26,586
I mean you got your human-sized Phantoms,
and your creepy caterpillary Phantoms...

521
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:29,589
...your flying Phantoms and let's not forget my personal favorite...

522
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:31,591
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.

523
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:32,592
Down, boy.

524
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:35,595
He's right. If you've spent as much time in the field as we have...

525
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:39,599
...you know there is no relationship.
It's llke a zoo out there.

526
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,602
Precisely. I think the giant ones are
llke our whales or elephants.

527
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:46,595
But why would an invading army bring a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?

528
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:50,610
Unless their ship was some kind of a crazy Noah's Ark?

529
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,613
We have always assumed that the meteor...

530
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:57,617
...was intended as a form of transportation. But it wasn't.

531
00:51:57,617 --> 00:52:00,620
The meteor is a chunk of their planet
that got thrown into space...

532
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,621
...when they destroyed their world.

533
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:05,614
But how could they survive the trip
across outer space on a hunk of rock?

534
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:10,619
They didn't.

535
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:14,634
Oh. This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.

536
00:52:14,634 --> 00:52:16,636
What do you think about all this, Captain?

537
00:52:16,636 --> 00:52:20,640
I think that explains why
we never had a chance.

538
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,644
All our strategies are based
on one assumption:

539
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:27,647
That we were fighting alien invaders.

540
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:30,650
Think of the dream, Gray.
How they died.

541
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,653
Since then, all they've known is suffering.

542
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:35,655
They're not an invading army.

543
00:52:35,655 --> 00:52:39,659
They're ghosts.

544
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:40,660
How many Phantoms?

545
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,662
More than enough to convince the council.

546
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:46,655
Excellent. Sound an alert.
Send a squad out to eliminate them.

547
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:50,670
Alert status. Full deployment.

548
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,672
I have numerous Phantom contacts!

549
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:53,673
Of course you do.

550
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:56,676
Outside of Sector 31
and moving at incredible speed.

551
00:52:56,676 --> 00:52:58,678
What the hell is going on?

552
00:52:58,678 --> 00:53:00,680
They're in the pipes.

553
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,683
They're moving with
the bio-etheric energy flow.

554
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:07,687
That's impossible. Nothing could survive in those pipes.

555
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:11,680
Well we've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.

556
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,701
Oh, my God.

557
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:25,694
Hold your fire!

558
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:13,742
What have I done?

559
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:35,764
Come on, Neil. We need a way out.
You're our man. Think.

560
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:40,780
These walls are titanium alloy
and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.

561
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:44,773
I mean it's not llke I can just
wave a magic wand and....

562
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:49,789
-Neil, I'm impressed.
-That makes two of us.

563
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:53,793
Proceed to the nearest
evacuation facility.

564
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:55,795
Proceed to the nearest
evacuation facility.

565
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:59,788
I think we should proceed
to the nearest evacuation facility.

566
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:26,826
-Here they come.
-But the others! Dr. Sid!

567
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:30,819
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.

568
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:38,838
what's happening? Why can we see them now?

569
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:42,831
They must be carrying
a residual charge from the barrier.

570
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:51,840
Behind you!

571
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,903
All aboard, captain!

572
00:57:59,979 --> 00:58:01,981
We need to find my ship.

573
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:04,984
If it was towed here,
it would be in the military hangar.

574
00:58:04,984 --> 00:58:08,977
That's a big "if."

575
00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:18,987
Look out!

576
00:58:24,003 --> 00:58:27,996
-Get us onto the platform.
-Got it.

577
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:46,025
Okay, now what?

578
00:58:46,025 --> 00:58:48,027
We're going through the station.

579
00:58:48,027 --> 00:58:50,029
With all due respect--

580
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:52,031
-Excuse me, captain.
-The station.

581
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,033
We're going through it.

582
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:56,035
It's the only way.

583
00:58:56,035 --> 00:59:00,039
So I gather this will be
somewhat of a rough ride?

584
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:02,041
Now you've got a talent for understatement.

585
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:06,034
Hang on, everybody!

586
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:33,061
Doc?

587
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:36,075
Interesting.

588
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:40,068
-Anybody hurt?
-Captain.

589
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:46,085
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.

590
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:47,086
Ouch!

591
00:59:47,086 --> 00:59:49,088
-Give me a hand, Jane.
-Right.

592
00:59:49,088 --> 00:59:53,092
No, wait! We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.

593
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:56,095
They're in my ship.

594
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:59,098
-No. No, doc. No drugs.
-Captain?

595
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:01,100
You heard the man.

596
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,102
We'll find the ship. We'll be back for you.

597
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:05,104
-I'll stay with him.
-Me too.

598
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:08,107
Nobody's staying.

599
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:10,109
-Just give me a gun.
-You got it.

600
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:14,102
Give him a weapon. Do it!

601
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:17,116
We'll be back for you.

602
01:00:17,116 --> 01:00:18,117
You hear me?

603
01:00:18,117 --> 01:00:22,121
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.

604
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:26,114
Let's move out.

605
01:01:14,173 --> 01:01:17,176
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.

606
01:01:17,176 --> 01:01:21,180
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.

607
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:25,184
However, we'll need to replace
these spent fuel cells.

608
01:01:25,184 --> 01:01:28,187
There could be some llve ovo-pacs in the hangar.

609
01:01:28,187 --> 01:01:31,190
All right. Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.

610
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,192
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.

611
01:01:33,192 --> 01:01:35,194
I'll go to the tower and rotate the airtray.

612
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:39,187
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this thing and get out the hell out of here.

613
01:01:52,211 --> 01:01:53,212
Be careful.

614
01:01:53,212 --> 01:01:57,205
You too.

615
01:02:37,256 --> 01:02:41,249
Oh, yeah.

616
01:02:54,273 --> 01:02:55,274
Neil, do you read me?

617
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:57,276
Loud and clear, captain.

618
01:02:57,276 --> 01:03:01,269
This baby'll fly itself.

619
01:03:06,285 --> 01:03:08,287
Fllght path is set.

620
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:12,280
Beginning rotation.

621
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:15,294
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.

622
01:03:15,294 --> 01:03:18,297
An impound tractor
is attached to the ship.

623
01:03:18,297 --> 01:03:21,300
Can you disengage from the cockpit?

624
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,303
Permission to go outside
and detach the coupling.

625
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:28,296
Do it.

626
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:41,309
There's the problem.

627
01:03:47,326 --> 01:03:51,319
The controls are locked, naturally.

628
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:56,335
Jane, let me ask you someting.
You think we'll get out of here alive?

629
01:03:56,335 --> 01:03:59,338
I mean I wonder if anybody else has gotten out.

630
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:01,340
You think anyone's made it this far?

631
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,343
You think will this eighth-spirit stuff
work against the Phantoms?

632
01:04:04,343 --> 01:04:08,336
I mean what if it's all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo?

633
01:04:09,348 --> 01:04:13,341
Jane, do you mind we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

634
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:27,366
What's happening down there?

635
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:31,359
Nothing we can't handle.

636
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:45,384
-Neil, what's your status?
-Almost there.

637
01:04:45,384 --> 01:04:47,386
I want you two back inside.

638
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:51,390
We're fine. Jane is negotiating
with extreme prejudice.

639
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,393
Talk to me, Jane.

640
01:04:54,393 --> 01:04:58,386
No problem here, captain.

641
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,393
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

642
01:05:27,443 --> 01:05:31,200
No!

643
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:46,445
Jane, get out of there.

644
01:05:46,445 --> 01:05:49,448
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!

645
01:05:49,448 --> 01:05:53,441
Get the hell out of there! Jane!

646
01:06:18,477 --> 01:06:21,480
The shield is powered and ready.

647
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,482
-Where are you going?
-To the cockpit. The ship is set on auto-pilot.

648
01:06:23,482 --> 01:06:26,485
We're in countdown to llftoff.

649
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:30,478
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!

650
01:06:53,512 --> 01:06:57,505
Over here, you son of a bitch!

651
01:08:22,601 --> 01:08:25,604
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?

652
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:28,607
You and Sid are getting out of here now.

653
01:08:28,607 --> 01:08:31,610
-No! We can't just leave everyone.
-Everyone's dead!

654
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:35,603
-I'm not leaving without you.
-Sorry, but you don't have a choice.

655
01:08:37,616 --> 01:08:41,609
Goodbye, Aki.

656
01:09:17,656 --> 01:09:21,649
Gray, come on!

657
01:11:23,782 --> 01:11:26,785
I just....

658
01:11:26,785 --> 01:11:30,778
I wish I could believe
they were in a better place.

659
01:13:39,918 --> 01:13:41,920
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...

660
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,923
...to include an area that
we had previously overlooked.

661
01:13:44,923 --> 01:13:47,926
The impact crater.

662
01:13:47,926 --> 01:13:49,928
Strange place to find the eighth spirit.

663
01:13:49,928 --> 01:13:51,930
Yes, really quite astonishing.

664
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,933
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.

665
01:13:54,933 --> 01:13:55,934
Precisely.

666
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:58,937
Which suggests that the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.

667
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:02,941
I can't explain it at the moment,
but once we get down there...

668
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:05,944
-...you will understand--
-Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.

669
01:14:05,944 --> 01:14:09,948
Yes, I expected that's how
you would evaluate our chances.

670
01:14:09,948 --> 01:14:10,949
Well, am I wrong?

671
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:12,951
No, I agree. We probably...

672
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:15,954
...won't live long enough to extract
the eighth spirit from the crater.

673
01:14:15,954 --> 01:14:17,956
Then why even try it?

674
01:14:17,956 --> 01:14:19,958
Because we don't need
to extract the eighth spirit.

675
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:21,960
If we can't bring
the final spirit here...

676
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,963
...we can go there and complete
the wave inside the crater.

677
01:14:24,963 --> 01:14:26,965
Yes, exactly.

678
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:28,967
And how do we do that, exactly?

679
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:30,969
I can construct a device that...

680
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:34,962
...would attach to Aki's chest plate
to gather the eighth spirit and....

681
01:14:36,975 --> 01:14:37,976
And what?

682
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:41,980
And then we wait and see what happens.

683
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,982
That's it?

684
01:14:43,982 --> 01:14:47,986
That's your plan?
We wait and see what happens?

685
01:14:47,986 --> 01:14:51,990
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.

686
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,992
We keep scanning the surface from orbit...

687
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:57,996
...and maybe we'll find
a compatible spirit somewhere else.

688
01:14:57,996 --> 01:15:01,989
I say we go in.

689
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:05,789
General Hein, you're clear to get into 01 alpha

690
01:15:29,027 --> 01:15:33,020
What caused the barrier to fail, General Hein?

691
01:15:34,032 --> 01:15:36,034
I'm afraid it was only a matter of time...

692
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:39,037
...before the Phantoms developed
an immunity to our barriers.

693
01:15:39,037 --> 01:15:42,040
But I am relieved to see
that you and the council...

694
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,044
...were able to evacuate
to Houston without incident.

695
01:15:46,044 --> 01:15:49,047
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.

696
01:15:49,047 --> 01:15:52,050
The council has reconsidered
your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.

697
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:54,052
I see.

698
01:15:54,052 --> 01:15:58,056
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.

699
01:15:58,056 --> 01:16:00,058
And, general...

700
01:16:00,058 --> 01:16:04,051
...best of luck to us all.

701
01:16:06,064 --> 01:16:07,065
Prepare to fire the cannon.

702
01:16:07,065 --> 01:16:10,068
The target, sir?

703
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:14,061
The Phantom crater.

704
01:16:39,097 --> 01:16:43,090
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.

705
01:16:47,105 --> 01:16:51,098
Powering the shield.

706
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:54,112
Okay, we're over the meteor.

707
01:16:54,112 --> 01:16:57,115
Do you have it in sight, doctor?

708
01:16:57,115 --> 01:17:01,119
There are so many of them.

709
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:02,120
Wait.

710
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:06,113
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit
along the crater's surface.

711
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:11,118
All right.
Now let's take a closer look.

712
01:17:50,168 --> 01:17:52,170
Ready to fire in three minutes.

713
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:56,163
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.

714
01:17:57,175 --> 01:17:59,177
Counter-thrusters are engaged.

715
01:17:59,177 --> 01:18:02,180
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.

716
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:06,173
We have something on radar
over the impact site, sir.

717
01:18:08,186 --> 01:18:09,187
It's her.

718
01:18:09,187 --> 01:18:11,189
Sir?

719
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:13,191
Just a traitor under
the influence of the enemy.

720
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:15,193
Continue the countdown.

721
01:18:15,193 --> 01:18:19,186
We'll take them all out at the same time.

722
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,193
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.

723
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:29,207
Target locked.

724
01:18:29,207 --> 01:18:33,200
Ready to fire on your command.

725
01:18:35,213 --> 01:18:38,216
It's a match! It's a perfect match!

726
01:18:38,216 --> 01:18:42,209
-Scanners ready.
-Fire.

727
01:19:15,253 --> 01:19:16,254
What was that?

728
01:19:16,254 --> 01:19:19,257
It's the Zeus.
They're firing on the crater.

729
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:22,260
-Aki, Captain, are you all right?
-A llttle shaken. Stand by.

730
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:26,253
Sid, the eighth spirit is not
on our scanner. Do you have it?

731
01:19:28,266 --> 01:19:30,268
The eighth spirit...

732
01:19:30,268 --> 01:19:32,270
...has been destroyed.

733
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:36,263
-What are we going to do now?
-Nothing. This mission is over.

734
01:19:37,275 --> 01:19:41,268
-Let's get out of here.
-Incoming!

735
01:20:10,308 --> 01:20:12,310
What is that?

736
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:16,303
If you're getting us out here,
you better do it now.

737
01:20:27,325 --> 01:20:31,318
Hold on!

738
01:20:38,336 --> 01:20:42,329
the Quatro
I can't hold on to you.

739
01:20:44,342 --> 01:20:48,335
Unable to maintain altitude.

740
01:20:54,352 --> 01:20:58,345
Emergency landing procedures.

741
01:21:20,378 --> 01:21:23,381
Come in. Come in, please.

742
01:21:23,381 --> 01:21:26,384
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

743
01:21:26,384 --> 01:21:30,377
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?

744
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:36,394
-What is that thing?
-I don't know, sir.

745
01:21:36,394 --> 01:21:38,396
Incoming message, sir.

746
01:21:38,396 --> 01:21:41,399
General Hein, you must cease fire immediately.

747
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:45,403
What you're seeing is the living
spirit of an alien's home world.

748
01:21:45,403 --> 01:21:48,406
Their planet was destroyed and part of it landed here.

749
01:21:48,406 --> 01:21:51,409
This is not an invasion.
It never was.

750
01:21:51,409 --> 01:21:55,402
I see. What have we been fighting
all this time? Ghosts?

751
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:57,415
Yes.

752
01:21:57,415 --> 01:22:00,418
Spirits that are confused,
lost and angry.

753
01:22:00,418 --> 01:22:03,421
Right. And these spirits are
coming out of this Gaia thing.

754
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:05,423
General Hein, you have to listen.

755
01:22:05,423 --> 01:22:09,427
Allen Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Doctor, Even if I believed this nonsence ...

756
01:22:09,427 --> 01:22:12,430
...the fact remains Earth's under attack
from an aggressor...

757
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,433
...who must be destroyed at all costs.

758
01:22:15,433 --> 01:22:17,435
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.

759
01:22:17,435 --> 01:22:20,438
Firing on the alien Gaia
will only make it stronger.

760
01:22:20,438 --> 01:22:24,431
Well, since you're under the alien's
influence, Doctor, i will take your protest to mean that we are ...

761
01:22:25,443 --> 01:22:27,445
...in fact persuing the correct course of action.

762
01:22:27,445 --> 01:22:31,438
So I suggest you take your last few moments and prepare to meet your Gaia.

763
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:36,443
Continue to fire until
the invader has been destroyed.

764
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:14,492
General, the system's overheating.

765
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:18,496
We'll hit again and keep on hitting
it until it's dead.

766
01:23:18,496 --> 01:23:21,499
But we're not even sure if it's having any effect.

767
01:23:21,499 --> 01:23:24,502
No effect? We've got them
on the run, soldier.

768
01:23:24,502 --> 01:23:28,495
This is our moment of victory.
I order you to fire.

769
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:33,500
-The system won't allow us to fire.
-We'll see about that.

770
01:23:34,512 --> 01:23:38,505
Our shield is out.
We're sitting ducks. Come on!

771
01:23:59,537 --> 01:24:03,530
This is not a good place to be.

772
01:24:10,548 --> 01:24:13,551
What the hell is that?
Is it what I think it is?

773
01:24:13,551 --> 01:24:15,553
Yes, it's Gaia.

774
01:24:15,553 --> 01:24:19,557
This is definitely not a good place to be.

775
01:24:19,557 --> 01:24:21,559
Are you all right?

776
01:24:21,559 --> 01:24:25,552
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

777
01:25:03,601 --> 01:25:06,604
Sid, do you read me?

778
01:25:06,604 --> 01:25:09,607
Go ahead, I'm still here.

779
01:25:09,607 --> 01:25:13,611
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.

780
01:25:13,611 --> 01:25:17,604
This explains why
the eighth spirit appeared here.

781
01:25:19,617 --> 01:25:20,618
Yes.

782
01:25:20,618 --> 01:25:22,620
Yes, that's it!

783
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,623
A Phantom changed into the eighth spirit...

784
01:25:25,623 --> 01:25:28,626
...at touching a llfe born from our own Gaia.

785
01:25:28,626 --> 01:25:32,630
If so, it would've gotten a different energy signature...

786
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:35,633
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.

787
01:25:35,633 --> 01:25:38,636
You couldn't have hoped for a better location...

788
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:41,639
...to find a new compatible spirit.

789
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:45,632
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.

790
01:25:46,644 --> 01:25:50,648
Staying where we are may not be as easy as it sounds.

791
01:25:50,648 --> 01:25:53,651
Don't shoot any of them!

792
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:56,654
You could very well destroy our last hope.

793
01:25:56,654 --> 01:25:59,657
What do you suggest I do, Doctor?
Ask them to play nice?

794
01:25:59,657 --> 01:26:04,650
Combat strategy is your area  of expertise, captain, not mine.

795
01:26:04,662 --> 01:26:07,665
I have a reading in the fissure. Do you see it?

796
01:26:07,665 --> 01:26:12,658
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.

797
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,672
Well? Which one is it?

798
01:26:14,672 --> 01:26:16,674
Which one?

799
01:26:16,674 --> 01:26:20,667
I'm having difficulty in narrowing it down.
Just a moment, please.

800
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,673
It's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have much time.

801
01:26:27,175 --> 01:26:29,478
Aki! Aki!

802
01:27:57,775 --> 01:28:00,778
With the hope of new life...

803
01:28:00,778 --> 01:28:04,771
...has Gaia changed the Phantom within?

804
01:28:09,787 --> 01:28:13,780
I have it.

805
01:28:16,794 --> 01:28:20,798
Gray, get in here. I need you!

806
01:28:20,798 --> 01:28:23,801
Hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.

807
01:28:23,801 --> 01:28:27,805
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.

808
01:28:27,805 --> 01:28:30,808
I don't see how you found the final spirit.

809
01:28:30,808 --> 01:28:34,812
It found me, doctor.

810
01:28:34,812 --> 01:28:37,815
Oh, my word.

811
01:28:37,815 --> 01:28:40,818
I see now. I understand.

812
01:28:40,818 --> 01:28:43,821
But I don't understand!
What the hell is going on?

813
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:45,823
Give me your ovo-pac. I need it to project the complete wave.

814
01:28:45,823 --> 01:28:49,827
-But we'll be defenseless.
-Just do it!

815
01:28:49,827 --> 01:28:53,831
-I hope you know what you're doing, Aki.
-We can use the shield to project the wave.

816
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:57,835
Dr. Sid's theory was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.

817
01:28:57,835 --> 01:28:59,837
I'm cured, Gray.

818
01:28:59,837 --> 01:29:02,840
-Are you sure you have the final spirit?
-Yes, yes, I'm sure.

819
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,843
-How can you know?
-Don't worry. A Phantom told me.

820
01:29:05,843 --> 01:29:07,845
Oh, great.

821
01:29:07,845 --> 01:29:11,838
That's it. Shield on.

822
01:29:15,853 --> 01:29:19,857
It's not working.
We have to do something before it's too late.

823
01:29:19,857 --> 01:29:23,850
If this doesn't work,
then it's already too late.

824
01:29:30,868 --> 01:29:34,861
Gray, trust me.

825
01:29:56,894 --> 01:30:00,887
I'll blast you all to hell.

826
01:30:05,903 --> 01:30:09,896
Oh, no. No!

827
01:30:11,909 --> 01:30:15,902
Get down!

828
01:30:25,923 --> 01:30:28,926
-Warning. System overload.
-I know.

829
01:30:28,926 --> 01:30:32,919
-Warning. System overload.
-I know!

830
01:30:37,935 --> 01:30:41,928
But it must be done.

831
01:31:21,979 --> 01:31:23,981
Fire.

832
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:25,983
Fire, damn you!

833
01:31:25,983 --> 01:31:29,976
Fire!

834
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,666
Gray, Gray.

835
01:32:46,063 --> 01:32:49,066
Don't leave me, Gray.

836
01:32:49,066 --> 01:32:52,069
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.

837
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:54,071
Looks llke I was right.

838
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:57,074
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

839
01:32:57,074 --> 01:32:59,076
I still have the wave.

840
01:32:59,076 --> 01:33:03,069
We can get through this.

841
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:09,086
-We're not gonna make it.
-We are going to make it.

842
01:33:09,086 --> 01:33:13,079
We both know that isn't true.

843
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:28,094
Help me.

844
01:33:36,113 --> 01:33:38,115
Listen to me.

845
01:33:38,115 --> 01:33:42,119
You saved my llfe once.
Now I want you to save yourself.

846
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:44,121
Gray, no. Please!

847
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:48,114
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.

848
01:33:57,134 --> 01:33:59,136
Don't leave me, Gray.

849
01:33:59,136 --> 01:34:02,139
You've been trying to tell me the death isn't the end.

850
01:34:02,139 --> 01:34:08,100
Don't back out on me now that I finally believe.

851
01:34:19,156 --> 01:34:23,149
I love you.

852
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:14,260
Oh, it's warm.

853
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:50,100
Free the dream within

854
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:58,900
The stars are crying a tear

855
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:06,000
A sigh escapes from heaven

856
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,700
And the world's end

857
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:15,200
Breathe the dream within

858
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:19,900
The mystifying

859
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:26,900
We tremble and spin

860
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:34,700
Suspended within

861
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:48,700
Look beyond where hearts can see

862
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:55,000
Dream in peace

863
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:02,800
Trust, love, believe

864
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:09,200
We tremble and spin

865
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:20,900
Suspended within

866
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:26,400
Free the dream within

867
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:34,600
The voices calling, a song

868
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:41,700
A prayer from deep inside you

869
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:45,800
To guide you

870
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:51,500
Be the dream within

871
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:55,800
The light is shining

872
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:02,900
A flame on the wind

873
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:11,300
Salvation begins

874
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:25,300
Look beyond where hearts can see

875
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:30,900
Dream in peace

876
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:39,000
Trust, love, believe

877
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:45,400
We tremble and spin

878
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:56,600
Suspended within

879
01:40:56,600 --> 01:41:04,600
Ah...

880
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:15,600
