1
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,195
<i>Jerome!</i>
<i>Put on that Bobby Womack.</i>

2
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,155
<i>No, girl, I want to go way back.</i>
<i>Oh yeah, check this out.</i>

3
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,477
Please put that in the kitchen.
And watch the wall... the wall!

4
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,150
- Who is this pretty lady?
- I told Oliver we shouldn't do this here.

5
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,230
- What's wrong?
- Why couldn't we do it at the church?

6
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,231
- Mike, get that out of my face, please.
- Mr Blackman is going to like this one.

7
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:50,199
Yeah? I have some videos myself.
You know I keep everything, boy.

8
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,713
- Are you trying to blackmail me?
- That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

9
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,631
Tell my son Roland I want to see him.

10
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,038
Oliver, time to set up
the chairs outside.

11
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,871
It just wouldn't seem right
without any drama.

12
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,438
I never thought Roland would
get married. Apparently, neither did he.

13
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,031
The wedding kicks off in three hours
and nobody can find him.

14
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,758
My name is Mike. Big Mike
in the Wood, but we'll get to that later.

15
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,555
What's the Wood?

16
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,997
It's not what you think it is.
No, it's Inglewood, California.

17
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,593
It's where we grew up.
Me, Roland and Slim.

18
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:54,148
There's Slim. He's been pissed off
ever since Roland went missing.

19
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,117
- Every five minutes he says...
- Where the fuck is that nigger?

20
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,869
- See?
- Who the fuck are you talking to?

21
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,076
Excuse me.

22
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,231
If Roland didn't want to get married,
he shouldn't have asked.

23
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,195
Nobody forced him. He wants to be
Hugh Hefner <i>and</i> get married.

24
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,396
- Hugh Hefner <i>is</i> married.
- He's divorced... Fuck him, too!

25
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,196
The point is, we were supposed
to meet the photographer an hour ago!

26
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,315
And don't ever front me
in front of people we don't know.

27
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,471
Don't mind Slim. He and Ro are always
in disagreement about something.

28
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,319
It's always been that way.

29
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,389
Me? I get to play the peacemaker.
The mediator.

30
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,432
Goddamn! It's hard to believe we
dressed like this and thought it cool.

31
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,474
Oh, man.

32
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,470
<i>In 1986 me, my little brother</i>
<i>and my mom moved to Inglewood.</i>

33
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,716
<i>An L.A. Suburb.</i>

34
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,790
<i>My mom got a new job at the hospital.</i>
<i>For the last time, I hoped.</i>

35
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,151
<i>This was my third school in five years.</i>

36
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,950
<i>It wasjust like the movies here.</i>
<i>Middle of January, yet 80 degrees.</i>

37
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,234
<i>Palm trees, sunny skies</i>
<i>and, of course, beautiful women.</i>

38
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,558
You see her titties in "Purple Rain"?
You could eat off those.

39
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,274
- You're crazy.
- Vanity looked fine in "Last Dragon".

40
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,998
She didn't show no tit.
Let's ask him, man.

41
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,638
- Who's finer, Vanity or Apolonia?
- Apolonia, man.

42
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,354
- Vanity.
- What did I tell you?

43
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,836
- He doesn't know anything.
- You're the new kid, right?

44
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,115
So, are you cuz or blood?
Are you cuz or blood?

45
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,274
- Cuz what?
- What set are you from, man?

46
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,312
I don't know anything about any sets.
I'm from North Carolina.

47
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,469
North Carolina? That's why
the nigger sounds like Willie Nelson.

48
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,391
You better hang with us. You got
to learn how to make it in the Wood.

49
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,397
- Otherwise you might get shot.
- Shot?

50
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,353
You know, shot. Bang-bang.

51
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,914
- The nigger don't know nothing.
- We've got to teach him the ropes.

52
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,513
- I'm Roland. This skinny fool is Slim.
- I'm Mike.

53
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,076
- You play ball?
- I play baseball.

54
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,229
We ain't in Boston. That's that
white boy, Ricky Schroeder shit.

55
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,436
- I mean basketball.
- No. But I watch it a lot.

56
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,357
Rule number one in the Wood:
Either you gang-bang or you play ball.

57
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,714
Or you could be a pimp, like me.
Because I've got to stay clean.

58
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,236
Whose homeroom are you in?

59
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,629
- Mrs Hughes.
- That's where we're going.

60
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,593
What's up with the threads, man?

61
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,951
And look out for Mrs Hughes.
Somebody should give her a Tic Tac.

62
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,031
Oh, man!

63
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,871
- Who is that?
- That's Alicia.

64
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,198
- She's fine as hell, ain't she?
- You ain't never lying.

65
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,078
- What, you like her?
- No, I just think she looks good.

66
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,912
So does every nigger in the school.
Watch this, though.

67
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,351
- Alicia...
- What are you doing?

68
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,031
Alicia, you're looking nice today.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,231
You ain't got a play. Give it up.

70
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,752
<i>Alicia. It was early in the morning,</i>
<i>but my hormones were wide awake.</i>

71
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,349
Settle down. Before we begin,
I'd like to introduce Michael.

72
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,997
Today is his first day. Stand up
and tell the class about yourself.

73
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,196
Yeah, Michael.

74
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,355
<i>I kept thinking,</i>
<i>"Please go down. Please!"</i>

75
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,155
- Well, I'm Mike...
- Come up here, so we can see you.

76
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,989
<i>I've got to be cool.</i>
<i>Think of something. Baseball.</i>

77
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,228
<i>First base, second... Hell,</i>
<i>I'd like to hit a home run with Alicia.</i>

78
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,998
<i>Shit, bad move!</i>

79
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,150
Well, I'm Mike.

80
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,554
I'm from North Carolina...
and I like sports.

81
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,109
- And that's it.
- "I like sports and that's it."

82
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,953
Levinio, is something amusing you?
Then turn to page 15, like the rest.

83
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,711
- Levinio?
- What page is 15 on?

84
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,994
Never mind. I'll find it.

85
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,471
Roland.

86
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,275
- Whose number is that anyway?
- We'll find out.

87
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,075
- Hello.
- Who's this?

88
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,230
- Nice to speak to you too, Slim.
- Tanya? This is real bad.

89
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,396
Is Ro over there?

90
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,639
Yeah, and he's pretty jacked up.
Would you be quiet!

91
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,753
<i>He's been drinking.</i>

92
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,988
- That nigger don't drink.
- This is an enormous snag.

93
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,751
Roland and Tanya,
that was his first love. First...

94
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,034
Keep that fool there. We're coming.

95
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,394
Hurry up, or I'll put my foot
where it don't belong.

96
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,751
- Hurry up.
- We're coming right now.

97
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,191
- What's up?
- I hope he didn't do what I think.

98
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,392
We've just got to go and get him.

99
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,152
- That's sweet. When did you get that?
- A couple of weeks ago.

100
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,830
Nothing big.
A little something.

101
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,156
If you work hard, you might
afford one of these one day.

102
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,116
- What's up?
- Come here, my childhood nigger!

103
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,310
- What's wrong?
- Why the long faces?

104
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,719
- What have you been drinking?
- Have you forgot about today?

105
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,309
The flowers, the family, Lisa?

106
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,274
Lisa...
I bet she's looking pretty.

107
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,554
- Is she, Slim?
- He came like this an hour ago.

108
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,833
<i>Making love forever...</i>

109
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,470
- That was our song.
- What's wrong with you?

110
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,478
- You didn't fuck, did you?
- No. What do I look like?

111
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,358
- I'm just saying...
- Nothing happened. Leave it at that.

112
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,951
- Let's go before she whops my ass.
- I ain't going to that place.

113
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,358
What do you mean?
I paid $100 for this tux!

114
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,918
- I'll go and get some coffee.
- And get some Listerine, too.

115
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,151
Listen. Get the fuck out of here,
because I'm trying to get into that.

116
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,388
Did you see her booty?
I'm going to make her booty giggle.

117
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,991
- What is wrong with you?
- You wanted to squeeze it.

118
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,670
You're getting married. Don't be a punk.

119
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,432
- You're a punk.
- I will whop your mud-bone ass.

120
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,916
You're fucking up big time, man.

121
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,990
Damn, Mike.
I know I'm fucking up.

122
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:03,833
I love Lisa, but I don't know, man.
I just don't know.

123
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,600
What don't you know?

124
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,393
You thought of all that pussy
you'd be giving up and you punked out.

125
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,789
- That's what it is, Mike.
- Somebody always has to punk out.

126
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,634
I'm sorry to break up your
all-boys meeting, but this is my house.

127
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,516
You need to drink this.
No, hold it. God...

128
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,599
- I'm sorry.
- This shit is cold.

129
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,356
- We've got to go.
- My head is spinning.

130
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,032
- I've got to chill here.
- Not here. Grab your shit and let's go.

131
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,390
Let's go, baby.

132
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,149
- Where are you going with my pot?
- I'll bring it back.

133
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,868
<i>I found myself in the damnedest</i>
<i>situations with Roland and Slim.</i>

134
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,150
<i>My first school day was no different.</i>

135
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,956
Peep this thing.
Look at that booty.

136
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,756
- I bet it's soft.
- I'd love to grab that ass.

137
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,318
<i>Before sex, there was grabbing booty.</i>
<i>For a 14-year-old, that was the best.</i>

138
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,358
<i>It was like a game. You run up</i>
<i>and grab a girl's booty, and run.</i>

139
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,877
- I dare you to grab her booty.
- I'll do it.

140
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,790
I know, but I'm asking Mike.
I know you want to do it.

141
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,475
I will give you one dollar.
No, not you.

142
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,992
- You touch her booty, you get a buck.
- But you've got to do it right now.

143
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,599
Okay, it's a bet.

144
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,550
Do it before lunch is over,
or the bet's off.

145
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,478
Okay, man.

146
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,558
<i>I was ready and determined.</i>
<i>For a dollar, it was worth the risk.</i>

147
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,638
<i>And the booty was looking good.</i>

148
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,589
Shit!

149
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,717
Did you see him get hit in his face?

150
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,639
- Damn, she clocked your ass.
- Give me my dollar.

151
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,995
You do not know me. Don't ever
put your stinking hands on me again.

152
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,309
And I <i>will</i> tell my brother.

153
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,640
<i>I so wanted to fit in, I never wondered</i>
<i>why they didn't want to grab her butt.</i>

154
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,188
- Her brother?
- Remember the Bloods and the Crips?

155
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,752
- Yeah.
- Well, that nigger's a Blood.

156
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,557
When he picks me up, he'll kick
your ass. Bet on that, punk.

157
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,471
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't think she'd get that mad.

158
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,719
- I guess she just tripped.
- You're all in this with me.

159
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,513
You're tripping. You better run
out of here when school is over.

160
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,077
<i>Any other day,</i>
<i>time drags during the last period.</i>

161
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,879
<i>But time was on crack today.</i>
<i>Maybe she'd forget about it.</i>

162
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,351
<i>So much for that.</i>

163
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,839
Mike.

164
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,155
- That girl's got you bugging.
- You're sweating.

165
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,799
- You look like you're fast. Just run.
- What about tomorrow?

166
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,279
You live to run again, fool.
Let's go. We better go this way.

167
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,398
- Am I glad to get out of there!
- Do you wanna shoot some hoops?

168
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,315
What's wrong with you?

169
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,912
<i>Funny how any hint of a fight</i>
<i>always gets around the whole school.</i>

170
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,471
- My sister tells me you grabbed her!
- I didn't mean it!

171
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,754
- You think my sister's a ho?
- No, I think she's pretty.

172
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,073
- Leave him alone.
- Fuck you. You want some of me?

173
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,070
- Yeah... I guess so.
- No, this is my fight.

174
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,756
What, nigger?

175
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,352
<i>I could've sworn I saw the light.</i>
<i>A hand reaching out to me from above.</i>

176
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,348
- <i>My mistake. It was his fist.</i>
- I told you to scare him. Stop!

177
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,990
- Come on, man.
- Stacey, I said stop it.

178
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,234
- Let's go, Alicia.
- Are you all right?

179
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,033
- I'm okay.
- Let's go!

180
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,549
I'm sorry about...

181
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,869
- Are you all right? Damn!
- Come on!

182
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,675
I thought he was gonna kill you.

183
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,557
You got a hit on Stacey, though.
Ain't nobody ever done that.

184
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,952
- Thanks for having my back.
- We always got your back, man.

185
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,870
- We got you into this.
- We can't have you killed the first day.

186
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,952
Let's go. But was it worth it?
Was it worth getting beat down?

187
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,354
Yeah.

188
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,758
- In, baby, in.
- Let's go.

189
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,475
- Where's the aspirin at?
- In the third aisle.

190
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,639
- Where...?
- In the third aisle. Please!

191
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,152
I'm getting you some Tic Tacs.
You've got dragon breath.

192
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,229
What are you smiling about?
It's not funny.

193
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,470
We used to come up here and grab
a bunch of mints for the school dances.

194
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,112
- Grits?
- I used to have all the girls on my tail.

195
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,952
No.

196
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,629
Hold it.
Put another one...

197
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,119
Your no-dancing ass...

198
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,190
- Mike. No dancing.
- How did it go?

199
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,273
- Do it again.
- You're just jealous.

200
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,797
- Man, the dances!
- They was the bomb.

201
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,114
Put this on that nigger's tab.

202
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,356
If the aisles could talk,
the things they would say!

203
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,430
- Nobody's cooking those grits for you!
- If the aisles could talk, boy.

204
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,115
<i>After a couple of months,</i>
<i>I was getting adjusted to Inglewood.</i>

205
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,835
- Hi, baby.
- I ain't your baby.

206
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,238
- Are you going to the dance?
- Yeah, save a dance for me.

207
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,429
What about you, Mike?

208
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,272
- Yeah, I'm going.
- I can't wait. It's gonna be fresh.

209
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,075
First dance of the year, too.

210
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,992
Leave Tracy at home.
I can't stand that girl.

211
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,518
- What's up?
- What's up, Ro?

212
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,955
You just missed it. Alicia just came
and asked if I was going to the dance.

213
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,470
- So?
- She likes me.

214
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:29,552
- Why else did she come up to me?
- To see if you were going to the dance.

215
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,189
- She asked me this morning.
- So?

216
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,997
She asked me early in the morning, so
it's probably been on her mind all night.

217
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,834
The dance is gonna be slamming.
You'll get to show what you've got.

218
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,558
- You can dance, right?
- Yeah, I'm like "Dance Fever".

219
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,273
- We're gonna see on Friday.
- You can stay at my crib that night.

220
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,996
- That's cool. I'll ask my mom.
- Yeah, me too.

221
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,193
<i>I had never danced a day in my life.</i>
<i>Not with a girl.</i>

222
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,393
<i>With Alicia being there,</i>
<i>I couldn't look like a fool.</i>

223
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,910
<i>So I figured I'd learn how to dance.</i>

224
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,999
<i>Check this out. 1580 AM, KDAY.</i>

225
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,239
Oh, girl. You think I look good?
I think I look good.

226
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,635
Let me show you something.

227
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,076
Do you like that, girl?

228
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,710
That's cool. Watch this!

229
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,236
Girl, that wasn't it.

230
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,196
That wasn't nothing, girl.
Let me show you something cool.

231
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,994
You like that? You like me?

232
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,270
You sexy girl. Come here,
let me show you something.

233
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,233
You smell good, girl.

234
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,828
What is going on? Michael!

235
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,472
Mom.

236
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,439
I was just dancing.
There's a dance on Friday.

237
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,430
- So you did the freak with a rabbit?
- I've never danced before.

238
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,634
What about Deborah's wedding?
You were so cute.

239
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,473
- I was four. It's different now.
- Look at my little boy growing up.

240
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,792
That's the latest step.
It's called "the hip".

241
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,832
- So how's the job going?
- It's going well. The people seem nice.

242
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,678
Good.

243
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,593
- So who is she?
- What?

244
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,873
Only a woman can make a man
do the crazy stuff you were just doing.

245
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:29,555
- Come on. It ain't nobody.
- Whatever, boy.

246
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,629
I'm glad to see you like it here.
We're gonna stay here for a while.

247
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,589
Anyway, I think you need
a little more practice.

248
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,958
- Just keep it down.
- Okay, Ma.

249
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,119
This is it!

250
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,275
- Where'd you get that sweet hat?
- Carolina Blue in North Carolina.

251
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,077
Why are you wearing it like
a poindexter? Let me help you out.

252
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,470
- That's how the ballers wear it.
- Everybody got their pen and paper?

253
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,911
- A pen?
- To get girls' numbers.

254
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,749
Whoever gets the most numbers
gets a dollar.

255
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,319
- I don't have a pen.
- Here, I always carry a spare.

256
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,992
- But I'm gonna get the most anyway.
- You're crazy.

257
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,077
<i>It was all new to me. I'd never danced</i>
<i>with a girl, let alone got her number.</i>

258
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,670
Hold on. We didn't do the breath test.

259
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,759
- Shit!
- I'm cool.

260
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,953
But for how long? Have you got
some gum, candy, Binaca?

261
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,436
I need something.
My breath is kicking like Bruce Lee.

262
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,871
- Let's go to the mini-market.
- Hell, no. That's like Blood central.

263
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,949
I am not walking in there
with my breath smelling all tart.

264
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,356
Let's just go.

265
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,993
All right, man.

266
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,439
- Take that hat off. It's got blue in it.
- It's light blue.

267
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,111
- Take it off.
- What up, blood?

268
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,755
- My fault.
- Damn, that was too close.

269
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,758
I keep forgetting you're the rookie.

270
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,918
- Here are the refreshments.
- Tic Tacs.

271
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,037
- Good idea, but bad flavour.
- What's wrong with orange?

272
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,031
- School him.
- Tic Tacs are small, but powerful.

273
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,793
Always go small. You might be talking
to some girl, and the candy falls out.

274
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,791
- You'd look stupid.
- But Tic Tacs are hard to notice.

275
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,996
Especially in the dance, right?
And fruit flavours are always bad.

276
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,115
<i>Like Harvard professors. They had</i>
<i>breath mints down to a science.</i>

277
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,236
- That's important for slow dancing.
- What about gum?

278
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,635
I got this.

279
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,518
Always remember, when dealing
with females... Suck, never chew.

280
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,512
- I'll get the green.
- I'll get the white.

281
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,800
Let me get a soda.

282
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,790
- The party started an hour ago.
- We got time.

283
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,198
Give me the money.
Shut the fuck up and move!

284
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,553
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get down.

285
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,237
- What's going on?
- Check it out.

286
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,117
- Not this time. You check it out.
- Let's all check it out.

287
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,232
- Shit, they're robbing the place.
- No shit! As if I didn't know.

288
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,993
- We got to get out of here.
- Let's stay and let them rob the place.

289
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,637
- Then maybe they'll leave.
- Do you know where we're at?

290
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,356
Where's the other one?
I think he's coming.

291
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,199
I've got something for his ass.

292
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,915
Hold on, man. Oh, shit!

293
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,629
- Look. There's someone in here.
- Bring them here.

294
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,513
- I just wanted some Tic Tacs.
- Get in the front.

295
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,076
Hurry up!

296
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,079
They ain't nothing.
They go to school with my sister.

297
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,559
- Stacey?
- Don't say my name.

298
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,833
He's got a heart, though.
When I beat him, he took it like a G.

299
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,668
Are you going to the dance?
I remember them dances.

300
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,111
Don't fuck with me.
Get on the ground!

301
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,116
- Do you little niggers want something?
- I was kind of thirsty.

302
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,471
- Go and get it.
- No, we're cool.

303
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,909
At least let me give you a ride
to the dance. It's the least I can do.

304
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,309
You're wasting time. Come on.

305
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,590
I'm taking you to the dance.

306
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,239
- Did you get some more Zig-Zags?
- I forgot.

307
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,959
- That's the reason we went there.
- I went to get some rubbers.

308
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,430
- Do you want a hit?
- No, we're cool.

309
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,355
- Are you Muslims or something?
- No, we just don't do that.

310
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,154
I'm just trying to be generous. I don't
understand youngsters nowadays.

311
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,999
Pass that shit this way.

312
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,432
Fuck you. You ain't getting no Zig-Zags,
you ain't getting no drig-drag.

313
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,399
That shit rhymed, nigger.
I should be a rapper.

314
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,232
I'm harder than DMC.

315
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,319
I'm serious. I'd make
a whole album about smoking weed.

316
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,717
Nobody wants to buy that.

317
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,270
We'll get some beats like these
and sell millions.

318
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,074
Name me one race
that don't smoke bud.

319
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,589
I'd sell millions.
I'd call it "The Weed Album".

320
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,118
Getting contact back here?
Shit, the police!

321
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,110
- Put the gun under the seat.
- Open the windows.

322
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,596
- Open the windows.
- Don't panic.

323
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,759
I'm just taking you to the dance.

324
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,599
- Is there a problem?
- Your tail light is out. Licence, please.

325
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,116
- Slowly.
- Here you go, sir.

326
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,194
- Whose car is this?
- Mine. But it's in my mother's name.

327
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,757
- Your last names don't match.
- She just remarried.

328
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,313
Stop crying!

329
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,674
<i>It's amazing how tables can turn.</i>
<i>At the store, Boo was so tough,</i> - 

330
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,872
- <i>but now they were kids like us.</i>

331
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,752
Everybody out. Now!

332
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,470
Put your hands behind your heads.

333
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,277
Against the wall.
Get your hands behind your heads.

334
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,989
Get those legs apart.
I don't want to hear a sound.

335
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,598
Don't move. If you've got any
weapons or contraband, tell me now.

336
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,439
Spread them.

337
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,399
Get them apart.

338
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,235
<i>We're going tojail.</i>
<i>I'm going to be on "Scared Straight".</i>

339
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,595
Open those legs.

340
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,996
- They're clean.
- All this for a tail light?

341
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,320
- Speak only when you're spoken to.
- You heard the officer!

342
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,590
- Shut it up.
- Stacey, shut up.

343
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,553
What's going on?

344
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,518
It's just my allergies, sir. I'm sorry.

345
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,474
Unit C6. We'll take care of it.

346
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,309
<i>God, if you get us out of this,</i>
<i>I'll never grab a booty again.</i>

347
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,114
Davis, let's move.

348
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,671
Turn around.

349
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,871
You can go now.
And you, greasy one...

350
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,516
Get that tail light fixed.

351
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,790
<i>Prayer really works. The robbery</i>
<i>they just committed got us off.</i>

352
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,878
<i>Life's funny sometimes.</i>
<i>As long as it doesn't laugh at you.</i>

353
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:04,076
Get in the back, cry-baby.
These kids have more heart than you!

354
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,638
- I'm riding in the front.
- Get in the back or walk home!

355
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,915
In the front, homeboy.
You, get up in the front.

356
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,757
What were you thinking, alcoholic?

357
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,555
Popping Tic Tacs
when we got pulled over.

358
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,232
I was thinking that this could be
my last meal as a free man.

359
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,510
You smell.

360
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,993
He was thinking it might be a female
cop and he could sweet talk us out of it.

361
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,992
- Get some more Tic Tacs, just in case.
- Don't doubt the mack skills.

362
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,112
It's got me out of a lot of shit.

363
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,279
Keep the change, homey.

364
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,597
Get out and go have some fun.

365
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,351
Little man, let me talk to you.

366
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,438
I apologise for beating your ass.
But I was protecting my sister.

367
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,795
She's cute. There's always
some nigger trying to fuck with her.

368
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,672
Yeah, I know. It's cool.

369
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,320
You like her, don't you?

370
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,195
It's cool.
I ain't gonna do nothing to you.

371
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,751
- I guess.
- You guess?

372
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,950
Well, yeah, I do.

373
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,439
- What's your name?
- Mike.

374
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,519
Big Mike. You got good taste.

375
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,599
She's cool. She's smart, too.

376
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,716
She loves that Luther Vandross song
"If This World Were Mine".

377
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,358
If they happen to play that,
I want you to get your dance.

378
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,518
I'm serious, man.

379
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,834
Go and have some fun... Big Mike.

380
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,949
Stay your cry-baby ass in the back!

381
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,073
- Are you all right?
- What did he say?

382
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:10,708
- He just wanted to know my name.
- I thought he was gonna get you.

383
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,516
No, man. Let's just get up
in this party, finally.

384
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,349
<i>The party of all parties. I'd never seen</i>
<i>anything like this in North Carolina.</i>

385
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,588
<i>Hormonesjumping, music pumping,</i>
<i>booties shaking... paradise!</i>

386
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,709
I'm gonna be freaking
all the fine skeezers up in here tonight.

387
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,190
Check it out, Ro.
Go, Ro!

388
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,636
That's my boy!

389
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,154
Lay back and let's see who's here.

390
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,036
Look at that freak right there.
That booty is nice!

391
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,592
I'm dancing with her.
You get her friend.

392
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,149
<i>The power of horniness is amazing.</i>

393
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,194
<i>We werejust in a robbery, but</i>
<i>it was like nothing had happened.</i>

394
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,109
Ladies, you want to dance with us?

395
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,196
<i>I was so horny I forgot I couldn't dance.</i>

396
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,789
What are you doing?

397
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,710
<i>I was looking like a fool.</i>
<i>I'lljust get into my own thing.</i>

398
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,638
Hey, watch this.

399
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,957
Or do you like this?

400
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,798
Mike, get it! "Dance Fever", huh?

401
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,432
I'm getting tired. I'm gonna stop.

402
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,595
This party is fly, man!

403
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,119
One from each corner of the room.
Ro ain't messing with me.

404
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,039
Ro, how many?

405
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,159
Six? Damn, I've only got four.

406
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,874
I'd have more if we hadn't come late.
How many you got, Mike?

407
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,755
- None.
- What?

408
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,158
You got to get up off that bench
if you want some numbers.

409
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:27,354
- He's waiting for Alicia.
- Forget it. Everybody wants her.

410
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,199
Including me.

411
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,669
- I'll tell her you want to talk to her.
- No, don't.

412
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,830
- No, for real. Come on.
- I'm just trying to help you.

413
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,354
- Why not hook me up?
- Why don't both of you talk to her?

414
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:56,113
See all these honeys?
That one is about to be number seven.

415
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,039
- Where?
- Right there.

416
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,669
You're all gonna owe me some money
after tonight. I'll get it from you later.

417
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,796
I won't pay for that big-headed girl.
I got to get some more numbers.

418
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,796
We're gonna slow it down now.
Grab a fine lady and get close.

419
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,639
<i>That's the song!</i>

420
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,355
<i>I've got to find her. If I could</i>
<i>getjust this one dance...</i>

421
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,077
<i>I expected her to be dancing</i>
<i>with someone else.</i>

422
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,511
<i>Then I'd have an excuse</i>
<i>for not asking.</i>

423
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,308
<i>Maybe I should think about this.</i>
<i>I did grab her butt that day.</i>

424
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,672
<i>But that was two months ago,</i>
<i>and she's been cool ever since.</i>

425
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,750
- Hey, Alicia.
- What's up, Mike?

426
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,796
I just wanted to say hi.
You haven't been alone all night.

427
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,832
I never really did get
to apologise for the bet.

428
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,149
Oh, that's what you get for hanging
around Roland and his nasty behind.

429
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,397
<i>I was nervous as a hooker in church.</i>

430
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,958
- I really like this song.
- It's a beautiful song.

431
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,676
Do you want to dance?

432
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,072
Yeah, sure.

433
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,871
<i>My heart was beating 100 times</i>
<i>a minute. She smelled so good.</i>

434
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,356
<i>All I could think of was,</i>
<i>"Don't get hard"!</i>

435
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,831
Look.

436
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,830
I love this part.

437
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,990
- Why don't you go dance with her?
- You, too!

438
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,553
Can't I call you?

439
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,432
<i>Shit, I can't hold it any longer.</i>
<i>Captain, she's going to blow.</i>

440
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,031
- <i>I was in full salute.</i>
- You okay, Mike?

441
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,199
Yeah, this is how we do it
in North Carolina.

442
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,869
This is how we do it in L.A.

443
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,112
The party's over. Time to go home.

444
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,156
Walk me outside?

445
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,315
Yeah, sure.

446
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,800
- I had so much fun.
- Me, too.

447
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,192
- I guess I'll talk to you at school.
- Why not this weekend?

448
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,958
- You're asking me for my number?
- Yeah, I guess so.

449
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,994
- You guess so?
- Okay, I am.

450
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,397
Here.

451
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,070
How the hell did you do that?

452
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,949
- I told you not to worry about me.
- Whatever. I got seven numbers.

453
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:55,553
The last one wasn't cute,
but she had a body. I won.

454
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,438
- I got seven, too. It's a tie.
- How many did you get?

455
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,149
Just one.

456
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,429
- Alicia? Damn!
- I knew you danced with her, but damn!

457
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,431
That number is worth ten of
those skeezers. You won, Big Mike.

458
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,114
You're taking all my money.

459
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,996
I still don't know
how you swung that.

460
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,228
- That's why I'm Big Mike.
- Don't act stupid.

461
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,991
- I'm forgetting about the wedding.
- What do you want us to tell them?

462
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,034
- I don't know.
- Should I tell them it's off?

463
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,394
- No!
- What then? They're all waiting.

464
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,479
- I need some time to think.
- You had time before you proposed.

465
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,915
- I did think.
- Grow up and act responsible.

466
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,830
- I don't want to wonder "what if".
- You won't, because we know it.

467
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,915
You need to face that, man.

468
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:22,196
- Pull the car over.
- No! I'm getting your ass there.

469
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,279
- We'll stick by you no matter what.
- Tell him to stop the car.

470
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,029
Stop running...
Are you all right?

471
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,152
- Mike, don't even start.
- He don't look too good.

472
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,159
Get the window.

473
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,630
This is my new shit!

474
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,231
Look at this shit!

475
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,479
These are Ferragamos!
They cost $300!

476
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,949
- How much did you pay for them?
- They're worth 300! Stupid ass!

477
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,508
- Chill, man. It's over.
- Get back in. You're marrying Lisa.

478
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,191
- Are you gonna force him?
- I never said I don't want to marry her.

479
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,589
See? He's crazy.
You're crazy, a drunk and a punk!

480
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,070
- Why do I have to be a punk?
- Ro, step the fuck back.

481
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,070
I will beat your little ass up.
You fucking midget.

482
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,471
Have you lost your mind?

483
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,514
I will body-slam your ass.
Are you calm?

484
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,111
Are you calm?
Ro... stop playing.

485
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,390
Both of you are acting like punks.

486
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:55,958
The wedding is or isn't going to happen
today. Only you know the answer.

487
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,596
Don't let cold feet fuck this up, Ro.

488
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,948
- Are you gonna do this or not?
- I guess so.

489
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,197
We ain't asking you to get doughnuts!

490
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,029
That's good enough for now.
If he says "no" in the church...

491
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,118
- We got to get cleaned up.
- Where?

492
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,269
Hell, no.
No, no, no.

493
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,589
Just go. Get this shit away from...
What the fuck is that smell?

494
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,839
Ro got carsick. We need to clean up.

495
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,828
Gas stations have fresh paper towels.

496
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,634
This ain't no damn commercial.

497
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,988
Ro gets married in two hours.
We really need your help.

498
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,834
Please.

499
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,916
I'm doing this for her.
Not for you and especially not for him.

500
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:05,595
- She must be going through hell.
- If he gets cleaned up, she won't know.

501
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,828
- Can you clean the tuxedos?
- Do I look like a maid?

502
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,512
Take them to the cleaners!
I've got some of my man's clothes.

503
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,277
- I'm first in the shower.
- Shower?

504
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,711
There's a hose in the backyard.

505
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,434
- We ain't washing no dogs.
- Says who?

506
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,795
- What choice have we got?
- Through the back way!

507
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,195
- You stink. Go through the back.
- Like Benson?

508
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,788
- That's bad.
- So are you.

509
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,674
Thank you.

510
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,640
- Damn, this shit is cold.
- Maybe it'll snap Ro back to normal.

511
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,716
Stop playing!

512
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,958
Damn you all. Stop playing.

513
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,994
I see not a lot has changed
since high school.

514
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,512
This is shrinkage, right?
Back me up, you all.

515
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:37,313
- The joke's over. Pass the clothes.
- What clothes? Oh, my God.

516
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,199
We look like three nerds.

517
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,794
Why is this so painful?
I'm talking about marriage.

518
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,471
It's like you're going to the electric
chair. It's supposed to be special.

519
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,036
- It ain't that simple.
- Do you love her?

520
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,270
- Yeah.
- Then it's simple.

521
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,712
Getting drunk and dirty, fighting,
just so you can act like a schoolboy.

522
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,630
- Thank you, Oprah!
- Can't take the heat?

523
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,435
I can take the heat fine.
<i>That</i> fool's getting married.

524
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,355
But you do look good in them jeans.

525
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,752
Thanks for putting up with me, Tanya.

526
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,670
- That's for the bride.
- I deserve that.

527
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,079
- Ladies.
- Hi there.

528
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,631
- We need this done in an hour.
- What would you like cleaned?

529
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,871
Find a church. It'll take a miracle
to have this cleaned in an hour.

530
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,478
Please, we're going to a wedding.

531
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,592
We need you to work a miracle.

532
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,869
I'll see what I can do.
But I won't promise you anything.

533
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,073
- Here. One hour.
- Thank you.

534
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,908
- Think we'll get there on time?
- We've got two hours.

535
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,396
You want this last piece?
You're not getting it. I'll take it.

536
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,071
- Why did you ask me, then?
- I didn't ask you.

537
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,239
I asked Mike for the same reason
you proposed to Lisa. It sounds nice.

538
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,396
- That's cold.
- I thought you'd understand my doubts.

539
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:01,151
After the way you treated me
when I proposed.

540
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:08,675
When I said I'd propose, you said:
"Why are you busting up the group?"

541
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,591
You just shouldn't follow her. She
should move where you are. Be a man!

542
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:20,830
That's bull. She has a good job,
so I'm gonna follow her.

543
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,918
Nigger, you need some panties.

544
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,430
Mike, tell this ignorant Negro, please.

545
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:35,310
I'll put it this way. I see what
you're saying, but Slim got a point.

546
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,080
What about Alicia?

547
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,638
What about her? That was high school.
She went to Columbia, I got into S.C.

548
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:51,155
- You also got into New York University.
- Damn, he's right.

549
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,957
So now what?
Stay, let's talk about this.

550
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,630
Let's talk about Alicia. Lying bitch.

551
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:08,678
We've been in the Wood for years.
You're talking about leaving?

552
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:13,635
- I'm getting married.
- What time? So I can be there.

553
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,675
Nobody said a thing
when you went to Italy.

554
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,710
- That was to play ball. I love ball.
- I love Lisa.

555
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,798
Then why aren't we at the wedding?

556
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,472
"Because I'm a punk."
That's the answer, Ro.

557
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:39,759
I can solve all your problems. We're
gonna do this the old-school style.

558
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:45,080
- I've got Jennifer Lopez.
- No, I've got J.L. Here.

559
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,400
- You've got Janet Jackson.
- I always had Janet Jackson.

560
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:55,310
- You've got Lisa Davis.
- Your player card's revoked.

561
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,314
- Let's do this.
- One nice one.

562
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,760
- That's me. I'm the closest.
- You always do that!

563
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,595
- Remember the bet?
- Do you, Mike?

564
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,950
I do. Do you?

565
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,799
<i>St. Bernard's High School.</i>
<i>Lots of memories here.</i>

566
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,314
<i>High school was a different world,</i>
<i>but with the same objective: Girls.</i>

567
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,230
<i>High school was nice. Still beautiful</i>
<i>girls, but instead ofjust booty</i>- 

568
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,275
- <i>they had legs, hips, breasts...</i>
<i>And I'm a breast man.</i>

569
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,191
How you doing?

570
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,159
- What's up?
- Checking out some fine-assed girls.

571
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,111
<i>First day of school is always the best.</i>

572
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,436
Go grab a piece of booty.

573
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:12,670
<i>It's full of possibilities. For us, that</i>
<i>meant sex, the wild thing, the nasty.</i>

574
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:17,476
- See you later.
- Leave the waddy-haired girls alone.

575
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,391
- You're jealous.
- Stop calling girls that, man.

576
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,273
Look at that.

577
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,033
- Yeah, so?
- You gonna let Eric mack your girl?

578
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,234
- Funny.
- What's up?

579
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,432
<i>After that dance,</i>
<i>me and Alicia talked.</i>

580
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:50,351
<i>We were a couple for the standard</i>
<i>three weeks. But we stayed friends.</i>

581
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,917
- We're juniors now. Buckle down.
- Yeah. Ain't it a trip, though?

582
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:01,309
- Meet me at the library at five.
- Why? It's the first day of school.

583
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:09,313
- Ms Quiano is giving us a test.
- For real? I'll meet you there.

584
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,469
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, me too.

585
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:21,676
That girl is still fine.
You should've stayed with that.

586
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,749
Come on. I'm onto bigger
and better things now.

587
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,192
- Like what?
- Like your mama, nigger!

588
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:46,193
- It's on me.
- You're crazy. It's on me, man.

589
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:51,315
- Mike, spin it again.
- No, this isn't for real.

590
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,514
Yeah, I'm tired of not getting
any coochie. We're juniors, man.

591
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:03,398
I need something real. Females get
way too much power with this shit.

592
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,594
It's like they ain't giving it up.
I've been after Monica for two months.

593
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,679
- Damn.
- It's time to move on, man.

594
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:20,032
I'm not warming her up to let the
next nigger hit the jackpot. I'm close.

595
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,520
This has to be our year.
We're the head niggers now. Juniors.

596
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,555
You're on varsity
and I'm looking better every day.

597
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,719
Nigger, as pretty as you are,
you still ain't getting no pussy.

598
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,674
- I bet I'll be the first to get some.
- I'm gonna get Monica soon.

599
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:51,319
- Put your money where your dick is.
- Yes, in your nostrils!

600
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:57,473
You're always clowning.
It's because you know I'll win the bet.

601
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,515
The first one to get some pussy
gets five bucks.

602
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,996
But to keep it from going on forever, -

603
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,799
- if in a month no one gets none,
we put in five bucks more.

604
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,870
- I'm with it.
- Okay, I'm in.

605
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,150
Let the games begin, baby.

606
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,790
When are we gonna make this real?

607
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,516
- Stop, Slim!
- Why don't you want to do it?

608
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,911
I was just thinking
we could make this a physical thing.

609
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,874
Hello?

610
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,153
- I'm not ready.
- How long have we been going out?

611
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,749
A week and a half.

612
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,716
- What are you doing?
- Let's do something else.

613
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,312
We could make love.

614
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:12,878
- Don't say that. You don't love me.
- It sounds better than "bone".

615
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,437
You want me to let you
put that inside me? That's so nasty.

616
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,838
I could get blue balls. My shit
could just swell up and explode.

617
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:37,275
You remember that fool Andrew?
That nigger still ain't walking.

618
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,679
- Nasty? It's natural. Suck on it.
- You need to back up. That's nasty.

619
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,350
- Why wait for what you can get now?
- Because it's in the Bible.

620
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,758
You're already on the wrong path.
Finish it.

621
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,509
Do you think I'm a ho?

622
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:00,033
You let Terry bone.
I look better than that.

623
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,791
Come on, girl.
I'll buy you something. What you want?

624
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,997
<i>I had a girlfriend.</i>
<i>But Alicia was my friend, you know?</i>

625
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,318
<i>We could talk about anything.</i>
<i>Boyfriends, girlfriends... It was cool.</i>

626
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:25,629
- Why say that?
- Why not? Explain her reasoning.

627
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,913
We're doing everything but <i>it.</i>
What's up?

628
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,914
Doing it ain't easy.

629
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:40,393
You don't just walk up to a girl and say:
"What's up? Can we get busy?"

630
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,879
- Everything's got to be right, right?
- Right, it's got to be special.

631
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:50,471
- I heard that before.
- Well, hear it again.

632
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:59,197
- Don't trick her into doing it.
- I don't need tricks. My game is strong.

633
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,999
- Then how come you ain't getting any?
- Oh, you got jokes.

634
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,637
Girls act like they don't want it
as bad as we do.

635
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,435
- That is not true.
- Yes, it is.

636
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,518
You ain't got nothing to say.

637
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,751
Maybe you need to find somebody
who wants it as bad as you do.

638
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,830
Maybe I do.

639
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,235
Let's go.
We won't get no studying done.

640
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:49,910
- All right.
- And you need to work on your game.

641
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,910
What are you wearing to homecoming?

642
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:03,956
- I got a suit from last year's...
- Are you too cheap to buy a new suit?

643
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,995
Times are rough.
I ain't trying to spend no more money.

644
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:17,431
- So, are you going with... Eric?
- You know his name. Come on.

645
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,799
Yeah, I'm going with Eric.
You're going with Kim, right?

646
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,037
- Monica.
- Oh, yeah.

647
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,835
- Is Eric someone special?
- You tell me. You play ball with him.

648
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:40,313
- He's cool. If that's what you want.
- He's all right.

649
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:45,719
- Is Bonita somebody special?
- Monica.

650
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,797
Monica.

651
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:54,238
She's special enough.
I knew she'd say yes if I asked her.

652
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,194
Did you ask her
only because you knew she'd say yes?

653
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,759
- Are you afraid of rejection?
- Yep.

654
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,472
- All the brothers ask you...
- Not all the brothers.

655
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:22,429
- What are you wearing to the dance?
- A little fly red dress.

656
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,475
- Do you wanna see it?
- Yeah, of course.

657
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,474
My room.

658
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,117
<i>Her bedroom.</i>
<i>I always wanted to get up here.</i>

659
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,397
- Ready?
- Yeah.

660
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,231
Here it is.

661
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,796
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

662
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,274
Thank you.

663
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:06,993
- Where's your mom and Stacey?
- My mom's working late.

664
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:12,991
- Stacey's out running the streets again.
- <i>Down, boy.</i>

665
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:20,149
<i>We're slow jamming tonight.</i>
<i>If you've got any dedications, call us.</i>

666
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,717
<i>This next one goes out to Lisa</i>
<i>from Terence. Glenita, I love you.</i>

667
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,515
- How sweet.
- <i>Here's Luther Vandross.</i>

668
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,029
Not Luther.

669
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,310
I love this.
Do you remember this song?

670
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,988
Yeah.

671
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:49,390
- La Tijera, 1986.
- La Tijera, 1986. See?

672
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,590
- I remember when I first met you.
- You met me with your fist.

673
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:01,272
- Right. You and that stupid bet.
- That bet wasn't stupid.

674
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,790
It was. That's why you got the fist.

675
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:12,317
You three probably bet on
who'd get the booty first, didn't you?

676
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,557
- Booty first?
- Yeah.

677
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,833
Come on, that's stupid.

678
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:32,117
Whatever.
You and your little nasty friends.

679
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:42,031
- Do you remember that dance?
- Yeah, I remember.

680
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:48,432
I remember you standing there.
Just singing.

681
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,913
I just had to ask you,
even though I was scared to death.

682
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,234
I'm glad you asked me, Mike.

683
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,678
You dance pretty good
for a guy with two left feet.

684
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,269
Oh, really?

685
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,677
I think I've improved. For real.

686
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,678
- You want to find out?
- Do you want to dance?

687
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:26,396
- Right now?
- While the mood is right.

688
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,671
Wait, wait.

689
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,032
This is how we do it in North Carolina.

690
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,760
You know, I still love this part.

691
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:02,518
<i>My God, is this really about to happen?</i>

692
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,234
<i>Shit, it is.</i>

693
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:12,513
- You've got protection, right?
- Yeah, it's here.

694
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,838
<i>One of Slim's condoms that's</i>
<i>six months old, but work with me.</i>

695
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,119
I'll be right back.

696
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,230
You okay, Mike?

697
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,835
Yeah, it's cool.

698
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,993
Is it supposed to look like that?

699
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,920
Yeah... I guess.

700
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:49,431
Go slow.
If you hurt me, the fist.

701
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:00,072
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

702
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:04,319
- Not there.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

703
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:19,396
- Maybe you should back up a little bit.
- Come on, girl.

704
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,599
Oh, shit.

705
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,150
- It broke.
- Get another one.

706
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:50,832
We don't need one, do we?
Damn, that was my last one.

707
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,269
Go to Stacey's room.
He keeps them in his top drawer.

708
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,514
- I ain't going to his room.
- Do you want to do this or what?

709
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,994
Damn!

710
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,719
I can't believe
I've got to do this shit.

711
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,438
Oh, baby.

712
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,353
Oh my God, Mike!

713
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:07,028
Come on. She said the top drawer.

714
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,711
Baby, hurry up.

715
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:49,150
<i>The things men do for sex.</i>
<i>I was stuck with no way out.</i>

716
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,352
<i>Stacey was getting lucky while I was</i>
<i>stuck with dirty drawers in my face!</i>

717
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,271
What happened to your rubbers?
You had four rubbers.

718
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:04,157
- I counted. Now one's gone.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

719
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,239
- What ho are you fucking?
- No ho but you.

720
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:13,992
Don't call me no ho.
Shut up and take me home.

721
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,955
- I was just playing.
- Take me home now!

722
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,395
- What happened?
- Nothing.

723
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,672
I got it. It all worked out.

724
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,913
I guess that means
this was meant to be.

725
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,196
Yeah, I guess so.

726
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:20,033
<i>I'm actually having sex, and with Alicia!</i>
<i>This cannot be real.</i>

727
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,152
<i>Oh, yeah, this is real.</i>
<i>Real good.</i>

728
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,911
Oh, shit.

729
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,834
So that's it?

730
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,029
Yeah... that's it.

731
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,912
- So what's gonna happen now?
- I don't know. What?

732
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,515
What about me and you?

733
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,235
Me and you sounds good.

734
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,228
What about homecoming?

735
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,631
You're just going to have to buy
a new suit.

736
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,470
<i>So I won the bet.</i>
<i>But I didn't feel right, betting.</i>

737
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:58,312
<i>This was Alicia, you know?</i>
<i>She was worth more than money.</i>

738
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,991
<i>So I didn't tell Slim and Roland</i>
<i>until after one of them won.</i>

739
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:08,310
I never in a million years thought -

740
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,954
- that I would meet Miss Right.

741
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:20,675
When I asked Lisa, I kept thinking
of all the things I'd be gaining.

742
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:28,072
But I never took the time to think
of all the things I'd be losing.

743
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,157
We ain't going nowhere.

744
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:35,273
Don't give up the best thing you'll
ever get because you're scared.

745
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,558
You're right, man.

746
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,350
You're right.

747
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,313
- So what are you saying?
- I'm ready to marry Lisa.

748
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,909
Yes, yes, yes!

749
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,912
Let me ask you something.

750
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,669
Are you absolutely sure on this?

751
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,795
Yeah, I just said.

752
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,037
Yes.

753
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:18,390
That's good enough for me.

754
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,632
- When you see Lisa...
- Where the hell have you all been?

755
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:32,109
- Slim had...
- Car trouble? As if we'd buy that!

756
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:39,590
- You're a writer. Would you believe it?
- We spent a fortune on this wedding.

757
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:44,351
Why are you getting on me?
I'm not the one getting married.

758
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,951
- Good point.
- If I had to look at him, I'd kill him.

759
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,754
Come on. And you better stay.

760
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,112
If he doesn't want to, I'm not
gonna force him. Call it off, then.

761
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:22,309
You all must think I'm stupid.
Car broke down?

762
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,954
He could at least face me like a man!

763
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,789
I'm not gonna cry. I spent
too much time on this damn make-up!

764
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,309
- Just stay calm.
- I am calm.

765
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:37,038
- Then why are you yelling?
- I'm not!

766
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:42,360
I'll get Ro so you can talk to him.

767
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:51,515
- No, it's bad luck to see him.
- I thought you wanted to call it off.

768
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:58,516
Mike, would I be standing here in this
dress if I didn't want to marry him?

769
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:04,511
- But I won't if he has doubts.
- Lisa, it's Daddy.

770
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:11,751
- Roland wants to say something.
- Lisa, baby, I'm sorry.

771
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:18,119
Lisa, I love you.
I want to marry you.

772
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:22,074
- Go away!
- Come on, girl. Please.

773
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:31,159
- You need to get out of here.
- I need to see her.

774
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:36,434
- She won't see you. It's bad luck.
- So she still wants to get married?

775
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,997
- I don't know. Let me handle it.
- All right.

776
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,998
Just give her this.
Give her this.

777
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,354
- Mike, let me get in there.
- What do you want, man?

778
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,235
- Hey, man...
- I'll be cool, Mike.

779
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,079
- Now's not the time.
- I'll be cool.

780
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,871
- I'll be cool.
- Hook me up.

781
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:13,831
- What's up? People are waiting.
- Shut up, Slim.

782
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:19,395
- Why?
- You probably told him not to do it.

783
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,070
You're perfect for each other
because you're both nuts.

784
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:31,159
- Nigger, shut up!
- Listen to him. He wants to marry you.

785
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,638
- Then why did he do this?
- He's scared.

786
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,559
I've known him 13 years -

787
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:44,153
- and I've never heard him talk about
anybody the way he talks about you.

788
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,592
He wanted me to give that to you.

789
01:27:54,720 --> 01:28:00,750
- Remember that?
- I didn't know he still had this.

790
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:07,353
It was hot that day at the concert.
Roland and Slim drooled over you.

791
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,358
There wasn't no... I was drooling.

792
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,678
Slim went over to you
and what did he say?

793
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,350
- He introduced me to Roland.
- Think about that.

794
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:25,079
- That could be Slim out there, crying.
- You all got jokes.

795
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,713
- I'm glad he's got you guys for friends.
- Give me some sugar, too.

796
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:44,678
- Please take him out of his misery.
- Tell him to stop whining.

797
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,555
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

798
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,636
Oh, it's on.

799
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:21,996
Did you clean it up?

800
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,394
Hurry up before the reverend
changes his mind.

801
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:33,031
What a joyous occasion
when two come together as one.

802
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,317
Who amongst us
will give this woman to this man?

803
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,351
I do.

804
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:52,990
You mess up,
I'm going to have to cut you.

805
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,115
May we have the rings?

806
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:10,393
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

807
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,872
<i>I never thought Roland would get</i>
<i>married. I'm glad to see things change.</i>

808
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,433
- What are you doing?
- You scared me.

809
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:39,397
I'm trying to hide from Tanya.
She talks too damn much.

810
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:44,395
We better get in before
Alicia beats his ass again.

811
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:54,189
- You better run back up in there.
- Tanya's got you cornered, too.

812
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,552
- "Ro, can I have something to drink?"
- "Okay, Tanya."

813
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:03,276
Very funny. You should be
taking notes from Roland.

814
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:09,589
- Tonight I'm gonna win the bet.
- Let me explain something to you.

815
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:14,112
Tanya ain't giving up shit
and you're still on lock-down.

816
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:20,236
- Then why are you here with me?
- We came looking for you.

817
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,193
- I'm with him.
- Oh, you're with him?

818
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:30,233
You got me, man!

819
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:35,230
It's not natural to be with one girl.
That just ain't me.

820
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:39,956
Right. That's what
I've been trying to tell Mr Faithful.

821
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:43,994
What if she's the shit,
like Janet Jackson fine?

822
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:49,752
No matter. No woman's
going to put a leash around my neck.

823
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:55,273
I can't even button my shirt to the top
without getting nervous.

824
01:32:55,480 --> 01:33:00,508
- We should play this game for life.
- What game?

825
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:06,636
- Macking... Hanging.
- I like that.

826
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,994
Macking... Hanging.
Macking... Hanging.

827
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:22,359
- Ain't that Nichole?
- I'd recognise them legs anywhere.

828
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,597
Ro, run me a little interference
real quick.

829
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:33,994
<i>What did we know? All that mattered</i>
<i>were your boys, the team.</i>

830
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:38,079
- <i>We didn't think other things mattered.</i>
- I thought I'd have to dance with Eric.

831
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,998
- That was funny.
- Where are your boys at?

832
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,548
- I don't know. Let's go inside.
- Let me fix you up here.

833
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:54,515
<i>You hold on to that feeling</i>
<i>until you meet that one.</i>

834
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,712
<i>It happened to Ro</i>
<i>and it'll happen to Slim.</i>

835
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:03,828
<i>Me? I was a goner that first day</i>
<i>she walked into my classroom.</i>

836
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,989
- May I have this dance, Madame?
- Yes, you may.

837
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:20,753
- How is life in the Big Apple?
- Cold.

838
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:26,637
- I still haven't got used to it.
- Finally made it back to Inglewood?

839
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,276
The wedding gave me a good reason
to come back and see an old friend.

840
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:38,229
- I haven't seen Roland in years.
- You came all the way to see him?

841
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,830
- And Slim, too.
- And Slim?

842
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,515
But you're dancing with me.

843
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,275
So, how cold is it back east?

844
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,795
Let's start this off.

845
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:07,029
You got the good sound.
This is the best man's toast. Get up.

846
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,550
Before we get started,
I have some bad news.

847
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:16,471
Reverend Parker was arrested
for impersonating a minister.

848
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,719
So we have to do this again next week.

849
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:27,597
I love you guys
and I'm going to turn this over to Mike.

850
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:38,596
I guess since we are the best men
we ought to say something.

851
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:45,348
We all did a lot of things
to get prepared for today.

852
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:48,154
I did a lot of thinking.

853
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,431
And I came to a funny conclusion.

854
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,710
I realised how selfish I was.

855
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:02,594
Because I felt like
I was losing a very dear friend.

856
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,430
That may not sound
like the right thing to say.

857
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:12,191
But I moved around a lot as a boy
and never knew what it was like -

858
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:20,193
- to have real true friends,
until I met Roland and Levinio.

859
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,039
You need to stop.

860
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:29,634
So today I'm a bit upset,
but I'm also very happy -

861
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,992
- and extremely proud of you, man.

862
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,829
I'd like to ask God
to bless Roland and Lisa -

863
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:43,114
- as they enter a beautiful
new life together.

864
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:47,438
If he gets out of control,
Slim got a headlock for him.

865
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,200
And we ain't laughing.

866
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,155
To our parents, you know we love
you all and thanks for all the love.

867
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:01,835
And to the two grown men
who mean the most to me, -

868
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:07,393
- I'll never forget the times we had -

869
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,196
- and I look forward to the future,
and I love you all.

870
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,073
You're my brothers.

871
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,909
So, let's do this one for the Wood.

872
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,918
- To where it all started.
- The Wood!
