<i>Hey, good morning, New York
Scott Zoe here...</i>

2
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:56,864
<i>...at 1027, WNEW-FM,
where rock lives</i>

3
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,737
<i>Beautiful autumn day in the city...</i>

4
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:01,738
<i>...and a great record
coming your way too</i>

5
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,540
Ben!

6
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:39,977
Get up, get up, get up!
Late, late, late!

7
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:43,177
Ben! Come on, honey.
Get up! We're seriously late

8
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,583
You may think this is
funny, but this is so not...

9
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:49,740
...funny

10
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,123
I'm not kidding anymore, Ben

11
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:55,142
You make yourself
appear... right this instant

12
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:03,538
The clock is ticking, Ben!
Come on now!

13
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,184
Anna?

14
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:10,524
Oh good, you're already up

15
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:12,862
You forgot to wash my shirt.
I told you hundred times

16
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:15,500
Today is purple shirt day at school

17
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,544
I didn't forget

18
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:21,104
Actually, I was up half
the night thinking about it

19
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:22,244
Yeah, right

20
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,694
And I concluded that you are...

21
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:27,144
too special to look
like everyone else

22
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:31,076
So, orangey-red. That's your
colour. Few can carry it off

23
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,044
Now...

24
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:33,283
Would you help me find your brother?

25
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:34,422
You lost Ben?

26
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,984
No

27
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,141
I didn't lose Ben

28
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,337
All right, Ben, fine

29
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:51,784
You explain to your
teacher why you're late

30
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:54,124
Your daddy said he had an
important case this morning...

31
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,864
and had to go to work early

32
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:59,382
And he left us here to
be responsible and we...

33
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:01,601
Shit!

34
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:03,824
You're so not funny... Not funny!

35
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:07,776
And you're also late, and that
means get dressed right now!

36
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:10,977
Stay. No, stay. Ben! Ben!

37
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,777
This is not funny!

38
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,375
We've got to get you dressed.
We're running so late

39
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:17,382
This is not a game!

40
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,637
Come on. Help me out. Ben!

41
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:23,104
Come on! Really, we're so late

42
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,696
But I don't want to go to school

43
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:27,184
No!

44
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,375
Mommy!

45
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,138
Hi, sweetie!

46
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:35,024
Ben, you look like you're
having such a good time

47
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:37,144
But we're running a little late

48
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:38,983
Sweete, I thought you're
supposed to wear purple today

49
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:40,821
She forgot to wash it

50
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:45,343
What a hug!

51
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:50,796
I'll handle it from here, Isabel

52
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,242
I'm sure you will, Jackie

53
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:04,480
Oh, my gosh! She made you a lunch?

54
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:11,664
Okay, come on

55
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:27,664
<i>Mom, why do we have to listen
to this classical stuff?</i>

56
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,744
<i>Because I like it, and I'm driving</i>

57
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:32,839
<i>And when you get get your own
car, you can pick the music</i>

58
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,243
Why does Isabel wear
Daddy's underpants?

59
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,524
Doesn't she have
underpants of her own?

60
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,060
Oh, well... I saw a
whopping pile of laundry

61
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:41,304
sitting on the washing machine

62
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:43,240
Perhaps Isabel's
underpants are there

63
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,344
Yeah, right next
to my purple shirt

64
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:46,978
I'm never speaking to her again

65
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,104
Never say never.
Here's your vitamins

66
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,944
She's always messing up my life

67
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:53,142
It's not fair to say "always"!

68
00:04:53,225 --> 00:04:54,724
I hate her. She's such a witch

69
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:57,424
Hey! No name-calling.
Use your words

70
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:58,784
I hate when you say that

71
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:01,864
Now, that's a beginning. "Hate"
is a totally acceptable word...

72
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:06,053
and just be careful to use it only
when you truly detest something

73
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:07,295
Like what?

74
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,984
Well, like...

75
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:12,584
...the planet Uranus. I hate that.
It's a terrible name for a planet

76
00:05:12,585 --> 00:05:14,343
- Uranus!
- Yeah

77
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:17,064
- And the hokey-pokey
- Hokey-pokey?

78
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:18,602
The hokey-pokey.
I hate the hokey-pokey

79
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,940
Putting your foot in and out
at weddings. It's terrible

80
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:23,941
Oh, Ben!

81
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:27,063
I hate when you do that!
I can smell your breakfast

82
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,062
Point well-taken!

83
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,420
Ladies, let's just calm
down. She'll be here

84
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,684
Isabel, where are
you? Come on. Any word?

85
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:39,940
Yes. She's on her way

86
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,724
- She's on her way. I promise
- Oh, really?

87
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:42,784
- Si
- How do you know?

88
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:45,584
- I have... a sixth sens. Voilà!
I'm here! I'm sorry. I'm late

89
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:49,834
What a crisis! White pants, black
top? And the white or black bra?

90
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:51,624
And then I just... picked this

91
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,964
- All righty
- I'm here. I'm lame...

92
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:56,742
- You got a Froot Loop in your hair
- Gracias

93
00:06:04,785 --> 00:06:06,944
Get me a digital camera right now

94
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:09,104
Russell, get this
out of here, please

95
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,054
Quikly. Come on, boys!

96
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,498
Why is she shooting this?

97
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,101
Isabel, we have been
waiting for an hour...

98
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:24,263
I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again

99
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:26,257
Why are you shooting this?

100
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,457
Because I'm brilliant...

101
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:30,417
and I see something you don't

102
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,104
So stand back and
trust me, why don't you?

103
00:06:32,105 --> 00:06:34,530
Oh, I trust you.
I just don't understand

104
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:36,164
...why are you shooting
the craft service guy...

105
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:39,938
...when I've got 5 male models
in very expensive suits over here?

106
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:44,075
Thank you, ladies. That's lovely.
That's a wrap, everybody!

107
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:46,564
No!... No, no, it's not a wrap!

108
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:50,179
She's kidding. You are
kidding, aren't you, Isabel?

109
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:53,815
I'm not kidding actually. And
if you meet me here in an hour...

110
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,095
...I will prove to
you why you hired me...

111
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:59,239
...even though I
wouldn't sleep with you

112
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:06,815
She's got such a
great sense of humor

113
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,534
Wait

114
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:16,784
Let's see...

115
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,334
...if I can save... both our jobs

116
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:26,536
<i>- Interesting
- Look at that</i>

117
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:28,504
Wow!

118
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,624
<i>It's the little guy in the suit...</i>

119
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:32,464
- What do you think?
- I like it

120
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,724
I like it. Good work

121
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:36,064
I like it too. Very creative

122
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,339
Thank you

123
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,496
Congratulations, Duncan

124
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:44,864
<i>That suit takes pounds off of him...</i>

125
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:47,124
While change is
exhilarating for an adult...

126
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,139
...it can be quite a
challenge for a child

127
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:53,934
I won't get that

128
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,904
It's fine

129
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,300
Change...

130
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,864
You were talking about change

131
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,710
Well, the fact that you
two are remarrying...

132
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:03,464
obviously has Anna overjoyed

133
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:06,304
And she's very excited
about the move to Switzerland

134
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:09,264
She said we are remarrying?

135
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,160
And my concern is that Anna...

136
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:13,064
...seems apathetic towards her work...

137
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:15,164
knowing she's leaving, uh,
before this semester

138
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,572
Mrs Franklin, we are not...

139
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:17,979
No plans on getting...

140
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,743
...remarried. There's no move...

141
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:21,502
- ... to Switzerland
- No

142
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,904
- Really?
- Really

143
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:29,538
Well, then, my concern
for Anna is that she...

144
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:32,184
- Are you here?
- I'm here

145
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:34,584
- You don't seem like you're here
- I'm here

146
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:35,880
The judge is about
to rule on a motion...

147
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:36,932
that could make or break this case

148
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,484
after working up the 8 monts...
but have I answered my beeper?

149
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,477
So turn it off!

150
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,434
I'm wondering if there's
anything going at home...

151
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:49,264
that could possibly be intensifying
Anna's need to create this fantasy

152
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:51,164
I've been seeing another
woman through the past year

153
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,764
Since we're divorced he's
seen a number of women, and...

154
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:55,243
Saw a few women when
we first split up...

155
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,364
But I've been seeing one
woman for the past year

156
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:58,671
After a lot of thought and
carefull discussion with her...

157
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,224
and the kids - I might add
- she moved in last month

158
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,684
He's living with a
woman half his age...

159
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:04,053
Isabel's not half my age

160
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,064
- We're not discussing your age
- Then why bring it up?

161
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:07,582
When they go to your house,
they wanna be with you

162
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,484
They want to be with their father...

163
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,321
When they come to my house,
they want to be a part of my life

164
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,044
Isabel's part of my life

165
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:17,144
Mr Harrison, I hear you talking
about your life, your needs but...

166
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:20,424
...are you really in
touch with what Anna needs?

167
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,819
Anna needs a home where
she feels safe and loved...

168
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,364
What I'm trying to give her

169
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,600
I thought that's
what she already had

170
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,784
I'd walk through fire for Anna...

171
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:30,624
Gladly... Any day of the week

172
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,844
Except Thursday, when
Isabel forgot to pick them up

173
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:35,944
Jackie, she was 5 minutes
late, for chrissakes!

174
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:37,737
She was 5 minutes late!

175
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,784
I'm wondering if Anna could be
responding to the underline hostility

176
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:44,904
that exists between your
girlfriend and Mrs Harrison

177
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:47,810
Well, of course
she's responding to it!

178
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:50,764
Mrs. Franklin, do you think
any of this is easy for us?

179
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,184
Do you think it's
easy for Jackie to...

180
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,145
watch her kids been looked
after by another woman?

181
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:59,637
Not to mention, a woman who really
has no experience being a mother

182
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,704
Of course, Jackie's
going to be irrational...

183
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:03,974
...hostile...

184
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,538
...defensive

185
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,633
Thank you, Luke

186
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,724
<i>I didn't say that.
Why would I say that...</i>

187
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,544
...you and daddy you're
getting back together?

188
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:18,419
Sometimes people make up stories...

189
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,504
...about things they
wish would happen

190
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,784
I don't want that to happen.
Why would I want that to happen?

191
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:25,344
Okay, pick a card. Any card

192
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:26,984
Because you're upset...

193
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,124
You know, because
Isabel moved in and...

194
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,684
I'm not upset. I won't
get myself upset over her

195
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,504
- Ok. Tear it in half
- Look, sweetie...

196
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,599
- if it means...
- Again

197
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:39,695
- if you really...
- Again

198
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:42,220
- if you want...
- And again

199
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:43,940
Time out

200
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:46,084
If you don't want to
talk about this now...

201
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,983
it's ok. Really. you don't have to

202
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:51,824
But don't look me in
the eye and lie to me

203
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:54,402
It hurts my feelings,
I get angry, and...

204
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,063
Anyway, you're only
allowed so many lies...

205
00:10:56,064 --> 00:11:00,282
before it starts showing in yourface
and you wind up looking like...

206
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:01,964
Like who?

207
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:05,137
He's not President
anymore, so why be petty?

208
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:09,461
I'm sorry I said it...

209
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:12,423
I guess sometimes I just...

210
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:16,217
You know, sometimes I do
wish you and Daddy would...

211
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,960
- Well, you know...
- Yeah...

212
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:23,740
I figured if I said it out
loud, it just... might come true

213
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:25,954
Yeah, I know

214
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:46,164
<i>It's not that I can't cook.
It's that I choose not to cook</i>

215
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,344
- There's a big difference
- You don't have to cook

216
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:51,695
Could we save some of the wine?

217
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:56,425
- I need it for the sauce
- Too late

218
00:11:56,985 --> 00:11:58,613
- Hi
- Hi

219
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:10,858
You better get it

220
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,759
Hellow

221
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,660
<i>Hellow?</i>

222
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,424
- Who's there?
- Nobody there!...

223
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:25,944
I missed you today

224
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,524
I missed you too.
I miss you every day

225
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,744
How was your day, baby?

226
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:32,184
It was pretty good, except I
got to go back to Pittsburgh

227
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,745
- No... -Yeah, I got to go
tomorrow till Sunday

228
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:38,064
But I'll have to order in

229
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:41,524
Well, we got the kids for
the weekend, so I figured...

230
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,581
...that you.. and the kids...

231
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:46,544
...and me... could all go...

232
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,701
...to Pittsburgh together

233
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,644
Never going to happen

234
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,364
No? Come on! We could
get a great hotel room...

235
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,804
We could take in a baseball
game or something...

236
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:59,100
- What do you think?
- Pass

237
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:02,904
All right. Then I'll
call the babysitter

238
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:04,144
What for?

239
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:07,298
Well, I don't expect you
to handle them yourself

240
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:12,540
What?

241
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:16,834
Can't handle them myself.
That's what you mean, isn't it?

242
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,020
No

243
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,621
Hellow

244
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:38,224
You don't trust me to
be alone with your kids

245
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:39,364
- Yes, I do
- No

246
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,583
Of course I do.
It's just that...

247
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,696
- What?
- They're a handful

248
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:47,576
Luke, keeping me apart
from them is like saying...

249
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,184
" Hey, kids, this is
fun. Keep on hating her"

250
00:13:50,185 --> 00:13:51,515
I don't say that.
They don't hate you

251
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:53,045
Really?

252
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,444
Look in their eyes, honey.
Look in your ex-wife's eyes

253
00:13:56,445 --> 00:14:00,224
Jackie's just protecting
her kids. What do you expect?

254
00:14:00,225 --> 00:14:01,529
It's hard for her. It's complicated

255
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,234
You don't understand.
You don't have kids

256
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:05,624
Ok

257
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,984
So... it's just complicated
for you and Jackie

258
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:14,376
For me, it's pretty simple
because I don't have kids

259
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,953
Look, I'm just trying to
make things work here and...

260
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:18,924
trying to give you guys time
to get used to living together

261
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,335
All right, then...

262
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:25,039
...back off just a little bit
and give me a chance, okay?

263
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,040
Hellow

264
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:35,441
<i>Hellow</i>

265
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:38,784
What is your problem, asshole?

266
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,737
You are my problem!

267
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,895
You're absolutely right, baby

268
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:53,137
Your kids don't hate me. I'm just...
I'm just paranoid. Call your daughter

269
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:59,018
I trust you

270
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,780
Really?

271
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,421
I'll give you a chance
if you still want it

272
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:06,459
- I do
- Are you sure?

273
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,541
Yes

274
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,140
Okay

275
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,636
- Thank you
- You're welcome

276
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,335
Don't fight with me when I'm hungry

277
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,176
<i>So, how long will
you be out of town?</i>

278
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:24,664
Till Sunday morning

279
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,264
I'm worried

280
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:27,224
About what?

281
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,564
About being alone
with her all weekend

282
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,904
I mean... What if she
burns the place down?

283
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:34,061
Well, just keep an eye on her and...

284
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:37,143
make sure you boys got the
fire extinguisher's handy

285
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:38,939
- You ready to launch her?
- Yeah

286
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,462
Let's give her a good push

287
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,295
So, why did she move
in with you anyways?

288
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,461
Because we love each other and...

289
00:15:50,462 --> 00:15:52,704
because we want to
share our life together

290
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,344
You already had a life with Mommy

291
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:58,578
But Mommy and I weren't
getting along very well

292
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:02,484
And it wasn't fair to you
guys, us fighting all the time

293
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,884
I fight with Anna all the time

294
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:06,864
Can I move out?

295
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,999
No. But you guys are
brother and sister

296
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:13,542
You were husband and wife.
Doesn't that mean something?

297
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:17,240
Yes. It does

298
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,241
But...

299
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,042
Well...

300
00:16:23,345 --> 00:16:24,944
When you get older...

301
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,138
your relationships get
a lot more complicated

302
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,778
And there's all kinds
of feelings flying around

303
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,458
And sometimes...

304
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:38,819
some of those feelings change

305
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:46,139
But did you fall out
of love with Mommy?

306
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,840
Well...

307
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:54,340
Yeah

308
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:57,218
I guess I did

309
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,322
I still love your mom

310
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:03,484
It's just...

311
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:07,161
...became a different
kind of love, that's all

312
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:10,902
We're still really good
friends, and we always will be

313
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:15,063
Can you ever fall out
of love with your kids?

314
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:16,495
No

315
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:20,843
That is impossible

316
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,858
Like Mission: Impossible

317
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:26,721
Yeah. Exactly... like Mission:
Impossible. Get over here

318
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:34,140
<i>Powdered lizard brains...</i>

319
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,304
<i>crushed werewolf ears...</i>

320
00:17:39,305 --> 00:17:41,914
<i>and vampire eyes...</i>

321
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,135
God!

322
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:57,138
Cool!

323
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:11,544
Check it out. Magic potion

324
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:13,144
It's cocoa

325
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:17,984
I put a spell on it. Whoever drinks
it will go to sleep for 1.000 years

326
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:22,555
Whatever who spill any on my drawing
I'll put you to sleep for 1000 years

327
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:26,919
You guys... I have a surprise
for you. Come over to the sofa

328
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,435
Please...

329
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:32,660
With a little... enthusiasm...

330
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,134
Sit down

331
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:36,584
All right

332
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:39,504
And close your eyes... please

333
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,161
Okay

334
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,500
Okay, now

335
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:47,460
Don't open them until
I tell you to, okay?

336
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:49,734
And open

337
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,284
What do you think?

338
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:55,913
- Will he eat my bunny?
- No. Puppies don't eat bunnies

339
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:57,615
Anna, what do you think?

340
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,697
Well, I'm allergic to dogs

341
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:04,184
Your daddy didn't tell me that

342
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,138
He doesn't know much
about me. He's never around

343
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,138
Why don't we name the
puppy? Puppy needs a name

344
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:15,644
I know. Isabel

345
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:17,420
I beg your pardon?

346
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:18,858
Well, he kinda
smells like you and...

347
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:21,938
I'm allergic to you
too. It fits perfectly

348
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:34,023
Ben, why don't you name that
puppy? I'll be right back

349
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,404
Listen, young lady,
let's get one thing straight!

350
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:40,654
Don't touch my things!

351
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:43,584
Look. I would really like
it if we could get along

352
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,944
- I don't have to listen to you
- Yes, you do

353
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,444
No, I don't. You're not my mother

354
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,622
Thank God for that!

355
00:19:57,705 --> 00:20:01,693
What I meant, and perhaps
I didn't say it well...

356
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:05,724
is that you have a great mom.
You don't need another one but...

357
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,644
...I would like to be
treated with some respect...

358
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:10,824
when you are in this house

359
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:14,904
- Look, this is my dad's house
- Well, it's my house too

360
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:18,477
This is my room. Treat it
with respect and get out

361
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,304
All right

362
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:43,324
<i>" Run, run, run as fast as you can</i>

the Stinky Cheese Man"</i>

364
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,699
Aren't you going to drink your
cocoa? I made it especially for you

365
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:52,684
Yes, of course

366
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,276
The special cocoa...

367
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:06,178
Delicious

368
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:10,744
<i>"A little boy looked up and
sniffed the air and said... "</i>

369
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:14,940
No, now you're cheating. You
skipped the part about the cow

370
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:19,824
It's bedtime. Can't we
finish in the morning?

371
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,064
No. We have to start
from the beginning...

372
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:26,583
...and you have to read the whole
thing. I can't sleep otherwise

373
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,940
Okay

374
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,457

377
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:42,704
You're onto something. Why don't
you read to me a little bit?

378

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

What's the matter?

386
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,655
I... killed her

387
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:34,104
Killed her! Killed her!

388
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,181
Killed her!

389
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:07,964
- Good morning
- It is 7:23

390
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,014
You were supposed to be here at 6:30

391
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:12,404
She missed her morning riding lesson

392
00:23:12,405 --> 00:23:15,324
It's Monday. Her riding
lesson's on Tuesday

393
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:18,944
Except for the third Tuesday of
the month, which switches to Monday

394
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:23,384
And in November, when she rides on
Thursdays. It's not that difficult

395
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:25,552
Don't you have some kind
of little black agenda book

396
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:27,764
that you can write all this down in?

397
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,764
May I have a cup of coffee, please?

398
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:32,624
We don't have coffee

399
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,984
Good morning, Betty Ford

400
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:39,316
Hey, monkey man. Hi, sweetie.
How are you doing... Anna!?

401
00:23:43,225 --> 00:23:45,877
Sweetie, go change your shirt

402
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,424
What happened to Anna?
What did you do?

403
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,844
Maybe could you just
back off me a little bit?

404
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:54,222
- What happened?
- Nothing happened

405
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:58,038
Luke was in the shower
this morning and...

406
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,303
...Anna sort of...

407
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,724
walked in without even knocking

408
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:06,264
I don't see why that would upset her

409
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:08,483
I mean, there have been
people in our family

410
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:10,901
that have taken showers before

411
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:14,161
Well, I was in there with him...

412
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:23,924
And did either of you... talk
to her about it afterwards?

413
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,344
No

414
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:28,136
I thought it would be
uncomfortable for her

415
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:31,103
You mean for you

416
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,584
A 12-year-old girl is trying
to cope with the fact...

417
00:24:34,585 --> 00:24:38,824
...that her father is never
moving back in here with his family

418
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,233
She sees her father
naked, in the shower

419
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,644
with another woman
for the first time

420
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:46,623
and you think it
would be better for her

421
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,844
if everyone pretends
nothing happened?

422
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:52,604
I am so unbelievably sick
of your imperious bullshit

423
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:54,610
I never said I'm not
June fucking Cleaver

424
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:56,124
You don't use that kind
of language in this house

425
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:57,143
If every time life hits her hard...

426
00:24:57,144 --> 00:25:00,164
...you want to have a
12-hour conversation...

427
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,021
every third Tuesday of the month...

428
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:04,424
...you go right ahead,
lady. I have a life

429
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh, and I don't?
Because I have children?

430
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:14,124
You know what is your problem?
You are so self-involved...

431
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,563
you couldn't be a mother

432
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:19,004
Maybe the problem
here is your daughter

433
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:21,704
And that she is a spoiled,
wiseass little brat

434
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,724
Get out of my house

435
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:25,424
Get out

436
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:29,257
Are you sure? I didn't
see that on the schedule

437
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,542
Honey, I've got your
Halloween costume

438
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,980
Let's see if it's
the right size, ok?

439
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:44,974
A hippie?

440
00:25:45,825 --> 00:25:48,122
Didn't you say you
wanted to be a hippie?

441
00:25:48,185 --> 00:25:50,004
That was last month

442
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:54,224
Oh, well... okay. What do
you want to be this month?

443
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,853
Elvis

444
00:25:55,865 --> 00:25:57,904
Elvis. What kind of Elvis?

445
00:25:57,905 --> 00:26:00,424
You mean, like, black
leather jacket Elvis?

446
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,644
- Gold lamé Elvis
- Gold lamé Elvis

447
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:06,764
That's pre-drugs, pre-chubby,
pre-army, pre-bad movie...

448
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,304
- All of that Elvis?
- Yeah

449
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:09,601
Honey...

450
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:16,934
when Daddy was... washing Isabel...

451
00:26:17,925 --> 00:26:20,917
...in the shower, what did
you think that was about?

452
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:23,903
Well, sex, of course...

453
00:26:24,404 --> 00:26:25,904
Oh...

454
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,305
Ok...

455
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:32,804
- Why does Isabel scream?
- Scream?

456
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:34,704
During sex

457
00:26:34,705 --> 00:26:36,543
How do you know she
screams during sex?

458
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:39,161
Well, I live in the same country

459
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:42,224
And...

460
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:47,084
- why are you asking me?
- Just checking

461
00:26:47,085 --> 00:26:49,184
I like to talk to you about stuff

462
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:51,721
I like talking to
you about stuff too

463
00:26:52,225 --> 00:26:54,224
So, since Daddy's
gonna be working...

464
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:57,603
...you want to do something
on Saturday, just you and me?

465
00:26:57,745 --> 00:26:59,624
Sure, but it'll have
to be in the evening

466
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:03,376
cause' I'm helping Bonnie Lyons
move into her apartment and...

467
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:07,064
So you're going to be with...

468
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:08,520
...Isabel

469
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,504
Again? That really sucks!

470
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:15,684
Well, you'll be at a professional
photo shoot in Central Park...

471
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,719
You guys are going
to have a lot of fun

472
00:27:19,065 --> 00:27:22,424
<i>Switch your hands.
Top hand down, bottom hand up</i>

473
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:26,042
Dylan, can you take one step up
for me, please? Just one big step

474
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:29,584
Rapunzel, would you reach
your hand out there again?

475
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:33,104
Wouldn't it be cool if her
hair came out of her armpits?

476
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:34,979
Oh, sick!

477
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:38,258
- I think we can get this
finished before lunch - Ok

478
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:41,622
Folks, we like this light. We'll try
and get this in before lunch

479
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,284
Come on! It's been
5 hours. We're hungry

480
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:46,655
Yeah, we're starving

481
00:27:47,305 --> 00:27:51,214
Get yourself another ice cream,
ok? And I'll be done... soon

482
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:52,859
I promise

483
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,584
We're rich!

484
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:06,897
Sleeping Beauty, wake up

485
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:08,934
Where's your brother?

486
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:12,779
I don't know

487
00:28:19,385 --> 00:28:22,144
- What if he's kidnapped?
- He's not kidnapped!

488
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,944
He's hiding! Ben!

489
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:26,124
- Maybe he's in the castle
- Good idea!

490
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,785
Don't touch me! You bring bad luck

491
00:28:58,025 --> 00:29:00,980
Okay, watch very carefully...

492
00:29:20,585 --> 00:29:22,564
- Mommy!
- Hi, sweetie!

493
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:28,844
- Are you all right?
- I knew where I was all the time

494
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:32,084
- We found him in the zoo
- In the zoo? My God!

495
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:35,284
Hold his hand. Don't let
him out of your sight

496
00:29:35,285 --> 00:29:36,204
Jackie, I am so sorry

497
00:29:36,205 --> 00:29:40,077
I'm going to say this one
time, so listen carefully

498
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:44,224
That woman is to have nothing
more to do with my children

499
00:29:44,225 --> 00:29:45,504
Our children

500
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:48,124
Do you realize what could've
happened to tour son?

501
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:52,679
How lucky we are the police found
him, instead of some lunatic?

502
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:55,744
Jackie, don't make it any worse.
Isabel is sorry. She feels terrible

503
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:57,584
- It could've happened to anyone
- Not to me!

504
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:59,296
You've made mistakes.
People make mistakes

505
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,504
Well, I am not gonna sit
here and wait for the next one

506
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:02,864
I'm not gonna watch our children

507
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,784
fall through the cracks
of this arrangement

508
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:05,704
Just calm down

509
00:30:05,705 --> 00:30:07,724
I won't calm down!
I'm going to a lawyer!

510
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,564
Don't do that.
We promised we'd never do that

511
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,904
We've broken a lot of
promises, haven't we, Luke?

512
00:30:11,905 --> 00:30:13,864
Don't take this out on him

513
00:30:13,865 --> 00:30:15,324
It's my fault... Honey

514
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,744
I'm so sorry

515
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:20,764
But you're not making
this easier on anybody

516
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,204
It is not my job to
make it easier for you

517
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:27,984
It is my job to care of those children,
and they don't want to be with you!

518
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,938
I'm getting a court
order, and you are never...

519
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:33,019
...going to be with
these children again alone

520
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,294
Do you understand? Ever!

521
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,964
- Mommy
- What, sweetie?

522
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,604
It's not Isabel's
fault that I ran away

523
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,344
No, you're right.
That was your fault

524
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:00,382
But it's her fault for not
taking care of my precious son

525
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:02,424
as if it was her priority

526
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:05,184
Which means, her most important job

527
00:31:05,185 --> 00:31:07,744
Isabel's job is she works

528
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:09,964
Ben, Mommies work too.
They work very hard

529
00:31:09,965 --> 00:31:11,204
In fact, I work harder as a mommy

530
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,943
than I ever did when
I had an outside job

531
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:14,784
I just don't get paid!

532
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,923
Does Isabel make a lot of money?

533
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:19,401
People like Isabel who
think only about themselves

534
00:31:19,402 --> 00:31:22,057
often do make a great deal of money

535
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:25,004
I think she's pretty

536
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:28,323
Yeah!... If you like big teeth...

537
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:31,660
- Mommy...
- What, sweetie?

538
00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:35,201
If you want me to hate her, I will

539
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,064
What do you want?

540
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,961
Anna left her soccer
stuff at the loft

541
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:06,384
I figured she might
need it this week

542
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:07,574
Thanks

543
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:13,384
Did you talk to the lawyer?

544
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:16,499
Yes. I have an appointment
for the day after tomorrow

545
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,624
Don't do this

546
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,824
You'll tell me not to put the
kids in the middle of a war

547
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:25,264
Luke, I'm doing this
for their own well-being

548
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,820
Partly...

549
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:29,575
And partly you're doing
it because you're mad

550
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:32,384
You know the kids
aren't in any real danger

551
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,444
This is about Isabel...
and you know it

552
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:38,221
She made one mistake, but
she's trying. She's learning

553
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:43,284
Slugs have a faster learning
curve, ok? Trees, clams...

554
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:46,857
Give her some time, will
you? Don't drive her away

555
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:50,364
I'm supposed to care about her?

556
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:52,744
You're supposed to care about
me, like I care about you

557
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:54,004
Like you cared about
me two years ago...

558
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,664
- ... when you walked out...
- You kicked me out!

559
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:58,296
Oh, wait a minute... You were gone
long before I asked you to leave

560
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:01,542
Don't give me this shit! I
was working, for God's sake!

561
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:06,575
I'm sorry. Look, wait
a second. Don't...

562
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,276
Please don't do this
thing with the lawyers...

563
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:14,922
The kids will be okay...
if we're okay

564
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,154
I'd do it for you

565
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:36,138
Okay. I'm going to
give you one last chance

566
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,680
Thanks

567
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,114
Thanks

568
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:46,099
Good night

569
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:11,284
<i>This is the one. This is
the one I really like the best</i>

570
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:12,604
<i>She's got a really longing look</i>

571
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:14,604
- She's great in that
- He couldn't be more flexed

572
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:17,784
Yeah. He's holding his breath. C-14

573
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:21,084
Don't you think this one is? The
way he's leaning back and is more...

574
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:23,984
Bill, kill that music, please

575
00:34:23,985 --> 00:34:27,764
That's passive. This is dynamic.
He's going to get that girl

576
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,904
You're the photographer...
You're the genius

577
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:33,516
Isabel... Isabel, it's Anna's
school. They're looking for Luke

578
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:38,804
Hellow?

579
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:41,082
No, he's not here. This is...

580
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:45,604
Are you sure you
have the right kids?

581
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:51,498
Because Jackie Harrison would
never forget to pick up her kids

582
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:55,042
Are you absolutely sure it's them?

583
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,043
Ok

584
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,124
Of course. I'll be right there

585
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,524
I will pick them up. Thank you

586
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:02,704
What?

587
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:05,524
Isabel, may I remind you that
the clients will be here at 4:30?

588
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:07,821
I know, so I have to hurry.
Everything is gonna be fine

589
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:08,764
Don't worry. I'll be back

590
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:11,904
And I will dazzle you with
my punctuality. To the button

591
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:14,700
Isabel, don't do this!

592
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,080
Hi, guys

593
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:35,858
Barbecue. I know they're your fave

594
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,737
How could she... just
forget us? I mean...

595
00:35:42,825 --> 00:35:45,556
Yeah. That's something you would do

596
00:35:48,225 --> 00:35:50,124
To tell you the truth...

597
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:54,513
I did

598
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:59,424
Your mother had to help
a friend with this...

599
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:03,784
emergency... and so she
called me to switch days but...

600
00:36:03,785 --> 00:36:07,404
I got caught up at work and...
just forgot all about you

601
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:09,531
Mommy!

602
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:11,457
My little chick!

603
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:15,962
<i>How are you, sweetie? I'm sorry
you got stuck. Were you scared?</i>

604
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:18,984
- You must be starving
- Yeah

605
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,300
Yeah? You hungry?

606
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,964
You want a good meal?

607
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:25,504
How'd you do on your
math? Was it hard?

608
00:36:40,305 --> 00:36:41,424
Who is it?

609
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:44,359
<i>It's Jackie. May I come in?</i>

610
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,220
Sure

611
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:57,675
I have another appointment
this afternoon, and I...

612
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:02,424
...I need somebody... to
take the children to the park

613
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:04,404
And have federal agents
jump from the bushes

614
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:07,024
and serve me with a court order?

615
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,374
How many years do
you get in the state

616
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,064
for giving second-rate
care to minors?

617
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:12,064
Whatever it is, it's not enough

618
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,224
Well. Look. I'm on thin ice
already with my boss, alright?

619
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:17,023
- Fine
- When I ran out yesterday...

620
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,624
...I actually thought
he was gonna fire me

621
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,024
I can get somebody else

622
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:23,317
Wait. God!

623
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:28,200
I'll figure something out.
I'll do it

624
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:35,760
After-school snack.
Refrigerate, if possible

625
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:39,104
Band-Aids, Neosporin,
hand-wipes, Kleenex, Tylenol...

626
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:41,721
Why not just bring
the whole pharmacy?

627
00:37:42,185 --> 00:37:44,184
Ben likes to be read
to. You know Dr Seuss?

628
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,374
Not personally

629
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:50,119
Do you have a word limit
you have to hit every day...

630
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,154
...or may I finish?

631
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:55,321
Here's their schedule,
my beeper number...

632
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:56,424
In case of emergency

633
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,764
If not, I'll see you
at 5 o'clock at the park

634
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:03,037
All I'm asking is that my children
still be alive when I get there

635
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:07,221
Jackie, I wanted to
ask you... something

636
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:10,974
There's a Pearl Jam
concert on the 5th...

637
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:13,364
and I would like like to take Anna

638
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,719
Is that a weekday?

639
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:19,624
I think it's a Thursday

640
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,189
So you wanna take
a 12-year-old girl

641
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,154
to a Pearl Jam concert
on a school night?

642
00:38:26,185 --> 00:38:27,692
I just thought it
would be something nice

643
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:30,400
that she and I could do together

644
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:33,619
It's ridiculous...
She's too young

645
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:11,144
It spread? But, I did...

646
00:39:11,145 --> 00:39:14,824
I did everything right.
Everything I was supposed to do

647
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:18,813
We found some cells in your
lymph nodes... In three of them

648
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,604
But you said last time
that you got it all

649
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:25,012
So, if you were wrong last time

650
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:26,619
than there's a good chance
you're wrong this time...

651
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:30,175
- ... because the last time...
- ... was a year ago

652
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:33,861
We found a tiny lump, we treated
it. We thought we got it all

653
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:36,738
We were hopeful, but
there were no guarantees

654
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,879
But people...

655
00:39:41,225 --> 00:39:45,020
...we can beat it, I mean...
People beat it all the time, right?

656
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,864
- Every day, more and more
- Ok, so, what's the plan?

657
00:39:47,865 --> 00:39:50,499
What do we do? Another
round of radiation?

658
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:53,384
Chemotherapy

659
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:57,018
That's necessary?

660
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,817
Let's give it our best shot

661
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,538
Right. Okay

662
00:40:05,385 --> 00:40:07,337
Excuse me. I got to get the kids

663
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:09,615
We'll discuss this at
your next appointment

664
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:12,817
And you should share this
with your kids and ex-husband

665
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:15,698
How would his worrying or my
kids worrying make any difference?

666
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,463
Sooner than later...

667
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,893
...you need to

668
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,824
- Jackie...
- Ok...

669
00:40:22,825 --> 00:40:24,799
- Think about it
- Ok

670
00:40:41,265 --> 00:40:42,534
I see her

671
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:49,535
- Hi
- Hi

672
00:40:50,385 --> 00:40:52,974
- Thanks for coming
- You're welcome

673
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,934
- You look pretty
- Thanks

674
00:40:58,065 --> 00:40:59,104
Listen...

675
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:00,173
I'm glad you called...

676
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:02,304
'cause there's something I
wanna tell you something too

677
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,784
Oh! Ok. Well, you go first

678
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:07,137
Let me have a drink here

679
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:18,478
I'm going to ask
Isabel... to marry me

680
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,779
Wow!

681
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,975
I know you don't think much of her

682
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,884
She's a special person...

683
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:32,641
She really is, Jackie

684
00:41:34,545 --> 00:41:36,804
Why are you telling me this?

685
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:38,564
I want you to tell me that it's ok

686
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:40,704
- You don't need my approval
- The kids do

687
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:43,944
<i>Good evening. Would you and your
wife care to look at the menu?</i>

688
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:45,737
I'm not his wife

689
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:47,624
No, thank you

690
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:52,162
Give me a drink though,
please. Whatever this is

691
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:56,741
I think it's going to
be... hard for the kids

692
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:00,384
And I... was hoping we
could tell them together

693
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:03,404
And that'd make it easier
for the kids? Or for you?

694
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:06,171
Because you know, you can't just
decide to be a "we" and "us"...

695
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:07,644
...whenever it's convenient for you

696
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:09,844
- We are...
- We're over. We are over

697
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:13,643
We are still their parents
for the next 100 years

698
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:30,599
Why?

699
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:35,798
Just tell me why you
think this marriage...

700
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:39,240
...is going to work and ours didn't

701
00:42:57,985 --> 00:43:01,782
- What did you want to talk
to me about? -Nothing. It's...

702
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:05,133
I think we have...

703
00:43:05,265 --> 00:43:08,741
quite enough to deal with
just... with your news

704
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:29,204
Good morning

705
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:30,784
Good morning, baby

706
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:34,524
I've got something for you

707
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:36,274
- You do?
- Yeah

708
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:42,445
But you have to wake up to get it

709
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,446
Ok

710
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,144
- Hi
- Hi

711
00:43:56,545 --> 00:43:58,524
I'm awake

712
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:24,219
You shouldn't have?

713
00:44:25,185 --> 00:44:27,535
The first time I got married...

714
00:44:27,985 --> 00:44:30,974
...we'd been together
since college...

715
00:44:30,985 --> 00:44:35,582
...and marriage...
just seemed like the next step

716
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:39,439
It was just something that happened

717
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:43,836
But I think for two people
to really love each other...

718
00:44:44,105 --> 00:44:48,104
to really... commit to each other...

719
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:50,279
...it has to be...

720
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:54,402
...it has to be an act of will

721
00:44:54,665 --> 00:44:56,904
Or a decision

722
00:44:56,905 --> 00:45:01,723
And I think two people have to...
live that decision every day

723
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:06,224
Even when things are hard
and you feel like giving up...

724
00:45:06,225 --> 00:45:08,324
...you have to...

725
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:11,099
...hang on to that decision...

726
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:16,044
...that choice to...

727
00:45:16,045 --> 00:45:18,344
...to love each other

728
00:45:18,345 --> 00:45:21,354
Even if it's only by a thread

729
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:28,239
I... let that thread break once

730
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:31,543
This time, it won't

731
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:42,319
Will you marry me?

732
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:43,864
Yes

733
00:45:43,865 --> 00:45:45,600
Yes, I will

734
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:57,299
Sweetheart, don't get upset

735
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,104
I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?

736
00:46:00,105 --> 00:46:03,084
I mean... No one asked
me when you got a divorce

737
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:05,164
No one asked if I
wanted a new mother

738
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,764
No one even asked me if I liked her

739
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,712
If you guys don't care

740
00:46:08,713 --> 00:46:10,964
about keeping our family
together, then why should I?

741
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:14,564
Anna, daddy and I tried
very hard. Really, we did

742
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:17,384
No, you didn't! All you did
was name-call I heard you

743
00:46:17,385 --> 00:46:20,902
You didn't even try
to use real words

744
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,464
Ok, buddy...

745
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:26,304
Baby, Isabel's not going
to take my place as your mom

746
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:32,064
No!... It's just that... Isabel's
going to be in your life and...

747
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:35,199
...hopefully, you can
learn to accept her

748
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,800
Sweetheart

749
00:46:42,825 --> 00:46:44,640
Honey

750
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:49,379
You know, life is
full of hard things...

751
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:52,335
And sometimes it isn't fair and...

752
00:46:52,705 --> 00:46:54,324
But you know you have a choice...

753
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:58,498
You can either take the hard things
and make your life better or...

754
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:00,864
...or you can make it worse

755
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:02,634
Like how?

756
00:47:05,905 --> 00:47:07,424
Like...

757
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:11,242
...trying to see the good
side of Isabel and...

758
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,584
...what she brings to
your father's life and...

759
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:16,334
...to yours

760
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:19,624
You know, there comes
a time in every family

761
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:22,841
when you've got to be
there for each other

762
00:47:23,442 --> 00:47:25,042
Ok...

763
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:27,758
I'll be there for you

764
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,643
How about you, buddy?

765
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:33,734
Yeah

766
00:47:33,825 --> 00:47:36,299
- You'll be there?
- Yeah

767
00:47:48,305 --> 00:47:49,940
Damn it!

768
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:00,454
What's the problem?

769
00:48:01,705 --> 00:48:03,320
Nothing

770
00:48:11,665 --> 00:48:13,544
It looks good!

771
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:16,375
I can't get the trees to look real

772
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:20,698
Mind if I try?

773
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:24,700
I already messed it up anyway

774
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:28,384
Let's see

775
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:31,584
First a little brush smooshing

776
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:32,784
"Smooshing"

777
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,323
Very technical term

778
00:48:49,345 --> 00:48:51,661
Cool! Where'd you
learn how to do that?

779
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:55,398
I took an art class
when I was at NYU

780
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,942
Why don't you give it a try?

781
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:05,033
It helps if you make that little...

782
00:49:15,265 --> 00:49:16,534
Thanks

783
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:19,620
You're welcome

784
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:31,784
<i>I was thinking about what
you said about Isabel...</i>

785
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:34,021
<i>You know, seeing
the good side of her...</i>

786
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:35,977
<i>You know, you're right!</i>

787
00:49:35,985 --> 00:49:38,062
<i>She knows all about
clothes and stuff, and...</i>

788
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:40,604
<i>...she knows every rock
and roll song ever written</i>

789
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:43,936
<i>I mean... She's kind
like a kid herself</i>

790
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:46,464
<i>- Like a big sister?
- Yeah</i>

791
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:49,099
<i>She knows all the cool
junk food places to eat at</i>

792
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:50,481
<i>I'll bet!</i>

793
00:49:50,725 --> 00:49:54,439
- Once you get to know
her, she's kind of cool - Yeah?

794
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:59,153
But don't tell her I told you, I...

795
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:01,740
- I just...
- It's our secret

796
00:50:02,785 --> 00:50:04,304
Thanks

797
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:07,182
<i>Ben, wait up!</i>

798
00:50:22,064 --> 00:50:24,164
<i>Listen, baby</i>

799
00:50:24,465 --> 00:50:26,265
<i>ain't no mountain high</i>

800
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:28,066
<i>ain't no vally low</i>

801
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,767
<i>ain't no river wide enough, baby</i>

802
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:33,968
<i>If you need me, call me</i>

803
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:35,969
<i>No matter where you are</i>

804
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,770
<i>no matter how far</i>

805
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:39,271
<i>Don't worry, baby</i>

806
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:40,572
<i>Just call my name</i>

807
00:50:40,573 --> 00:50:42,773
<i>I'll be there in a hurry</i>

808
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:44,674
<i>You don't have to worry</i>

809
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:45,675
<i>'Cause baby now</i>

810
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:49,276
<i>ain't no mountain high enough</i>

811
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:52,877
<i>ain't no valley low enough</i>

812
00:50:52,978 --> 00:50:55,044
<i>Ain't no river wide enough</i>

813
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,179
<i>To keep me from getting to you, babe</i>

814
00:51:07,145 --> 00:51:09,734
- Did you have a good day?
- Yeah

815
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:11,944
You're one lucky boy
because... guess what?

816
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:15,296
You get to watch a tape tonight.
I'm going out. Colleen's baby-sitting

817
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,733
Yeah! Cool!

818
00:51:16,985 --> 00:51:19,881
And you... are wearing makeup!

819
00:51:20,585 --> 00:51:22,821
Well, no. Isabel gave it to me

820
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:26,695
No, she put a little on
in the car, playing around

821
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,001
You don't usually see
that color in the afternoon...

822
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:32,750
...except on working girls

823
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:35,977
Anyway... wash your face, because...

824
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,303
...you and I are going
out in 10 minutes

825
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:40,336
On a school night?

826
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:43,204
- Pearl Jam?!
- Yeah!

827
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:47,734
- Oh, mom, you are the coolest!
- You only live once, right?

828
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:50,541
Isn't my mom the coolest?

829
00:51:53,665 --> 00:51:55,617
It was a great idea. Thanks

830
00:51:57,385 --> 00:51:58,734
Have fun

831
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:12,823
Chemotherapy. There's
a day's dose stored here

832
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:15,664
This is a portable IV. Feel it...

833
00:52:16,705 --> 00:52:17,744
It's pretty light

834
00:52:17,745 --> 00:52:19,899
Yeah, nice and slim. You
can wear it everywhere...

835
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,984
Play tennis, jogging...

836
00:52:21,985 --> 00:52:24,745
- You can hide it under your clothes
- That's cool...

837
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:27,984
Side effects?

838
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:31,823
Some days you'll experience
drowsiness, nausea...

839
00:52:31,825 --> 00:52:34,414
...and other days you'll
feel perfectly fine

840
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,057
Am I going to lose my hair?

841
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:41,501
Maybe... Maybe not. It
varies with each person

842
00:52:42,345 --> 00:52:43,773
Let's do it!

843
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:45,740
Good

844
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:47,335
When?

845
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:50,735
I'm available tomorrow... evening

846
00:52:50,745 --> 00:52:52,081
Oh, tomorrow evening is bad...

847
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:55,084
It's spaghetti and meatball
night. Ben really looks forward...

848
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:57,901
Okay, tomorrow's good. Fine

849
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:07,744
Hellow?

850
00:53:07,745 --> 00:53:09,583
Hi, honey. How you doing?

851
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,340
Mom, I've been
waiting for your call!

852
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,100
- You won't believe it
- What?

853
00:53:15,105 --> 00:53:18,058
- I'm telepathetic
- You mean telepathic

854
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:19,857
That's what I said

855
00:53:19,865 --> 00:53:23,501
I just discovered it today.
I can read minds

856
00:53:23,505 --> 00:53:24,774
<i>No way...</i>

857
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,136
Yeah... I just tried it with
Dad and Isabel, and guess what?

858
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:29,300
<i>What?</i>

859
00:53:29,425 --> 00:53:32,219
I always knew exactly
what they were thinking

860
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,343
That is incredible

861
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,496
- Want me to read yours?
- Absolutely

862
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:39,777
- Think real hard about something
- I'm thinking

863
00:53:39,785 --> 00:53:41,896
- Close your eyes...
- Ok

864
00:53:42,665 --> 00:53:44,821
Concentrate

865
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:46,897
<i>I am concentrating</i>

866
00:53:49,785 --> 00:53:52,055
You're thinking about... me!

867
00:53:53,785 --> 00:53:55,464
That is amazing!

868
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,020
What else?

869
00:53:57,545 --> 00:54:00,896
And you're wishing you were
here instead of where you are

870
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,982
That's for sure

871
00:54:03,985 --> 00:54:05,823
<i>Where are you, anyway?</i>

872
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:11,459
I'm in bed, with the flu...
and I'm green and barfing...

873
00:54:11,505 --> 00:54:13,058
<i>I knew that</i>

874
00:54:13,345 --> 00:54:15,775
And you're wishing you were
here making me spaghetti...

875
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,738
...so I wouldn't have to eat
Daddy's sucky lamb chop

876
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:20,584
You're right about that...

877
00:54:20,585 --> 00:54:23,458
- See? I'm pathatelic!
- Telepathic!

878
00:54:23,905 --> 00:54:25,584
That's what I said

879
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:27,624
- Mommy...
- Yeah...

880
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:31,340
- When am I going to see you?
- Tomorrow after school

881
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,735
Oh... I was wishing
I'd see you tonight

882
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:39,244
Well, just gonna have...
to have one of our dream dates

883
00:54:39,245 --> 00:54:41,484
and meet somewhere
special... In our dreams

884
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:44,903
Where haven't we been in a
while? How about Disneyland?

885
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:47,655
No... Last time, the
lines were too long

886
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:49,456
Ok

887
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:51,499
The beach...

888
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,400
Yeah!

889
00:54:53,745 --> 00:54:55,936
On a hot summer day...

890
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:58,540
With gigantic waves...

891
00:54:58,705 --> 00:55:00,304
And boogie boards...

892
00:55:00,305 --> 00:55:02,133
- And corn dogs
- Yeah...

893
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:03,659
Awesome...

894
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:07,784
Cool... All right, don't forget
to put on your sunblock, okay?

895
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,739
It's a dream, mom.
You don't need sunblock

896
00:55:12,865 --> 00:55:14,737
That's right. I forgot

897
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:19,037
- Mommy, you still there?
- Yeah

898
00:55:19,225 --> 00:55:20,904
Ben? Time for dinner

899
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:22,743
I got to go. See you tonight, okay?

900
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:24,134
All right

901
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:26,684
- I'll see you in my dreams
- Bye, mom

902
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:28,334
- Bye
- I love you

903
00:55:50,985 --> 00:55:53,699
She doesn't have that
killer instinct, does she?

904
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:55,099
Defense, fall back!

905
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:15,259
You feeling all right?

906
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:17,177
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm great

907
00:56:17,505 --> 00:56:19,343
You look a little tired

908
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:20,440
I hate when people say that

909
00:56:20,441 --> 00:56:23,936
It's a polite way of
telling you look like shit

910
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:24,860
I didn't mean it like that

911
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:28,656
I just have... some
things on my mind

912
00:56:33,585 --> 00:56:35,741
You've been really busy lately

913
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:38,740
Are you...

914
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:40,984
...seeing somebody?

915
00:56:44,265 --> 00:56:47,537
No. I wish that was the
reason I was tired. I...

916
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:53,175
I've been spending a
little time with my old boss

917
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:56,576
...trying... to decide whether or
not I'll go back to Random House

918
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:58,662
Really? That would be great!

919
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,663
Oh, Ben. Easy, easy, easy

920
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:06,463
Ben, Ben, be careful, sweetie

921
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:09,463
You're a dead man, Captain Blood!

922
00:57:20,745 --> 00:57:22,790
Oh, Ben, that was really cool

923
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:24,936
- Sweetie, can you move your leg?
- Yeah

924
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:26,254
- Does it hurt?
- No

925
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:27,461
Are you okay?

926
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:31,022
Yeah, but can I still go
to Tucker's party tomorrow?

927
00:57:33,265 --> 00:57:34,601
Probably. But we
gotta get it cleaned up...

928
00:57:34,602 --> 00:57:36,138
...and have somebody
to look at it, ok?

929
00:57:36,225 --> 00:57:38,541
We'll go to the emergency room

930
00:57:49,945 --> 00:57:51,817
- Five stitches
- Is he okay?

931
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:53,697
- Yeah, he's doing fine
- He's not crying?

932
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:57,216
- Can I see my son now, please?
- I need your insurance information

933
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,580
I'll do this... He's in 152

934
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:09,343
- I don't see any broken bones
- 'Cause you don't have any

935
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,702
I'm very proud of you.
You were awfully brave today

936
00:58:12,705 --> 00:58:14,261
It didn't hurt that bad

937
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:17,217
Besides, it'll be pretty
cool to show my friends

938
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:20,056
Hey, would you do me a favor?

939
00:58:20,905 --> 00:58:22,823
Maybe... Depends what it is

940
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:26,342
Will you ask Dad to give me
a white dove for Christmas?

941
00:58:26,345 --> 00:58:27,534
We'll see...

942
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,324
Come on!

943
00:58:28,325 --> 00:58:32,374
Every magician needs a white
dove. A real one. They do

944
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:34,343
Well, you know,
that's a long way off...

945
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,895
and I think we should talk to
your mom and just see, okay?

946
00:58:38,465 --> 00:58:40,144
- Does it hurt again?
- Yeah

947
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:41,940
Lay back

948
00:58:41,945 --> 00:58:43,658
Take a deep breath

949
00:58:46,825 --> 00:58:48,617
Will you sing me a song?

950
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:51,784
My mom always sings
to me when I get hurt

951
00:58:55,185 --> 00:58:56,385
Ok... Hmm...

952
00:58:58,185 --> 00:59:00,694
Hard to think of a song on the spot

953
00:59:06,105 --> 00:59:09,670
# If I needed you #

954
00:59:09,705 --> 00:59:12,736
# would you come to me #

955
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:16,391
# would you come to me #

956
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:19,718
# and ease my pain? #

957
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:23,070
# If you needed me #

958
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:26,274
# I would come to you #

959
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:29,444
# I would swim the sea #

960
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:34,081
# for to ease your pain #

961
00:59:35,985 --> 00:59:37,334
- Feel better?
- Yeah

962
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:38,740
A little bit?

963
00:59:43,185 --> 00:59:45,103
It puts a girl on the spot

964
01:00:43,705 --> 01:00:45,816
Hi. It's Jackie

965
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:47,844
Look, I just got a
call from Random House...

966
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:50,739
and they want me to go meet
an editor this afternoon...

967
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,041
...but I'm afraid I
won't get back in time...

968
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:55,178
...to pick up Ben at
Tucker's birthday party

969
01:00:56,305 --> 01:00:58,063
Good! Great!

970
01:01:00,825 --> 01:01:02,981
Ben will be happy too

971
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:05,463
That you'll pick him up, yeah

972
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:07,013
It's 4:30

973
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:10,735
At 22 Williams Road

974
01:01:13,185 --> 01:01:14,181
Great

975
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,381
Thanks

976
01:02:02,025 --> 01:02:03,977
How hard can this be?

977
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,224
Ok...

978
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:20,377
It's going to be okay

979
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,944
- Directory assistance. What city?
- Manhattan

980
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,178
- Yeah. What listing?
- The number for Random House, please

981
01:02:35,224 --> 01:02:36,224
<i>Hellow...</i>

982
01:02:36,225 --> 01:02:38,302
Hi. May I speak with
Jackie Harrison, please?

983
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:40,217
<i>I'm sorry. Mrs Harrison's not here</i>

984
01:02:40,225 --> 01:02:42,620
No. She has a meeting
with the editor today...

985
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,963
I'm picking up Benjamin
from a birthday party

986
01:02:44,964 --> 01:02:46,101
and I lost the address

987
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:48,296
I just need to speak to
her for one quick second

988
01:02:48,305 --> 01:02:49,904
<i>Miss, I'm the senior editor</i>

989
01:02:49,905 --> 01:02:53,044
<i>I haven't seen Mrs Harrison
since she left Random House...</i>

990
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:54,978
<i>...eleven years ago</i>

991
01:02:58,105 --> 01:03:00,865
Okay. Thanks anyway

992
01:03:00,905 --> 01:03:01,901
<i>Balloons...</i>

993
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:03,214
I beg your pardon?

994
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:05,824
<i>Just look for a house with
balloons. It never fails</i>

995
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,783
<i>The kids will be there</i>

996
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:10,219
Thanks very much

997
01:03:55,585 --> 01:03:56,661
Hey, look at you!

998
01:03:57,305 --> 01:03:58,620
Come here

999
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:00,084
Can you see me?

1000
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:02,777
- Hi. You had a good time, eh?
- Hola

1001
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:03,978
Hi

1002
01:04:04,578 --> 01:04:05,624
- Hello
- Hi

1003
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,385
Let's clean your shirt.
How was Tucker's party?

1004
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,495
- Good
- Yeah?

1005
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:13,540
- Did he like the present?
- Yeah

1006
01:04:14,785 --> 01:04:16,824
<i>Did they have the snake
guy or the magician?</i>

1007
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:18,978
<i>- Snake guy
- Snake guy...</i>

1008
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:21,001
<i>It bit Tucker</i>

1009
01:04:21,185 --> 01:04:23,276
<i>It bit Tucker? Did it eat him?</i>

1010
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,103
Did you have any trouble finding
the place with my directions?

1011
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,175
No

1012
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:02,377
Well, thanks

1013
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:09,660
I know your secret

1014
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,220
I saw airline tickets and
note from your new boss

1015
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:18,622
You're not working at Random
House in New York. I talked to them

1016
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,498
You're taking the kids
and moving to Los Angeles!

1017
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,935
What the hell are you
doing, reading my mail?

1018
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:27,464
Snooping around my back
like some little... dishonest

1019
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,893
Dishonest?!

1020
01:05:28,905 --> 01:05:32,495
I wouldn't have to snoop around
if you were honest with Luke!

1021
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:36,419
I'd have thought this was
the answer to your prayers...

1022
01:05:36,425 --> 01:05:40,334
You lose the witch and her
two little brats in one swoop

1023
01:05:40,385 --> 01:05:42,244
Simplifies everything.
You get your life back

1024
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:44,402
Come on. There's plenty of
publishing houses in New York

1025
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:46,260
Surely you can get a job here

1026
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:50,783
Oh, so I'm supposed to rearrange my
life to accommodate your schedules?

1027
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:53,724
If you're so damned concerned,
why don't you get a new career?

1028
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:55,964
Why don't you and Luke
move to Los Angeles?

1029
01:05:55,965 --> 01:05:56,993
Oh, you can make plans

1030
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:59,821
to rearrange everyone else's
life without consulting us

1031
01:05:59,825 --> 01:06:02,619
Bi-coastal parenting.
People do it all the time

1032
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,604
Luke gets the kids one
month during the summer...

1033
01:06:04,605 --> 01:06:07,016
and every other holidays. It's
not ideal but people make it work

1034
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:08,578
No, you can't do that

1035
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:10,196
You can't take Luke's
kids away from him!

1036
01:06:10,197 --> 01:06:12,102
- Yes I can
- No. We can't live like that!

1037
01:06:12,103 --> 01:06:13,300
We?!

1038
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:16,580
Look, if Luke has a problem
with this, tell him to talk to me

1039
01:06:16,625 --> 01:06:19,259
This is not about you.
This is not your problem...

1040
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:22,320
- It is my problem
- Why's that?

1041
01:06:23,305 --> 01:06:25,423
Because I'm gonna marry this man...

1042
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:29,300
and we're going to share
our life together. I love him!

1043
01:06:30,345 --> 01:06:32,084
His kids are everything to him...

1044
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:35,623
and he would be devastated
not to be near them

1045
01:06:59,705 --> 01:07:02,055
You guessed the wrong secret...

1046
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:08,781
Charlie Drummond, she's a...

1047
01:07:09,585 --> 01:07:13,175
is a colleague of mine from
Random House in New York, and she...

1048
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:17,982
she moved to the West Coast office
and I'm gonna be crashing with her...

1049
01:07:17,985 --> 01:07:20,301
while I get protein injections

1050
01:07:20,345 --> 01:07:22,979
that are recommended
by my oncologist

1051
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,973
You can only get them in Los Angeles

1052
01:07:26,105 --> 01:07:27,542
Oncologist?

1053
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:30,424
Yeah... Life's a tradeoff!

1054
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:33,822
It's finally legal to smoke
dope, but you got to have cancer

1055
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,178
Are you dying?

1056
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:48,184
Not today

1057
01:07:57,505 --> 01:07:58,501
We'll beat it

1058
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:01,023
- It's a walk in the park
- Yeah

1059
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:04,903
Thanks for the "we"

1060
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:11,380
You're not alone in this, you know

1061
01:08:12,545 --> 01:08:14,736
You don't have to go
through this by yourself

1062
01:08:15,185 --> 01:08:16,898
You know that

1063
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:19,981
You understand what I'm saying?

1064
01:08:29,785 --> 01:08:31,896
What will we tell the kids?

1065
01:08:35,025 --> 01:08:37,375
I think we should
tell them the truth

1066
01:08:39,825 --> 01:08:41,617
They can handle it...

1067
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:50,173
It should've been me instead of you

1068
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:56,116
I'll go along with that

1069
01:09:11,385 --> 01:09:13,179
<i>Look out...</i>

1070
01:09:13,265 --> 01:09:15,183
<i>You didn't see...</i>

1071
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,584
<i>Gotcha!</i>

1072
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:22,494
Did he beat you?
Here, look, 35 marshmallows

1073
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:25,174
35. Your sister put them in

1074
01:09:26,505 --> 01:09:29,265
So... what's going on?
Who's marrying who this time?

1075
01:09:29,305 --> 01:09:32,304
- Mommy's marrying Isabel
- Oh, so cute

1076
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:35,079
Oh, no...

1077
01:09:35,665 --> 01:09:38,124
- Guys, Mommy's sick
- You still have the flu?

1078
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:42,335
No. I have... cancer.
Do you know what that is?

1079
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:46,582
It's what Aunt Mary died from

1080
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:49,864
Aunt Mary had a different kind

1081
01:09:49,865 --> 01:09:53,981
There's lots of different kinds.
And hers was very... very bad

1082
01:09:56,945 --> 01:09:58,624
Is yours bad?

1083
01:09:59,045 --> 01:10:02,218
Well, I've been working with a
doctor to get better for a while now

1084
01:10:02,225 --> 01:10:05,417
...and she says we have
every reason to hope...

1085
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:07,576
that I'm going to be fine

1086
01:10:10,985 --> 01:10:13,824
Check this out, Anna.
Look at this... This is so cool

1087
01:10:13,825 --> 01:10:16,174
No. It's okay

1088
01:10:16,705 --> 01:10:19,255
Look at this. I don't have to go
to the hospital to get my medicine

1089
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,784
- It just come right in this
- It just looks like Game Boy

1090
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,984
Yeah, it kind of is, uh?

1091
01:10:24,025 --> 01:10:26,404
It's going to make me strong,
so I can fight the disease

1092
01:10:26,405 --> 01:10:27,581
Cool, uh?

1093
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:30,624
Can I catch cancer?

1094
01:10:30,745 --> 01:10:33,413
No, sweetie. It's not contagious

1095
01:10:33,425 --> 01:10:36,378
So you've known about
this for a long time...

1096
01:10:37,545 --> 01:10:38,621
Yeah...

1097
01:10:39,425 --> 01:10:40,944
And you never told me

1098
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,414
Sweetheart...

1099
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,214
...your mom wanted to wait
until the right time to tell you

1100
01:10:45,385 --> 01:10:48,538
Oh, guys, I'm sorry...
Look, I just...

1101
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,384
I know how scared I
get when you're sick...

1102
01:10:51,385 --> 01:10:53,003
...and I thought it would be best...

1103
01:10:53,004 --> 01:10:54,944
to wait for a while
until it got smaller!

1104
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:57,904
So you lied. You lied
when you never told me

1105
01:10:57,905 --> 01:10:59,820
If you lied then,
maybe you're lying now

1106
01:10:59,821 --> 01:11:01,344
I can never believe you again!

1107
01:11:01,345 --> 01:11:04,255
I made a mistake...
Anna, people make mistakes!

1108
01:11:05,145 --> 01:11:06,884
- Where's Isabel?
- What?

1109
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:08,664
It's Thursday. We're
supposed to be with Isabel

1110
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:11,464
- She should've picked us up by now
- I'd rather be with Mommy

1111
01:11:11,465 --> 01:11:14,024
Well, she's dying...
Isabel's your mother now

1112
01:11:14,025 --> 01:11:15,621
Anna, don't say that!

1113
01:11:21,305 --> 01:11:23,377
You do not run out on your mother!

1114
01:11:24,345 --> 01:11:26,297
No, that's your job

1115
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:14,781
- I'm sorry you're sick
- What?

1116
01:12:14,785 --> 01:12:16,862
I said I'm sorry you're sick

1117
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,464
I can't hear you

1118
01:12:18,465 --> 01:12:20,218
Then turn down the music!

1119
01:12:24,545 --> 01:12:25,621
What?

1120
01:12:26,185 --> 01:12:27,613
I said...

1121
01:12:27,705 --> 01:12:29,702
...I'm sorry you're sick

1122
01:12:31,105 --> 01:12:33,296
That's what I thought you said

1123
01:12:34,925 --> 01:12:36,574
So what are you guys doing?

1124
01:12:36,725 --> 01:12:39,816
Oh! Marvin and I are getting
our act together, right Marvin?

1125
01:12:39,825 --> 01:12:41,174
- Right, Tammi
- Yeah...

1126
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:44,804
But that's one of Isabel's songs...

1127
01:12:44,805 --> 01:12:47,323
Oh, look. Isabel might
know the words, babe, but...

1128
01:12:47,324 --> 01:12:50,942
...I invented the moves!
Right, Marvin?

1129
01:12:50,945 --> 01:12:51,975
Right, Tammi

1130
01:12:52,345 --> 01:12:53,341
In fact...

1131
01:12:54,425 --> 01:12:57,776
we're looking for somebody
to do... backup with us

1132
01:12:57,945 --> 01:12:59,663
- Right, Marvin?
- Yeah, Tammi!

1133
01:12:59,664 --> 01:13:01,064
<i>Listen, baby</i>

1134
01:13:01,865 --> 01:13:03,265

1138
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,969

01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,870

01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:16,371
<i>Don't worry, baby</i>

1141
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:17,972
<i>Just call my name</i>

1142
01:13:17,973 --> 01:13:19,873
<i>I'll be there in a hurry</i>

1143
01:13:19,874 --> 01:13:21,674
<i>You don't have to worry</i>

1144
01:13:21,675 --> 01:13:22,675
<i>'Cause baby now</i>

1145
01:13:22,676 --> 01:13:26,176

<i>Ain't no river wide enough</i>

1148
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:36,379
<i>To keep me from getting to you, babe</i>

1149
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,480
<i>Oh, no valley</i>

1150
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:43,381
<i>no wind, no rain</i>

1151
01:13:44,405 --> 01:13:46,415
Oh, my God!
# Or winters cold #

1152
01:13:46,816 --> 01:13:47,704
<i># Can't stop me, baby #</i>

1153
01:13:47,705 --> 01:13:48,960
Cool!

1154
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:50,261
<i>No, no, baby</i>

1155
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:51,561
<i>Cause you are my goal</i>

1156
01:13:51,562 --> 01:13:52,862
<i>If you are ever in trouble</i>

1157
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:54,763
<i>I'll be there on the double</i>

1158
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:58,464
<i>Just send for me, oh, baby</i>

1159
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:00,765
<i>My love is alive</i>

1160
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:02,664
<i># way down in my heart #

1161
01:14:02,665 --> 01:14:04,995
<i>Although we are miles apart</i>

1162
01:14:04,996 --> 01:14:08,196
<i>If you ever need a helping hand</i>

1163
01:14:08,197 --> 01:14:09,897
<i>I'll be there on the double</i>

1164
01:14:09,898 --> 01:14:11,598
<i>just as fast as I can</i>

1165
01:14:11,599 --> 01:14:12,799
<i>Don't you know that</i>

1166
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,900

1169
01:14:23,003 --> 01:14:26,203

1170
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:27,104
<i>Don't you know that</i>

1171
01:14:27,105 --> 01:14:29,805

01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:42,435
<i>This land is my land</i>

1175
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:44,663
<i>From California</i>

1176
01:14:44,665 --> 01:14:47,003
<i>to the New York islands</i>

1177
01:14:47,045 --> 01:14:49,334
<i>From the redwood forests</i>

1178
01:14:49,369 --> 01:14:51,623
<i>to the Gulf Stream waters</i>

1179
01:14:52,645 --> 01:14:54,410
<i>this land was made</i>

1180
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:56,175
<i>for you and me</i>

1181
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,433
<i>As I was walking</i>

1182
01:14:58,434 --> 01:15:00,842
<i>that ribbon of highway</i>

1183
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:02,770
<i>I saw above me</i>

1184
01:15:02,805 --> 01:15:05,294
<i>that endless skyway</i>

1185
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:07,710
<i>I saw below me</i>

1186
01:15:07,745 --> 01:15:10,658
<i>that golden valley</i>

1187
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:12,781
<i>This land was made</i>

1188
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:14,637
<i>for you and me</i>

1189
01:15:14,738 --> 01:15:16,838
<i>This land is your land</i>

1190
01:15:16,839 --> 01:15:19,239
<i>This land is my land</i>

1191
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,140
<i>From California</i>

1192
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,441
<i>to the New York islands</i>

1193
01:15:23,442 --> 01:15:26,142
<i>From the redwood forests</i>

1194
01:15:27,145 --> 01:15:28,658
- You look great!
- Hi

1195
01:15:28,659 --> 01:15:29,693
Hi

1196
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:31,659
Your dad's meeting's running
late so I came to watch you

1197
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,760
Ok

1198
01:15:35,505 --> 01:15:36,874
I have to tell you
something in confidence

1199
01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:38,204
You're having Michael Jackson's baby

1200
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:43,304
That, and Anna is over her head
for Brad "The Flame" Kovitsky

1201
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,894
No way! I can't believe she would...

1202
01:15:46,145 --> 01:15:48,415
After the way how he was
with all the girls in class!

1203
01:15:49,025 --> 01:15:51,181
Oh... how... I didn't
know anything about this

1204
01:15:51,185 --> 01:15:52,664
She was afraid you'd
make a big deal about it

1205
01:15:52,665 --> 01:15:54,343
They've been going out for 2 weeks

1206
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:56,422
Which, of course, in the 6th grade,
as you know, doesn't mean anything

1207
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,200
They don't "go" anywhere.
They don't have lunch together

1208
01:15:58,201 --> 01:15:59,344
It's just their declaration...

1209
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:02,017
Yeah. I know, I know.
I had kids of my own once

1210
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,819
Anyway, today, in the lunchyard...

1211
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:07,022
he announces publicly,
in front of her friends...

1212
01:16:07,023 --> 01:16:08,620
...that he's breaking up with her

1213
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:11,862
In front of everybody?
That little shit!

1214
01:16:11,945 --> 01:16:13,544
Not you. Just go

1215
01:16:14,345 --> 01:16:16,297
Anyway. That's the point
of going out, right?

1216
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,584
So one of them can
dump the other one...

1217
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:22,984
and they can act out this passionate
adult... soap opera tragedy

1218
01:16:22,985 --> 01:16:24,061
She must be devastated

1219
01:16:24,105 --> 01:16:25,760
She's been one hour in
the girls' room crying

1220
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:29,115
You mean, you think you've got
problems. This is serious...

1221
01:16:34,325 --> 01:16:36,180
Oh, so, my point...

1222
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:37,904
Anyway. I pick her
up from school today

1223
01:16:37,985 --> 01:16:41,063
She tells me the whole
story and asks me what to do

1224
01:16:41,065 --> 01:16:41,883
What did you tell her?

1225
01:16:41,884 --> 01:16:43,801
I said "Beats me. Ask your mom!"

1226
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:45,936
So she's going to... Tomorrow

1227
01:16:46,025 --> 01:16:48,317
- Be ready
- I'm ready. I'm ready

1228
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:50,904
What the hell is this?

1229
01:16:50,905 --> 01:16:54,064
It's Thanksgiving dinner. These are
the Clintons. We're having dinner

1230
01:16:54,065 --> 01:16:56,214
That is my son...

1231
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,143
...the turkey!

1232
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,381
Did they...?

1233
01:17:20,425 --> 01:17:23,662
Yeah. They killed him.
But he does it so great!

1234
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:35,623
But sweety, did you
really think, at 12...

1235
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:39,215
that you'd meet someone you'd want
to spend the rest of your life with?

1236
01:17:39,225 --> 01:17:40,653
No

1237
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:42,784
It's just every time
I'm on the lunchyard...

1238
01:17:42,785 --> 01:17:45,279
and he's with 10 of his
butt-kissing little weasels...

1239
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,776
You don't like his friends!

1240
01:17:47,785 --> 01:17:50,604
...they all yell, "There goes the
Virgin Queen" or "The Ice Princess"

1241
01:17:50,605 --> 01:17:54,302
...or some clever cut like that.
Like it hurts my feelings

1242
01:17:54,305 --> 01:17:56,382
You didn't let him kiss you

1243
01:17:56,945 --> 01:17:58,976
Not with my mouth open

1244
01:17:59,785 --> 01:18:03,057
That's my girl! Good for you

1245
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:07,054
Does that mean now that you let
him kiss you with your mouth shut?

1246
01:18:07,655 --> 01:18:11,184
- Mom...
- Oh! Sorry... Okay. Right

1247
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:14,377
What do you say to him when
he says something like that?

1248
01:18:14,425 --> 01:18:17,935
I call him a fart-face or a
pervert or something equally lame

1249
01:18:17,945 --> 01:18:20,705
Sweetheart, you have
to just ignore him!

1250
01:18:20,785 --> 01:18:23,738
He doesn't exist. You don't
see him, you don't hear him...

1251
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:26,015
He's just nothing. He's not there

1252
01:18:26,025 --> 01:18:28,261
You are too much of a woman...

1253
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:31,454
to even... bother
with such a little...

1254
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,184
...boy as him

1255
01:18:33,985 --> 01:18:34,764
You're kidding, right?

1256
01:18:34,765 --> 01:18:36,904
No, no, no. I mean, all
he wants is the attention

1257
01:18:36,905 --> 01:18:39,204
Once he doesn't get it, he might
try a little harder for a while...

1258
01:18:39,205 --> 01:18:42,060
...but then he'll get
frustrated and give up

1259
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:43,976
So I just ignore him.
Keep my mouth shut

1260
01:18:43,977 --> 01:18:45,577
Yeah

1261
01:18:47,025 --> 01:18:49,204
You think Isabel would do that?

1262
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:55,504
Oh, it's just, she's younger.
Maybe she remembers how to do this

1263
01:18:57,385 --> 01:18:59,081
So this will work, uh?

1264
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,019
Hi, sweetie...

1265
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,854
- What's wrong?
- Nothing

1266
01:19:51,905 --> 01:19:53,777
Is it time for you to go to LA?

1267
01:19:53,785 --> 01:19:57,580
No, it's still nighttime.
And it's snowing...

1268
01:19:57,705 --> 01:19:59,975
I got a babysitter for Ben...

1269
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:02,421
Do you want to go
someplace special with me?

1270
01:20:02,425 --> 01:20:03,853
Right now?

1271
01:20:03,985 --> 01:20:05,095
Yes

1272
01:20:05,225 --> 01:20:07,381
Okay. Just you and me

1273
01:20:43,985 --> 01:20:46,016
I'm never, never
going to forget this

1274
01:20:46,185 --> 01:20:47,500
Never say never

1275
01:20:49,225 --> 01:20:53,421
Well... there's a loophole.
You can say " never, never"...

1276
01:20:53,465 --> 01:20:57,021
...if you mean it
enough to say it twice

1277
01:21:03,985 --> 01:21:06,415
I'll remember always, always

1278
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:10,617
Promise, promise?

1279
01:21:36,185 --> 01:21:40,094
<i>Move that carriage from back to the
end of the street and start again</i>

1280
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:43,823
<i>Everybody keep moving!</i>

1281
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:49,444
<i>Go back to the starting point...</i>

1282
01:21:49,445 --> 01:21:50,741
It's 1:45

1283
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:55,093
Want a lens?

1284
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:57,217
Thanks, everybody! That's a wrap!

1285
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:00,059
Thank you for a great day, folks

1286
01:22:01,465 --> 01:22:04,114
It's 1:45. I told you, I have
to pick up Anna and Benjamin

1287
01:22:04,115 --> 01:22:05,515
Thanks guys!

1288
01:22:05,865 --> 01:22:07,464
You're not... You have to finish!

1289
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:10,856
No. I've got it in the can!
Coop can wrap the equipment

1290
01:22:10,865 --> 01:22:12,339
This is my star account

1291
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,463
These clients need choices.
They need variety

1292
01:22:15,465 --> 01:22:17,221
I shot it 20 different angles

1293
01:22:17,222 --> 01:22:19,578
They'll have plenty of variety.
Trust me

1294
01:22:19,585 --> 01:22:21,218
I don't

1295
01:22:23,665 --> 01:22:25,423
What are you saying?

1296
01:22:27,665 --> 01:22:30,720
I'm saying that you're
the best I've got

1297
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:33,784
Probably the best
I've ever worked with

1298
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:37,835
But these last couple of
months... your work is slipping

1299
01:22:37,836 --> 01:22:40,936
It's still fine, but
you've lost your edge

1300
01:22:40,965 --> 01:22:42,461
Your focus...

1301
01:22:42,465 --> 01:22:44,223
Your dedication

1302
01:22:44,545 --> 01:22:46,542
And your attitude...

1303
01:22:47,225 --> 01:22:49,416
is very disappointing

1304
01:22:51,385 --> 01:22:54,194
You're making a career decision here

1305
01:22:55,545 --> 01:22:58,339
If you walk now,
I'll have to let you go

1306
01:23:07,145 --> 01:23:09,222
I'm sorry you feel that way

1307
01:23:18,865 --> 01:23:20,020
Damn!...

1308
01:23:21,985 --> 01:23:25,814
It's okay. Don't worry.
It's going to be fine

1309
01:23:44,065 --> 01:23:45,459
Hey, guys

1310
01:23:45,645 --> 01:23:47,537
Sorry. I'm late

1311
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:54,244
- Hey Benjamin...
- Yeah?

1312
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:56,820
- Why don't you go sit
in the car, buddy? -Ok

1313
01:23:57,145 --> 01:23:59,222
- Don't drive away
- I won't

1314
01:24:00,385 --> 01:24:01,620
What happened?

1315
01:24:04,145 --> 01:24:07,538
Do you know that boy I was
telling you about, Brad Kovitsky?

1316
01:24:07,539 --> 01:24:08,739
Yeah

1317
01:24:09,185 --> 01:24:13,060
Well.. he's been a real jerk lately,
and my mom told me to ignore him

1318
01:24:13,145 --> 01:24:14,664
So today...

1319
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:16,014
...I did

1320
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,103
And you know what he called me?

1321
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:22,944
He called me "Frosty the
Snow-bitch". In front of everyone

1322
01:24:25,425 --> 01:24:27,343
Men can be scum

1323
01:24:27,385 --> 01:24:28,574
Yes, they can...

1324
01:24:28,585 --> 01:24:30,855
Is that little bastard
here? I'll kick his ass

1325
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:33,420
No, his mother's always on time

1326
01:24:38,545 --> 01:24:39,860
I have an idea

1327
01:24:39,865 --> 01:24:43,216
No, thanks. I don't need
advice from a stepmother

1328
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:49,717
Ok. Yeah...

1329
01:24:50,945 --> 01:24:54,774
I can see how sitting out here
in the... cold and snow, crying...

1330
01:24:54,785 --> 01:24:58,534
seems like a far superior
idea to listening to...

1331
01:24:58,545 --> 01:25:00,258
...a stepmother

1332
01:25:00,665 --> 01:25:04,864
But for kicks, let's lose the title

1333
01:25:04,865 --> 01:25:08,819
Seems to me you have a choice. You
can either pretend to be an adult...

1334
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,777
...or you can actually be one

1335
01:25:10,865 --> 01:25:11,961
So...

1336
01:25:13,665 --> 01:25:17,494
sit here in the cold, crying

1337
01:25:18,465 --> 01:25:20,144
...by yourself...

1338
01:25:20,585 --> 01:25:21,581
...or...

1339
01:25:22,825 --> 01:25:24,617
...do something about it...

1340
01:25:25,185 --> 01:25:26,874
...together

1341
01:25:28,385 --> 01:25:29,813
Crying...

1342
01:25:30,745 --> 01:25:32,598
Do something...

1343
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:37,698
What's it going to be?

1344
01:25:40,945 --> 01:25:42,419
Do something

1345
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,620
- Yeah?
- Yeah

1346
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:50,623
Ok. Can we start by like covering
up my hairy stepmother wart?

1347
01:25:50,665 --> 01:25:52,856
Because it must be showing!

1348
01:25:54,865 --> 01:25:56,020
Punk...

1349
01:25:56,465 --> 01:26:00,223
It's cold! Come on, let's go!
Benjamin will drive us home

1350
01:26:05,145 --> 01:26:07,620
Okay, come on! Come on! Come on!

1351
01:26:09,485 --> 01:26:13,055
Ok. Next week, after school...

1352
01:26:13,785 --> 01:26:15,384
...you walk up to him...

1353
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:16,655
...with...

1354
01:26:16,865 --> 01:26:19,675
...attitude. You hear me?

1355
01:26:20,345 --> 01:26:21,580
And you say:

1356
01:26:21,825 --> 01:26:23,822
"Listen up, limp-dick...

1357
01:26:26,405 --> 01:26:30,541
...'cause I'm only in to say
this once: As far as your...

1358
01:26:30,625 --> 01:26:32,019
...pitiful...

1359
01:26:32,065 --> 01:26:35,860
...knowledge of what a
woman really wants goes...

1360
01:26:35,865 --> 01:26:39,944
...I am not going to waste
my time with some... loser...

1361
01:26:40,025 --> 01:26:42,785
...who doesn't even
know what snowblowing is"

1362
01:26:45,225 --> 01:26:46,221
What is it?

1363
01:26:51,505 --> 01:26:55,841
It's... an incredibly disgusting
and not even remotely sexy thing..

1364
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:58,762
...that I once I heard described in
a movie I'd never take you to go see

1365
01:26:59,105 --> 01:27:01,533
But it is real. Now...

1366
01:27:02,585 --> 01:27:04,013
...the clincher:

1367
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:07,024
You walk away...

1368
01:27:07,745 --> 01:27:09,424
...then you...

1369
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:11,655
...whip around...

1370
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:13,819
...and say:

1371
01:27:15,025 --> 01:27:17,261
"The guy I see is in high school...

1372
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,820
...and, it has to be said...

1373
01:27:19,825 --> 01:27:23,654
...he laughs his ass off
whenever we talk about you"

1374
01:27:24,145 --> 01:27:26,142
I don't know anyone in high school

1375
01:27:27,385 --> 01:27:30,099
There will be... a suitable boy...

1376
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:34,424
...outside your school
on Monday at 2:30 with...

1377
01:27:34,465 --> 01:27:36,223
...a very expensive bike

1378
01:27:36,265 --> 01:27:40,743
And he will be a stone fox... even
if I have to call an escort service

1379
01:27:42,345 --> 01:27:44,217
I've had the worst day...

1380
01:27:44,665 --> 01:27:46,139
...until now

1381
01:27:48,865 --> 01:27:50,214
Me too

1382
01:27:52,945 --> 01:27:56,820
<i>United Airlines announces
the arrival of Flight 86...</i>

1383
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:58,777
<i>...service from Los Angeles</i>

1384

<i>Deplaning passengers may

1385
01:28:05,265 --> 01:28:06,744
Ok, so I'm gonna get your bags...

1386
01:28:06,745 --> 01:28:09,261
- .. and the taxis are just over there
- Thanks

1387
01:28:09,865 --> 01:28:11,259
Surprise!

1388
01:28:15,225 --> 01:28:17,256
Why is she in a wheelchair?

1389
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:19,464
Sweetie, she's traveled a
long way and she's just tired

1390
01:28:19,465 --> 01:28:21,244
So go give her a hug
and be gentle, ok?

1391
01:28:21,645 --> 01:28:23,945
Look at this guy... Hi!

1392
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:26,223
Let's go home

1393
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:31,295
- Welcome back
- Thanks. What a great surprise

1394
01:28:44,065 --> 01:28:45,778
Hey, let me out!

1395
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:48,055
- Come on! Let me out!
- Your brother's got to get out

1396
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,019
- Hey!
- Sorry

1397
01:28:51,305 --> 01:28:53,541
I'm in the family too, you know

1398
01:29:02,785 --> 01:29:05,215
- What's up?
- We have a surprise for you

1399
01:29:05,225 --> 01:29:06,574
- No way
- Yes

1400
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:09,020
- What is it?
- We can't tell you. It's a surprise

1401
01:29:09,025 --> 01:29:10,135
- Come on, tell me
- No

1402
01:29:10,145 --> 01:29:12,017
- Ben, tell me
- No way!

1403
01:29:12,025 --> 01:29:13,578
- Come on. Tell me
- No way...

1404
01:29:14,065 --> 01:29:15,823
Close your eyes

1405
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:18,613
Step...

1406
01:29:19,825 --> 01:29:22,664
Almost! You're almost there
Don't open your eyes

1407
01:29:22,665 --> 01:29:24,821
- Please, just a little peek
- No... no...

1408
01:29:24,825 --> 01:29:25,901
Gosh!

1409
01:29:27,225 --> 01:29:28,983
Come in! Come in!

1410
01:29:28,985 --> 01:29:31,938
All right, ready? One, two, three...

1411
01:29:31,945 --> 01:29:33,260
...open!

1412
01:29:59,425 --> 01:30:00,978
Isn't it great?

1413
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:02,903
Isabel did it

1414
01:30:17,865 --> 01:30:21,853
I'm working on a Christmas
project for Ben and Anna and...

1415
01:30:21,865 --> 01:30:25,562
and there aren't any recent photos
of... me with the kids, and I was...

1416
01:30:25,597 --> 01:30:27,344
...I was just wondering if...

1417
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:29,898
...if you'd take some

1418
01:30:30,465 --> 01:30:32,462
Sure... Love to

1419
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:35,021
Thanks

1420
01:30:40,825 --> 01:30:43,778
Hey, guys, wait up. Wait up for me!

1421
01:30:49,425 --> 01:30:52,383
Can you stop right there
for a second? Oh, great!

1422
01:30:53,425 --> 01:30:54,421
Perfect

1423
01:30:54,425 --> 01:30:56,900
Benjamin, that's a dazzling
display of horsemanship

1424
01:30:57,025 --> 01:30:59,056
Come on, you lazy horse, get up!

1425
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:14,295
<i>"One day, five men
came in funny hats...</i>

1426
01:31:14,305 --> 01:31:17,263
<i>to pick the biggest, fastest,
roughest bull to fight...</i>

1427
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:19,974
<i>...in the bullfights in Madrid"</i>

1428
01:31:44,745 --> 01:31:46,219
Hi, Mom!

1429
01:31:55,945 --> 01:31:57,373
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1430
01:31:57,465 --> 01:31:59,018
<i>There we go</i>

1431
01:31:59,825 --> 01:32:01,253
<i>Almost...</i>

1432
01:32:01,665 --> 01:32:05,619
Well, almost not falling.
That was the first time he fell

1433
01:32:05,745 --> 01:32:07,298
Awesome fall...

1434
01:32:07,345 --> 01:32:09,615
Are you going to try it again?

1435
01:32:09,985 --> 01:32:11,700
One over here. Everybody!

1436
01:32:12,265 --> 01:32:13,614
Cheese!

1437
01:32:16,425 --> 01:32:17,853
- Are you going back?
- Si

1438
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,261
- More?
- Yeah

1439
01:32:19,265 --> 01:32:22,880
All right! Go for it. I'm watching!

1440
01:32:28,985 --> 01:32:31,653
You know, Ben was born in 2
hours, went strait to the breast...

1441
01:32:31,665 --> 01:32:34,379
...and camped there
for the next four days

1442
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:36,144
Always with this...

1443
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:40,663
...his mischievous look on his face.
Like he had a secret or something

1444
01:32:41,425 --> 01:32:43,138
And his...

1445
01:32:43,185 --> 01:32:44,295
...blanket...

1446
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:47,537
...always looked like a cape.
Even the nurses said so

1447
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:51,385
He loves hearing that
story over and over

1448
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,780
About how he was born a magician

1449
01:32:55,265 --> 01:32:56,614
And her?

1450
01:32:56,865 --> 01:32:58,623
Twenty-eight hours...

1451
01:32:59,625 --> 01:33:02,737
The doctors wanted to
go in and get her but...

1452
01:33:03,305 --> 01:33:07,293
...I knew she'd come in her own
time. That's just the way she is

1453
01:33:08,105 --> 01:33:10,182
Can't let anybody rush her

1454
01:33:11,665 --> 01:33:13,617
I'll keep that in mind

1455
01:33:34,665 --> 01:33:36,344
It didn't work, did it?

1456
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:38,450
I'm sorry

1457
01:33:38,485 --> 01:33:41,855
Hey... You did everything you could

1458
01:33:43,065 --> 01:33:44,857
But there's still
some options available

1459
01:33:44,865 --> 01:33:47,321
There's a... treatment in
Paris, one in Switzerland...

1460
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:48,978
...and they come highly recommended

1461
01:33:48,985 --> 01:33:50,618
Thanks, but...

1462
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:54,178
I think I want to spend...

1463
01:33:54,265 --> 01:33:56,023
...my time at home...

1464
01:33:56,185 --> 01:33:57,818
...with my family

1465
01:34:00,619 --> 01:34:02,319
Yeah

1466
01:34:04,785 --> 01:34:07,419
Christmas will be
here before you know it

1467
01:34:46,665 --> 01:34:48,364
I thought you might
need one of these

1468
01:34:48,365 --> 01:34:51,063
I do. It looks great

1469
01:35:01,585 --> 01:35:02,934
A little more

1470
01:35:03,065 --> 01:35:04,334
A little more...

1471
01:35:04,345 --> 01:35:05,534
Okay!

1472
01:35:05,545 --> 01:35:07,701
I think that's fine. Stop

1473
01:35:07,985 --> 01:35:09,538
Oh, perfect

1474
01:35:10,545 --> 01:35:12,797
Smells great too

1475
01:35:14,465 --> 01:35:15,700
Thanks

1476
01:35:28,825 --> 01:35:31,414
What are we supposed
to do without you?

1477
01:35:33,465 --> 01:35:35,498
You'll be fine

1478
01:35:36,585 --> 01:35:38,616
You're a great father!

1479
01:35:43,465 --> 01:35:45,417
I just never really...

1480
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:48,298
...I didn't give you
the chance to realize it

1481
01:35:54,905 --> 01:35:56,415
Thank you

1482
01:36:00,985 --> 01:36:02,538
Merry Christmas

1483
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:25,177
As for your pitiful knowledge
of what a woman really wants...

1484
01:36:25,185 --> 01:36:27,580
...I'm not wasting my time
on some pathetic loser...

1485
01:36:27,585 --> 01:36:30,219
...who doesn't even
know what snowblowing is

1486
01:36:30,505 --> 01:36:31,660
Good one

1487
01:36:31,865 --> 01:36:33,698
Oh, and the guy I see...

1488
01:36:33,745 --> 01:36:36,334
...is in high school,
and it has to be said that...

1489
01:36:36,345 --> 01:36:39,855
every time we talk about
you, he laughs his ass off

1490
01:36:39,985 --> 01:36:41,379
Yeah, right

1491
01:36:41,785 --> 01:36:45,022
You don't believe me? He's
standing right over there

1492
01:36:56,825 --> 01:36:58,094
No way...

1493
01:36:58,785 --> 01:37:00,384
Well, believe it

1494
01:37:08,945 --> 01:37:10,783
You rule, Anna! You rule!

1495
01:37:10,785 --> 01:37:12,020
You blew it!

1496
01:37:12,025 --> 01:37:13,260
Loser!

1497
01:37:20,464 --> 01:37:21,464
Hi!

1498
01:37:21,465 --> 01:37:22,301
What are you doing here?

1499
01:37:22,302 --> 01:37:24,737
I'm here picking up
my kids from school

1500
01:37:24,785 --> 01:37:27,413
Who... is that?

1501
01:37:28,345 --> 01:37:29,899
He looks familiar. He
looks like that guy...

1502
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,054
...in his underwear on the
side of the bus for Calvin Klein

1503
01:37:32,065 --> 01:37:33,415
No. Fully dressed for Ralph Lauren

1504
01:37:33,416 --> 01:37:34,066
- What?
- What?

1505
01:37:34,067 --> 01:37:36,116
- Uh?
- No. Oh...

1506
01:37:41,185 --> 01:37:43,137
<i>He's such a loser!</i>

1507
01:37:44,185 --> 01:37:45,261
<i>Moron!</i>

1508
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:52,617
It worked, it worked, it worked!

1509
01:37:55,265 --> 01:37:59,219
Did you see the look on
Brad's face? Thank you so much!

1510
01:38:05,265 --> 01:38:07,740
Okay... "Limp-dick" I know

1511
01:38:07,865 --> 01:38:10,056
What exactly is "snowblowing"?

1512
01:38:11,625 --> 01:38:13,523
It doesn't matter.
I didn't explain it to her

1513
01:38:13,558 --> 01:38:15,421
But you're gonna have to
explain to me because...

1514
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:17,778
...I'm gonna have to explain it
to about 20 or 30 parents...

1515
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:19,538
...that are going to call
in the next half-hour or so

1516
01:38:19,585 --> 01:38:20,640
Give them my number

1517
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:23,539
No. I think they'll want to
talk to Anna's mother, thank you

1518
01:38:23,545 --> 01:38:27,181
What are you worried about?
Looking bad at the PTA?

1519
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:29,338
Are you defending what you did?

1520
01:38:29,345 --> 01:38:30,341
Right to the ground!

1521
01:38:30,342 --> 01:38:31,637
You put filth in my child's mouth

1522
01:38:31,645 --> 01:38:34,063
- Oh, please...
- You had her lie about that model

1523
01:38:34,065 --> 01:38:36,840
And it worked... like a charm

1524
01:38:36,845 --> 01:38:40,057
And you became a hero,
and I became I schmuck

1525
01:38:41,225 --> 01:38:44,303
Basically, you taught my child...

1526
01:38:44,465 --> 01:38:46,144
...that I am a loser...

1527
01:38:46,225 --> 01:38:48,736
who doesn't really
care about her pain

1528
01:38:49,265 --> 01:38:52,502
- That's not what I tried to do
- That's what you did

1529
01:38:52,785 --> 01:38:56,534
Did you think I didn't have some
dirty words for that little putz?

1530
01:38:56,545 --> 01:38:58,576
That I couldn't figure
out some low blows?

1531
01:38:58,585 --> 01:38:59,900
You weren't passing them out

1532
01:38:59,905 --> 01:39:03,575
I believe, in a crisis, you have
an opportunity to learn something

1533
01:39:03,585 --> 01:39:05,013
That's deep

1534
01:39:05,585 --> 01:39:07,264
It was a lie

1535
01:39:07,425 --> 01:39:10,856
Winning without dignity
or grace is not winning

1536
01:39:10,865 --> 01:39:12,842
She has to figure out who she is...

1537
01:39:12,843 --> 01:39:14,819
...so she can stand up to
peer pressure, so that...

1538
01:39:14,825 --> 01:39:16,663
...so that she can
steer her own course

1539
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:19,174
She wasn't steering her own course

1540
01:39:19,185 --> 01:39:21,421
She was steering yours

1541
01:39:21,425 --> 01:39:24,264
That's what parenting
is all about, little girl

1542
01:39:24,265 --> 01:39:27,935
They are pleading for you to tell
them how to do the right thing

1543
01:39:27,945 --> 01:39:29,783
Sure as hell, that's
what you've done

1544
01:39:29,825 --> 01:39:32,937
And the next time something happens,
and the stakes are really high...

1545
01:39:32,945 --> 01:39:34,141
...she's gonna look back on this...

1546
01:39:34,142 --> 01:39:37,138
...and she's gonna remember how
easy it was and how good it felt

1547
01:39:37,145 --> 01:39:40,860
And she's going stand up for
herself. Dear God, what have I done?

1548
01:39:40,865 --> 01:39:43,340
You have turned her into you

1549
01:39:46,145 --> 01:39:48,063
That's what this is about...

1550
01:39:48,825 --> 01:39:50,144
That's all it's about

1551
01:39:50,145 --> 01:39:52,661
How would you know
what this is about?

1552
01:39:52,745 --> 01:39:54,458
You haven't been here
from the beginning...

1553
01:39:54,465 --> 01:39:57,737
worrying every minute of every day
that the decisions you're making...

1554
01:39:57,745 --> 01:40:00,300
...are going to shape the
people they're going to be

1555
01:40:00,505 --> 01:40:04,061
And you are not what I
want my children to be

1556
01:40:08,305 --> 01:40:10,223
I don't want that, either

1557
01:40:12,105 --> 01:40:16,218
This isn't about me
or you. It's about them

1558
01:40:16,505 --> 01:40:19,344
And believe it or not, I am trying

1559
01:40:21,305 --> 01:40:26,760
And I do have their very...
best interests at heart

1560
01:41:53,265 --> 01:41:56,218
- Would you like a drink?
- Patrón, please Double

1561
01:41:58,385 --> 01:41:59,654
What's up?

1562
01:42:07,545 --> 01:42:10,305
Last year, I lost Ben

1563
01:42:11,185 --> 01:42:14,181
- What?
- In the supermarket

1564
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:19,698
- You're lying
- It's true

1565
01:42:20,025 --> 01:42:23,422
That's impossible. You could
never lose that kid for one second

1566
01:42:27,585 --> 01:42:28,900
I did

1567
01:42:30,385 --> 01:42:32,416
Ben never mentioned it

1568
01:42:33,065 --> 01:42:35,495
He just remembers I found him

1569
01:42:36,905 --> 01:42:38,743
Why didn't you tell me?

1570
01:42:42,065 --> 01:42:44,264
You know why

1571
01:42:50,505 --> 01:42:52,900
I never wanted to be a mom

1572
01:42:56,105 --> 01:42:58,694
Well, sharing it
with you is one thing

1573
01:43:00,505 --> 01:43:03,458
Carrying it alone
the rest of my life...

1574
01:43:05,065 --> 01:43:08,143
...always being compared to you...

1575
01:43:09,705 --> 01:43:10,860
You're perfect!

1576
01:43:12,105 --> 01:43:14,057
They worship you

1577
01:43:15,025 --> 01:43:16,939
I just don't want to be
looking over my shoulder...

1578
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:18,854
...every day for 20 years...

1579
01:43:19,105 --> 01:43:20,658
...knowing...

1580
01:43:22,185 --> 01:43:24,994
...that someone else
would've done it right

1581
01:43:25,505 --> 01:43:27,233
Done it better

1582
01:43:27,585 --> 01:43:29,582
The way that I can't

1583
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:32,861
What do I have that you don't?

1584
01:43:34,705 --> 01:43:37,435
You're Mother Earth incarnate

1585
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:38,501
You're...

1586
01:43:38,985 --> 01:43:40,857
...hip and fresh

1587
01:43:40,865 --> 01:43:42,054
You ride with Anna

1588
01:43:42,065 --> 01:43:43,618
You'll learn

1589
01:43:48,785 --> 01:43:50,862
You know every story

1590
01:43:51,585 --> 01:43:53,264
Every wound...

1591
01:43:54,305 --> 01:43:56,063
Every memory...

1592
01:43:58,825 --> 01:44:02,620
Their whole life's happiness
is wrapped up in you...

1593
01:44:03,305 --> 01:44:06,065
every single moment

1594
01:44:09,025 --> 01:44:10,544
Don't you get it?

1595
01:44:13,065 --> 01:44:16,098
Look down the road to her wedding...

1596
01:44:19,505 --> 01:44:21,138
I'm in a room...

1597
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:23,297
...alone with her...

1598
01:44:26,705 --> 01:44:28,384
...fitting her veil...

1599
01:44:29,985 --> 01:44:31,857
...fluffing her dress...

1600
01:44:33,465 --> 01:44:34,939
...telling her...

1601
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:39,522
"no woman has ever
looked that beautiful"

1602
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:50,056
And my fear is...

1603
01:44:51,705 --> 01:44:53,736
...that she'll be thinking:

1604
01:44:57,905 --> 01:45:00,380
" I wish my mom was here"

1605
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:04,974
And mine is...

1606
01:45:06,105 --> 01:45:07,779
...she won't

1607
01:45:13,745 --> 01:45:15,344
But the truth is...

1608
01:45:16,705 --> 01:45:19,055
...she doesn't have to choose

1609
01:45:20,305 --> 01:45:22,257
She can have us both

1610
01:45:23,865 --> 01:45:25,657
Love us both

1611
01:45:27,345 --> 01:45:30,696
And she will be a better
person because of me...

1612
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:33,463
...and because of you

1613
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:38,861
I have their past...

1614
01:45:41,465 --> 01:45:44,360
and you can have their future

1615
01:46:03,185 --> 01:46:05,216
<i>Hey, guys, it's Christmas!</i>

1616
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:06,255
<i>Wake up!</i>

1617
01:46:07,865 --> 01:46:09,554
I hope there's a white dove

1618
01:46:11,785 --> 01:46:13,737
There has to be a white dove

1619
01:46:13,745 --> 01:46:17,494
Hark, I hear the gentle
sounds of Benjamin

1620
01:46:18,785 --> 01:46:22,261
We better get out there before
he opens all the presents

1621
01:46:26,225 --> 01:46:28,063
Have a little patience

1622
01:46:30,105 --> 01:46:32,341
Can I open my presents now?

1623
01:46:33,305 --> 01:46:35,599
Actually, your mom
wants you to go upstairs

1624
01:46:35,634 --> 01:46:37,293
and open presents with her first

1625
01:46:37,305 --> 01:46:39,655
Then we'll open
presents down here, okay?

1626
01:46:41,185 --> 01:46:43,376
Okay. Me first

1627
01:47:03,785 --> 01:47:05,782
Merry Christmas

1628
01:47:06,465 --> 01:47:09,498
Sweetie, I think this
has your name on it

1629
01:47:21,865 --> 01:47:24,340
A real magician's cape

1630
01:47:24,345 --> 01:47:25,739
Awesome!

1631
01:47:26,905 --> 01:47:28,902
Come here, I'll help you with it

1632
01:47:28,905 --> 01:47:31,255
What does it have all
over it? Could you see?

1633
01:47:31,265 --> 01:47:33,023
Pictures of me and you

1634
01:47:33,105 --> 01:47:35,624
And this one right here?
See that one?

1635
01:47:35,625 --> 01:47:38,862
That's our first official
photo of you and me as a couple

1636
01:47:39,025 --> 01:47:40,180
See that?

1637
01:47:40,185 --> 01:47:42,819
Did you know I was
good-looking right away?

1638
01:47:42,865 --> 01:47:46,455
Everybody in the hole hospital
talked about it. Are you kidding?

1639
01:47:46,465 --> 01:47:50,055
But this good-looking
was beyond my imagination

1640
01:47:54,505 --> 01:47:56,218
Are you dying?

1641
01:48:01,865 --> 01:48:03,339
What do you think?

1642
01:48:03,705 --> 01:48:04,974
Yes

1643
01:48:05,665 --> 01:48:07,696
Then I won't see you anymore

1644
01:48:09,185 --> 01:48:11,660
Well, you won't see my body, but...

1645
01:48:12,825 --> 01:48:16,097
You know how a caterpillar
becomes something else?

1646
01:48:18,665 --> 01:48:20,520
- A butterfly
- Yeah!

1647
01:48:21,305 --> 01:48:23,780
You just have to think of me as a...

1648
01:48:24,505 --> 01:48:27,059
...as off flying somewhere, mhm?

1649
01:48:27,094 --> 01:48:29,614
And, of course, the magician...

1650
01:48:30,145 --> 01:48:31,778
...he knows the secret...

1651
01:48:32,225 --> 01:48:35,223
...that just because you
don't see something...

1652
01:48:36,025 --> 01:48:38,659
...doesn't mean it's not there

1653
01:48:40,985 --> 01:48:42,618
So even though it might

1654
01:48:42,705 --> 01:48:44,338
...seem like I'm gone...

1655
01:48:45,305 --> 01:48:47,336
...the magician knows better

1656
01:48:49,425 --> 01:48:51,138
So where will you be?

1657
01:48:55,865 --> 01:49:00,414
Right here. Right here,
inside the magician

1658
01:49:01,785 --> 01:49:03,703
Can I talk to you when you're there?

1659
01:49:04,025 --> 01:49:05,994
Always. Always, always!...

1660
01:49:06,345 --> 01:49:08,422
You won't hear my voice but...

1661
01:49:08,425 --> 01:49:10,456
...but deep inside...

1662
01:49:10,745 --> 01:49:12,663
...you'll know what I'm saying

1663
01:49:15,385 --> 01:49:16,984
It's not good enough

1664
01:49:20,105 --> 01:49:23,263
Of course it isn't,
because it isn't everything

1665
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:26,474
And we want everything,
don't we? Yeah

1666
01:49:29,025 --> 01:49:31,181
But we still have one thing

1667
01:49:31,305 --> 01:49:34,224
One of our greatest
things we'll always have

1668
01:49:34,225 --> 01:49:36,017
You know what that is?

1669
01:49:37,185 --> 01:49:39,103
Our dreams!

1670
01:49:39,585 --> 01:49:42,379
We can still meet in our dreams!

1671
01:49:42,785 --> 01:49:45,296
We can talk to each
other there and...

1672
01:49:45,545 --> 01:49:48,305
...go for walks together
in the summer...

1673
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:50,143
...and in the winter,
and in the rain...

1674
01:49:50,145 --> 01:49:51,937
...and in the sun, and...

1675
01:49:52,825 --> 01:49:56,461
...I can come and pick
you up and we can go flying

1676
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,860
Nobody's loved you like I do

1677
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:06,178
Nobody ever will

1678
01:50:17,765 --> 01:50:21,418
- Hi. I brought you some tea
- Merry Christmas, baby

1679
01:50:21,425 --> 01:50:23,058
Merry Christmas

1680
01:50:23,785 --> 01:50:26,396
- Look what Mom made me!
- Uau!

1681
01:50:27,825 --> 01:50:29,981
I'll go show Dad and Isabel

1682
01:50:29,985 --> 01:50:31,823
- Here
- Thank you, sweetheart

1683
01:50:33,124 --> 01:50:34,624
Oh, mom...

1684
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:36,242
Will you make sure Dad
knows how to double-knot

1685
01:50:36,243 --> 01:50:39,359
my sneakers... the way you
do for school in the morning?

1686
01:50:40,265 --> 01:50:41,295
Yes

1687
01:50:42,065 --> 01:50:43,459
Thanks

1688
01:50:46,865 --> 01:50:48,384
That's yours

1689
01:50:57,705 --> 01:50:59,304
It's a quilt!

1690
01:50:59,625 --> 01:51:02,703
- And it has our pictures on it
- Put it here

1691
01:51:07,065 --> 01:51:10,659
It's kinda like a scrapbook
you can... keep warm with

1692
01:51:10,785 --> 01:51:13,704
It's... It's so beautiful.
I've never seen anything like it

1693
01:51:13,705 --> 01:51:16,339
See the horse here?
And the medals that you got?

1694
01:51:16,465 --> 01:51:18,221
Remember this? That was the dress...

1695
01:51:18,322 --> 01:51:20,578
...you wouldn't take off
in Pre-K for 3 weeks?

1696
01:51:20,585 --> 01:51:22,013
- Remember that?
- Yeah

1697
01:51:22,305 --> 01:51:24,894
Your first step. Look at your foot

1698
01:51:25,505 --> 01:51:29,220
Look at that little
chubby-cheeked thing. Look at you

1699
01:51:33,705 --> 01:51:35,179
Are you scared?

1700
01:51:36,585 --> 01:51:37,979
A little

1701
01:51:38,985 --> 01:51:42,477
Mostly, I was
scared... for you but...

1702
01:51:42,705 --> 01:51:45,863
...I'm not anymore because I
know you're gonna be okay

1703
01:51:48,585 --> 01:51:52,175
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'm going to miss you so much

1704
01:51:53,025 --> 01:51:55,599
It's okay... Oh, sweety...

1705
01:51:56,225 --> 01:51:58,916
Oh, my sweetie. It's okay

1706
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:02,514
It's okay to miss me. It's okay!

1707
01:52:03,505 --> 01:52:05,184
You can miss me and...

1708
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:07,535
...and you can take me with you

1709
01:52:07,905 --> 01:52:08,901
You can!

1710
01:52:09,105 --> 01:52:11,296
And when you're in trouble...

1711
01:52:11,385 --> 01:52:13,064
...I'll be there, and...

1712
01:52:13,225 --> 01:52:16,064
...when you fall in
love, I'll be there

1713
01:52:16,385 --> 01:52:17,859
You can!

1714
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:21,718
I mean, that's how... people
go on forever, you know...

1715
01:52:21,753 --> 01:52:24,373
...because somebody takes them along

1716
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:27,702
On your graduation and...

1717
01:52:27,745 --> 01:52:29,094
...your wedding and...

1718
01:52:29,145 --> 01:52:31,461
...when you have your babies

1719
01:52:33,625 --> 01:52:35,861
Take me along, will you?

1720
01:52:36,865 --> 01:52:39,260
Always, always and always

1721
01:52:44,065 --> 01:52:46,460
You have made my life...

1722
01:52:46,705 --> 01:52:49,057
...so wonderful

1723
01:52:49,625 --> 01:52:52,020
Take that with you too, okay?

1724
01:53:08,145 --> 01:53:10,415
Wow, Mom! It's so cool!

1725
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:14,061
See what you got there, Ben

1726
01:53:22,065 --> 01:53:24,779
What's the matter?
You look disappointed

1727
01:53:26,105 --> 01:53:28,296
No, everything is great, Mom

1728
01:53:29,305 --> 01:53:30,904
I love my presents

1729
01:53:30,905 --> 01:53:32,220
Hey, guys!

1730
01:53:32,785 --> 01:53:34,577
Looks like we forgot one

1731
01:53:37,065 --> 01:53:39,221
It's got your name on it, buddy

1732
01:53:39,505 --> 01:53:41,218
Abracadabra!

1733
01:53:42,225 --> 01:53:44,955
- What a beautiful cage!
- Si

1734
01:53:46,825 --> 01:53:48,460
It's empty

1735
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:51,299
Let's try it again

1736
01:53:53,225 --> 01:53:54,778
I think maybe this time...

1737
01:53:54,825 --> 01:53:57,380
...you should say the magic words

1738
01:53:57,705 --> 01:54:00,180
Abracadabra! Allakazam!

1739
01:54:00,185 --> 01:54:02,277
Allakazoom... Boom!

1740
01:54:04,105 --> 01:54:05,624
It worked!

1741
01:54:38,585 --> 01:54:42,255
Why doesn't everybody get on
the sofa for a picture, eh?

1742
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:45,658
Baby, can you put that
birdcage on the floor for me?

1743
01:54:49,185 --> 01:54:51,023
And I'll set up here

1744
01:54:57,905 --> 01:55:01,177
On the count of 3... I want
to see big Christmas smiles

1745
01:55:01,225 --> 01:55:02,335
One...

1746
01:55:02,465 --> 01:55:03,399
...two...

1747
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,334
...Benjamin...

1748
01:55:05,625 --> 01:55:06,860
...three

1749
01:55:07,665 --> 01:55:08,900
Excellent

1750
01:55:09,705 --> 01:55:12,461
Good one. Ok, now let's get
one with the whole family

1751
01:55:12,462 --> 01:55:14,062
Isabel?

1752
01:55:19,865 --> 01:55:21,817
Okay. Let me just...

1753
01:55:21,865 --> 01:55:23,857
...reset this

1754
01:55:27,158 --> 01:55:28,858
Get ready!
