1
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:03,804
Commencing data uplink,
establishing connection.

2
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:06,165
Okay.

3
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,266
Beam me to Burma, Scotty.

4
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,608
Satellite online, sir.

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,249
Snowman to Reindeer,
pick a visual on the target.

6
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,389
Roger, Snowman. Target picked.

7
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:33,827
Roger that. We have video confirmation,
and you're coming in 4 by 4.

8
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:02,123
Locking complete.

9
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:03,796
Reindeer, transpo is on.

10
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:05,492
Look at all those poppies.

11
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,993
Travis, I'm almost liking you now.

12
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:10,866
Copy that. Stand by.

13
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,503
Don't move. We got company.

14
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,453
No, sir. Don't go.

15
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,227
Shit!

16
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:50,500
Snowman, this is Reindeer. Hot evac.
Get out of here.

17
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:52,478
Get them out of there.

18
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:18,133
Gray smoke in sight,
approaching extraction point.

19
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:30,978
Go.

20
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:37,285
Come on! Don't run!

21
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,254
The package is in the box. Let's go.

22
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:08,650
You'll be all right.

23
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,554
We live right...

24
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,585
and we die right.

25
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,890
You're not dying, man. You'll be all right.

26
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,157
- You're a lying motherfucker.
- Come on, now.

27
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,892
You're not dying, man.

28
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,898
I gotta lie down, man.

29
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,862
Shit!

30
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:22,048
I will continue working to give Tokyo
and Japan a better future.

31
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:25,709
Vote for me, vote for Takayama.

32
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:30,919
In order to secure our cities and ports,
I intend to enact the legislation...

33
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:36,391
...concerning the deportation of immigrants
with questionable origins.

34
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:42,634
These countries need to understand
that it is necessary to protect our borders.

35
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:55,071
How would you handle foreign residents'
opposition to the new legislation?

36
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,117
All questions should be directed
to my press secretary.

37
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:49,399
To all my brothers,

38
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:53,605
today we stand in front of
Quang Quang, the God of War.

39
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,103
We swear with blood our loyalty to him.

40
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:58,338
When we shed our blood,
we will become family

41
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,540
Whether for good or bad,
we must stick together.

42
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,257
Gentlemen.

43
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,792
Good afternoon.

44
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,197
Well done.

45
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:25,503
I want to toast you on a job well done.

46
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,644
- Cheers to the Governor.
- Cheers.

47
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,478
He's in a better place now.

48
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,388
...we live together and we die together...

49
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:23,863
I am Chinese,
I do not want to serve the Japanese.

50
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:28,231
I refuse to work for you, so I will not swear.

51
00:10:40,147 --> 00:10:41,546
Time to go.

52
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,396
- Block.
- Hi. John Davidson, FBI.

53
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,899
Listen, I'm calling
regarding the governor's assassination.

54
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:07,805
- What about it?
- Well, we need your help.

55
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,507
Johnny, it's local. It's not my party.

56
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,112
We're thinking it's a Yakuza hit...

57
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,207
and we're hoping that you have someone
that has some knowledge in that field.

58
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,512
Yakuza?

59
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,952
Yeah, I've got someone.

60
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,485
You're gonna owe me big for this one.

61
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:27,421
How have you been?

62
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,485
Things are good. How about you?

63
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,258
I've been working very hard.

64
00:11:33,334 --> 00:11:34,733
So have I.

65
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:39,705
So here it is, swords of this caliber
don't come up for sale anymore.

66
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,817
I would pay twice this amount
for instruction from you.

67
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,445
I'm afraid I'm not a teacher.

68
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,422
There is no one else as good as you.

69
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:01,290
That isn't true at all, I just sell swords.

70
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:05,387
But I heard a legend
that you cut off a man's arm in a duel.

71
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,523
No, that's just foolish.

72
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:12,361
But you have the skills of old masters.

73
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:18,136
Listen, I wouldn't encourage fighting.
Excuse me for a second.

74
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,338
Hello.

75
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:21,607
Travis?

76
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:23,848
Guess who.

77
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:36,852
Sir.

78
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,360
Hello?

79
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:45,928
Okay, baby, I need you and your team
up on him the second he leaves here.

80
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,530
All the usual assets?

81
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,235
- Of course, baby, anything you need.
- Good.

82
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:53,310
I'll be in touch. And don't call me "baby."

83
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:03,916
That would be meant for me.

84
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,118
- You two know each other?
- Yeah.

85
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:08,322
For a long time.

86
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:11,321
But I'm assigning you to him for right now.

87
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,326
Just try to stay with him.

88
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,163
And keep me posted.

89
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:22,405
Didn't take you that long to get here.

90
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,576
Yeah, I was in the area.

91
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:28,209
In a nutshell,
the Governor made a lot of enemies...

92
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:32,417
when he stated his plan to begin
the deportation of certain people.

93
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:33,919
So why are we involved?

94
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,114
The FBI feels sure it's terrorist related.

95
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,249
That makes it a concern
for the United States.

96
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:41,123
We have intel that the local Yakuza...

97
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,823
have been farming themselves out
for some reason.

98
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,990
I've been in this game a long time.

99
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:50,093
Doesn't make sense to me that
the Yakuza would be involved in politics.

100
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,001
Anything is possible.

101
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,867
Yeah, I suppose so.

102
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,168
That's why I brought you in, big papa.

103
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,837
Nobody knows the bad guys like you do.

104
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:01,676
But with homeland security,
the FBI is on board.

105
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,147
I'm aware.

106
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,654
I'll gather some intel, feed it back to you,
and you can give it to them.

107
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,916
You know, life is never that simple.

108
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,094
This is Agent Mac.

109
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:18,631
He's going to be working with you.

110
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,991
- How do you do, Agent Mac?
- I'm good, thank you.

111
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,436
- And what do you do?
- I'm an FBI field agent.

112
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:29,237
So in the event
that there really is terrorist involvement...

113
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:33,669
why don't you have the FBI
put together a special response team...

114
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,976
and get this boy a gun.

115
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,384
Always great seeing you, Travis.

116
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:44,114
That went well.

117
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:53,590
The shooter exited
on a sport bike going East.

118
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:55,863
FBI.

119
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,172
It was quick. It was loud.
It just came out of nowhere.

120
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,299
Welcome to the crime scene.

121
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,671
- Travis.
- Hello, Inspector.

122
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:07,475
I need copies
of all the physical evidence here.

123
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:08,707
Sure.

124
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:12,810
Immediately, I want copies
of all the surveillance tapes.

125
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:14,814
- You hear?
- Okay.

126
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,187
So this is the security tape
for the government's incident?

127
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,892
Guy on the right. Little bit closer.

128
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,993
See that gold emblem on his neck?

129
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,128
See if you can come real close on that
for me.

130
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:33,901
- I wanna take a look at that.
- Okay, I got you.

131
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,066
- How about that?
- Okay.

132
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:40,635
Not only do these guys look Chinese,
but that one's Quang Quang.

133
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,877
These guys are Tongs.

134
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,747
I've got somebody I've gotta go talk to.

135
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,809
- Can you get me a copy of this?
- Yeah, sure.

136
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,442
Dai-Ryu, it's been a long time.
Please sit down.

137
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,815
What a surprise.
You look younger and taller.

138
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,814
And I see
you're still reading the same old books.

139
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:22,617
Just a simple man passing the time.

140
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,215
Tell me, what brings you today?

141
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:30,029
I've heard a rumor about an alliance
between the Tongs and the Yakuza.

142
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:34,500
I have a little problem with the Yakuza,
but I don't want one with the Tongs.

143
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,934
So I was wondering
if you'd talk to them for me.

144
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:38,198
Yakuza.

145
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:41,706
I heard the rumors in the street.

146
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,270
I'll help you.

147
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:47,074
I'll talk with them
and I'll make sure they leave the situation.

148
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,039
Wait.

149
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:53,419
Since you surprised me...

150
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,278
I'm going to surprise you. Mei Ling.

151
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,228
Look who has returned.

152
00:17:03,664 --> 00:17:04,926
Master.

153
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,196
- Her skills have much improved.
- She's gotten big.

154
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,897
She's been my shield. Now she's yours.

155
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,537
Okay. I'll see you soon.

156
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:43,600
Chen and I have been in business
for two years.

157
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,265
He told me you have
a sophisticated distribution network.

158
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:49,600
Yes.

159
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,474
With his pachinko parlors
and my fish business...

160
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,106
we can round the cash into US dollars...

161
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:01,385
and ship product everywhere
almost unnoticed.

162
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,891
What can I do for you?

163
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:13,089
Golden Triangle.

164
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:23,033
So we're meeting a Zaibatsu,
a leader in the banking world.

165
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,102
- But who are we?
- Obviously you're not a federal agent.

166
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,409
Obviously I'm not a federal agent.

167
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,246
Nobody knows what we do,
and that's better.

168
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:35,277
I want you to just play a role for me.
You're my martial arts student.

169
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:39,052
You're a fish out of water, trying to learn
how to swim and that will be that.

170
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:09,115
If it's okay, I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions...

171
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,090
about the local problems going on here.

172
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,623
Do you think there's any possibility...

173
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,062
that the Tongs and the Yakuza
are getting into big business?

174
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:25,136
A new generation of Yakuza
is starting to interfere with our business.

175
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:34,012
One of our executives
was assassinated yesterday.

176
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:40,449
There were rules Yakuza respected
and followed in the past.

177
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:44,655
Obviously, these rules do not apply
to the new generation.

178
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:51,219
It would make sense for us to assist you.

179
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:57,262
I will assist you in any way possible.

180
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,934
Thank you so much, Sensei.
I was hoping you'd say that.

181
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,975
That's why I came. Thank you.

182
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,215
Take a look...

183
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:20,119
Beautiful women can often lead you to bliss.

184
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:48,881
Sensei, please excuse me.

185
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,392
- Travis.
- Yeah?

186
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:02,228
How's it going?

187
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:04,029
Peachy keen.

188
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,109
Hold them longer.

189
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,274
Of course.

190
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:21,679
Good.

191
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:24,884
So, young man...

192
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,019
you are his deshi?

193
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,629
Deshi?

194
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:33,097
His student.

195
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,099
Yes, student.

196
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:38,636
What have you studied?

197
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,805
Kendo?

198
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:43,935
Lyai.

199
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,869
Kendo.

200
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:49,938
Oh, yeah.

201
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,082
What school?

202
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:57,445
School?

203
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,223
UCLA.

204
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:05,795
Go, Bruins.

205
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,594
What have you got?

206
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:12,399
Jahto, look up the word.
Tongs and Yakuza are working together.

207
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:14,637
Got something for you.

208
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,743
Be patient and leave me alone, all right?

209
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,743
You have to understand something. A high
government official was just assassinated.

210
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:30,381
It's only natural
that Intelligence would assume...

211
00:22:30,457 --> 00:22:32,015
terrorism may have been involved.

212
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:34,925
So the Agency is gonna watch us
until they decide...

213
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,429
how the situation should turn out.

214
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,563
- What, they decide?
- That's right.

215
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:45,135
80% of the CIA's activity
goes to disinformation.

216
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:47,435
They pay close attention to the situation...

217
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:49,771
and in the end
they'll decide what happened...

218
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:52,073
in order to fit their agenda.

219
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,185
I'm gonna pull over here,
I want you to jump in...

220
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,346
take the driver's seat and drive.

221
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,186
Go north,
then swing back around and pick me up.

222
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,522
- 15 minutes, you hear?
- Yes, sir.

223
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:45,026
Nayako-san, you look so beautiful today.

224
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,758
These walls have many ears.

225
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:49,961
Yeah, I know.

226
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:52,061
But I'm always happy to see you.

227
00:23:55,108 --> 00:23:58,908
Actually, I wanted to see
if you could get any information...

228
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,970
on the assassination of the Governor.

229
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:02,537
Where should I look?

230
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:05,276
I don't know if you know anybody...

231
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:08,150
that has a good connection
with the Yakuza?

232
00:24:09,522 --> 00:24:11,251
There is a tattoo artist.

233
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:14,655
He is an old friend of my family.

234
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:18,762
He knows a lot about the Yakuza.
I'll call him.

235
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:23,263
I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear from you.

236
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:26,328
So, I love you. You be good.

237
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,741
- Where is he?
- He's leaving Fusion.

238
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:36,281
- What's a fusion?
- Fusion is Nayako's club.

239
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,651
Good, she's an asset of his.

240
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,018
Move it, move it.

241
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:20,181
Ten thousand dollars.

242
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,556
Now Kojima can't touch us.

243
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,632
We're gonna
just jump into this little kissaten here.

244
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,406
Watch where you're walking, asshole!

245
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:42,637
Sorry.

246
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:43,907
Fucking round eyes!

247
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:50,949
Don't fuck with me, man.

248
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:54,149
May I take your order?

249
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,459
Two cervezas, por favor.

250
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,761
Can you give me a second?

251
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:08,807
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Why're you taking me to all these places?

252
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,673
This is my neighborhood, I grew up here.
That's the truth.

253
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,405
- No bullshit.
- Yeah.

254
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,386
That's great.

255
00:26:21,654 --> 00:26:25,146
But what does this have to do
with the Governor's assassination?

256
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,591
This neighborhood is the neighborhood...

257
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,187
where all organized crime
gathers and does their thing.

258
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:33,660
We got Tongs, we got Yakuza.

259
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:37,100
All kinds of organized crime,
they are all centralized here.

260
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,502
There is major struggle for turf.

261
00:26:40,306 --> 00:26:42,297
Major struggle for power.

262
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:45,173
Most of that power comes from heroin.

263
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:48,306
- Or as we call it here, Shabu.
- Shabu.

264
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:50,212
- Yeah.
- So...

265
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:58,615
Now you see, here's a perfect example.
Our little Yakuza friend is back.

266
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:02,058
Only this time, it seems like
he's got two Chinese boys with him.

267
00:27:02,128 --> 00:27:03,220
That's strange.

268
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,856
You would have never have seen that
10 years ago.

269
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:08,628
Will you excuse me for just one second?

270
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,226
You aren't ready for a fight yet.

271
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,867
You want to fight, come back in 10 years.

272
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,737
Please tell me you're kidding.
You didn't just have an AD.

273
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,574
- Sorry, that was an accident.
- Are you out of your mind?

274
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:55,614
- I got excited.
- You got excited?

275
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:58,378
I've never seen or heard of such a thing.

276
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,819
Look who's here.

277
00:28:01,988 --> 00:28:04,923
You're a cop, you deal with them.
I don't exist.

278
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,414
Fuck!

279
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:13,666
One quick call to my boss,
and everything is gonna be A-okay.

280
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,257
A-okay?

281
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:18,500
I need Block now.

282
00:28:18,838 --> 00:28:20,829
What the fuck did he do?

283
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:25,602
Three Yakuza injured and two Chinese
hanging out in Intensive Care?

284
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:28,413
You should have seen him. God, he's fast.

285
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,642
You fired a weapon in public.

286
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:34,678
Shit like that could destroy
everything we have with Japan.

287
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,688
Sorry, that was an accident.

288
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,280
Listen to this.

289
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,694
American version of the current government
is not acceptable.

290
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,755
We'll continue to use force
until our demands are met.

291
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,825
You're clearly moving
in the wrong direction.

292
00:28:49,902 --> 00:28:51,836
Has the lab heard this? What did they say?

293
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,428
We're working on it.

294
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:56,373
What makes you think
we're moving in the wrong direction?

295
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:59,878
This, for all we know, could be an attempt
to mislead us. We don't know.

296
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:04,212
So, if you don't mind, I'd like to go
to the lab and check it out myself.

297
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:06,681
- Go.
- Thank you.

298
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:13,516
Hello.

299
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:14,753
I'm Dai-Ryu.

300
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,188
Sensei is waiting for you.

301
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,931
I'm Dai-Ryu. Nayako sent me here.

302
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,163
So you must be Travis-san.

303
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:29,799
Please come this way.

304
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:30,934
Thank you.

305
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,979
So what is it that you want to know.

306
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:39,349
From my Nayako I've heard a lot about you.

307
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:41,887
She says you know a lot about the Yakuza.

308
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:45,490
I try to keep a low profile.

309
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,392
Check out Kuroda.

310
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:51,291
Kuroda.

311
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:55,433
Apparently, he made a pact with the Chinese
Tongs to monopolize the drug trade.

312
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:58,732
It seems like if this Kuroda
has that much strength...

313
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,239
and a direct connection with Myanmar...

314
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:06,003
maybe he can eat all the other families
and take over.

315
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:10,874
There is only one Yakuza player

316
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,646
who is capable of defeating Kuroda,
his name is Kojima.

317
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,184
But Kojima's boss is too old,
spending much of his time in his garden.

318
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,593
He doesn't care about the current turf war.

319
00:30:23,062 --> 00:30:26,691
This Kojima guy,
is there any way you could maybe...

320
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:28,893
get me a meeting with him?

321
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:31,000
If you want.

322
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,808
As long as I have total access to Burma...

323
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:41,909
the Tongs are welcome to grow and prosper
anywhere I have business.

324
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:45,145
Together we win Japan.

325
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:46,783
And eventually...

326
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:49,643
America.

327
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,787
Don't worry, it happens to the best of us.

328
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,992
Go inside, kid.

329
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,626
Are you ready to be a man?

330
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:49,913
My behavior...

331
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,718
at the street market was unforgivable.

332
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:56,920
My shame is beyond what I can describe.

333
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:00,117
Please accept this as a token...

334
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:02,859
of my regret.

335
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,294
You're crazy.

336
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,229
Not at all.

337
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,206
Thank you for coming.

338
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:03,445
Clean it up.

339
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,817
Travis, they serve hamburgers here?

340
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,293
Stop talking shit.

341
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,060
I'm just going to wait outside.

342
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,737
You found yourself a new deshi.

343
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:58,604
What's up, dog?

344
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:01,142
Yeah, don't worry about it.

345
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:09,186
May I?

346
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:13,984
Yes, please.

347
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,954
So you are Dai-Ryu san.

348
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,590
Yes, some people call me that.

349
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:51,660
So tell me your story.

350
00:34:55,635 --> 00:35:00,572
I've heard that people respect you
for your integrity in the Yakuza world.

351
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,139
I heard the same about you.

352
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:10,981
Actually, we have other things in common.

353
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:16,077
You want to get rid of Kuroda...

354
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,855
...and I feel the same.

355
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,868
Kuroda wishes
to send a message to Kojima.

356
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:38,170
Time to die.

357
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:48,912
I have a good reason to kill Kuroda.

358
00:35:50,322 --> 00:35:51,550
Heroin trade?

359
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:53,653
That's not all.

360
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,996
Listen, I live as a Yakuza...

361
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:03,860
...and I chose my destiny.

362
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,934
I grew up in this city, in the chaos
and devastation that followed the war.

363
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:17,780
People were living in despair
and struggling in darkness.

364
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:27,552
It was a tragedy.

365
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,890
So, tell me about your boss in there.

366
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:37,357
Boss?

367
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,769
Yeah, your boss. Who you work for.
Tell me about him.

368
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,239
- Boss?
- Never mind.

369
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:46,907
Now fifty years later,
the Yakuza has changed.

370
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:53,483
The younger Yakuza completely ignore
our rules and tradition of "Jingi".

371
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:59,547
These scumbags live for nothing but money.

372
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,690
And, by aligning themselves
with foreigners,

373
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:10,259
they're becoming too powerful.

374
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,230
I won't tolerate their existence.

375
00:37:18,644 --> 00:37:23,581
It'll be interesting to see
who will get Kuroda first, you or I.

376
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:30,454
That's right. It will be a contest between us.

377
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,482
Thank you.

378
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,220
Excuse me.

379
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:48,130
Kuroda sends his love.

380
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:15,031
Good morning, darling.

381
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,397
Good morning, my darling.

382
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,396
Here it is.

383
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,166
But I can't do this, can I?

384
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,105
No, you can't do this.

385
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:26,104
It's just like it always is.

386
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,113
You stay safe
and you protect your anonymity.

387
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:30,580
I understand.

388
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,650
See you in a while.

389
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:34,709
Okay. Bye.

390
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,122
Sit.

391
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,313
So, what's the problem?

392
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,054
What is this?

393
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:48,116
Some girl dropped it off.

394
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,940
Kuroda, this is a warning...

395
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:20,415
A mystery man sending me a letter...

396
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,025
at your place.

397
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,559
Strange.

398
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:39,869
Hello?

399
00:40:40,012 --> 00:40:41,001
It's me.

400
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,739
Keep an eye out for Kojima's men.

401
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:48,350
Get ready.

402
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:52,519
I'd like to stay. But I must go.

403
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:55,216
I have other things to take care of.

404
00:41:16,081 --> 00:41:18,606
I'm sorry I asked you to come so suddenly.

405
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,643
I just had some things
I really wanted to talk to you about.

406
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:27,590
I came as fast as I could.
Let's walk a little bit.

407
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,225
Let's sit here.

408
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,287
I wanna talk to you. Come, sit.

409
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,489
What is it?

410
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,999
You know...

411
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,034
I've never had the best luck with women.

412
00:41:38,103 --> 00:41:40,333
In fact, you could probably say...

413
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:42,798
I haven't had any luck at all.

414
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,704
But for the first time in my life...

415
00:41:49,114 --> 00:41:51,639
I found somebody that I really love.

416
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,186
Is that a proposal?

417
00:41:56,088 --> 00:41:57,851
You can call it a proposal.

418
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:00,153
Yes, I'm proposing to you.

419
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:04,320
I am so pleased to hear that.

420
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,688
So I guess that means yes.

421
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:14,228
The only reason why I have
been doing this job is to help you.

422
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,902
I have been hiding my feeling from you.

423
00:42:19,545 --> 00:42:21,570
I'm very sorry...

424
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:26,709
and all I can do is promise you a better life.
I'm gonna quit this right away.

425
00:42:26,785 --> 00:42:29,982
One last piece of work, that's it,
and then I'm finished.

426
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:34,092
I'll go wherever you decide to go.

427
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,826
Together, we'll find some place
really beautiful and quiet...

428
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:42,396
and lead a great life together.

429
00:42:42,835 --> 00:42:46,703
I'll go wherever you want.

430
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:51,637
Promise?

431
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:54,468
Promise me...

432
00:42:54,913 --> 00:42:56,346
...let's do Yubikiri vow.

433
00:42:56,815 --> 00:43:01,718
Yubikiri, this I vow. If you ever break it,
I'll make you drink one thousand needles.

434
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,022
Yubi-kitta!

435
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,053
Hai.

436
00:44:08,887 --> 00:44:10,218
What can I do for you?

437
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:14,225
I come to you on behalf of a friend
who had the incident at the street market.

438
00:44:14,293 --> 00:44:16,727
I ask you as a favor
that you remove yourself...

439
00:44:16,795 --> 00:44:19,229
from this incident's possible reprisal.

440
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,298
Sit down, please.

441
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,942
- Hi.
- Hey.

442
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,877
You know the guy
that put our guys in the hospital?

443
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:37,074
He's an American.

444
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:39,914
The American at the street market?

445
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,543
Yeah, he wants a truce.

446
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,520
Sounds like a problem to me.

447
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:45,352
That's what I think.

448
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,653
He seems to want an answer right now.

449
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,427
- Okay, take care of it.
- No problem.

450
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:06,376
Chill!

451
00:45:10,816 --> 00:45:12,078
Turn it off.

452
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:20,549
There is an American
asking about my business.

453
00:45:21,193 --> 00:45:22,683
American?

454
00:45:23,562 --> 00:45:26,030
An American that grew up in Japan.

455
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,263
He's been talking to Yakuza dinosaurs
like Kojima.

456
00:45:32,437 --> 00:45:34,997
Apparently, he is a sword master.

457
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:39,037
A sword master?

458
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:44,705
Is everything okay with the governor's case?

459
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,290
There are no sword fights
in this day and age.

460
00:45:57,896 --> 00:46:00,797
But, it would be good
if I learned how to use a sword.

461
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:03,864
Maybe from this American.

462
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,245
A fight is won not by technique...

463
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,153
...but by the most furious mind.

464
00:46:40,072 --> 00:46:42,006
Take it easy, boss.

465
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:49,412
How about going to the club and relaxing?

466
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:57,311
That sounds good. Let's pick up some girls.

467
00:47:02,928 --> 00:47:05,419
You two go, I need to think.

468
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,932
Why do you think I've been sucking up
to the Chinese for?

469
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,136
I'm getting close...

470
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:24,173
...so close to getting everything
I ever wanted.

471
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:28,415
Now I have an American snooping around?

472
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,485
I told you two to go!

473
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:37,929
Let me introduce to you
the hottest girl in this club.

474
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:42,457
Let me introduce to you
the hottest girl in this club.

475
00:47:43,602 --> 00:47:46,332
Check out her fishnet stockings.

476
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:16,794
Travis, do you know this man?

477
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,924
Yes, I do.

478
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,061
Travis, sorry for interrupting you.

479
00:48:26,244 --> 00:48:28,940
It's kind of a sudden visit, isn't it?
Is everything okay?

480
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,538
Watch yourself.

481
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:34,317
You've been asking a lot of questions
on the street.

482
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:35,646
Now...

483
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,920
the street is starting
to ask questions about you.

484
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:44,624
Thanks for the warning.

485
00:48:44,696 --> 00:48:47,995
There is an abandoned hotel
at the edge of town.

486
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,664
We monitored it for the last few weeks.

487
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:56,268
Kuroda's assassins are living
on the second floor.

488
00:48:56,341 --> 00:48:58,935
It may be a place of interest to you.

489
00:48:59,044 --> 00:49:02,138
Thank you for that intel,
it's very nice of you.

490
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:14,121
Is that a croissant on your head?

491
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,485
- How are you?
- Fine.

492
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:22,126
Everything's going good here?

493
00:49:22,868 --> 00:49:25,428
I bought this for you.

494
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,939
It's a beautiful antique,
It's from the Edo Period.

495
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:30,902
Geishas have used this...

496
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:34,139
and I thought of you
because you wear a kimono so nicely.

497
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,941
It's beautiful...

498
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,039
...thank you.

499
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:39,811
I will treasure it forever.

500
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:41,811
Thank you.

501
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,883
Here is a singing Robo-Cop.

502
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,231
- Travis.
- That's okay.

503
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:07,745
I'm so sorry to bother you,
but check this out. Nice to meet you.

504
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:10,212
I just got off the phone
with the guys from the lab.

505
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:13,513
Turns out
that the tape was made at a fish market.

506
00:50:13,585 --> 00:50:16,145
Skigi, something like that.
Maybe that rings a bell.

507
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:20,157
But all that background noise
apparently just gave the whole thing away.

508
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,891
It would have been nice
if you had called me. I'm here, I'm busy.

509
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,321
I'm in the middle of something.

510
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:32,235
Sorry about that.
But I figured, being partners...

511
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:34,670
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

512
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,764
You go over there to the fish market...

513
00:50:36,841 --> 00:50:39,241
do some surveillance, take some pictures...

514
00:50:39,311 --> 00:50:42,940
long-lens, remote stuff.
Don't be seen, and if it's good...

515
00:50:43,448 --> 00:50:45,643
- call me.
- Okay, cool.

516
00:50:45,884 --> 00:50:47,545
And no more ADs.

517
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,085
Nice to meet you.

518
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:55,259
He's young, you know.

519
00:51:11,876 --> 00:51:14,276
"Do some remote stuff with a long-lens...

520
00:51:14,346 --> 00:51:17,042
"take some pictures at the fish market."

521
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,208
What does he think I am, a rookie?

522
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:21,279
I hate this shit.

523
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:24,932
No guns. Put the guns away.

524
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:28,269
- Hands up.
- Okay.

525
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,846
I'm an inspector. Move over here.

526
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,948
Come on, move over here. Back the fuck up.

527
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,747
Chill, surfer dude!

528
00:53:36,821 --> 00:53:39,051
I don't speak your language, motherfucker.

529
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:43,290
You're in a lot of trouble. Big trouble.

530
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:45,921
I gotta report to my boss
and you're not gonna like that.

531
00:53:45,997 --> 00:53:47,862
- You are dead.
- Really?

532
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,730
I don't exist. All right?

533
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:53,164
It's a show time.

534
00:54:57,368 --> 00:54:58,357
Taxi!

535
00:55:29,634 --> 00:55:31,625
I'm on to something here.

536
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,835
I found where the tape was made.
It's a fish-packing warehouse.

537
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:38,398
And get this, I found a finger...

538
00:55:38,476 --> 00:55:40,842
a severed pinkie finger
wrapped in a piece of silk.

539
00:55:40,912 --> 00:55:43,176
I told you, "Do not go in there."

540
00:55:43,248 --> 00:55:45,079
I told you "remote surveillance."

541
00:55:45,149 --> 00:55:48,118
You know what remote surveillance means?
What is wrong with you?

542
00:55:48,186 --> 00:55:51,485
If you get yourself killed on my watch,
I'll kill you again.

543
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:53,247
The battery's dying.

544
00:55:53,324 --> 00:55:56,122
I found a piece of paper with an address.

545
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:59,789
It's like an invoice or something.
I'm going to go check that out.

546
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:08,263
Where's he going?

547
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:11,797
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say he's headed for the Ginza.

548
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,221
Is he in an apartment building?

549
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,522
Yeah. Our apartment building.

550
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:06,662
How does he know she's there?

551
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:15,836
You're not as sharp as you used to be.

552
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:19,673
Sharp enough for you.

553
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,747
You'd have kind of disappointed me
if I'd got the drop on you.

554
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,842
That's never gonna happen.

555
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:29,551
You think?

556
00:57:31,422 --> 00:57:33,720
I like you much better like this.

557
00:57:34,459 --> 00:57:36,859
I like the delivery boy myself.

558
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,056
The delivery boy was good.
It was a very sexy touch.

559
00:57:41,399 --> 00:57:44,334
Why is Block having me
follow you around Japan?

560
00:57:44,402 --> 00:57:48,168
United States government is always
particularly fascinated in any enterprise...

561
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,606
that could maybe bring income
to their enemies.

562
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,205
Why don't I go put on
something more appropriate...

563
00:57:58,282 --> 00:58:00,307
and then we'll go to the office?

564
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:05,413
And don't look at my ass.

565
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:29,208
Do you like takoyaki?

566
00:58:30,615 --> 00:58:32,810
Let's go for a little drive.

567
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:36,643
Open the fucking door.

568
00:58:45,496 --> 00:58:48,488
- What the fuck do you want?
- What do you want...

569
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,429
Mr. FBI?

570
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:56,163
Are you looking for this?

571
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:04,503
Fuck you.

572
00:59:07,051 --> 00:59:08,541
All right. Easy.

573
00:59:09,854 --> 00:59:12,015
Let's all take it easy here.

574
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:16,326
What the fuck are you looking at, smiley?

575
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:19,624
- Who, me?
- Yeah, fuck you!

576
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:22,391
Fuck me?

577
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,008
Come on.

578
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,354
Fuck me?

579
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:57,423
Chen, are you crazy?

580
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:59,866
Yeah, I'm crazy.

581
01:00:04,942 --> 01:00:06,034
Come on.

582
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:16,579
My guess is the Governor's assassination
was a ruse by Kuroda...

583
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,519
to divert attention from him.

584
01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:19,578
What's this all about?

585
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,820
This gives him a major alliance
between the Yakuza and the Tongs...

586
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:26,728
so that they could get a direct link
for the heroin out of Burma.

587
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:30,027
This is Kuroda's renovated temple
just outside of Tokyo.

588
01:00:33,938 --> 01:00:35,269
No one's seen the kid.

589
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:38,001
That's because you had no surveillance
at the fish market.

590
01:00:38,075 --> 01:00:40,100
He ain't around, and he's assigned to you.

591
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,669
He's still working for me.
I got him taking plates...

592
01:00:42,747 --> 01:00:44,271
and photographs. He'll be fine.

593
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:45,645
That's fine. In the meantime...

594
01:00:45,716 --> 01:00:48,617
will you please tell me
what you have got on the Yakuza?

595
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,177
- I'm working on that.
- Good. I'm glad.

596
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:16,944
Kojima, this is a friend. Kuroda will kill you.

597
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:19,742
Who's this?

598
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:23,583
Listen to me, time is running out.

599
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,215
Travis, thank you for telling me.

600
01:01:57,355 --> 01:01:59,255
That's what I thought.

601
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:02,785
Thank you.

602
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,010
Get the door.

603
01:03:01,252 --> 01:03:03,982
I can't put up
with that bastard Kuroda anymore.

604
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:08,181
We've already lost five people this month.

605
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:13,696
We are in danger
of losing our control, boss.

606
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:19,498
That bastard's involvement
with the Chinese makes it worse.

607
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:36,415
Boss, we are on the verge
of being wiped out.

608
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:39,047
I strongly request your consent.

609
01:03:40,324 --> 01:03:45,261
For 60 years, I've been through hell
in this business.

610
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,925
On the verge of survival?

611
01:03:52,303 --> 01:03:57,172
We've been there before.
Don't lose your head now.

612
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:03,412
Boss, Kuroda conspires with the Chinese

613
01:04:03,848 --> 01:04:08,751
and parades around
with the fortune he's amassed.

614
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:16,426
With his staggering success,
he is expanding into a huge organization.

615
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:22,993
We have to take action before it's too late.

616
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,569
Boss!

617
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:45,043
Kojima says goodbye.

618
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:03,729
Holy cow.

619
01:05:18,189 --> 01:05:19,520
What the hell?

620
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:21,351
Call Kuroda.

621
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:39,700
Some happened here.

622
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,544
They've all been killed... by sword.

623
01:05:44,782 --> 01:05:46,079
It looks like Kojima's work.

624
01:05:46,183 --> 01:05:49,448
This cannot go unpunished.

625
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:55,719
We start at the top with Ishikawa.

626
01:06:02,032 --> 01:06:03,465
That bastard, Kojima.

627
01:06:15,045 --> 01:06:16,273
Relax.

628
01:06:18,749 --> 01:06:19,909
Trust me.

629
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:21,816
Trust you?

630
01:06:22,753 --> 01:06:25,119
Why? You got me into this shit.

631
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,521
You broke the agent's neck.

632
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:38,495
Are you prepared to take of the American
if I take care of Kojima's boss?

633
01:06:39,136 --> 01:06:40,194
Yes.

634
01:06:42,072 --> 01:06:43,369
Fuck you!

635
01:07:27,618 --> 01:07:28,676
Yo, Bonsai fart.

636
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:31,345
What is it?

637
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,299
Time to go.

638
01:07:57,181 --> 01:07:59,308
The reason why I came here is to inform you

639
01:07:59,383 --> 01:08:01,874
my American friend
would like a meeting with you.

640
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,650
Alright.

641
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:21,170
You have woken the sleeping giant.

642
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:28,174
No, I promise.
I didn't tell Kojima people about you.

643
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,748
You fucking liar.

644
01:08:37,021 --> 01:08:38,352
Get up all of you.

645
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:41,413
Go, get out!

646
01:08:47,965 --> 01:08:50,365
Do you want to swing by
Nayako's club, Fusion?

647
01:08:56,674 --> 01:09:00,440
Yeah, that's a good idea.

648
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:10,513
Hey, Travis.

649
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:43,551
Welcome to Fusion.

650
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:46,984
Please have a seat. Please.

651
01:09:53,964 --> 01:09:56,296
You haven't forgotten about us, have you?

652
01:09:56,734 --> 01:10:00,329
What are you talking about? You are
some of my most important customers.

653
01:10:24,695 --> 01:10:26,822
Why are you so nervous?

654
01:10:29,233 --> 01:10:30,791
Hurry up and get our drinks.

655
01:10:32,336 --> 01:10:33,894
Would you excuse me?

656
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:37,867
Bring drinks for this table.

657
01:10:43,347 --> 01:10:44,678
Hi, Fudomyo-O. These are Tongs.

658
01:10:44,748 --> 01:10:46,511
I don't want to put you in the middle...

659
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,574
but when I signal you,
you'll know what to do.

660
01:10:48,652 --> 01:10:52,486
Mei Ling, you set up the meeting.
You come with me, handle the Chinese.

661
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,105
In the back.

662
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:44,829
How did it go?

663
01:12:47,804 --> 01:12:49,169
Good job.

664
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:07,747
- What are you doing here?
- Little mistake.

665
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:37,416
Why did you come here?

666
01:13:37,487 --> 01:13:40,581
You should show him more respect.
He is a friend of Master Cheung.

667
01:13:42,659 --> 01:13:45,492
I have no problem with the Yakuza
here in Tokyo...

668
01:13:45,862 --> 01:13:49,263
but I thought it'd be better
if I didn't have a problem with the Tongs.

669
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,801
- But I'll leave that up to you.
- So?

670
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:53,996
We have Nayako.

671
01:13:55,005 --> 01:13:56,199
Really?

672
01:13:57,107 --> 01:14:00,167
If you have her, for your sake...

673
01:14:00,844 --> 01:14:02,539
I hope she's okay.

674
01:15:19,756 --> 01:15:23,055
We found Nayako. She's dead.

675
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:35,293
Listen, I'm going after Kuroda tonight.
I will finish them or die trying.

676
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:43,576
If you feel the same as I do,
I will not stop you from following me.

677
01:15:43,647 --> 01:15:45,478
Otherwise, I will understand.

678
01:15:46,783 --> 01:15:49,308
Nayako was a close friend of mine.

679
01:15:49,386 --> 01:15:53,220
When I lost my family,
she was very kind to me.

680
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:59,028
What about your search for the men
that killed your family?

681
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:05,760
I know who killed my family.

682
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:10,366
Kuroda.

683
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:19,772
No one is fiercer than someone
who has nothing to live for.

684
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:24,819
What about her?

685
01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:32,459
I can't have her death on my conscience.
She will stay here.

686
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:40,566
This one is so sharp.

687
01:16:42,405 --> 01:16:45,897
I'll have to use this tonight.

688
01:16:46,343 --> 01:16:48,538
This kills very well.

689
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:02,615
Okay, find Travis.

690
01:17:02,726 --> 01:17:04,660
Using PLER to locate the asset.

691
01:17:06,029 --> 01:17:07,394
Come on.

692
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:09,164
He's in a car.

693
01:17:09,432 --> 01:17:11,900
- Where now?
- Heading east out of town.

694
01:17:24,915 --> 01:17:27,145
I see, alright.

695
01:17:30,587 --> 01:17:32,316
Chen is dead.

696
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:37,024
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

697
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:05,914
To my American bitch.

698
01:18:11,861 --> 01:18:13,226
Time to kill the American.

699
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,919
Why don't we sneak in the back?

700
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:42,652
'Cause I'm not in the mood for surprises.

701
01:18:42,726 --> 01:18:45,354
I'm going right in the goddamn front door.

702
01:19:36,846 --> 01:19:38,973
What the fuck are you doing here?

703
01:19:39,049 --> 01:19:41,847
I'm just visiting the temple to pray.

704
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:45,913
Bring it on!

705
01:19:52,629 --> 01:19:53,960
Are you the one...

706
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:56,260
...who killed Nayako?

707
01:20:01,771 --> 01:20:02,863
You are dead.

708
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:08,243
Don't fuck with the Japanese, dude!

709
01:20:08,478 --> 01:20:10,139
I shall beat you to death.

710
01:20:20,223 --> 01:20:21,588
See you in hell.

711
01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:54,455
Idiot! I told you not to come.

712
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,586
Do you want to die that badly?

713
01:20:57,127 --> 01:20:59,891
I swore to fight with you
and die next to you.

714
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,958
Hey... Thanks.

715
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,149
Yo, punk.

716
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:30,485
Who are you?

717
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,549
Bring it on!

718
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:32,821
What is this?

719
01:21:32,962 --> 01:21:33,951
Sushi.

720
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:35,963
You guys really eat this crap?

721
01:21:38,368 --> 01:21:40,097
Are these your chopsticks?

722
01:22:05,028 --> 01:22:07,690
Now, she is too hot to kill...

723
01:22:11,601 --> 01:22:15,367
I've come to kill you.

724
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,265
I couldn't sleep well,
knowing I hadn't chopped off your balls yet.

725
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:23,838
Take your sword.
Let's settle our unfinished business.

726
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:25,872
Yeah, right!

727
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:49,168
I want you.

728
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,080
You're turning me on, girl.

729
01:23:10,426 --> 01:23:12,121
Kiss me, please.

730
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:30,769
You son of a bitch.

731
01:23:32,215 --> 01:23:34,115
Oh, too bad, no revenge.

732
01:23:49,532 --> 01:23:51,056
Now watch this.

733
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,910
You alright?

734
01:24:11,988 --> 01:24:13,580
I just got a new tattoo.

735
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:16,153
Finish him!

736
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,898
Looking for your friend?

737
01:24:25,902 --> 01:24:28,029
Why are you hiding in here?

738
01:24:30,373 --> 01:24:32,534
You're making me laugh, my American bitch.

739
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:34,003
Fuck you!

740
01:24:34,877 --> 01:24:37,607
What the fuck is an American doing,
swinging around a sword?

741
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,611
You piece of shit.

742
01:24:39,816 --> 01:24:41,511
Get your ass out of here.

743
01:24:42,785 --> 01:24:45,253
You're living in the fucking past.
Times have changed!

744
01:24:49,525 --> 01:24:51,049
Alright, let's do it.

745
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,329
Fuck you.

746
01:25:10,947 --> 01:25:12,312
Come and get it!

747
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:58,750
Don't fuck with me.

748
01:26:21,451 --> 01:26:22,975
Let's go home.

749
01:27:31,154 --> 01:27:33,122
All right, tell me exactly what he did.

750
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:36,590
By the looks of this place, it looks like
he removed Kuroda completely.

751
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:39,753
You know what to do. Fast and beautiful.

752
01:27:39,962 --> 01:27:41,520
I'll handle it.

753
01:27:57,446 --> 01:27:58,936
All right, let's move out.

754
01:28:06,189 --> 01:28:08,180
You got the gear. I'll take the right.

755
01:28:08,257 --> 01:28:09,383
In here.

756
01:28:11,761 --> 01:28:13,388
Start cleaning up.

757
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:33,208
I am pleased to announce to Mr. Kojima...

758
01:28:33,282 --> 01:28:38,242
...once you drink down the sake...

759
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:42,215
...you'll officially become the new Godfather
of this family.

760
01:28:42,658 --> 01:28:47,561
When you are ready,
please go ahead and drink it down.

761
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:32,364
I would like to close the ritual
with this traditional manner.

762
01:30:21,023 --> 01:30:23,719
No DNA. Very clever.

763
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:28,922
Really nice job.

764
01:30:34,103 --> 01:30:37,595
- What's this?
- I don't know. It came with the other one.

765
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:56,182
"Block, put this shield in the shadow box...

766
01:30:56,993 --> 01:31:01,089
"and tell his parents
that Sean died valiantly in the line of duty.

767
01:31:02,565 --> 01:31:03,759
"Travis."

768
01:31:50,646 --> 01:31:52,113
Yeah, talk to me.

769
01:31:52,181 --> 01:31:54,149
Travis? Guess who.
