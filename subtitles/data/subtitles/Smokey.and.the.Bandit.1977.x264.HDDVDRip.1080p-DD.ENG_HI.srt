for your game.

53
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:59,031
Son, from what I've heard, the biggest
thing about the Bandit is his ego,

54
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:04,620
and I figure that, plus a lot of my dollars,
and he'll try anything, legal or not.

00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,353
- Over there behind his rig.
- Who wants to see him?

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,355
- Who's askin'?
- I'm askin'.

61

Egotistical son of a bitch.

68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf.

71
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:29,037
I came to make a deal. What's he get
if he wins this truck rodeo thing?

72
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,166
- (BANDIT) lf?!
- $5,000, Daddy.

73
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,878
- Chicken-shit money.
- Just what the hell you want, anyway?

74
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:40,591
You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo
and accept a real challenge.

75
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:51,059
(BANDIT) Gettin' to Texarkana and back
in 28 hours, that's no problem.

76
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:55,606
- It ain't never been done before, hotshit.
- Watch your language, little lady.

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,150
The problem is that Coors beer.

78
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:02,821
You take that east of Texas
and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'.

79
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,699
I believe you're just a little bit scared.

80
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,952
Great psychology. Why don't you say
somethin' bad about my mother?

81
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,372
- Your mama is so ugly...
- Look, you make this run for me.

82
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,125
These Peterbilts are worth $80,000.

83
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:20,756
That comes to about three grand
an hour if you make it in 28 hours.

84
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,258
How about that for a challenge?

85
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,969
- Dad, I don't believe that that's necess...
- Never mind.

86
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,680
Wait a minute. Why do you
want that beer so bad?

87
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,517
Because he's thirsty, dummy.

88
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,270
You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow
in the Southern Classic.

89
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,649
When he wins,
I wanna celebrate in style.

90
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,070
- How much style?
- Well, I got a few friends and me.

91
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,947
400 cases.

92
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,159
- 400 cases...?
- Well?

93
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,288
- Well, let me see your cash.
- Big Enos's word is gold.

94
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,626
All right, show him the cash.

95
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,087
- Go ahead, Little.
- Shit.

96
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,801
Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer,
I'll need the cash for that.

97
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,971
No problem. Go ahead, boy.

98
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,266
New car. Gotta have a new car
to block for the truck.

99
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:18,730
- OK. Go ahead, boy.
- I'd like to kick his ass just once.

100
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,858
Speedy car.

101
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,487
Speedier than that.

102
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,489
Go ahead.

103
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,596
- Hello, darlin'.
- Hi, Uncle Bandit.

104
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,848
- Which one of the house apes are you?
- Kate.

105
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,309
He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he?

106
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,520
Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful.

107
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,356
- How about 'gorgeous'?
- You can't have him.

108
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,401
Obviously you can. What are you
tryin' to do, start another race?

109
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:08,030
Look, you got Cledus in jail once.
Leave us alone!

110
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,490
- Hi, Uncle Bandit!
- He ain't your damn uncle!

111
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:15,871
I always recognise you! You know why?
You always kick me in the balls!

112
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,832
Damn it, Bandit! Look at me!

113
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,545
I find it hard to look at you, Waynette,
especially with those things in your hair.

114
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,131
Makes me think you're listening
to a radio station in Savannah.

115
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:30,052
You can't go in there and bother Cledus.
Hey! This is my home!

116
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,513
- Cledus.
- No!

117
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,391
I know in the past
I may have done you wrong.

118
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,603
- Right?
- Right.

119
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,900
However, in the future, Cledus,
I will never, ever do you wrong again.

120
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,528
- Right?
- Right.

121
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:54,660
We have a big chance, a big chance
to make a run for some big bucks.

122
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:59,790
- 80,000 of them.
- Really?

123
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:04,169
- Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'?
- How'd you guess?

124
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:09,132
No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana
and pick up 400 cases of Coors

125
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,010
and bring it back in 28 hours.

126
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,638
Whoa! I got a flash for you.

127
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,599
That's called bootleggin',
and that's against the law.

128
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,395
Who gives a turkey when the Snowman
and the Bandit are runnin' the booze?

129
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,147
- No one can stop us.
- Hold it right there.

130
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,234
There ain't gonna be no more
Snowman and Bandit.

131
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:32,614
Because I've got to go in the morning
to Conyers and pick up a load of manure.

132
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,701
- Shitty job.
- Can I ask you a question?

133
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,536
Sure. Ask me.

134
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,747
What the hell do we wanna go to
Texas for and haul beer back here?

135
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,000
For the good old American life.

136
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,628
For the money, for the glory
and for the fun.

137
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:50,090
Mostly for the money. You know
what we're gonna do with the money?

138
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,885
- What?
- We're gonna buy a new rig.

139
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,471
- You're crazy, you know that.
- Yeah.

140
00:09:56,638 --> 00:10:00,309
- How much money did you say it was?
- $80,000.

141
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,686
$80,000?

142
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,730
- Hm.
- Waynette!

143
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,193
Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya,
Fred here ain't gonna be no problem.

144
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,572
- I can see he'll be a major asset.
- Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog.

145
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,117
- Well, let's get goin'.
- Whoa. Hold it a minute.

146
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,662
I got to ask you a question.
Sit right there, Fred.

147
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,999
You mean to tell me
we're gonna drive from here

148
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,503
to Texarkana, Texas,
and back to here in 28 hours?

149
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,255
It's only 900 miles there
and 900 miles back.

150
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,009
Well, for your information,
that ain't never been done, not in no rig.

151
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:38,347
'Cause you and I never done it in no rig.
You gotta stop thinkin' so negative.

152
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:41,433
'Course we can make it.
We ain't never not made it yet, have we?

153
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,353
- Well, no.
- You see? There you are.

154
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,689
Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right.

155
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:52,194
I see our asses in a sling
if we get caught, that's what I see.

156
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,700
Hey! Ho-ho-ho!

157
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:02,454
Well, God Almighty,
would you look at that!

158
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,541
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Honey, hush.

159
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,671
I don't guess we're gonna be ridin'
in the truck together this time?

160
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:13,465
No, son. I'll be drivin' this one
and blockin'.

161
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,301
You'll be drivin' the truck.
This is Bandit One and that is...

162
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,762
...Bandit Two. Together again.

163
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:23,350
- Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl.
- That's right. But we got a problem.

164
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,312
You know them Smokeys
got them CBs in the car now.

165
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,358
I haven't worked that out yet,
but I'm thinkin' about it.

166
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,819
I got an idea.
Why don't we do this?

167
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:38,073
If I say go to channel 21, forget it.
We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19.

168
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,994
- 21 is 19?
- If I say go to channel six, forget it.

169
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,913
- We go to three.
- I go to three. Perfect.

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,083
- If I say go to channel two, we go to one.
- Two is one.

171
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,502
- That'll confuse everybody.
- That'll confuse 'em.

172
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,047
On the other hand,
if we stayed on the odd channels,

173
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,134
switched every time and started
in the basement, that'd work, too.

174
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:01,847
- That'd do it, too, wouldn't it?
- Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess.

175
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:05,142
- Let's haul ass.
- OK.

176

How come we're doing this?
They said it couldn't be done.

183
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,189

- N-no, sir.

00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,710
- Licence plate?
- Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates.

288
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,670
"Ban-one."

289

B-A-N dash O-N-E.

290
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:07,596
All right. Now, you boys
just stay here and watch the car.

291
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:11,016
There might be some vandals around
who wanna steal somethin',

292
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:14,394
so you boys just stay here
and keep your hands on the car

293
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,273
until one of my associates arrive.

294
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,155
And don't go home, don't go to eat,
and don't play with yourself.

295
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:28,492
It wouldn't look nice on my highway.

296

but don't do it.

297

Hey, man, he's gone.
Let's get outta here.

298
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,812
Shit! You do what you want.
I'm stayin' right here.

299
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:05,070
28 years old and... Oh, goodness,
what's this? I'll tuck it right in.

300
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:08,699
I was down here dancing
in a home appliance show.

301
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,952
<i>- I danced around three trash mashers.
- Talk to me, my boy.</i>

302
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,165
I had this costume that lit up.
I only short-circuited once.

303
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:20,919
- Where did you get that seat cover, son?
- This ain't no seat cover.

304
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:24,756
- I was standing in the parking lot...
- I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia.

305
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:29,636
I met this guy... These can't be my pants.
God, he was good-looking.

306
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,181
- And he had this hat on...
- Funny, ain't she?

307
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:37,436
I think he was from Texas or something,
and I thought, "Why not marry the guy?"

308
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,610
Nobody walks out
on a pretty weddin' I set up.

309
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,404
I'm gonna get that girl
and set everything straight.

310
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:53,160
She insulted my town.
She insulted my son.

311
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:59,500
- Look, what if we...
- Shut up! She insulted my authority.

312
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:06,465
And that's nothin' but pure and simple
old-fashioned Communism.

313
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:10,177
It happens every time one of those
dancers starts poontangin' around...

314
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,429
with those show-folk fags.

315
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:15,349
Halfway down the aisle I said to myself,

316
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,101
"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
His mother doesn't even have any teeth!"

317
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:21,396
I jumped in this car, and it blew up
on the side of the road,

318
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,733
and I ended up in this goddamn airplane.
What do you do?

319
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,028
I don't remember.

320
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:32,699
- Oh, are we on the air?
- Sort of, yeah.

321
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,830
You think I'm... nuts, don't you?

322
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,415
No, I don't think you're crazy.

323
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:45,128
I picked up three brides yesterday,
just like you, very subdued.

324
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,590
Hey, what... what's goin' on up there?

325
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,677
<i>- Come back, Bandit.
- Bandit?</i>

326
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:57,850

- That's my handle. Bo's my real name.

327
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,519

- Carrie.

328

329
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,402
She was.

330
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,155
What's she wearin' now?
Come back.

331

Hey, you got peanut butter
or somethin' in your ears?

332

Decoratin' up a whole town

Right.

runnin' back up that aisle...

No, she was dancin'
back up the aisle,

her knockers bouncin'
all over the joint.

- Have fun.

- Drivin'?

347

348
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:30,442
- You've got a great profile.
- Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side.

349
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,487
At least we finally agree on something.

350
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:37,074
Yeah. We both like half my face.

on the side of the road interest you?

Yes, it would.

Tell me, you comin' up

436
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,455
I just rolled past
a county mountie roadblock.

00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:26,543

Don't get out of my way, I'll pass him.

- Yes, I did.

Well, jump me.
