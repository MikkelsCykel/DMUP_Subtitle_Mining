'I'm so sorry for your loss. '

158
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,000
'Divers recovered
her personal effects.

159
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,536
'Her cell phone was in her car,
and we're returning it to you. '

160
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,311
...giving her to us, her family and friends,

161
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,616
to know and to love as a companion
on our earthly pilgrimage.

162
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,215
Give us faith to see in death
the gate of eternal life,

163
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,523
so that in quiet confidence
we may continue our course on earth

164
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:55,795
until, by Your call, we are reunited
with those who have gone before.

165
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,495
- Amen.
- Amen.

166
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,523
- So, what do you think?
- I love it.

167
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,558
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's nice here.

168
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,002
- All right.
- It's a fresh start.

169
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,699
I guess.

170
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,372
Could you...

171
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,879
Could you take Mikey for the weekend?

172
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,247
Yeah, of course.

173
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,583
Maybe... maybe a little longer.

174
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,881
As long as you want, John.

175
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,837
We're gonna go lay the floor now.

176
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,317
- When are you gonna bring them?
- They'd like to see you this week.

177
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:56,116
Sure. Fine, it shouldn't be any problem.

178
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,021
Whoops.

179
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:06,656
You brought me here
just to do that, didn't you?

180
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,429
No, I didn't.
Let me see what I can do here.

181
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:14,872
This is where you tell me
you're running over budget, right?

182
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,174
Shit. Keep doing that!

183
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,944
I'm sorry, I didn't...

184
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,495
Ask them if they have a light.

185
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,838
- You guys OK?
- We are now.

186
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,568
Yeah.

187
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,271
I trust you'll fix this
before Mr. Cunningham arrives.

188
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,622
Anna?

189
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,300
'Jonathan. '

190
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,188
'You have one message.

191
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,668
'Message received Wednesday 23rd,

192
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,192
'2:30am. '

193
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,605
'Jonathan. '

194
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:12,242
'End of message. You have no messages. '

195
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,944
'You have no messages.

196
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,385
'You have no messages. '

197
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,891
Oh! Please, come. How nice.

198
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,367
- Hello.
- Hi.

199
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,465
- Look, er...
- I was just about to finish with someone.

200
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,603
- I can come back.
- No, it won't take long.

201
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,773
I'm really glad to see you.
I was hoping that you'd come.

202
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,976
- Thank you.
- This is Sarah Tate.

203
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,247
Let me introduce you to Mr. Rivers.

204
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,221
Sorry, I'm a little...

205
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,225
We've had a breakthrough today.

206
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,419
It's incredible.

207
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,257
It truly is.

208
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,090
- This is ridiculous.
- Stay awhile.

209
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,534
I should get these boxes back to the store.

210
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,004
Sarah, there's no need to hurry.

211
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,030
Make yourself a cup of tea.

212
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,201
I suppose. Thank you.

213
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,135
Would you like one?

214
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,477
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

215
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,244
Thank you.

216
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,815
Mr. Rivers, please.

217
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,289
Oh, er... Excuse me. Please, sit here. Sit.

218
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:09,827
So, have you heard of E.V.P., Mr. Rivers?

219
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,268
No.

220
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,637
I'm not surprised.
Those that have call us cranks.

221
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:19,371
E.V.P. Stands for
electronic voice phenomenon.

222
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,404
- I'm listening.
- Well.

223
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,611
I'm not a clairvoyant, I'm not a medium,

224
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,312
I don't contact the dead,

225
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,480
the dead contact me.

226
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,648
And, with E.V.P.,

227
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,593
I can hear them,

228
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,255
I can see them, and...

229
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,931
I can record them.

230
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,077
'... I understand... '

231
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,595
'... you shouldn't be... '

232
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,908
- And they are...
- That's right.

233
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,007
People that have passed over.

234
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,663
Is this your job, or a hobby, or what?

235
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,138
I think obsession
would be more appropriate, to be honest.

236
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,231
Now, I wonder where... Ah!

237
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:01,075
Here we are. They don't always appear visually
the first few times.

238
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:05,913
We tend only to pick up their voices
and people can find that frustrating.

239
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,815
But when it works,

240
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,755
and you see the faces of the people
that you're able to help, like Sarah,

241
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,455
nothing, believe me, nothing comes close.

242
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,131
Mr. Rivers, do you want to hear your wife?

243
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,240
Yes.

244
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,060
'Jonathan.

245
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,200
'Jonathan.

246
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,965
'Find him.

247
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,241
'Jonathan Rivers.

248
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,267
'Find him.

249
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,945
'Jonathan... Jonathan...

250
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,848
'Rivers...

251
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,445
'Find him, please. '

252
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,138
The frustrating thing about E.V.P.
Is it's not live.

253
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,908
You need to make the recording

254
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,713
and you'll only know
if you've got results when you play it back.

255
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,413
Here. It has milk.

256
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,251
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Excuse me for a moment.

257
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,326
It's an amazing feeling, isn't it?

258
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,591
Er...

259
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,123
It's indescribable.

260
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,194
It took me a few visits to get used to it
but it's addictive.

261
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:10,037
I'm here all the time. He's really helped me.

262
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:15,478
I try to help him when I can,
so I keep some of this stuff at the store.

263
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,175
- What store?
- I have a bookstore.

264
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,447
Your wife was a wonderful writer, Mr. Rivers.

265
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,024
Yeah.

266
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,363
- So what made you come here?
- My fiancé.

267
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:41,634
He died eight months ago. We've had trouble
deciphering what he's been saying

268
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,607
but this afternoon we cracked it.

269
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,000
Only two words - "Sarah, yes. "

270
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:52,545
Because, before he died, he promised me
that if it was like they say it is

271
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,848
that he would find a way of getting to me

272
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,878
and letting me know that he's happy.

273
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,958
So, "Sarah, yes. "

274
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,661
Oh.

275
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,962
Raymond thinks we probably won't
see him again now but that's OK.

276
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,966
And I've heard what I wanted to hear.

277
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,710
Anna...

278
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,815
this is John.

279
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,887
If there's any way you can hear me...

280
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,520
will you please let me know?

281
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,532
Please.

282
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,093
Just any kind of... Just any kind of sign.

283
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,567
Please.

284
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,160
'Susie. '

285
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,434
'Susie. '

286
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,347
'Susie, I... '

287
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,029
I recorded this a few hours ago.

288
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:04,736
It's quite faint, so I had to save it as a sound
file on the computer to enhance the sound.

289
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,272
So, um...

290
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,180
- she knows that I visited?
- I believe so.

291
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,911
- So will I get to see her this time?
- No.

292
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,476
This will just be sound. I'm sorry, John,

293
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,351
we have to be a little patient.

294
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,021
Trust me, John,
this is just the beginning. Sit, here.

295
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,723
Now...

296
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,658
If you want to hear it again,
just press that key.

297
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,692
I'll be back in a moment.

298
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,784
'Tell him... because I love him. '

299
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,519
'Tell him... because I love him. '

300
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,748
'Bastard. Bastard. '

301
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,859
'Bastard. '

302
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,232
What was that?

303
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,135
It's OK, it's OK.

304
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,266
We do have some very bad people out there.

305
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,242
You just have to press that...

306
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,270
and they're all gone.

307
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:53,807
We've had a step towards visual contact
with Anna. Let's celebrate that.

308
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,978
Here.

309
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,982
They can't all be nice,
they can't all be Anna.

310
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,245
'Susie Tomlinson... smile. '

311
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,350
'Susie Tomlinson... sm... '

312
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,767
Hello.

313
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,503
- 'Lt's Raymond. Something's happening. '
- Really?

314
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,341
- 'Get over here. '
- I'm on my way.

315
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,949
Hello?

316
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,529
Raymond?

317
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,797
So you'll tell me whatever you find out?

318
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,997
I can't tell you any more
than you'll read in the papers.

319
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,109
Yeah, thanks.

320
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,263
Thank you for coming to the service.
It would've meant a lot to him.

321
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,064
Oh. Thank you for doing this for me.

322
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,336
I'm not sure where to start.
He was working off a disk, so...

323
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,867
Maybe Anna's original tapes
might be in one of these boxes.

324
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,640
You all right?

325
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,575
I still can't believe he's gone.

326
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,147
Well...

327
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,917
- Maybe he'll be in touch.
- I don't know.

328
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,222
Said he'd made enough of a nuisance
of himself when he was alive.

329
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,589
Just doesn't make any sense.
He was helping people.

330
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:02,963
Wow.

331
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,730
- These go back years.
- 23, to be precise.

332
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,529
"Carol should know. "

333
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,100
"Tell Thomas he should. "

334
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,169
"Men in the room. "

335
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,978
Oh, here's one - "500 dollars still there. "

336
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,246
- That's the kind of message I like.
- Yeah.

337
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,199
There we go.

338
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,031
Why do we got so many?

339
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:16,301
So you can watch your favorite show
and I can watch my favorite show.

340
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,041
Yeah.

341
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,839
OK... Um...

342
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,849
They're showing me something.

343
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,441
It's...

344
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,145
It's, uh...

345
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,652
Willow Avenue.
They're showing me Willow Avenue. Yes?

346
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,423
No. No. No.

347
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,725
Oh. OK.

348
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,168
It's no problem. Sometimes it happens.

349
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,445
Your wife, she passed over recently.

350
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,643
Yeah.

351
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,456
Her passing was difficult.

352
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,318
Yeah.

353
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,918
She was, um...

354
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,061
She's a writer. She was a writer.

355
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,531
Yeah, her words are important.

356
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,200
Oh...

357
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,103
I'm sorry, the light is way too bright.

358
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,408
It's... it's like these tiny, noisy, little pinpoints.

359
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:17,118
It's making it hard to see anything at all.
Can you...

360
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,666
- It's electronic voice...
- I know what this is.

361
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,603
- I've been making tapes...
- You shouldn't.

362
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:40,906
You shouldn't try this by yourself,
it's not safe.

363
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,971
It's like homemade Ouija boards
and teenage séances at Halloween.

364
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,643
E.V.P. Is not good.

365
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,917
We spend years developing
our relationships with our guides

366
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,456
so that we can protect you.

367
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,786
- From what?
- From the ones who like damage.

368
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:02,154
Cos they are out there and they will find you.

369
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,600
If you're gonna
keep insisting on meddling, then...

370
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,797
Anna, my wife, she sent me a sign.

371
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,137
No. No. Not Anna.
You are misreading everything.

372
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:15,271
Listen, it is one thing to contact the dead,
it is another to meddle,

373
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,610
and you are meddling.

374
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,323
- I just came cos I wanted some help.
- I know, I can help you.

375
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,484
It's just that they are urging me
to tell you to stop.

376
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,461
Right. Thank you.

377
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,529
Mr. Rivers...

378
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:42,969
Willow Avenue. Are you sure?
They keep showing me Willow Avenue.

379
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,564
No.

380
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:49,705
No Willow Avenue,
no Willow Street, no Willow Terrace.

381
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,982
Mr. Rivers. She was pregnant. Yes?

382
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,694
'We play every day. '

383
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,231
'He says you are happier now. '

384
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,063
'Did I die? '

385
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,772
'Susie.

386
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,572
'Susie Tomlinson...

387
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,276
'smile.

388
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,155
'Susie Tomlinson.

389
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,889
'Smile'
