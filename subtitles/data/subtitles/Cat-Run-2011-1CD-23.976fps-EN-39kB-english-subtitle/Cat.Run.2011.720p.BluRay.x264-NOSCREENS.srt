1
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,313
Thank you.

2
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,940
Welcome.

3
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,650
Well, thank you.

4
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,360
Up the stairs, ma'am.

5
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,156
- Come on, let's go.
- I'm coming.

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,491
Good evening, ladies.

7
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,076
Purses.

8
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,246
Good evening. Can you
open your jacket, please?

9
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,331
Excuse me!

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,333
Follow me.

11
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,002
Why all the security?

12
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,212
OK, big boys with the big guns,

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,591
- I feel protected.
- They are not here to protect us.

14
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,384
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,136
Cat, don't worry.

16
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,221
Yeah, but just stay safe, OK?

17
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,640
Yes, don't worry about me.

18
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,423
Goddamn. They're having a fun night.

19
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,258
Check it out.

20
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,517
Are you crazy?

21
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,478
Ooh, I like the chick in the back,
the blonde one.

22
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,857
Yeah. Do you think
she's got her real tits?

23
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,218
Jakovic, hi. I owe you, pal.

24
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,680
See you.

25
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,559
No, no, no, thank you.

26
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,894
Come on!

27
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,898
Take that!

28
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,278
Oh-ho! That's good.

29
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,029
That's really good.

30
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,490
I'm going to take this off.

31
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,286
Take it off. Who wants to
fuck a big, fat American?

32
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,454
- I want to fuck.
- You do?

33
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,502
Do you know each other?

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,130
- No.
- Well, you will soon.

35
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,717
- Hi, I'm Lela.
- Cat. Nice to meet you.

36
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,428
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

37
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,769
Sava. Come, come.

38
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,605
Come.

39
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,982
- Please, please.
- Anthony, very full.

40
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,401
Sava, how can you sell the food

41
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,320
if you don't know what it tastes like?

42
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,781
My stomach, its very...

43
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,283
Full, I know.

44
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,653
You and you and me...

45
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:29,370
- What? What the fuck?
- What are you doing here?!

46
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,877
Jesus Christ! What are you?

47
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,255
Jesus! You're wet.

48
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,758
- Why are you here?
- I came to see my best friend.

49
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,219
- Meet my ladies.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

50
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,264
- This is, er, Eva?
- Jieva.

51
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,099
- Jieva.
- Mm-hm.

52
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,226
- And this is Natsuya?
- Nastasya.

53
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,895
- N-Nastasya.
- Nastasya, yes.

54
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,106
Uh-uh. It doesn't matter.
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,275
This is my oldest friend, Anthony.

56
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,110
How are you doing? Hi.

57
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,487
I saved him from
many brutal beat-downs.

58
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,157
Hey!

59
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,081
It's true.

60
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,500
How beautiful are they?
Look at that.

61
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,255
- You need a place to stay?
- No, I got a spot down the street.

62
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,759
They laid it out, flat screen TV,
satellite dish,

63
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,094
minibar, got 950 channels.

64
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,847
- I'm watching the game.
- No, you didn't.

65
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,391
- What you talking about?
- It's bullshit.

66
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,561
Yesterday was the tenth.
No international travel.

67
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,397
It's now 3.27,
it means you got in around 2pm,

68
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,817
which makes it the British Air
9.15 from Philly.

69
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,861
Unless you're giving hand jobs
to LeBron,

70
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,238
no way you saw a basketball player.

71
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,949
There's three channels only so...

72
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,910
- OK.
- You need a place to stay.

73
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,953
I said they could stay with us.

74
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,289
- They can't.
- You got a girlfriend?

75
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,917
- No, but you do.
- You do?

76
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,295
- You have a girlfriend?
- What happened was...

77
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,672
What happened with Stephanie?

78
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,885
I've been promoted, so I'm moving to
California. The movers come tomorrow.

79
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,055
I want you and your shit out of here.
Here, 300 bucks.

80
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,558
- Good luck.
- You're paying me to move?

81
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,478
But deep down, I think she loves me.

82
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,023
You can stay on my couch,
help with the restaurant.

83
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,570
- Get these girls a cab.
- You'd take away my hoasis?

84
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,949
Come on, you're going to help
me cook. Make something good.

85
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,451
They need to help me cook, too.

86
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,036
I'm right up here.

87
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,961
So? You like it?

88
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,005
Yeah.
You want me to be straight up?

89
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,218
OK, fuck it. Go next door and eat yak
butter and deep-fried Twinkies.

90
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,096
No, no, no, no! Let me finish this.

91
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,766
I'm just saying, maybe
the restaurant business isn't for you.

92
00:07:55,934 --> 00:08:00,688
It's a people-pleasing thing and
you're not a people-pleasing person.

93
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,023
So what do I do, man, huh?
You tell me.

94
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,945
I should serve hotpockets and
Chef Boyardee like the rest?

95
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,989
To win paying customers, yes.

96
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,575
- Hey, I've got to drop this deuce.
- Go.

97
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,952
Where's the bathroom?
I'm just playing.

98
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,371
I'm going to take a leak real quick.

99
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,060
Whoa!

100
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,563
May I please use your phone?

101
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,024
Yeah, it's right back there
on the right.

102
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,318
OK.

103
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,445
Er, wait, you want maybe a drink?

104
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,989
A little wine? Something to eat?

105
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,242
Rain check.

106
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,541
Oh, my gosh.

107
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,051
Hello?

108
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,224
Ryder, it's me, Cat.

109
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,270
- What the fuck did you do?
- Me? I survived, that's what I did.

110
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,649
- They said there was an accident.
- Their guns went off

111
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,069
multiple times
and shot all the multiple girls?

112
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,120
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You'll be fine.

113
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,588
I wonder where her baby is.

114
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,925
- Er, what baby?
- The little bruise round her pinky.

115
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,052
When my nephew was teething,

116
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,721
he'd teeth on her pinky
and it left a bruise.

117
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,891
She wanted a drink
but she wouldn't have one.

118
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,476
Also, I could be wrong,

119
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:06,021
but, I'm looking at her breasts
and thinking milk.

120
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,608
Really? I'm looking at her titties
and thinking half and half.

121
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,777
- Where are you?
- Don't worry.

122
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,990
- Did you tell them about Alex?
- Of course not.

123
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,617
You're worth more alive
and on your back.

124
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,285
The pants. The pants.

125
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,140
- Hello?
- Grushenka,

126
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,935
I can't talk long,
so please listen to me.

127
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,478
Cat, what's going on?

128
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,689
I need you to watch Alex
a little longer.

129
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,400
I'll be back as soon
as I can get across the border.

130
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,153
Where are you Cat?
Is everything OK?

131
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,031
Just tell me what's wrong.
You're scaring me, Cat.

132
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:02,036
- Sabina is dead.
- What?

133
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,789
- Sabina is dead.
- Sabina is dead?

134
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,268
Here comes the action, man.
Check it out.

135
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,357
Ooh, you like that, huh?

136
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,152
- The safety word is "toast"?
- Toast, yes.

137
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,863
Grushenka, please...

138
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,824
We'll cry about her later. Not now.

139
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,993
You're gonna scare Alex.

140
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,495
Can you put him
on the phone?

141
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,793
Hello, baby... it's mommy.

142
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,962
I miss you so much.
I love you very much.

143
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,300
Baby, I love you so much.
I miss you so much.

144
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,022
Here she comes.
Don't say nothing.

145
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,526
Thank you very much.

146
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,113
- You are so nice and handsome.
- Oh, you, too.

147
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,452
- Bye.
- Bye.

148
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,204
Did you see the munk?

149
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,331
Fun fact. I don't trust her.

150
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,458
What,
cos she didn't eat your food?

151
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,212
Not just that.
She's about to take my car.

152
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,881
All the bending over
was a subterfuge

153
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,967
to sleight of hand my keys.

154
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,553
- She also took your phone.
- What?!

155
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,233
Come on!

156
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,946
Quick! Come on, man.

157
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,240
Hey, hold on! Hey!

158
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,202
Lady, open the door.
You've got my phone.

159
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,663
Come on. El niño loco.
What are you doing?

160
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,875
I just want my phone.
My momma bought me that phone.

161
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,252
Come on, I've got numbers.
Come on.

162
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,255
Miss, could you please steal
someone else's car?

163
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,925
Don't drive off with my phone!
Hey!

164
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,262
Lady! Hey! I'm gonna call the cops!

165
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,055
Man, shit!

166
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,808
You're gonna let her
steal your car like that?

167
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,768
She must really need it.

168
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,854
"She... She must really need it?"

169
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,772
I must really need my phone!

170
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,726
- How far is your place?
- 15 minutes away.

171
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,561
You said that 15 minutes ago.

172
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,271
Anthony, you don't think

173
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,858
my business ideas
have been unsuccessful, do you?

174
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,568
Compared to what?

175
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,030
Some have been
very, er, interesting.

176
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,450
It's not how good you are,
it's how good you wanna be.

177
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,078
- I guess so.
- I got an idea.

178
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,704
What you got?

179
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,083
- OK, it's a lot of money.
- Ah, this is a good story.

180
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,543
- We'll make a lot.
- Sounds interesting.

181
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,987
I need a one-way ticket to Treviso.

182
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,912
One moment.

183
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,219
You want to set up
a detective agency?

184
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,014
I want us
to set up a detective agency.

185
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,391
You've been through a lot.

186
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,186
- No, this guy Gerry told me...
- Who the hell's Gerry?

187
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,480
You know Gerry.
He comes on late night.

188
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,066
Is your spouse cheating on you?

189
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,652
Do you want to find a loved one?

190
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,197
If you can't catch them,
Kech can.

191
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,907
Licensed private investigators.

192
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,410
He charges $400
plus expenses.

193
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,039
Dude, trust me.
These guys eat well, they tip well.

194
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,582
You know chicks love that.

195
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,709
And we have one clear advantage.

196
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,587
- What's that?
- We have nothing better to do.

197
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,298
Listen, we'd need an office,
experience...

198
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,259
- "We?"
... equipment, all kinds of capital.

199
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,762
- You said "we".
- No, absolutely not.

200
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,389
Ten, twenty grand for start-up
costs.

201
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,391
I don't have money.

202
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,353
- What about the trust fund?
- Absolutely not.

203
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,314
I'm trying hard
to keep my family out of my life.

204
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,608
- At least you have a family.
- Stop it.

205
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,860
I was raised by African fruit bats.

206
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,196
Don't play
the African fruit bat card.

207
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,990
Can I play the best friend card?

208
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,212
In ninth grade, you helped the Dean's
wife find her husband's diary.

209
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,255
Then she shot him in the face.

210
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,009
- So the answer's no?
- I'm in Eastern fucking Europe.

211
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,179
I left the States three years ago,
which was your idea.

212
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,764
I remember.

213
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,475
It was to get away from my family.

214
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:03,313
Why? Because I like to cook.
And be alone. That's it.

215
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,107
Well, you got your wishes.

216
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,734
Nobody comes to the restaurant
to eat.

217
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,696
Just wish to never get laid
and all three wishes will be up.

218
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,231
Anthony?

219
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,732
Mm?

220
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,152
Can I get a glass of water?

221
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,529
No, you're gonna piss on my couch.

222
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,080
I know I told you
to get away from your family,

223
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,291
go travel, live your life,

224
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,378
but you're here
just hiding from the world, man.

225
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:12,799
I need you in on this.
And you need to live your life.

226
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,509
So, you in on this, man?

227
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,221
You going to get with me?
Come on, man, be a dick.

228
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,518
All right.

229
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,271
If it doesn't work,
you're waiting tables.

230
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,273
- We're gonna do this?
- I'm with you.

231
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,525
- We can! Yes, we can!
- We'll try.

232
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,070
Come on, you feel me!
My boy! Bros before hos.

233
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,740
- I don't have any hos.
- That's on my list.

234
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,617
You gonna get some hos.

235
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,827
It's, er, wait.

236
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,705
"Bonjour". It's right here.
Come on, here we go.

237
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,707
This is it.

238
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,543
Oh, yes!

239
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,713
Yes! Dude, that's Santa Claus.

240
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,090
They're showing
Christmas movies.

241
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:57,469
A porno theatre.
Our office is in a porno theatre.

242
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,181
Dude, you think Ben and Jerry
started in a high rise creamery?

243
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,769
No, not at all. They had
one big spoon, one bucket,

244
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,897
in the back of a VW van,
creaming in their pants.

245
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,399
Ground up, Anthony, ground up.

246
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,861
Hey, you wanna watch the movie,

247
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,696
you need to buy a ticket.

248
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,657
Er, let's see.

249
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,785
We're looking for a... Boden.

250
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,538
Ah, Boda? It's me.

251
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,498
Come on, guys, come on.

252
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,752
This is your office.
You make here much money.

253
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,757
You have all you need here.
Big desk, free porno.

254
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,928
Careful, careful. Boards rotten.

255
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,223
Here, you can put the papers.

256
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,267
And this is very important place.

257
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,852
You can wash here or piss here.

258
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
Everybody must piss, yes.

259
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:55,443
500 of month, but, er,
for you, because I like your face,

260
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,697
I give to you for four, OK?

261
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,574
We'll take it.

262
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,409
Good guys.

263
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,619
- Yes.
- Come on, pay him.

264
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,163
- Er, yes, come on.
- You ready to wait tables?

265
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,832
Ground up, ground up.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,167
- You make here big success.
- Ah.

267
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,504
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

268
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,173
So we have
an uninhabitable hovel

269
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,301
overlooking
a Santa Claus snuff film.

270
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,969
What's next?

271
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,637
Staff.

272
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,056
You know,
I was in Army language school.

273
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,267
I speak five different languages.

274
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,770
- Um, do you mind if we ask, Mr...
- Call me Dexter.

275
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,196
OK, er, Dexter, um, how did you?

276
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,532
Well, I mean,
were you born like this?

277
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,076
- He was in the Army.
- Oh. Oh, no.

278
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,870
Shortly after I was discharged,

279
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,873
my wife and I
were vacationing in Florida,

280
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,000
and we were involved
in a shark attack.

281
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,503
Um, so that's how you lost?

282
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,173
- Oh, no, shark ate my wife.
- Oh, God.

283
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:02,010
Have you ever seen somebody
you love eaten alive slowly,

284
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,887
one bite at a time?

285
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,805
Er, he didn't eat her whole?

286
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,559
Oh, they found her hole. And
a piece of her ass on the beach.

287
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,062
Just an empty thong
and a broken dream.

288
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,105
You know,
that hits you kinda hard.

289
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,900
I started drinking
and using intravenous drugs.

290
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:21,529
Lost my arm through
an abscess caused by a dirty needle.

291
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,574
I reached rock bottom
about five years ago.

292
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,911
I was living on the streets
and begging and eating pet food.

293
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,416
Finally, I just threw myself
under a subway train,

294
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:37,712
and landed on the rails,
and well, that train just, whoosh!

295
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,631
Popped my legs clean off.

296
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,008
Well, listen,
you seem remarkably positive.

297
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,345
I thank God every day
for what happened to me.

298
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,431
You know, my accident,
well, it brought me to the Lord.

299
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,143
I stopped drinking and drugging.

300
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,729
I promised myself
that I would make the most

301
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,441
out of every single opportunity
that life afforded me.

302
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,068
OK, well, I guess, um,

303
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:04,322
practically speaking, could you
fill some of the requirements?

304
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,699
You see that phone over there?

305
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,035
Ring! Ring!

306
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,254
And I make
a great cup of coffee, too.

307
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,590
Well, when can you start?

308
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
Give me a little nub.

309
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,931
Hello?

310
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,767
Daniel Carver? This is Cat.

311
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,395
Cat, where are you?
I'm so glad you're alive.

312
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,898
- How did you get my number?
- I copied Ryder's address book.

313
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,860
How very industrious.
So what is this about?

314
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,736
Wanted to touch base?

315
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,030
I have your hard drive, OK?

316
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,866
If you don't call off your dogs,

317
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,576
that movie of your boss will be

318
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,495
the most-watched video
on YouTube.

319
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,791
Turn off the fucking music!

320
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,002
Oh!

321
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,930
You can't get anything
off that hard drive.

322
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,057
It's got military encryption.

323
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,020
It's gonna purge itself like
a Russian farm worker on Easter.

324
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,647
I took it to an expert.
He figured it out.

325
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,483
Never lie to grown-ups.

326
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,194
I'm old enough
to be your sugar daddy.

327
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,822
And I'll find you.
I'll find you by the pm.

328
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,828
Fuck.

329
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,853
I found a car.
Someone left it on the street.

330
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,856
I could get 300- 400 Euros for it,
I'm sure.

331
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,692
I don't know whose it is, don't care.

332
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,863
Away! Away from the car!
Away, you dirty shit!

333
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,741
I said get away from the car!

334
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,870
Get away from the car

335
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,927
What? What did you do?
Are you crazy?

336
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,972
- You stupid fuck.
- You said to kill the driver.

337
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,848
No said boy or girl.

338
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,517
- You killed a cop?
- Yah.

339
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:40,270
You won't get paid for this.
Fuckers!

340
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,938
Shoot him.

341
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,442
OK, now I'm really
annoyed with you, princess.

342
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,861
It's time to bring in a professional.

343
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,031
Plan B. As in Bingham.

344
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,844
- Good to see you, Helen.
- Thanks for thinking of me.

345
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:21,311
I'm always thinking of you.

346
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,856
- How's Maria?
- She's fine.

347
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,233
And Eliska?
What is she now? Three?

348
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,278
- Three and a half.
- How lovely.

349
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,530
You know Razwell?

350
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:35,158
Of course,
since he was in short pants.

351
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,076
Hello, Helen.

352
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,705
Oh, still using
Acqua di Parma, Bob?

353
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,874
Old habits die hard.

354
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,710
A real man never changes
his cologne. Shall we?

355
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:49,213
The hard drive
has a level-five encryption.

356
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:52,216
She won't be able
to get anything out of it.

357
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,927
And yet, you'll pay top euro
to get it back.

358
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,888
What's on the hard drive, Daniel?

359
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,848
- Baby pictures.
- Hm.

360
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:03,478
That's need-to-know, Helen.
Trust me, you don't need to know.

361
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,105
And the girl?
What do we know about her?

362
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,732
Bob?

363
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,027
Thank you.

364
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:15,073
Her name is Catalina Rona,
also answers to Cat.

365
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,452
Left her rustic, rural homeland
of Andorra looking for work,

366
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,331
and found her true calling
sprawling and balling.

367
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,958
Oh, my goodness.

368
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,835
What else do we know?

369
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,172
- Well, we know she's smart.
- And how do we know that?

370
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,383
- Because she's still breathing.
- Ah.

371
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:40,807
And those other girls, the ones who
weren't as smart as Catalina?

372
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,850
What are your plans for them?

373
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,354
Car crash, drug paraphernalia,
bodies burned up, local cops.

374
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,980
The chief is on my payroll.

375
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,149
Dear me. Pull!

376
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,113
I thought you boys
were all about change.

377
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,698
Oh, we have changed.

378
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,784
We used to be
really cold and ruthless. Pull.

379
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,937
Do you need a hand with that?

380
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,439
No, no!

381
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,774
Oh, I think you do.

382
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,077
Mr Rona?

383
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,331
Mr Rona,
I want to assure you, Mr Rona,

384
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,082
that we're just as concerned

385
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,752
about Catalina's disappearance
as you are.

386
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,756
Oh, yes? That mean
you're not much concerned.

387
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:39,091
You're not worried
about your daughter?

388
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,887
What to worry? I never see her.
And she never gives me a dime.

389
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,932
She fuck and make big money,
but none for Papa.

390
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,392
- Who's the bitch?
- She is from the police.

391
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,520
Her name is Virginia Wolf.
This is my boy son.

392
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,855
How lovely to meet you.
Do you happen to know

393
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,524
where your girl sister is?

394
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,860
- I know nothing.
- Imagine that.

395
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,821
If you do happen to hear anything,

396
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,990
I would most appreciate it
if you'd give me a call.

397
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,369
Why is she wasting her time
looking for my sister?

398
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,496
She won't hide long.
She's got a kid.

399
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:13,084
Ah. Si? Gracias.

400
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,736
Hold it.

401
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,664
Ooh, we need an elevator.
All these damn stairs.

402
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,420
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Late for what?

403
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,839
Dexter Wolf, any, er, messages?

404
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,050
Er, Boda called,

405
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,554
and he said that Swedish
penis pump you ordered,

406
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,265
he's going to deliver it
in a discreet package.

407
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,143
Er, I meant, like business messages.

408
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,022
- Am I paying for your porn?
- No, man, I didn't even order that.

409
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,024
I'm a victim of identity theft.

410
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,319
Anyways, man, I got some new
business cards and cell phones.

411
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,821
- Here, check it out.
- Let's see.

412
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:29,035
"Looking for a good dick?
Call the Juan Detective Agency. "

413
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,329
- Who's Juan?
- No, no, no, no. It's "Ju-An".

414
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,081
It's a cross,
like a mix with our names,

415
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,792
Julian and Anthony. Ju-An.
You feel me?

416
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,379
- Why's your name first?
- Anju sounds like a law firm.

417
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,965
You know,
Goldman Goldman Sachs Anju.

418
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,634
I mean, if you don't like it,

419
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,929
I can go back
and maybe reprint something.

420
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,557
Is this your only objection?
Are we doing this?

421
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,353
Yes!

422
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,355
Check this out.

423
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,315
What the hell does that say?

424
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,734
That's the girl from the restaurant.

425
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,571
Father's looking for his missing
daughter. She's our first case.

426
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:22,380
The next ferry to Bari, Italy
leaves in eight minutes.

427
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,090
Please board now.

428
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,426
This is the last call
for the ferry to Bari, Italy,

429
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,012
leaving in eight minutes.

430
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,431
Please board now.

431
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,982
Come on, wake up, honey.

432
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,566
Ow.

433
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,027
Where are we?

434
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,238
Ancona, Italy.

435
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,990
Oh, I fell asleep.

436
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,784
Good. Now you can go all night.

437
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,513
- You wanted it!
- What happened?

438
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,933
It was an accident.
I didn't do anything.

439
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,853
- Go.
- It was an accident.

440
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,688
Go. Go.

441
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,286
Their safety
is our number one priority.

442
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,829
Safety.

443
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,267
- What the fuck?
- We are not in Italy.

444
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:01,062
We couldn't.
There were too many cops.

445
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,231
They were looking in the trunks
of the cars. We'll go tomorrow.

446
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:07,068
We'll spend the night here
and go tomorrow. I promise.

447
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:11,363
- It'll be completely all right.
- I don't think so.

448
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,574
Your dream girl's getting famous.

449
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,911
Father's upset his baby
didn't come home for supper.

450
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,371
- Is that objectionable?
- It's bullshit.

451
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,041
She's not a girl
who comes home for supper

452
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,668
and why would this
make the headlines?

453
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,629
Which leads us to conclude what?

454
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:29,715
Some hard, bad people,
connected and respected are fronting

455
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,593
and want her found
before she can make a sound.

456
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,887
Oh, MC Dr Seuss, kicking rhymes!

457
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,389
I'm just saying,
something is not right.

458
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,684
A bunch of stuff ain't right.
And you suddenly care?

459
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,895
I'm just curious, that's all.

460
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,148
I knew it! You want to
have sex with her, don't you?

461
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,026
- What are you saying?
- You want to hit that.

462
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,403
It's cool by me.
It's our first case.

463
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,156
Come on, let's catch our train.
Come on.

464
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:08,587
- Mr Ryder? Good afternoon.
- You work for Carver?

465
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,382
- I do.
- You got answers about my girls?

466
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,843
I was hoping you could
help me on that score.

467
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,719
You see,
one of your girls, Catalina,

468
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,013
has stolen something
from my employer.

469
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,350
I need to know if you've heard
from her and where she is.

470
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,644
I don't know
where that scheiss bitch is.

471
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,648
Where the fuck are the others?
Debbie, Susie, Bubbles, Sabina?

472
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,859
I'm afraid I have no idea.

473
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,361
Then we've both got
no fucking idea.

474
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:37,032
Well, perhaps you could tell me
who Catalina left her baby with?

475
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,874
Lady, look at you. You come in
here, Mary fucking Poppins.

476
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,378
You've got a brass pussy,
but no offense, get fucked, mama.

477
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,463
Oh, I'm not your mama, I'm afraid.

478
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,465
I would love to have
a son like you,

479
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,343
but no such luck, poor old me.

480
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,181
And your real mother, didn't she
teach you it's rude to point?

481
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,018
The only thing my mother taught
me was how to take a punch

482
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,603
and to cook up base.

483
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,521
She taught my sister to suck dick

484
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,232
- and take it up the ass.
- My goodness.

485
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,819
Hans,
show Mary Poppins the way out.

486
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,911
If you'd been closer to your mother,
she might have taught you manners.

487
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,498
For instance, when a lady enters
the room, it is polite to stand up.

488
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,262
Do you think you could
stand up for me now, Mr Ryder?

489
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,349
Lady, I swear,
I don't know where she is,

490
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,601
Cat or her fucking baby.

491
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,728
You can sit down now.

492
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:49,897
Ah! God!

493
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,523
Are you crazy?

494
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,778
God! OK, OK, OK.
I'll tell you all I know.

495
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:00,991
Hmm, well, unfortunately, with
a man of your low character -

496
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,035
and I don't mean to insult you

497
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:07,748
but you were brought up by a sodomy-
and fellatio-tutoring crack addict -

498
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,376
there's the possibility
that you might lie.

499
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,921
Lady, you got to trust me.

500
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,506
Well, that's one option.

501
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,508
Oh, no, no, no, lady!

502
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,690
Mr Carver? Officer Slobodan.

503
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,441
We have two young males.

504
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,112
OK. Pictures coming right up.

505
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:42,783
- We're gonna find your daughter.
- Politsia? Hah! They find nothing.

506
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,536
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

507
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,163
That's why you need
professionals like us.

508
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,542
We handle, er, how many cases
on the books, Anthony?

509
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:55,254
- One.
- Too many to count, really.

510
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,257
But we really feel that
we can find your daughter.

511
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,259
- Find her?
- Yes.

512
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:04,054
Who says Catalina disappear?
Like I already told woman.

513
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,597
What woman?

514
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,601
Woman policeman.
Name Virgin Woolf. Very nice.

515
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,063
I say my daughter never home.
Takes after mother.

516
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:17,568
All I have is broken condom
that turns into son here.

517
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,112
Hey! Hey!

518
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,490
So how much money
we talk about?

519
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,617
Er, not very much money.

520
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,828
Our fee is $400 a day
plus expenses.

521
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,706
And we'd need a $2,000 retainer.

522
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,791
How about 100 euros?

523
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,376
What, a day?

524
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,961
No, the whole thing.

525
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,756
Give me 100 euros,
I can help you find sister.

526
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,008
When she first start
fucking for money,

527
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,178
I drive her a little bit
for, how you say, protection.

528
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,014
I could show you where I took her.

529
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,225
Her favourite client.
Maybe he knows where she is.

530
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,146
Look, the way this works
is that you would actually pay us...

531
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,607
- Here, take it.
- What are you doing?

532
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,443
- You have a car?
- You just paid him.

533
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,613
We could have got the retainer.
What are you doing, man?

534
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:06,575
I think
Pinocchio needs his nose clipped.

535
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,871
Oh, God!

536
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:19,797
And this will teach this little piggy
not to point.

537
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:28,931
That car is tailing us.
It has been since the pig farm.

538
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,600
They were snapping shots
of us.

539
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,019
Uh-oh. It could be the cops.

540
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,063
Whoop whoop-whoop whoop.

541
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,483
- Do you want me to lose them?
- Yes, I do.

542
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,985
OK, why are we going off the road?

543
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,196
- Tree!
- Left, left, left!

544
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,573
I think I peed a little bit.

545
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,043
Shit.

546
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,420
- Oh, damn, you all right?
- Yeah. You?

547
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,005
Yeah.

548
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,049
Yo, where's your boy at?

549
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,932
- Oh, man, he look dead.
- You OK?

550
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,603
Come on, man.

551
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,438
Shoulda wore that belt.

552
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,441
Come on, man. You all right?

553
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,944
You need a doctor.
We'll take a taxi.

554
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,492
Hello?

555
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,453
The fish that got away.
Has it been fried yet?

556
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,414
Er, don't worry.

557
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,249
We've got the borders sealed.

558
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,502
She'll hardly go to the police,
though we have friends there.

559
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,713
I'm not worried about the police.

560
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,509
You may be able to get away with
burying 5,000 people in a mass grave

561
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:52,264
but in America, a hint of scandal
and the Senate will be up my ass.

562
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,434
If I see that girl on TV in anything
other than a body bag,

563
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,895
the closest you'll get
to a missile contract

564
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,272
is reading about them
in the newspaper.

565
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,692
- Jesus, Bill, it wasn't me who...
- Don't Jesus Bill me.

566
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,279
- Just find the girl.
- It's being done. Trust me.

567
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,740
Carver's got his best man on it.

568
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,743
Well, I believe you now, Mr Ryder.

569
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,538
You really don't have
any additional information for me.

570
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,916
I apologise for
taking up your morning,

571
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,044
but I'm sure you appreciate
the value of being thorough.

572
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,588
A job worth doing
is worth doing well,

573
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,673
as my dear old mum used to say.

574
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,801
Kill me.

575
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,055
Ooh, now.
What's the magic word?

576
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,726
Please. Kill me.

577
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,395
- Fucking bitch.
- That's the one.

578
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,483
Well, I'll say goodbye to you, sir.

579
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,278
Now, do you need a moment?

580
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,492
Anthony Hester and Julian Simms,
American nationals.

581
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,455
When Cat called you, that was from
Julian's cell and Anthony's car.

582
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,209
- Why they are talking to the family?
- They're private detectives.

583
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,461
- Working for who?
- We don't know.

584
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,422
But Julian gave 100 euros
to the brother.

585
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,800
- Is that a problem for us?
- Maybe.

586
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,677
Want me to ring the bank?

587
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,429
No, no,
we'll deal with it ourselves.

588
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,434
Bonjour, comment ça va?

589
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,895
Bonjour, mademoiselles.

590
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,022
Er, où est...

591
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,358
Rue de Bon? Rue de Bun?

592
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:31,029
We're looking for Rudible. Ladies,
you wanna help us out? S'il vous plaît?

593
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,781
You saw the high scarf?

594
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,700
Those weren't words you said.

595
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,495
You wanna deal with girls or you
wanna start a detective agency?

596
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,080
I wanna do both.

597
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,000
You need to focus
on finding Catalina, I think

598
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,545
Oh! Anthony
and Catalina sitting in a tree...

599
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:51,133
There is no-one like her
to draw venom from my serpent.

600
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,225
More sweetly than any other one.

601
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,853
So, you're saying,
as a blowjob provider,

602
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,772
Cat's head and shoulders
above the rest?

603
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,607
"A blowjob provider"?

604
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,863
That would be like calling
Caravaggio a house painter.

605
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,825
Gentlemen, would you like
some tea? Chamomile.

606
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,577
Sure, I'll have a cup.

607
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,912
You are not to be
easily shocked, are you?

608
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,914
- No, no.
- Us? No, go on.

609
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,251
Cat produced from me
a jet of semen,

610
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,961
which travelled some 11 feet.

611
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:32,466
It was like the salty exhale
of the great white whale

612
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,217
in Melville's classic tome.

613
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,762
Let me show you something.

614
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,639
This is a mark here she leaves.

615
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,227
"Le plaisir de Cat".

616
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:47,689
Wow. From the windows
to the walls. That's nice shooting.

617
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,232
Indeed.

618
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,152
Let me ask you something,
gentlemen.

619
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:57,949
If I help you find her, will there
be any, er, pecuniary rewards?

620
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,078
I don't want to sound
too bourgeois,

621
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,206
but my needs
are quite varied and exotic.

622
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,085
Well, the reward will be
very large and pecuniary,

623
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,755
and, er, Catalina's father's
filthy rich, he's rolling in it.

624
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:16,093
Very well. I obtained her services
through a man named Ryder.

625
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,761
Do you have a number?

626
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,680
Better yet, gentlemen.
His address.

627
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,608
- Hi.
- Hi.

628
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,945
OK. It's a level-five encryption.

629
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,655
- Level-five?
- Uh-huh.

630
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,407
Wow, that might be a problem.

631
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,993
If anyone can do it, you can.
You are my little genius.

632
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,122
Thank you. After all these years,
you haven't changed.

633
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,291
I'll bring the hard drive
and passport to the hotel

634
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,544
as soon as it's ready.

635
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,004
You sure you got the right place?

636
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,965
It's the address he wrote down.

637
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,176
- I didn't sign up for this.
- It's a little sketchy.

638
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,928
Can we go back?

639
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,305
Come on, we're right here.
You ready?

640
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:03,932
No.

641
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:10,939
What kind of pimp doesn't open
up for a potential doubleheader?

642
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,150
A dead pimp.

643
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,667
Oh, shit.

644
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,169
How bad is it?

645
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,131
Remember when you started that
lawn mower with the kittens inside?

646
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,717
- Yeah.
- This is much worse.

647
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,094
Oh, damn!

648
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,805
You weren't kidding
about the dead part.

649
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,600
Ah-Ah! What the hell?

650
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,143
Are those? Ahhhh!

651
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,604
Chick who did this
must have been pissed.

652
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,564
What, a female did this?

653
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,525
- I think so.
- Wanna see what she looks like?

654
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,402
- That blinking light.
- Shit!

655
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:01,281
Security cam. I'm thinking
it recorded everything.

656
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:05,076
Our sick, castrating bitch missed
it cos it was bright outside.

657
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,579
Course, I could be wrong,
but I don't think so.

658
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,509
Look at this lady plying her trade.

659
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,512
Oh, she's plying
more than a trade.

660
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:27,599
Ohhh, God! Ohhhh!

661
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,310
Oh, my God. Is she going for the...

662
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,230
Not the nuts, not the n-n-n... No!

663
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,610
...on a houseboat
on the river in Italy...

664
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,987
- What? Italy?
... near Ferrara.

665
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,242
The arsehole sold her out!
He sold the baby down the river!

666
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,370
- We should probably warn her.
- Let me see this.

667
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,789
Er, Grushenka,
Grushenka, Grushenka...

668
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:54,459
- No Grushenkas here.
- Look for, er, Agrafena.

669
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,712
- Agrafena?
- Grushenka's short for Agrafena.

670
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,214
Grushenka's longer.

671
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:02,551
It's three syllab...
Just look for the fucking number.

672
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,678
It's like the backwards Ks and Hs.

673
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:09,891
- Read The Brothers Karamazov.
- You just read the Cliff Notes.

674
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,393
I read it. Look up the number.

675
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,063
Well, I'll be damned!
OK, here, you talk to her.

676
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,149
- Why don't you talk to her?
- No, dude, I'm nervous.

677
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,734
My stomach's bubbling.

678
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,362
- I get sweaty armpits.
- Shut the fuck up.

679
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,918
Grushenka, listen.
Someone is coming to kill you.

680
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,962
A very bad lady
is coming to kill you.

681
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,758
Get out now. Someone is coming
to kill you and the baby.

682
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,470
She's speaking Russian.

683
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,389
What? Russian? Oh, let me see.

684
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,016
You speak Russian?

685
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,101
I had a Russian girlfriend once.

686
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,734
Bitch!
Get the fuck out of here!

687
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:05,071
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!

688
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,616
I'll kill you!
Get the fuck out of here!

689
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,370
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll kill you!

690
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,418
- You think she understood that?
- Do you think I did?

691
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,338
I think we need to
go warn her in person.

692
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,237
I like you very much, young lady.

693
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:50,158
Your resilience, and dedication
to your friend is admirable.

694
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,868
Oh-oh-oh.

695
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,745
There we are.

696
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:58,917
You must understand,
I will find Catalina anyway,

697
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,461
and then your sacrifice
and your nobility

698
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,088
will all have been in vain.

699
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:07,759
Oh dear, oh dear.

700
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,514
Do you see these?

701
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,809
These are to remind me
of courage.

702
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,812
I had them made from the teeth
of a young man

703
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,647
I interrogated in the Yemen.

704
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:24,484
He held out
for eight days straight.

705
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,862
The last thing he said to me
before he died,

706
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,534
having told us absolutely nothing,
by the way, was the F word.

707
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,831
Ahh, look who's just woken up.

708
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,749
Hello.

709
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:46,339
- Please...
- Hello! Hello, relax.

710
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,927
Please leave the baby out of this.

711
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,429
Leave him alone.

712
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:58,101
Hola.
How are you, little one?

713
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:03,857
Leave him alone!
Please let Alex be.

714
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:08,361
Oh, you like this toy, do you?

715
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:12,699
Where is Cat, Grushenka?

716
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:16,035
I liked this detective idea
but I'm ready to wait tables.

717
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,330
- We gotta save this girl.
- You think she's still alive?

718
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know. I hope so.

719
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,503
This is morphine.
It will make your death painless.

720
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,633
I really don't know where she is.

721
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,969
Shh.

722
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:37,640
- I believe you.
- Please, the baby.

723
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:43,771
Yes, yes, I'll call the police.
They'll take care of him.

724
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:52,405
I want you to know
I would never hurt a tiny baby.

725
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,955
Not on a Sunday.

726
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,173
Hey! Hey!

727
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,676
Don't you know how to drive?
I'm wet, bitch!

728
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,806
- Hello?
- Hello, this is Virgin Woolf?

729
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,391
This is Virginia Woolf.

730
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,644
This is Catalina's father.
Remember me?

731
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,271
Good morning, Mr Rona.
How may I help you?

732
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:31,319
Hello?

733
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,198
Oh, God.

734
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,617
Ma'am, are you OK?

735
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,577
Say something.

736
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,621
- Come on, I got you.
- Miss. Hello?

737
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,002
Splen... Splendid?

738
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,464
Oh, God.

739
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,344
- What's going on?
- I think she's dead.

740
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,638
She said something like
"splendid" before...

741
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,641
Jesus. Oh, no.

742
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,435
I think she meant
the Splendid Hotel in Budva.

743
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,104
That's probably where Cat is.

744
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:11,484
Dex, I need tickets to Constalova.
We'll staying at the Splendid Hotel.

745
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,611
And send some thermal underwear.

746
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,405
So you will buy me a new van?

747
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:19,242
- It would be my pleasure.
- With AC, CD, DVD, and TV?

748
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:23,705
Fully equipped. What information
do you have for me?

749
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,541
Two guys came, wanted to know
about my daughter.

750
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,668
Asking many questions.

751
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,047
Here. They gave card.

752
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,757
So, you pay me now?

753
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,759
Oh, yes, I'll pay you now.

754
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,553
Do you need a moment?

755
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,221
For what?

756
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,394
No, Ronas, no stay here.

757
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:50,690
No Ronas? OK, see if
you have a Cat or a Catalina.

758
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:54,235
Sir, we have 370 rooms
and over 1,000 guests.

759
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,363
OK, she's a short girl, 5'4", 5'5",

760
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,283
long, dark hair,
nice low-opening booty.

761
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,036
Got up-top heavy breasts,
skimpy dress.

762
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,537
No, I'm sorry.

763
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,372
All right, well, let me get a room.

764
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,374
It is magic convention today.

765
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,628
I am afraid we have only
Presidential Suite apartment.

766
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,922
But it's much too expensive.
It's 2,400 euros.

767
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,633
- 2,400 euros?
- Yes.

768
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,302
OK. You, er,
you come with the room?

769
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:20,803
No, I'm sorry.

770
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,139
- You don't come with the room?
- No.

771
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,521
Hello?

772
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,024
- Can I help you?
- Hello.

773
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,985
Is this the Juan Detective Agency?

774
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,656
- It's Ju-An. Come on in.
- Thank you.

775
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,240
Can I get you anything?

776
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,577
We have a lovely selection
of herbal teas.

777
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,830
Or are you just looking for
a good date?

778
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,250
How very kind.
Nothing for me, thank you.

779
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,628
My name's Emily Brontë.

780
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,214
I'm from
the National Security Agency.

781
00:52:56,382 --> 00:53:00,051
I believe you're working on a case
of great importance to us.

782
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,137
A missing girl. Catalina Rona.

783
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,475
Emily Brontë?

784
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,977
Like the writer lady?

785
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,563
Died of, er, TB or some shit?

786
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,982
Well, yes, as a matter of fact.

787
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,778
Well, Miss Brontë,
I can't discuss the case with you.

788
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,155
You'll have to
talk to my employers.

789
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,116
When might I be able to do that?

790
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,285
Well, they're in the field,
so it might be a few days.

791
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,331
And what field might that be?

792
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,500
Why don't you
give me your number,

793
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,961
and I'll be happy to pass it on?

794
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,046
Or you could just
give me that note

795
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,091
that you slipped into
the Gospel of St John.

796
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,592
You...

797
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,054
You, er,
you read that upside down.

798
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,515
I did.

799
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,475
You did.

800
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,571
Oh, Lord.

801
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,575
Oh, damn.

802
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,127
Oh, my goodness.

803
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,385
Oh, put them away.

804
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,223
Sweet baby Jesus.

805
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,647
Nice. Oh!

806
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:21,108
Oh, king size!
I got this. I got all this.

807
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:24,111
You make your phone calls.
I'm going to put him to bed.

808
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,240
OK, we just need to
find your mom, that's all.

809
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,867
Shh, it's all right.

810
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:37,333
Hi, my name is Julian.
I'm looking for Cat or Catalina.

811
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,627
Hello? Hello?

812
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,337
OK, all right.

813
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,507
Let's take a little look at
what you got here, OK?

814
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,763
Can you shut the baby up?

815
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:54,475
Hello? Hi? I'm looking for
a Cat or Catalina.

816
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,353
- No, no, housekeeping.
- Oh, I'm sorry, OK.

817
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,730
Well, yeah, can we get
more towels up here, then?

818
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,524
Yes, yes, moment.

819
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,629
One new message.

820
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,882
Er, hi, my name's Julian Simms...

821
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,769
There she is. Is that her?

822
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,355
I recognise that rack.

823
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,441
How do I look?

824
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:46,819
You're good, let me see.
Collar's cool.

825
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,614
What about the 'fro? 'Fro's good?

826
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,617
The boats. See her boats?

827
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,243
Get her number this time.

828
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:57,914
Come on. Give him to me.
Give me my baby.

829
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,750
- It's OK.
- Give him to me. Come on.

830
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,801
Sit down.

831
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,554
I have a gun in my bag.

832
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,016
You try anything, I swear to God,
I will shoot you in the balls.

833
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,893
It's OK. It's not necessary.

834
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,104
Not to mention impossible,
since you don't really have a gun.

835
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,857
Man, you could be wrong.

836
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,234
Who are you guys, hm?

837
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,487
You don't recognise us?

838
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,447
- I stole your car.
- And my phone.

839
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:34,784
With my ringtones, numbers,
I had those pictures.

840
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,452
What do you want?

841
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,423
- What the fuck, man?
- I know you did not just slap me.

842
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,094
We're private investigators.
Your father hired us to find you.

843
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:56,013
- My father?
- I mean, technically, we're not...

844
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,890
Ah, OK, he's worried about you.

845
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:02,103
All he's worried about is the money
I stopped sending after Mum died.

846
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,938
You all don't get along?

847
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,023
You could say that.

848
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:09,318
Yes! My father and I
were the same way.

849
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,405
He preferred my brother,
take him fishing and stuff.

850
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:14,240
My father beat me with a belt

851
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,701
and made me sleep in the barn
with pigs.

852
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,953
Yes, yours is substantially worse.

853
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,539
- That's bad. Yeah.
- Why have you got my son?

854
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,583
- Agrafena is dead.
- Who is Agrafena?

855
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:29,130
- Grushenka's short for Agrafena.
- Nobody been reading that book.

856
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,341
- You gotta get them Cliff Notes.
- Grushenka's dead?

857
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,843
Yeah. And Ryder.

858
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,886
Dead. Gone, six feet under.

859
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,930
- He's my pimp.
- No, not any more.

860
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,517
- He's pimped out.
- They tried to kill our assistant,

861
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,060
cut his fucking arm off.

862
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,731
What kind of person cuts
a one-armed man's only arm off?

863
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:50,026
Cat, it's the kind of person
that cuts someone's balls off.

864
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,945
- They are going to find you.
- Find you.

865
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,949
They'll chop you up like a tomato.
We need to get you out of here.

866
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:02,371
No, I can't. I'm waiting for someone.
My room is 432. Meet me there.

867
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,541
Wait. No, I'm gonna go with you.
Get the check, OK?

868
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,543
How you gonna tell ME
to get the check?

869
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:11,756
You want me to get the check?
I don't... I didn't order these nuts.

870
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,003
Coming out?

871
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,130
Going down?

872
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,091
Yes, please.

873
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,220
- Um, what floor?
- Oh, that'll do fine.

874
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,722
Er, OK.

875
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,901
- After you.
- Thank you.

876
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,682
Help. She's trying to kill me.

877
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,560
Look, she's a psychotic killer.
Look how tall she is!

878
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,981
Where's your friend gone
with Catalina?

879
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,608
Damn.

880
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,781
- Who is it?
- It's me.

881
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,742
Come along now, we haven't
got all day. Chop chop.

882
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,953
What did you do?
How did you bring her here?

883
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,414
I didn't bring her here.
She's got a gun.

884
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,584
Please. Please!

885
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,634
Alone at last.

886
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,305
Now, would you mind
closing those curtains?

887
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,853
You have a delectable accent.
Where are you from?

888
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,148
- I'm gonna try something.
- I'm from Canada.

889
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:38,694
I take back all the bad things
I've ever said about Canadians.

890
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:42,364
Now, how are you two involved?

891
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,783
We're private detectives.

892
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:52,666
I'm sorry.

893
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,337
Why does everybody react like that?

894
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,590
- Who is it?
- Ivan for Cat.

895
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,764
I'm here for Cat. Is she here?

896
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,810
Do come in.

897
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:20,402
Hey, guys, Siegfried is looking for
a new Roy in room 432.

898
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,363
Wow!

899
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,950
Aha. Lovely.

900
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,370
Now, we're almost done.

901
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,250
- Ladies first.
- Please, I have a child.

902
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,876
Oh, my dear Catalina.

903
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:40,798
If I had a shilling for every time
someone said that, I wouldn't be here.

904
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,883
But someone else would.

905
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,510
Now,

906
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,095
do you need a moment?

907
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,640
Wait! My partner and I have a DVD

908
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:52,309
of you performing surgery,
a cockectomy,

909
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,937
on a dirty pimp,
with no medical licence.

910
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,398
You could be in a lot of trouble.

911
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,651
I'm getting old.

912
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,612
Don't beat yourself up.
It was bright outside.

913
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,407
- You couldn't see the light blink.
- Where's the tape?

914
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:11,078
Oh, OK. A question.
See? We're starting to negotiate.

915
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,914
I only need one of you
to tell me where the tape is.

916
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,836
I'm beginning to lose my patience.

917
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,760
I'm looking for Siegfried.
You must be his assistant.

918
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,390
Look.

919
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,103
Could you excuse me?

920
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,404
Come on!

921
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,166
Lady, get down!

922
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,923
In. In. In.

923
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:18,145
What are you doing?
No, you're not. Dude.

924
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,737
OK. OK, this is crazy.

925
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,697
Oh, my God.

926
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,121
OK, give me the baby.

927
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:40,292
Oh!

928
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,838
Give me a second.
You don't want to see me naked.

929
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,635
What are you doing? Hurry up!

930
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:58,060
Oh, God. Shit!

931
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:04,358
Man! Help!

932
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:05,943
Out the way!

933
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:15,994
Hey, where are you going?

934
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,924
Oh, good work, Helen.

935
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,718
The money will be
in your account tomorrow.

936
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,263
We had a little collateral
along the way.

937
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:36,432
That's in the "shit happens" column.

938
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,185
Who's a good boy?

939
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,147
Mm. So, Daniel, tell me.

940
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,566
You didn't know that
those two pubescents

941
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:50,154
- were playing detective, did you?
- No, not until you told me.

942
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,114
There's no-one else on the job?

943
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,615
Of course not.

944
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,201
I know you like to work alone.

945
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,911
More than anything.

946
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:03,417
Mr Jakovic wanted me to extend
an invite to his fundraising party.

947
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:07,546
For the American
Secretary of Defense.

948
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,424
Ooh, a posh do. How delicious.

949
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:13,427
You know how I like to dress up.

950
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:19,057
Helen, have you ever regretted
that you and I?

951
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,435
It's for the best, Daniel.

952
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,604
We'll always have Angola.

953
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,666
We're bringing someone else in.
Helen's done with this.

954
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,252
Yeah. We have full containment.

955
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,421
OK.

956
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,590
Such a brave little girl.

957
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:55,093
Are you having fun today
with your daddy?

958
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,942
Helen was a good soldier.

959
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,569
The best. An army of one.

960
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,489
Do you think she took a peek
at the hard drive?

961
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,282
Probably not.

962
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,660
But I couldn't take that risk.

963
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:22,871
It's all right, Bob.

964
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,998
Old soldiers never die.

965
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,501
They just get blown away.

966
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,311
Hello, Bob.
Tell her you'll call her back.

967
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,816
Do get in.

968
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,493
A nod to the wise, my dear.

969
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,830
You only need a little dab of
Acqua di Parma behind each ear.

970
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:07,833
And I gave up on
those old trip switches years ago.

971
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:11,378
Ten-second delay. Tut tut.
Dear, oh dear.

972
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,048
Now, all you need to do
is answer one or two questions,

973
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,092
and we can wrap this up.

974
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:21,054
Otherwise, I have
a lovely soundproof basement.

975
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,723
I can rig up a saline drip,

976
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:26,727
and we can make it last a
couple of crispy, crunchy weeks.

977
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,606
And after that, I'll go and find
that lovely daughter of yours, in...

978
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,399
Where is she? Lupiana?

979
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,276
Please don't hurt her.

980
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,361
Who's replacing me?

981
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,113
Sean Moody.

982
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,657
Ah, my favourite Scotsman.
Is he in town?

983
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,868
He's at the Hotel Riviera.

984
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,787
Marvellous. Thank you so much.

985
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,914
It was nothing personal, Helen.

986
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,627
Oh, no, of course not.
I always liked you, Bob.

987
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,588
Now, do you need a moment?

988
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,496
Look at you, sweetheart.

989
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:32,376
You are a wee fucking ride,
so you are.

990
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,839
Fucking hell, man.

991
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:47,557
Oh, man.

992
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,851
Oh, I'm a big man, huh?

993
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:54,106
Look at that fella.
You could cut diamonds with that.

994
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:58,902
Fuck. Who the fuck is this?

995
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,654
- Hello?
- It's Carver.

996
01:10:00,822 --> 01:10:02,489
- What?
- Carver. We found the girl.

997
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,492
Aye, hang on, hang on,
let me get a fucking pen.

998
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,690
Anthony.

999
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:38,442
Can you take him, please?

1000
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,193
Yeah.

1001
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,237
OK.

1002
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,454
You smell good.

1003
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,039
We found her.

1004
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,544
You see
how many people there are?

1005
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,671
Of all those people,
we found your mom.

1006
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,757
Everything's OK on the bed.

1007
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,011
Are you going to do
gymnastics for me?

1008
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,804
Yeah? Side, side.

1009
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,598
A little breakdance.

1010
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,641
Yeah!

1011
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,144
Chook, chook! Take my nose.

1012
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,480
I don't need it.
I've smelled enough stuff.

1013
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,273
Go on, take it, take it.

1014
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,817
I know, I know.

1015
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,491
He was asking for you.

1016
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,494
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, he's very impatient.

1017
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,213
This one, this one, this one.

1018
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,007
How many words do you think
you'll be able to say?

1019
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,642
Thank you.

1020
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,521
You're welcome.

1021
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:03,109
Low fucking profile?
Under fucking cover?

1022
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,779
What the fuck
do you call this thing?

1023
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,615
- Mr Moody, right?
- That's me, pal.

1024
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,408
What's happening?

1025
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:14,287
They've been in hotel room 502
for the past three hours.

1026
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,917
Listen, Mr Moody, all due respect,
but why we not coming with you?

1027
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,877
I mean, we follow them for days.

1028
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,671
Why are we cut out now, man?

1029
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:25,090
Cos you're a couple of
fucking ball-bag cunts.

1030
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:26,758
What'd your boss tell you?

1031
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:30,345
Well, um, he told us that
you are some terrorism specialist

1032
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,223
and you have to handle this alone,
but...

1033
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,892
Well, there you go.
Do us a wee favour.

1034
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:40,230
Sit here, eat your sweeties,
jerk off in your coffee cup,

1035
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:43,817
and shut your fucking mouth,
you ethnic-cleansing pricks.

1036
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:46,820
I like this guy!

1037
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,542
Shh.

1038
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,086
Nae cunt fucking moves.

1039
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:06,256
On your feet, Nancy boy.

1040
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:09,009
Any chance
you have the wrong room?

1041
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,677
No.

1042
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:13,305
On your feet, pal.

1043
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,107
What's going on? Who are you?

1044
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,987
Right, listen.

1045
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,615
Yous are all going to die
in a few minutes.

1046
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:36,411
Now, how you die, well,
that's up to doll-face here.

1047
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,830
Now...

1048
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:43,376
Is that a wean? For fuck's sake.
I've not killed a wean for ages.

1049
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:47,631
- Please. Please.
- I've been watching you, hen.

1050
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,799
Look at me
when I'm talking to you.

1051
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,010
You're a pure ride, so you are.

1052
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:54,679
I just got back
from doing a wee job in Kabul.

1053
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:59,017
You've got more chance of getting
laid in nunnery than you have there.

1054
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:02,854
My balls, they are
fucking busting, so they are.

1055
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:06,566
So if you'll just give us
a wee gobble,

1056
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,444
you can all have a dose
of Mr Sweet Dreams here.

1057
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,029
But if you will nae...

1058
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:17,243
well, then, I'm afraid,
it's going to get a wee bit messy.

1059
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,289
Sorry, but I don't understand
anything that you just said.

1060
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,916
For fuck's sake, man!

1061
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:26,294
Does nae cunt speak English
in this fucking country?

1062
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,005
Just say it again, please.

1063
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:35,679
Lf... you... suck... my dick, huh?

1064
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:37,764
You got me so far? Capiche, no?

1065
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:41,893
If you suck my dick,
I will kill you all quickly.

1066
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,478
But if no...

1067
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,649
I will cut
soft lad's little prick off here

1068
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,610
and stuff it in his fucking mouth.

1069
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,737
Comprende?
Are you with me now?

1070
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,281
That's enough. Enough.
Leave her alone.

1071
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,703
Oh, Anthony, Anthony,
don't do anything, please.

1072
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,373
I don't usually like to interfere
but you're being a dick.

1073
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,083
You don't like to interfere?

1074
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:07,752
Hang on, son.
Hang on just a minute. Hang on.

1075
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,677
Ho ho ho!

1076
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,512
For fuck's sake, son!

1077
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,265
You just cannae get enough
of the ball-booting.

1078
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,100
You cannae get enough of it,
wee man.

1079
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,811
Cannae fucking get enough of it.
Sit doon.

1080
01:15:26,981 --> 01:15:29,399
Now, where were we?

1081
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,695
Come on.
Say, keep that wean quiet.

1082
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,363
That's it. Lick your lips.

1083
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:38,491
Here comes the choo-choo.

1084
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,480
OK, what just happened?

1085
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,787
Shit.

1086
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,167
Who is it?

1087
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,752
It's Helen Bingham.

1088
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:34,130
I've just saved your lives.
Would you open the door, please?

1089
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,801
Or should I call room service

1090
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,553
to clean up
the dead body on your bed?

1091
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,933
I'm not going to kill you.

1092
01:16:46,644 --> 01:16:48,311
You can put the gun away now.

1093
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,648
Who was that guy?

1094
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,692
That was a Mr Sean Moody,

1095
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:58,404
a priapic killer of some repute
and my proposed replacement.

1096
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,365
But why'd his head blow off?

1097
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,700
Sub-sonic explosive tipped round.

1098
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,745
He deserved to go out with a bang.

1099
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,918
What're you calling
me for now, ya bastard?

1100
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,003
We've got a situation, Moody.

1101
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,631
Bingham got away.
Watch your back.

1102
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,843
Thank you,
Daniel. I'll pass that along.

1103
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,055
Who's paying you to kill us?

1104
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:27,392
- And why should we trust you?
- Very good questions

1105
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:31,521
but right now, we need to get out
of the country. Come along.

1106
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,953
I'd very much appreciate it if
you didn't mention my profession.

1107
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,415
Or the... fact that I... smoke.

1108
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,128
- Hello, Mummy.
- Oh, Helen!

1109
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:58,423
- What a nice surprise!
- Happy birthday, Mummy.

1110
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,758
Oh, darling,
you never forget, do you?

1111
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,219
- Of course not.
- And you've brought friends.

1112
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,930
Come in, everybody.
Come in, all of you.

1113
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,974
There we go. There we...

1114
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,894
Oh, my goodness!

1115
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:14,022
What wonderful creature is this?

1116
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:15,815
His name is Alex.

1117
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:20,153
Alex. He's beautiful. May I?

1118
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:22,906
Mm, yeah.

1119
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:24,616
Ooh!

1120
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,827
My goodness.

1121
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:30,747
- He likes you.
- Babies love me.

1122
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,832
And I love babies.

1123
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,293
They're a blessing.

1124
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,130
They're life's way of making up
for the way it all inevitably ends.

1125
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,257
You know, we all start off

1126
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:44,677
being wide-eyed little angels
like him...

1127
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,347
don't we, Helen?

1128
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,600
- Yes, Mummy. Shall we go in?
- Of course. Come on.

1129
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:53,937
This cake is just scrumptious.

1130
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,608
I don't know how you did it
with what little I keep in.

1131
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,526
Oh, it's nothing.

1132
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,112
Helen, darling,
have you gained weight?

1133
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,240
I think perhaps you've
had enough of that sweet stuff.

1134
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,118
Darling,
you're not a young girl any more.

1135
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,287
You need to take care of yourself.

1136
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:15,083
I won't always be around
to look after you, you know.

1137
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,752
Yes. Mummy,
isn't it time you went back to bed?

1138
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,337
It's getting terribly late.

1139
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:23,257
Oh. All right, all right.
I know when I'm not wanted.

1140
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:27,762
And I do think all that sugar's
made me feel very tired.

1141
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:31,516
Now, you know where the extra
blankets and pillows are?

1142
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,101
Yes, course.

1143
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:37,021
Thank you all for a very,
very grand birthday party.

1144
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,731
Bless you. Darling.

1145
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:40,692
I do love you, you know.

1146
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,902
- Yes. Love you, too, Mummy.
- Good night.

1147
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,988
- Night-night.
- Good night.

1148
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,990
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Bingham.

1149
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:48,783
Well, that explains a lot.

1150
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,203
Now, we need to
get that hard drive back.

1151
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,789
Won't he have wiped it clean already?

1152
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:58,042
Jakovic's company makes
weapon systems for the military.

1153
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,378
He won't give that up.
It's leverage.

1154
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,256
But they'd both be finished
if the film got out.

1155
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:06,009
Krebb only needs to know
that Jakovic has it.

1156
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:09,387
He never needs to use it.
It's nuclear brinkmanship.

1157
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,687
Cat, what's wrong?

1158
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,605
Whoa!
Where are you going with that?

1159
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,566
- Cat?
- Fuck all this shit.

1160
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,276
You killed Grushenka.

1161
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,195
Put the gun away, child,
you'll hurt yourself.

1162
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,740
How can you just kill
innocent people?

1163
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,785
I don't know. I've never met
an innocent person.

1164
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:35,288
The only difference
between our professions

1165
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:39,959
is that when I blow people away,
they don't ejaculate on my breasts.

1166
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:47,800
Feeling better?

1167
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,178
Tell me why
I shouldn't just kill you now.

1168
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:55,016
Because there'll be another
Sean Moody along in a minute.

1169
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:57,060
Or another Helen Bingham.

1170
01:20:57,227 --> 01:21:01,022
We are the only people who know
what's on that hard drive.

1171
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,691
If we don't find it
and expose it to the world,

1172
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,359
then we're all dead.

1173
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:09,614
I don't kill babies but my colleagues
would have no such compunction.

1174
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:11,449
They will find you and Alex,

1175
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:15,369
and kill you in the most creative
way they can possibly think of

1176
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,246
and you will just disappear.

1177
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,084
Now, shall we get back
to business, my dear?

1178
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,377
You are going to
get us into this party.

1179
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,463
Me?

1180
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:29,133
I hacked into the guest list.
One of your co-workers is on it.

1181
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:30,802
You need to give her a call

1182
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,429
and offer her
double what she's being paid.

1183
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,348
And how's your Scottish accent?

1184
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:36,974
Scottish... Oh, it's terrible.

1185
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,686
A wean? For fuck's sake.

1186
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:44,816
I've not seen a wean for ages.

1187
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,734
Oh, dear.

1188
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,486
L- I could try.

1189
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:56,994
Aye, is that a wean? Fuck's sake!
I've not killed a wean for ages.

1190
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,288
- Aye.
- Lovely.

1191
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,635
Hello there.

1192
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,178
Isabella?

1193
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,764
Ho ho!

1194
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,226
I could fall in love with you,
so I could.

1195
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:26,190
Maurice did good.
Driver, here's the parking pass.

1196
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,861
Do you speak English?

1197
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:37,577
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you stopping the car?

1198
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,538
Your regular driver
couldn't make it tonight.

1199
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:42,415
Hey?

1200
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,794
- Good evening.
- Who the fuck are y?

1201
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:06,522
Could you open the trunk for us,
please?

1202
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:08,900
- Aye.
- Mr McPhee?

1203
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:13,196
Mr Angus Tyrone Denzel McPhee.

1204
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,114
Good evening

1205
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:18,826
- You RSVPd one person, sir.
- One whore or two, who cares?

1206
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,622
What difference does it make?

1207
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,749
It doesn't matter!

1208
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,961
Would you calm down?

1209
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,632
Move on. Move on, please.

1210
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,766
Don't be nervous.

1211
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,809
This is the fun bit.

1212
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,561
I'm fine.

1213
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,279
Here we go.

1214
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,073
Welcome.

1215
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,242
- Good evening.
- Aye, aye.

1216
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,086
Testing, testing.

1217
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,879
- Copy.
- Copy.

1218
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,092
- After you, my dear.
- I'm downstairs with the drivers.

1219
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,886
Come on through.

1220
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,269
Keep calm. Keep smiling.

1221
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,571
Oh, "Ave Maria". How lovely.

1222
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,828
Three security on the upper floor.

1223
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:47,290
Are you sure we're
going to get away with this?

1224
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,501
Aye.

1225
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,180
Thank you so much
for hosting this thing.

1226
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:06,976
It's a nice party, beautiful home,
stunning daughters.

1227
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,687
Would you like
a tour of the house?

1228
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:14,191
Honey, er, let him catch
his breath, take a drink.

1229
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,030
Everyone remember their assignments?

1230
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,324
I'm a bit terrified, honestly.

1231
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,617
Oh, stiff upper lip, bro.

1232
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:37,673
What, hoots, man. It's a braw,
bricht, moonlicht nicht.

1233
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:39,967
- You're Scottish?
- I be, aye.

1234
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,388
You heard of a black Irish? Well,
I be a black-eyed Scotsman, aye.

1235
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,266
- Of course I am.
- You don't look Scottish.

1236
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,477
I don't look Scottish?

1237
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,145
Is that what you said?

1238
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,481
You don't wanna know
what you look like.

1239
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:57,151
You look like a one-legged gypsy
whore of a goat herder.

1240
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:59,403
Don't make me slap you.

1241
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:03,616
I lift my kilt, you see my boots.
See my black snake moan. Sss.

1242
01:26:03,784 --> 01:26:06,243
- It may bite you...
- Is there a problem?

1243
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:10,331
- Sir, we need you to calm down.
- You want me to calm down?

1244
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:13,626
Don't make me slap... Look
at me when I'm talking to you.

1245
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,462
Excuse me. You can't be up here.

1246
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,590
I was looking for the ladies.
I've broken my necklace.

1247
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:22,385
- Go downstairs, please.
- Would you hold that?

1248
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:28,182
All clear on the upper floor.

1249
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,767
On my way.

1250
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:44,323
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm good. Sorry.

1251
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,825
Then get out.

1252
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:58,212
Krebb's got a small army down here,
fully armed. Just a heads up.

1253
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:05,219
Come in.

1254
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,306
Am I interrupting anything?

1255
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:14,145
- Good evening, Daniel.
- Helen.

1256
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,522
I'm so glad you could make it.

1257
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,607
I like your new look.

1258
01:27:18,775 --> 01:27:20,484
Well, thank you.

1259
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:23,154
You look... marvellous.

1260
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:26,240
You look very elegant, yourself.

1261
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:34,457
Is it morning already?

1262
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:36,125
Excuse me?

1263
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:39,420
I just saw the sun rise,
and it's blinding me.

1264
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:44,508
I have to introduce a political film,
same old stuff,

1265
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:49,305
- but afterwards, we could...
- Be terribly naughty?

1266
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,600
Oh, I'd like that.
I'd like that a lot.

1267
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:55,102
Sir, it's time for your speech.

1268
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:57,897
Promise me you'll wait?

1269
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,191
Say the magic word.

1270
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:30,471
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr William Krebb.

1271
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,727
Thank you so much.

1272
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:40,898
First, on behalf of myself and
all the people of the USA,

1273
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,735
thank you to our gracious hosts
for opening their beautiful home.

1274
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,946
Ivana and Branco Jakovic.

1275
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,822
How about a hand for them?

1276
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:55,037
Through my travels
throughout this region,

1277
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:59,250
I have felt only warmth
and welcome in their home,

1278
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:03,170
and have shown me an excellent time
in their beautiful country.

1279
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,632
Speaking of beautiful countries,
I don't know how you do it

1280
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,426
but the women here
are absolutely gorgeous.

1281
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,720
Must be something in the water.

1282
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,518
I don't suppose Razwell was
any trouble.

1283
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:19,728
No, no, no, Bob was a sweetheart.

1284
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,564
- Thank you, Daniel.
- My pleasure.

1285
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,817
- Who is it?
- It's me.

1286
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,569
Come in.

1287
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:31,156
- Who's this?
- I'm an associate.

1288
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,284
Hi, how are you?

1289
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,119
I'm fine.

1290
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:38,289
I'm assuming you have access
to various slush funds

1291
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,957
on behalf of your employer.

1292
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,294
If you'd transfer
all you can lay your hands on

1293
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,547
into this account,
I'd be most grateful.

1294
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:51,885
Now, I have
a little audio-visual programme,

1295
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,597
if I can figure out
how to work this.

1296
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,807
- Sir, can I help?
- This way? Yeah.

1297
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:01,687
- There you go.
- Well, that was easy. Thank you.

1298
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,773
I got the disk. I'm on my way.

1299
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:08,319
For the record, Helen,
it wasn't my idea.

1300
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,863
Of course not. Powers that be.

1301
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,781
Let's see how we've done.

1302
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,951
17 million and change.
Oh, yummy.

1303
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:21,248
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Damn you.

1304
01:30:27,505 --> 01:30:30,758
As many of you know, I have
been travelling through the region

1305
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:34,845
assuring our allies that
the anti-ballistic missile shield

1306
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:37,640
will give our troops
and our allies in Eastern Europe

1307
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:40,059
a new level of safety and security.

1308
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:42,895
Queensberry Rules?

1309
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,480
Of course.

1310
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,456
Nice.

1311
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,969
What are you doing here?

1312
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:19,098
Need to replace the HDMI
and reroute the components.

1313
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:23,018
If we don't get 1080p video,
we're all dead. I'm with ATI.

1314
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:26,438
Understand?
It means, get the fuck out.

1315
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:30,317
We have been facing a challenging
and complex new set of threats

1316
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,902
for this region.

1317
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,948
Iran's ballistic missiles prove to
be a significant risk to this area.

1318
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:40,077
The proposed ground-based...
interceptors...

1319
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:42,746
...will...

1320
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,417
Will what?

1321
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,963
Naughty, naughty.

1322
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:54,758
You didn't say the magic word.

1323
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,720
- You must be Mrs Jakovic.
- Yes.

1324
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:02,099
I can't believe I've been here
so many times and we never met.

1325
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:04,101
Who on earth is this person?

1326
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,729
I'm one of your husband's whores.

1327
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:14,653
Let's see, hmm.

1328
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:18,657
"America's commitment
to its allies. "

1329
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:24,329
Well, if that commitment includes
covering up sodomy and murder,

1330
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:28,542
I guess Branco and Bill here
are your guys.

1331
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:38,510
- That's enough of that.
- No, it's not enough. Not nearly.

1332
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,971
Home movie time.

1333
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:53,192
Stop! What are you doing?

1334
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:56,779
Oh, my God!

1335
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,782
What did you do?!

1336
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,868
Sabina! Sabina!

1337
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,661
Wake up.

1338
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,039
- Take this... Get it off now.
- Someone stop him!

1339
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,124
NOW!

1340
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:28,977
What are you doing? Come with me.

1341
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,687
Whoo!

1342
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,649
- You're beautiful.
- Ready for more?

1343
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,070
No-one in or out.
Full containment.

1344
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:41,573
- Full containment. Understood.
- OK, guys, we're on. Let's go.

1345
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,131
Do you need a moment?

1346
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:14,022
Stop. Hands up. Now.

1347
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,402
Who the hell are you?

1348
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:21,738
I'm Carver's man. How do you do?

1349
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:24,867
Ah, it's nice to finally meet you.

1350
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:27,578
Everybody
move into the main ballroom.

1351
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,454
Move, please.

1352
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:34,126
Let's go. Main ballroom. Move.

1353
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:37,129
You two, Pixie and Dixie,
how do you fit into all this?

1354
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:39,006
We're private investigators.

1355
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,968
That's great.

1356
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:45,888
Why is that funny?
Man, we got a website.

1357
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:48,891
Don't forget all those people
just saw that tape.

1358
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,935
Ah, yes, those poor people.

1359
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:55,397
Innocent victims
of another terrorist atrocity.

1360
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,191
What are you using there? C4?
HMX?

1361
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,027
What is this, 1982?

1362
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:03,322
This is ONC, Octanitrocubane.

1363
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:06,325
The most powerful non-nuclear
explosive in development.

1364
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,578
A sugar cube of this shit
would take out a tank.

1365
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:13,457
My, my. You're really
going all the way, aren't you?

1366
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,834
Yes, I'm all in on this hand.

1367
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,295
Excuse me, please.

1368
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,714
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

1369
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:23,967
We have an active situation.
Gunmen are on the premises.

1370
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,970
We are keeping you in here
for your safety.

1371
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,181
We have refreshments for you.

1372
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:32,476
Hopefully, the matter will be
resolved quickly.

1373
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:36,897
- Did somebody call the cops?
- Nobody wants any food.

1374
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:43,862
Bill, wait, you can't do it.

1375
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,823
Come on, Bill, my wife
and daughters are downstairs.

1376
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,505
Sir, now's the time to leave.

1377
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:04,925
- Take care of them.
- Yes, sir.

1378
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:11,682
- Is the code all set?
- Yes, sir. Just hit send.

1379
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,558
Like to blow up
a lot of this country.

1380
01:36:13,726 --> 01:36:15,686
Except for the beautiful women.

1381
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,733
What are you doing?

1382
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,488
Wait. Before you shoot us all,

1383
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:30,993
there's just one thing
I wanted to do before I die.

1384
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:27,132
Down! Down! Down!

1385
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:40,353
What's our contingency plan?

1386
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,981
We need to get you in the air
immediately.

1387
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:46,109
There's a bird standing by
at a private airstrip.

1388
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,196
I'm working on a plan
to make this all disappear.

1389
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,619
Pay attention.
Go out the back way.

1390
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,413
I have a little business
to attend to.

1391
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,291
Catalina. Take this.

1392
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:03,960
- What is it?
- Something for a rainy day.

1393
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,129
I'm sorry about your friend.

1394
01:38:06,297 --> 01:38:07,923
It's the job.

1395
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,258
Numbs you.

1396
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,177
Look after Mummy, will you?

1397
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:18,725
Jesus.

1398
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,103
Come on. Go, go.

1399
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:25,524
Oh, man.

1400
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,360
AAAARGHHHH!

1401
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,637
God forgive me.

1402
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:59,141
Who am I kidding? Here goes.

1403
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,981
It's not connecting.

1404
01:39:06,149 --> 01:39:08,859
- You push "send", right?
- Yes. The code is set.

1405
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:11,570
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

1406
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:27,419
Are you OK?

1407
01:39:27,587 --> 01:39:33,341
I have a bomb!
Get back! Move!

1408
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,616
Ah, yeah, yeah, here it goes.

1409
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,831
- You got it?
- Yeah, let's go.

1410
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,922
- What the fuck?
- Spot of tea?

1411
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,634
Do you need a moment?

1412
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,970
Shit.

1413
01:40:30,233 --> 01:40:33,526
I was just starting to like her, too.

1414
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:37,197
She was cool. Killer cool.

1415
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:53,046
Good afternoon.
Ju-An Detective Agency.

1416
01:40:53,214 --> 01:40:54,798
Can you hold, please?

1417
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,600
Jeffrey Leeds on line three.

1418
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,818
There it is. I'm on the news.

1419
01:41:17,029 --> 01:41:18,822
Hey, baby, how's it going?

1420
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:20,365
Hi, there.

1421
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:22,033
Hey, we're on the news again.

1422
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:26,413
- Did Julian say anything stupid?
- I don't know yet. How's it going?

1423
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,416
Great.
I've found an amazing house.

1424
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:37,924
Are you still
coming over next week?

1425
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:40,051
Yeah, the flight gets in at 11.

1426
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,519
I gotta go. Julian's interview's
on. I'll see you on Friday.

1427
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,855
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Bye.

1428
01:41:52,023 --> 01:41:53,940
What's going on?
What are you saying?

1429
01:41:54,108 --> 01:41:56,151
Hey, man, check it out.

1430
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:57,902
You look good. You look sharp.

1431
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:59,821
I always look sharp.

1432
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,323
Oh, watch, watch.

1433
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:04,117
You're not supposed to look
in the camera.

1434
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,082
- That's cool.
- You gotta talk to her.

1435
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,294
...at www...
- And that's the shocking story.

1436
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:17,422
It's a little tacky,
using the news for advertising.

1437
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:21,468
You gotta strike while the iron
is hot. Carpe diem. Seize the day.

1438
01:42:21,635 --> 01:42:34,481
You know? Feed the beast.
Get it while the getting's good.
