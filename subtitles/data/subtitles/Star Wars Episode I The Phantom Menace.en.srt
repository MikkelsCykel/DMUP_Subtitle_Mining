1
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:56,714
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:01:56,844 --> 00:01:58,880
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:01,677
With all due respect...

4
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:04,876
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,801
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

6
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:09,882
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

7
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,917
<i>and we'd be happy</i>
<i>to receive the ambassadors.</i>

8
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:37,998
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,921
This way, please.

10
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:48,716
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,641
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,994
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,919
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:01,922
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:05,798
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:05,924 --> 00:03:08,199
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:11,316
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:14,163
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,195
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,122
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:21,075
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,674
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:28,840
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,683
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,958
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,917
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:39,793
I knew it.

28
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:42,074
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:46,322
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:47,957
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:50,803
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,757
Send a droid.

33
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,801
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:03,119
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,280
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,561
<i>What is it?</i>

37
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:20,244
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:23,754
The blockade is fînished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:28,480
<i>Viceroy, I don't want</i>
<i>this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

40
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:33,683
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.</i>
<i>We must accelerate our plans.</i>

41
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:36,238
<i>Begin landing your troops.</i>

42
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:39,913
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:42,239
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

44
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,559
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,073
<i>The chancellor should never have</i>
<i>brought them into this.</i>

46
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,876
<i>Kill them immediately.</i>

47
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:53,122
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:56,642
Captain, look!

49
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,043
Shields...

50
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,201
Sorry.

51
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,681
Dioxis.

52
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:14,832
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

53
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:17,524
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

54
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,599
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,557
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:33,076
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,083
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:42,081
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:49,282
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:52,237
Well, no, but I don't...
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:54,958
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:56,961
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:59,518
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,957
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:18,324 --> 00:06:20,394
That will hold them.

66
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,118
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:33,075
This is impossible!

68
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:40,123
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:41,644 --> 00:06:43,316
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:50,803
They have shield generators!

71
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,798
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:06:58,804 --> 00:07:01,193
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,916
Sir!

74
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:05,604
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:16,604
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:20,844
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,922
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,523
Let's split up.

79
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:28,716
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,596
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,044
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,473
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,595
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:43,033
At last we are getting results.

85
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,242
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:50,322
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear</i>
<i>what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

87
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:53,993
<i>Your trade boycott</i>
<i>of our planet has ended.</i>

88
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:56,558
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,278
<i>I have word that the chancellor's</i>
<i>ambassadors are with you now...</i>

90
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:01,998
<i>and that you have been commanded</i>
<i>to reach settlement.</i>

91
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:04,274
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:06,679
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,715
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

94
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:11,438
<i>The Federation</i>
<i>has gone too far this time.</i>

95
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:15,443
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:17,953
You assume too much.

97
00:08:18,084 --> 00:08:19,403
<i>We will see.</i>

98
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,798
- She's right. The senate will never...
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:27,757
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:32,036
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:40,919
<i>Negotiations haven't started</i>
<i>because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

102
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,114
<i>How could that be true?</i>

103
00:08:43,244 --> 00:08:47,396
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor</i>
<i>his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

104
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:51,119
<i>It must... handiwork...</i>
<i>negotiate... ambassadors...</i>

105
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:53,758
<i>- nobody would...</i>
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,681
What's happening?

107
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,601
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:02,354
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: Invasion.

109
00:09:02,484 --> 00:09:04,679
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:08,433
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be fînished.

111
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:11,283
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:14,476
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,834
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,479
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,595
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,760
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:29,833
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,762
- Yes, Viceroy?
<i>- Captain, we've searched the ship...</i>

119
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:09,920
<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.</i>

120
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:12,683
<i>They may have gotten on</i>
<i>one of your landing craft.</i>

121
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:15,159
If they're down here, sir,
we'll fînd them.

122
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:19,436
<i>Use caution.</i>
<i>TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

123
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,402
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,115
Get down!

125
00:10:46,724 --> 00:10:49,477
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:52,036
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:54,120
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:55,802
I spake.

129
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,960
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,837
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,876
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,995
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,877
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,835
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,516
You saved my again.

136
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,441
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:24,998
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:28,355
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:33,160
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:36,356
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:39,721
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:41,562
Can you take us there?

143
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:43,802
On second thought, no.

144
00:11:43,924 --> 00:11:46,313
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,480
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:11:48,604 --> 00:11:52,392
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,482
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:58,516
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:01,522
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:05,239
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:07,832
If they fînd us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:12,321
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:14,082
Oh.

154
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:16,195
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:18,554
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:26,795
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:28,721
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:32,803
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:36,121
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:48,433
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:34,682
So good bein home!

162
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:52,872
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,234
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

164
00:13:55,364 --> 00:13:57,161
Mesa back.

165
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:00,082
Noah gain, Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

166
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:02,718
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

167
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:09,797
How wude.

168
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,393
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:24,881
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:29,680
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,240
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:14:33,364 --> 00:14:36,037
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,962
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:43,043
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:45,359
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,237
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:51,162
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:54,515
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,240
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:01,798
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:04,313
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:07,117
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:09,963
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:13,042
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:13,164 --> 00:15:17,680
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:19,601
Now...

187
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:21,442
go.

188
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:23,714
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:25,800
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,801
A transport, I hope.

191
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,915
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:15:30,044 --> 00:15:33,514
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,637
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,721
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,318
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,321
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,276
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

198
00:15:51,404 --> 00:15:56,114
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,323
I saved his life.

200
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,833
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt."

201
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:04,639
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,994
Binks...

203
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:10,912
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

204
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:19,156
Begone wit him!

205
00:16:21,724 --> 00:16:23,999
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:27,116
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:30,236
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:50,397
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfîsh!

209
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,641
- Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:58,599
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:03,320
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:19,763
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,840
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:24,637
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,595
Big gooberfîsh!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:47,843
- There's always a bigger fîsh.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:01,836
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,842
<i>I have the senate</i>
<i>bogged down in procedures.</i>

219
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:09,196
<i>They will have no choice but</i>
<i>to accept your control of the system.</i>

220
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:13,840
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:18:13,964 --> 00:18:16,797
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>

222
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:20,234
<i>You will find controlling her</i>
<i>will not be difficult.</i>

223
00:18:20,364 --> 00:18:22,161
Yes, my lord.

224
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:26,317
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:18:26,444 --> 00:18:30,756
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:38,633
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:18:38,764 --> 00:18:41,437
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:44,235
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:47,839
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:55,714
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,404
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:18:58,524 --> 00:19:01,357
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:06,239
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,679
Power's back.

235
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,795
Monster's back!

236
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,996
Relax.

237
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:22,523
You overdid it.

238
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,560
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:42,515
Oh, boy.

240
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:18,395
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:21,084
Ah, victory.

242
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:36,114
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:44,274
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:48,397
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:51,561
I have assurances
it will be ratifîed by the senate.

246
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,994
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:59,083
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,195
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,882
Process them.

250
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,722
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:07,402
Roger, roger.

252
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:02,160
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:03,842
Get their weapons.

254
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,754
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:22:09,324 --> 00:22:11,599
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:13,521
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,396
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:17,799
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:22:17,924 --> 00:22:19,915
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:23,241
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:30,962
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:34,474
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,516
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:40,238
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,320
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,923
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:46,080
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:48,081
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:50,081
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,479
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,959
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:58,872
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:00,801
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:23:00,924 --> 00:23:04,041
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:06,519
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:09,242
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:19,795
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,801
I'll deal with that.

279
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:27,113
Halt.

280
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:28,836
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,477
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:23:30,604 --> 00:23:33,676
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:36,318
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:38,275
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:44,673
Come on. Move!

286
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:50,754
Go!

287
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:18,435
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:24,154
Hello, boyos.

289
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:31,802
There's the blockade.

290
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:43,362
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,037
How wude!

292
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:04,157
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:07,478
If we can't get the shield generator
fîxed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:10,758
The shields are gone.

295
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:19,838
The power's back!

296
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:25,834
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:28,432
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:41,193
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:44,077
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:46,274
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:47,996
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:49,796
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,721
How can you be sure?

304
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,675
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,477
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:58,799
- If they discovered her...
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,721
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:26:00,844 --> 00:26:02,835
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:04,955
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:12,122
<i>And Queen Amidala,</i>
<i>has she signed the treaty?</i>

311
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:15,714
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:19,837
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:22,759
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

314
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,840
My lord...

315
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:27,398
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,640
It's out of our range.

317
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,914
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

318
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:34,281
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

319
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:36,235
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

320
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:40,675
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

321
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:47,039
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:49,120
Now there are two of them.

323
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:52,122
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:26:57,204 --> 00:27:00,594
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:03,477
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:06,801
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:11,400
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:27:11,524 --> 00:27:12,877
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:17,877
Padmé.

330
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:21,400
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:27:21,524 --> 00:27:23,401
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:26,603
Continue, Captain.

333
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:31,196
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:33,963
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:37,281
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:39,872
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:42,802
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:47,722
Hello.

339
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:50,677
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,157
I'm Padmé.

341
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:56,155
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

342
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:58,192
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:03,840
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:07,479
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

345
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,277
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

346
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:13,555
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow...
mesa here.

347
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:17,273
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

348
00:28:23,324 --> 00:28:26,282
- That's it... Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,317
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:49,557
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:52,039
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:55,156
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,240
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:29:03,084 --> 00:29:05,393
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:06,957
Wait!

356
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:09,357
Wait.

357
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:15,397
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:29:15,524 --> 00:29:19,119
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:21,235
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:23,400
The queen wishes it.

361
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,355
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:30,756
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:29:44,004 --> 00:29:46,723
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:51,513
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:53,441
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:29:53,564 --> 00:29:55,759
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:57,715
Like us.

368
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:01,677
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:04,642
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:19,433
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,721
Good day to you.

372
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:29,643
What do you want?

373
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:32,722
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:36,723
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,241
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:30:39,364 --> 00:30:41,161
My droid has a readout of what I need.

377
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:45,276
What took you so long?

378
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,403
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:50,163
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:53,401
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:55,321
We'll fînd what you need.

382
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,362
Don't touch anything.

383
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:12,037
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:15,713
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:18,597
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:21,192
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

387
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:25,479
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:31:25,604 --> 00:31:29,279
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:33,522
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:37,432
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,759
How long have you been here?

392
00:31:39,884 --> 00:31:43,718
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:46,438
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:31:46,564 --> 00:31:49,158
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:51,002
You're a slave?

396
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:55,083
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,799
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:12,203
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:32:12,324 --> 00:32:13,996
Hit the nose.

400
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:21,874
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:24,518
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:28,000
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:30,923
Saying of which...

404
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:33,319
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:35,400
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:32:35,524 --> 00:32:37,276
Republic credits?

407
00:32:37,404 --> 00:32:40,202
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:43,316
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fîne.

409
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:46,914
- No, they won't.
- Credits <i>will</i> do fîne.

410
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:48,796
No, they won't!

411
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:52,917
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:32:53,044 --> 00:32:57,117
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:01,155
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:05,641
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:16,317
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,721
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

417
00:33:24,244 --> 00:33:26,678
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,556
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:40,961
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,915
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:44,875
Clean the racks.

422
00:33:45,004 --> 00:33:46,278
Then you can go home.

423
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,122
Yippee!

424
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:56,199
<i>And you're sure there's</i>
<i>nothing left on board?</i>

425
00:33:56,324 --> 00:33:58,121
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,156
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

427
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,514
not in the amount
you're talking about.

428
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:06,442
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:07,883
I'll check back later.

430
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:10,236
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:13,083
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:15,559
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,721
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

434
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,717
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:38,441
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:34:43,524 --> 00:34:44,798
Oops.

437
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:50,921
Is this yours?

438
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:52,716
Who, mesa...

439
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,760
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:00,795
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:04,314
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:08,153
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

443
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:11,196
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,603
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

445
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:18,676
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:20,522
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:35:20,644 --> 00:35:22,441
He picked a fîght with a Dug...

448
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:24,953
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:28,520
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:32,478
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:35:33,004 --> 00:35:34,403
Thanks, my young friend.

452
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,401
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:49,032
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,597
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:54,273
- Panaka.
<i>- Receiving a message from home.</i>

456
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,122
We'll be right there.

457
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:04,354
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:06,952
- Here.
- Thank you.

459
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,279
My bones are aching.

460
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:14,761
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:17,603
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:20,192
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:22,599
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:26,433
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,919
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:44,193
Mom!

467
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:47,873
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,279
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:36:50,404 --> 00:36:53,794
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:56,199
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:36:56,324 --> 00:36:58,201
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

472
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:10,721
Isn't he great?
He's not fînished yet.

473
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:12,072
He's wonderful.

474
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:14,922
You really like him?

475
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:17,842
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:23,312
Where is everybody?

477
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,559
Whoops.

478
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:28,759
Oh, hello.

479
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:32,035
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:37:32,164 --> 00:37:33,961
How might I serve you?

481
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,757
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:40,274
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:44,038
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:47,236
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,234
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:54,276
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:59,876
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:38:01,484 --> 00:38:04,601
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:11,399
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

490
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:13,799
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

491
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,880
<i>You must contact me.</i>

492
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:18,564
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:20,595
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:25,557
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:38:25,684 --> 00:38:29,472
What if it is true,
and the people <i>are</i> dying?

496
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:31,959
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:47,080
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:38:47,204 --> 00:38:49,877
If the trace was correct,
I will fînd them quickly, Master.

499
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:51,801
Move against the Jedi fîrst.

500
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:54,518
You will then have no diffîculty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:56,441
to sign the treaty.

502
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:58,634
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

503
00:38:58,764 --> 00:39:01,073
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:03,957
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

505
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:06,359
They will be no match for you.

506
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:14,878
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:39:15,924 --> 00:39:18,802
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,280
- Any attempt to escape...
- And they blow you up!

509
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,677
How wude!

510
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:27,113
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:29,041
The Republic's antislavery laws...

512
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,394
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:39:31,524 --> 00:39:33,594
We must survive on our own.

514
00:39:34,564 --> 00:39:35,997
Xcuse me.

515
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:40,438
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:39:40,564 --> 00:39:42,282
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:39:42,404 --> 00:39:44,998
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:47,561
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:39:47,684 --> 00:39:50,562
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

520
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:52,963
Don't do that again.

521
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:00,672
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:06,277
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

523
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,157
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

524
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,276
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

525
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:13,962
I don't think so.

526
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,154
No one can kill a Jedi.

527
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:18,920
I wish that were so.

528
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,000
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

529
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:24,161
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:40:24,284 --> 00:40:27,481
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:40:27,604 --> 00:40:31,756
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:39,083
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,082
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:44,115
on a very important mission.

535
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:47,156
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:50,754
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:55,036
I can help.
I can fîx anything.

538
00:40:55,164 --> 00:40:56,597
I believe you can.

539
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,397
But fîrst we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,118
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:41:02,244 --> 00:41:05,634
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:09,882
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:11,198
Podracing.

544
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:14,122
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:16,997
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,319
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,321
You could enter my pod.

548
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:25,156
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,081
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:29,320
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

551
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:30,957
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,473
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:41:33,604 --> 00:41:35,640
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:39,154
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:41,479
Anakin.

556
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:44,243
Your mother's right.

557
00:41:44,364 --> 00:41:47,322
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:50,356
No.

559
00:41:55,244 --> 00:41:59,681
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:07,077
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:09,035
We'll fînd some other way.

562
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,759
There is no other way.

563
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:18,036
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:20,681
He was meant to help you.

565
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,481
Are you sure about this?

566
00:42:35,604 --> 00:42:38,118
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:42:38,244 --> 00:42:40,200
The queen will not approve.

568
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,121
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:42:43,204 --> 00:42:44,762
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:48,358
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,042
How can you do this?

572
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:53,315
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:55,514
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:42:56,004 --> 00:42:57,642
Not bad!

575
00:42:57,764 --> 00:43:00,597
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:03,875
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:06,393
What would the boy ride?

578
00:43:06,524 --> 00:43:09,914
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fîx it.

579
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:12,274
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:13,962
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:17,315
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:20,759
That you did.

583
00:43:20,884 --> 00:43:23,557
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,073
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,796
The fastest ever built.

586
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:32,839
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:43:34,724 --> 00:43:38,114
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:39,563
and I supply the boy.

589
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:43,393
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:45,321
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:43:45,444 --> 00:43:47,958
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,040
If we win...

593
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:53,793
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

594
00:43:53,924 --> 00:43:56,996
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

595
00:43:59,364 --> 00:44:00,717
Either way, you win.

596
00:44:06,284 --> 00:44:07,558
Deal!

597
00:44:12,564 --> 00:44:16,637
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:44:24,284 --> 00:44:27,082
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:29,798
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:32,358
<i>Well, it's too dangerous</i>
<i>to call for help...</i>

601
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:35,715
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:44:35,844 --> 00:44:37,721
And...

603
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:39,641
there's something about this boy.

604
00:44:46,204 --> 00:44:48,434
You should be very proud of your son.

605
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:51,394
He gives without any thought
of reward.

606
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:54,277
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:44:54,404 --> 00:44:55,439
He has...

608
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:58,201
He has special powers.

609
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:01,073
Yes.

610
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:03,718
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:06,517
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:08,441
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:45:08,564 --> 00:45:11,237
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:14,595
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identifîed him early.

615
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:20,519
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:45:20,644 --> 00:45:22,316
Who was his father?

617
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,755
There was no father.

618
00:45:28,164 --> 00:45:31,361
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:45:32,204 --> 00:45:34,593
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:45:36,204 --> 00:45:37,922
Can you help him?

621
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:39,841
I don't know.

622
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:45,714
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:00,121
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:46:01,964 --> 00:46:05,559
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:08,517
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:10,282
With this?

627
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:13,043
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:16,236
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:18,434
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:46:18,564 --> 00:46:21,715
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:32,199
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:46:32,324 --> 00:46:35,634
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:37,083
Okay.

634
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:43,078
My tongue is fat.

635
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:46,162
My tongue... Wrench.

636
00:46:46,284 --> 00:46:48,844
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:54,603
I'm stuck.

638
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:58,558
You know, I fînd that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:03,043
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:47:03,164 --> 00:47:05,155
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,400
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,480
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:47:09,604 --> 00:47:11,720
My mouth.

644
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:13,118
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:47:18,124 --> 00:47:20,194
My tongue is fat.

646
00:47:20,324 --> 00:47:23,157
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:27,240
Thank you.

648
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:28,717
Go.

649
00:47:42,644 --> 00:47:46,114
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:58,713
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:02,598
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:04,521
Most of them.

653
00:48:04,644 --> 00:48:06,521
Has anyone been to 'em all?

654
00:48:08,164 --> 00:48:09,313
Not likely.

655
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:12,520
I wanna be the fîrst one
to see 'em all.

656
00:48:13,684 --> 00:48:15,959
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:18,723
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:48:18,844 --> 00:48:21,597
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:25,000
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:48:25,124 --> 00:48:26,603
Go on.

661
00:48:26,724 --> 00:48:28,601
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:48:28,724 --> 00:48:30,521
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:48:33,164 --> 00:48:35,075
- Obi-Wan?
<i>- Yes, Master?</i>

664
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,798
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:39,562
Wait a minute.

666
00:48:41,204 --> 00:48:43,081
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,438
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:48:48,564 --> 00:48:50,361
Over 20,000.

669
00:48:50,484 --> 00:48:53,954
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have</i>
<i>a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

670
00:48:54,084 --> 00:48:55,802
No Jedi has.

671
00:48:55,924 --> 00:48:57,880
What does that mean?

672
00:48:58,724 --> 00:49:00,282
I'm not sure.

673
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:10,117
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:50:10,244 --> 00:50:11,916
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:14,194
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:50:14,324 --> 00:50:16,042
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:20,043
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:23,395
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,516
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:28,999
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,160
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:50:31,284 --> 00:50:34,356
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:50:36,404 --> 00:50:38,076
Oh, no!

684
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,836
Why do you think that?

685
00:50:43,964 --> 00:50:45,761
He always wins!

686
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:50,039
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:54,398
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:50:55,124 --> 00:50:58,321
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:50:58,444 --> 00:51:00,241
the boy and his mother.

690
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:03,913
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:51:04,804 --> 00:51:06,476
The boy, then.

692
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,833
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:51:14,964 --> 00:51:18,240
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:51:18,364 --> 00:51:21,276
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:51:21,404 --> 00:51:22,473
Red...

696
00:51:23,844 --> 00:51:25,402
his mother.

697
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:37,033
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:39,200
but you won't win the race!

699
00:51:39,324 --> 00:51:41,315
So it makes little difference!

700
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:55,434
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:51:59,044 --> 00:52:01,433
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:52:01,564 --> 00:52:02,883
Good morning.

703
00:52:04,924 --> 00:52:07,563
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:13,398
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:52:13,524 --> 00:52:16,755
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:17,919
Do what?

707
00:52:18,044 --> 00:52:20,956
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:22,756
You've never won a race?

709
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:25,478
Well, not exactly.

710
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:27,515
Not even fînished?

711
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,999
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:52:30,124 --> 00:52:32,080
Of course you will.

713
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:02,276
That's absolutely right.

714
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:07,239
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:10,834
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:15,563
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros</i>
<i>from the Tund System.</i>

717
00:53:21,004 --> 00:53:23,359
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

718
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:27,522
<i>Sebulba!</i>

719
00:53:37,524 --> 00:53:40,482
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:53:40,604 --> 00:53:42,515
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

721
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:45,640
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

722
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:49,313
<i>to Clegg Holdfast</i>
<i>and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

723
00:53:52,204 --> 00:53:55,082
<i>And back again,</i>
<i>it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

724
00:53:55,204 --> 00:53:59,595
<i>with that incredible racing machine,</i>
<i>the Vulptereen 327.</i>

725
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:04,999
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

726
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:09,356
<i>Ody Mandrell,</i>
<i>with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

727
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:17,161
<i>And a late entry,</i>
<i>young Anakin Skywalker...</i>

728
00:54:17,284 --> 00:54:18,512
<i>a local boy.</i>

729
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,274
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:54:42,684 --> 00:54:44,163
Be safe.

731
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,514
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:04,604
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:06,874
you slave scum.

734
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:10,121
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:55:10,244 --> 00:55:12,519
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:55:16,924 --> 00:55:19,040
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:20,722
Right.

738
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:27,198
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,919
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:55:31,044 --> 00:55:32,602
I will.

741
00:55:32,724 --> 00:55:34,840
May the Force be with you.

742
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:45,355
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:55:55,164 --> 00:55:59,396
Welcome.

744
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:03,441
Begin the race!

745
00:56:13,564 --> 00:56:16,601
<i>Hey, looks like</i>
<i>they're clearing the grid.</i>

746
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:19,561
- Is he nervous?
- He's fîne.

747
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,877
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not...

748
00:56:24,004 --> 00:56:26,757
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

749
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:29,000
You should too.

750
00:56:29,124 --> 00:56:31,115
You assume too much.

751
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:34,153
<i>Start your engines.</i>

752
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:15,041
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:35,472
Oh, no!

754
00:57:40,884 --> 00:57:44,035
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:58,123
<i>It looks like Quadinaros</i>
<i>is having engine trouble also.</i>

756
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:00,872
Come on, Ani!

757
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:08,557
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

758
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:10,083
Go, Ani, go!

759
00:58:10,204 --> 00:58:12,240
<i>He will be hard-pressed</i>
<i>to catch up with the leaders.</i>

760
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:26,122
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders</i>
<i>are camped out...</i>

761
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:28,439
<i>on the canyon dune turn.</i>

762
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:42,753
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:00:09,364 --> 01:00:11,480
Oh, no!

764
01:00:16,084 --> 01:00:17,881
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:23,120
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:00:25,884 --> 01:00:28,114
<i>It looks like Skywalker</i>
<i>is moving up in the field.</i>

767
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:30,317
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:00:37,524 --> 01:00:40,960
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:01:45,804 --> 01:01:47,601
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:02:43,164 --> 01:02:46,952
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:55,362
Here he comes!

772
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:58,476
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,</i>
<i>Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

773
01:02:58,604 --> 01:03:00,993
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

774
01:03:01,124 --> 01:03:01,954
Go, Ani!

775
01:03:27,884 --> 01:03:30,114
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:03:50,924 --> 01:03:52,243
It's Skywalker!

777
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:54,438
Sebulba!

778
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:58,637
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

779
01:03:58,764 --> 01:04:00,436
Did he crash-ed?

780
01:04:39,724 --> 01:04:42,796
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

781
01:05:33,644 --> 01:05:35,236
He's catching Sebulba!

782
01:05:36,324 --> 01:05:38,713
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

783
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:10,119
That little human being
is out of his mind!

784
01:06:11,204 --> 01:06:12,319
<i>They're side by side!</i>

785
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:41,601
- Yippee!
- Yay!

786
01:06:45,644 --> 01:06:47,282
I can't believe it.

787
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:49,235
The crowds are going nuts!

788
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,760
Yay, Ani!

789
01:07:01,044 --> 01:07:03,956
Mom, I did it! Yay!

790
01:07:14,044 --> 01:07:15,841
Good going, Ani!

791
01:07:20,044 --> 01:07:21,921
We owe you everything, Ani.

792
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:26,480
It's so wonderful, Ani.

793
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:29,198
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

794
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:31,440
I'm so very proud of you.

795
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:43,281
You!

796
01:07:43,404 --> 01:07:45,599
You swindled me.

797
01:07:45,724 --> 01:07:49,353
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

798
01:07:49,484 --> 01:07:51,281
I lost everything.

799
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:54,794
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

800
01:07:54,924 --> 01:07:57,279
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

801
01:07:57,404 --> 01:08:00,362
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

802
01:08:00,484 --> 01:08:03,635
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

803
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:09,594
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

804
01:08:09,724 --> 01:08:12,113
I'm sure they can settle this.

805
01:08:13,564 --> 01:08:15,361
Take him.

806
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:23,033
Hidoe!

807
01:08:24,604 --> 01:08:26,595
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

808
01:08:26,724 --> 01:08:27,713
I'm going back.

809
01:08:27,844 --> 01:08:29,835
Some unfînished business.
I won't be long.

810
01:08:29,964 --> 01:08:33,274
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

811
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:37,036
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

812
01:08:37,164 --> 01:08:38,961
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

813
01:08:39,084 --> 01:08:41,518
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

814
01:08:41,644 --> 01:08:43,714
Come on. Hup!

815
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:49,961
Hey. These are yours.

816
01:08:51,884 --> 01:08:53,078
Yes!

817
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:57,334
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

818
01:08:57,455 --> 01:08:59,730
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

819
01:08:59,855 --> 01:09:02,688
- And he has been freed.
- What?

820
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:04,533
You're no longer a slave.

821
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:08,206
Did you hear that?

822
01:09:08,975 --> 01:09:11,330
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

823
01:09:12,175 --> 01:09:14,006
You are free.

824
01:09:17,455 --> 01:09:18,854
Will you take him with you?

825
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,533
Is he to become a Jedi?

826
01:09:20,655 --> 01:09:23,089
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

827
01:09:23,895 --> 01:09:25,487
Nothing happens by accident.

828
01:09:25,615 --> 01:09:29,005
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

829
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:30,488
Anakin...

830
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:35,486
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

831
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,368
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

832
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:41,532
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

833
01:09:42,335 --> 01:09:44,371
Can I go, Mom?

834
01:09:45,295 --> 01:09:46,887
Anakin...

835
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:49,813
this path has been placed
before you.

836
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,290
The choice is yours alone.

837
01:09:55,815 --> 01:09:57,612
I wanna do it.

838
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,211
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

839
01:10:08,575 --> 01:10:10,088
What about Mom?

840
01:10:13,095 --> 01:10:14,892
Is she free too?

841
01:10:15,015 --> 01:10:18,371
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

842
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:21,252
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

843
01:10:28,935 --> 01:10:32,132
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

844
01:10:32,255 --> 01:10:34,530
It is time for you to let go.

845
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:37,651
I don't want things to change.

846
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:40,050
But you can't stop the change...

847
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:43,133
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

848
01:10:44,175 --> 01:10:46,006
I love you.

849
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,252
Now hurry.

850
01:10:58,575 --> 01:10:59,894
Thank you.

851
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:02,813
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

852
01:11:04,975 --> 01:11:06,408
Will you be all right?

853
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:09,214
Yeah.

854
01:11:14,055 --> 01:11:15,568
Hello, Master Anakin.

855
01:11:15,695 --> 01:11:17,686
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

856
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,090
and I'm going away in a starship.

857
01:11:20,215 --> 01:11:23,013
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

858
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:27,174
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

859
01:11:27,295 --> 01:11:30,287
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to fînish you, 3PO...

860
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:32,371
give you coverings and all.

861
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:34,053
I'm gonna miss working on you.

862
01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:36,530
You've been a great pal.

863
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:39,169
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

864
01:11:39,935 --> 01:11:40,924
Sell me?

865
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,613
Bye.

866
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:44,054
Oh, my.

867
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,811
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

868
01:12:13,935 --> 01:12:15,846
Will I ever see you again?

869
01:12:17,255 --> 01:12:20,008
What does your heart tell you?

870
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,126
I hope so.

871
01:12:23,855 --> 01:12:25,652
Yes.

872
01:12:25,775 --> 01:12:27,288
I guess.

873
01:12:28,295 --> 01:12:30,763
Then we will
see each other again.

874
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:36,048
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

875
01:12:36,175 --> 01:12:37,813
I promise.

876
01:12:45,735 --> 01:12:48,568
Now, be brave...

877
01:12:49,335 --> 01:12:51,246
and don't look back.

878
01:12:52,015 --> 01:12:53,812
Don't look back.

879
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:37,610
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

880
01:13:37,735 --> 01:13:39,407
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

881
01:13:41,775 --> 01:13:42,685
Go!

882
01:13:43,695 --> 01:13:45,526
Tell them to take off!

883
01:13:57,615 --> 01:13:59,014
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

884
01:14:00,255 --> 01:14:01,574
Take off.

885
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:03,927
Over there. Fly low.

886
01:14:24,655 --> 01:14:27,533
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

887
01:14:27,655 --> 01:14:29,134
What was it?

888
01:14:29,255 --> 01:14:30,927
I'm not sure...

889
01:14:31,055 --> 01:14:33,489
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

890
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,010
My guess is
it was after the queen.

891
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:38,524
What are we gonna do about it?

892
01:14:40,415 --> 01:14:41,973
We shall be patient.

893
01:14:42,095 --> 01:14:43,164
Anakin Skywalker...

894
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:45,013
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

895
01:14:47,335 --> 01:14:49,769
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

896
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:00,809
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

897
01:15:00,935 --> 01:15:02,846
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

898
01:15:02,975 --> 01:15:05,011
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

899
01:15:05,135 --> 01:15:07,524
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

900
01:15:07,655 --> 01:15:10,533
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

901
01:15:10,655 --> 01:15:12,452
Take him away.

902
01:15:15,775 --> 01:15:18,130
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

903
01:15:18,255 --> 01:15:20,689
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

904
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:23,329
They will not
stay hidden for long.

905
01:15:33,935 --> 01:15:36,529
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

906
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:39,169
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

907
01:15:39,295 --> 01:15:41,411
<i>You must contact me.</i>

908
01:15:54,975 --> 01:15:56,806
You all right?

909
01:15:57,815 --> 01:15:59,646
It's very cold.

910
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,934
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

911
01:16:10,055 --> 01:16:12,330
A little too warm
for my taste.

912
01:16:12,455 --> 01:16:14,605
Space is cold.

913
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:16,771
You seem sad.

914
01:16:17,895 --> 01:16:20,045
The queen is worried.

915
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,484
Her people are suffering, dying.

916
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:25,971
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

917
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,570
I'm not sure what'll happen.

918
01:16:30,975 --> 01:16:32,931
I made this for you...

919
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,172
so you'd remember me.

920
01:16:36,855 --> 01:16:39,415
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

921
01:16:39,535 --> 01:16:42,254
It'll bring you good fortune.

922
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,172
It's beautiful.

923
01:16:44,295 --> 01:16:46,570
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

924
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:53,326
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

925
01:16:53,455 --> 01:16:55,889
but my caring for you will remain.

926
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,487
I care for you, too, only l...

927
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:03,685
Miss your mother.

928
01:17:21,415 --> 01:17:25,408
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

929
01:17:25,535 --> 01:17:27,207
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

930
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:30,452
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

931
01:17:58,735 --> 01:18:01,647
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

932
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:04,608
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

933
01:18:04,735 --> 01:18:07,090
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

934
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,729
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

935
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:11,732
Welcome, Your Highness.

936
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:13,811
It's an honour to fînally
meet you in person.

937
01:18:13,935 --> 01:18:15,334
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

938
01:18:15,455 --> 01:18:18,811
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

939
01:18:18,935 --> 01:18:22,211
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

940
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:26,293
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

941
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,212
There is a question
of procedure...

942
01:18:28,335 --> 01:18:30,724
but I'm confîdent
we can overcome it.

943
01:18:31,535 --> 01:18:33,605
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

944
01:18:33,735 --> 01:18:36,408
The situation has become
much more complicated.

945
01:18:41,935 --> 01:18:43,766
Ani, come on.

946
01:18:54,535 --> 01:18:57,129
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

947
01:18:58,415 --> 01:19:00,292
Pitty hot.

948
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:30,047
There is no civility,
only politics.

949
01:19:31,295 --> 01:19:35,004
The Republic
is not what it once was.

950
01:19:35,135 --> 01:19:40,163
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

951
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:44,211
There is no interest
in the common good.

952
01:19:45,055 --> 01:19:46,613
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

953
01:19:46,735 --> 01:19:49,329
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

954
01:19:49,455 --> 01:19:52,049
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

955
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:53,972
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

956
01:19:54,095 --> 01:19:56,211
the chancellor
has little real power.

957
01:19:56,335 --> 01:20:00,044
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

958
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:03,770
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

959
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:07,248
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

960
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,491
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

961
01:20:09,615 --> 01:20:11,685
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

962
01:20:11,815 --> 01:20:13,567
and give us justice.

963
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:19,694
You could call for a vote of
no confîdence in Chancellor Valorum.

964
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,204
He has been
our strongest supporter.

965
01:20:22,335 --> 01:20:27,329
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

966
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:30,652
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

967
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:33,526
Our people are dying, Senator.

968
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:37,173
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

969
01:20:37,295 --> 01:20:39,684
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

970
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:42,204
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

971
01:20:42,335 --> 01:20:44,724
for the time being.

972
01:20:46,415 --> 01:20:48,406
That is something I cannot do.

973
01:20:55,455 --> 01:20:57,923
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

974
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:01,809
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

975
01:21:01,935 --> 01:21:03,254
Impossible.

976
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,935
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

977
01:21:06,055 --> 01:21:10,048
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

978
01:21:11,015 --> 01:21:13,131
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

979
01:21:13,255 --> 01:21:16,008
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

980
01:21:16,135 --> 01:21:19,207
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

981
01:21:19,335 --> 01:21:20,927
May the Force be with you.

982
01:21:24,815 --> 01:21:26,214
Master Qui-Gon.

983
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:28,773
More to say have you?

984
01:21:30,815 --> 01:21:32,612
With your permission, my master...

985
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:36,973
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

986
01:21:38,055 --> 01:21:39,966
A vergence, you say.

987
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:42,131
Located around a person?

988
01:21:42,255 --> 01:21:43,449
A boy.

989
01:21:43,575 --> 01:21:45,964
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

990
01:21:46,095 --> 01:21:47,813
I have seen in a life-form.

991
01:21:47,935 --> 01:21:50,688
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

992
01:21:52,335 --> 01:21:56,044
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

993
01:21:56,815 --> 01:21:58,851
You believe it's this boy?

994
01:21:58,975 --> 01:22:01,443
- I don't presume to...
- But you do.

995
01:22:02,175 --> 01:22:04,052
Revealed your opinion is.

996
01:22:04,175 --> 01:22:06,131
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

997
01:22:08,175 --> 01:22:11,247
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

998
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:13,650
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

999
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:15,925
I have no doubt of that.

1000
01:22:22,335 --> 01:22:24,291
Bring him before us, then.

1001
01:22:34,935 --> 01:22:36,732
The boy's here to see Padmé.

1002
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:38,368
<i>Let him in.</i>

1003
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:45,164
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's
not here right now.

1004
01:22:45,295 --> 01:22:46,887
Who is it?

1005
01:22:47,655 --> 01:22:50,533
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé,
Your Highness.

1006
01:22:50,655 --> 01:22:52,373
I've sent Padmé on an errand.

1007
01:22:52,495 --> 01:22:54,292
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1008
01:22:54,415 --> 01:22:56,565
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:22:57,375 --> 01:23:01,050
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1010
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:05,565
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:23:06,655 --> 01:23:07,644
Thank you, Your Highness.

1012
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:25,008
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:23:31,535 --> 01:23:34,766
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1014
01:23:35,855 --> 01:23:38,130
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:23:38,255 --> 01:23:41,611
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:23:41,735 --> 01:23:44,613
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1017
01:23:44,735 --> 01:23:46,646
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1018
01:23:47,495 --> 01:23:48,848
This is outrageous!

1019
01:23:48,975 --> 01:23:51,409
I object
to the senator's statements.

1020
01:23:51,535 --> 01:23:55,414
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1021
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:59,244
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1022
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,286
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1023
01:24:01,415 --> 01:24:03,212
who speaks on our behalf.

1024
01:24:08,975 --> 01:24:11,614
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1025
01:24:12,335 --> 01:24:14,690
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1026
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:17,568
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade...

1027
01:24:17,695 --> 01:24:21,085
I object!
There is no proof!

1028
01:24:21,215 --> 01:24:23,012
This is incredible.

1029
01:24:23,135 --> 01:24:26,923
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1030
01:24:27,055 --> 01:24:28,283
The Congress of Malastare...

1031
01:24:28,415 --> 01:24:31,293
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1032
01:24:31,415 --> 01:24:33,371
A commission must be appointed.

1033
01:24:33,495 --> 01:24:35,884
- The point...
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1034
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:37,573
Enter the bureaucrat.

1035
01:24:37,695 --> 01:24:40,209
The true rulers of the Republic.

1036
01:24:40,335 --> 01:24:44,328
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1037
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:48,494
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1038
01:24:50,015 --> 01:24:52,210
The point is conceded.

1039
01:24:52,335 --> 01:24:54,849
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1040
01:24:54,975 --> 01:24:57,648
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1041
01:24:57,775 --> 01:24:59,572
I will not defer.

1042
01:24:59,695 --> 01:25:03,051
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1043
01:25:03,175 --> 01:25:06,053
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1044
01:25:06,175 --> 01:25:08,735
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1045
01:25:11,575 --> 01:25:13,805
If this body
is not capable of action...

1046
01:25:13,935 --> 01:25:15,891
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1047
01:25:19,175 --> 01:25:21,291
I move for a vote
of no confîdence...

1048
01:25:21,415 --> 01:25:23,326
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1049
01:25:30,095 --> 01:25:32,165
Vote now! Vote now!

1050
01:25:35,815 --> 01:25:37,646
Order!

1051
01:25:37,775 --> 01:25:40,528
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1052
01:25:40,655 --> 01:25:42,452
a strong chancellor...

1053
01:25:42,575 --> 01:25:45,373
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1054
01:25:47,015 --> 01:25:51,088
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1055
01:25:51,215 --> 01:25:54,207
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1056
01:25:54,335 --> 01:25:56,929
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1057
01:25:57,055 --> 01:25:59,649
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1058
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:05,090
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1059
01:26:05,215 --> 01:26:07,171
They will not go along
with you this time.

1060
01:26:08,615 --> 01:26:11,083
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1061
01:26:14,255 --> 01:26:15,574
A ship.

1062
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:19,012
A cup.

1063
01:26:19,135 --> 01:26:20,853
A ship.

1064
01:26:21,935 --> 01:26:23,334
A speeder.

1065
01:26:30,575 --> 01:26:32,406
How feel you?

1066
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:34,567
Cold, sir.

1067
01:26:36,175 --> 01:26:38,245
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1068
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:41,889
See through you we can.

1069
01:26:42,015 --> 01:26:43,812
Be mindful of your feelings.

1070
01:26:43,935 --> 01:26:46,574
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1071
01:26:48,175 --> 01:26:49,528
I miss her.

1072
01:26:50,735 --> 01:26:53,090
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1073
01:26:53,215 --> 01:26:55,251
What has that got to do
with anything?

1074
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:57,605
Everything.

1075
01:26:57,735 --> 01:27:00,647
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1076
01:27:00,775 --> 01:27:03,528
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1077
01:27:03,655 --> 01:27:06,852
Hate leads to suffering.

1078
01:27:13,135 --> 01:27:15,933
I sense much fear in you.

1079
01:27:28,335 --> 01:27:31,566
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1080
01:27:31,695 --> 01:27:32,969
I don't know.

1081
01:27:34,255 --> 01:27:36,052
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1082
01:27:38,415 --> 01:27:40,371
I hope not.

1083
01:27:41,135 --> 01:27:43,251
Gungans no die'n without a fîght.

1084
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:45,172
Wesa warriors.

1085
01:27:45,295 --> 01:27:48,412
Wesa got a grand army.

1086
01:27:48,535 --> 01:27:51,607
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1087
01:27:51,735 --> 01:27:53,009
Your Highness?

1088
01:27:55,575 --> 01:27:57,611
Your Highness...

1089
01:27:57,735 --> 01:28:00,693
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1090
01:28:00,815 --> 01:28:02,134
as supreme chancellor.

1091
01:28:02,255 --> 01:28:05,964
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1092
01:28:06,095 --> 01:28:10,293
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1093
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:12,007
Who else has been nominated?

1094
01:28:12,135 --> 01:28:16,253
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1095
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:21,085
I feel confîdent our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1096
01:28:22,735 --> 01:28:24,646
I will be chancellor.

1097
01:28:24,775 --> 01:28:27,243
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1098
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,447
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1099
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:32,372
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1100
01:28:32,495 --> 01:28:35,885
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1101
01:28:37,615 --> 01:28:41,244
Senator, this is your arena.

1102
01:28:41,615 --> 01:28:43,446
I feel I must return to mine.

1103
01:28:46,575 --> 01:28:48,770
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1104
01:28:48,895 --> 01:28:49,725
Go back?

1105
01:28:49,855 --> 01:28:52,688
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1106
01:28:52,815 --> 01:28:55,090
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1107
01:28:55,215 --> 01:28:57,888
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1108
01:28:58,015 --> 01:28:59,528
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1109
01:28:59,655 --> 01:29:01,850
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1110
01:29:01,975 --> 01:29:03,772
Stay here where it's safe.

1111
01:29:05,215 --> 01:29:08,252
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1112
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:12,934
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1113
01:29:22,255 --> 01:29:24,723
The Force is strong with him.

1114
01:29:24,855 --> 01:29:26,686
He is to be trained, then?

1115
01:29:28,735 --> 01:29:31,010
No, he will not be trained.

1116
01:29:31,135 --> 01:29:32,727
No?

1117
01:29:34,695 --> 01:29:36,651
He is too old.

1118
01:29:36,775 --> 01:29:40,404
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1119
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:44,925
Clouded this boy's future is.

1120
01:29:47,055 --> 01:29:48,807
I will train him, then.

1121
01:29:52,975 --> 01:29:55,694
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1122
01:29:55,815 --> 01:29:58,613
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1123
01:29:58,735 --> 01:30:01,010
Impossible to take on a second.

1124
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:02,727
The code forbids it.

1125
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:06,086
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1126
01:30:06,215 --> 01:30:09,685
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1127
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,169
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1128
01:30:13,295 --> 01:30:14,933
but he is capable.

1129
01:30:15,055 --> 01:30:16,966
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1130
01:30:19,455 --> 01:30:23,084
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1131
01:30:23,215 --> 01:30:25,683
Now is not the time for this.

1132
01:30:26,455 --> 01:30:28,332
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1133
01:30:28,455 --> 01:30:31,015
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1134
01:30:31,135 --> 01:30:34,207
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1135
01:30:34,335 --> 01:30:36,530
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1136
01:30:36,655 --> 01:30:40,853
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1137
01:30:42,095 --> 01:30:43,574
This is the clue we need...

1138
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:46,163
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1139
01:30:46,855 --> 01:30:48,971
May the Force be with you.

1140
01:31:01,615 --> 01:31:04,368
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1141
01:31:04,495 --> 01:31:06,292
From your point of view.

1142
01:31:06,415 --> 01:31:09,646
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1143
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:12,528
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1144
01:31:12,655 --> 01:31:14,930
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1145
01:31:15,055 --> 01:31:17,853
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1146
01:31:23,295 --> 01:31:26,890
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1147
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:29,131
You won't be, Ani.

1148
01:31:29,255 --> 01:31:31,086
I'm not allowed to train you...

1149
01:31:31,215 --> 01:31:33,171
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1150
01:31:33,295 --> 01:31:35,286
Always remember:

1151
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:38,689
Your focus determines your reality.

1152
01:31:38,815 --> 01:31:42,251
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1153
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:43,694
Master, sir...

1154
01:31:43,815 --> 01:31:47,251
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1155
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:50,731
I've been wondering...
What are midi-chlorians?

1156
01:31:51,975 --> 01:31:54,250
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1157
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,525
that resides
within all living cells.

1158
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:00,688
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1159
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:04,125
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1160
01:32:04,255 --> 01:32:07,964
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1161
01:32:08,095 --> 01:32:10,848
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1162
01:32:10,975 --> 01:32:13,648
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1163
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:15,572
They continually speak to us...

1164
01:32:15,695 --> 01:32:18,255
telling us the will of the Force.

1165
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:20,366
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1166
01:32:20,495 --> 01:32:22,292
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1167
01:32:22,415 --> 01:32:24,212
I don't understand.

1168
01:32:24,335 --> 01:32:27,691
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1169
01:32:31,575 --> 01:32:35,170
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1170
01:32:35,855 --> 01:32:37,208
I welcome your help.

1171
01:32:37,335 --> 01:32:40,884
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1172
01:32:41,015 --> 01:32:43,893
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1173
01:32:44,015 --> 01:32:46,768
Wesa goin' home!

1174
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,692
Come on, R2.

1175
01:32:58,535 --> 01:33:00,810
<i>Is the planet secure?</i>

1176
01:33:00,935 --> 01:33:04,644
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1177
01:33:04,775 --> 01:33:07,733
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1178
01:33:07,855 --> 01:33:10,892
<i>Good. I will see to it</i>
<i>that in the senate...</i>

1179
01:33:11,015 --> 01:33:13,813
<i>things stay as they are.</i>

1180
01:33:13,935 --> 01:33:17,291
<i>I am sending my apprentice,</i>
<i>Darth Maul, to join you.</i>

1181
01:33:17,415 --> 01:33:19,212
Yes, my lord.

1182
01:33:19,335 --> 01:33:21,132
A Sith here?

1183
01:33:26,335 --> 01:33:28,690
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1184
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:31,090
And those two control the pitch?

1185
01:33:32,615 --> 01:33:34,412
You catch on pretty quick.

1186
01:33:34,535 --> 01:33:36,207
As soon as we land...

1187
01:33:36,335 --> 01:33:38,849
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1188
01:33:38,975 --> 01:33:39,964
I agree.

1189
01:33:40,095 --> 01:33:42,734
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1190
01:33:42,855 --> 01:33:45,210
I will take back what's ours.

1191
01:33:45,975 --> 01:33:48,045
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1192
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:49,972
We have no army.

1193
01:33:50,095 --> 01:33:51,414
And I can only protect you.

1194
01:33:51,535 --> 01:33:53,491
I can't fîght a war for you.

1195
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:55,484
Jar Jar Binks.

1196
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:58,445
Mesa, Your Highness?

1197
01:33:58,575 --> 01:34:01,373
Yes. I need your help.

1198
01:34:06,415 --> 01:34:08,531
I have one battleship on my scope.

1199
01:34:08,655 --> 01:34:10,611
It's a droid control ship.

1200
01:34:10,735 --> 01:34:12,851
They've probably spotted us.

1201
01:34:12,975 --> 01:34:14,613
We haven't much time.

1202
01:34:25,855 --> 01:34:28,415
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1203
01:34:28,535 --> 01:34:29,763
Good.

1204
01:34:29,895 --> 01:34:32,045
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1205
01:34:32,175 --> 01:34:33,733
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1206
01:34:35,735 --> 01:34:37,965
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1207
01:34:39,695 --> 01:34:42,653
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1208
01:34:42,775 --> 01:34:46,324
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1209
01:34:48,175 --> 01:34:51,326
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1210
01:34:52,455 --> 01:34:54,252
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1211
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:58,215
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1212
01:34:58,895 --> 01:35:02,092
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1213
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:16,850
Desa nobody dare!

1214
01:35:16,975 --> 01:35:19,045
The Gungan city is deserted!

1215
01:35:19,175 --> 01:35:21,609
Some kinda fîght, mesa tinks.

1216
01:35:21,735 --> 01:35:24,693
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1217
01:35:24,815 --> 01:35:27,045
More likely they were wiped out.

1218
01:35:27,175 --> 01:35:30,087
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1219
01:35:30,215 --> 01:35:33,491
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1220
01:35:33,615 --> 01:35:36,368
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1221
01:35:53,975 --> 01:35:57,411
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1222
01:36:03,815 --> 01:36:07,012
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1223
01:36:07,775 --> 01:36:10,084
Jar Jar Binks.

1224
01:36:10,575 --> 01:36:13,692
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1225
01:36:14,255 --> 01:36:16,450
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1226
01:36:17,255 --> 01:36:19,564
I come before you in peace.

1227
01:36:19,695 --> 01:36:22,414
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1228
01:36:22,535 --> 01:36:25,572
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1229
01:36:25,695 --> 01:36:29,244
Yousa all bombad.

1230
01:36:30,095 --> 01:36:32,814
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1231
01:36:32,935 --> 01:36:34,254
Your Honour.

1232
01:36:36,335 --> 01:36:39,168
Whosa dis?

1233
01:36:39,295 --> 01:36:41,411
I am Queen Amidala.

1234
01:36:43,015 --> 01:36:44,528
This is my decoy...

1235
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:48,125
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1236
01:36:48,255 --> 01:36:52,373
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1237
01:36:52,495 --> 01:36:54,929
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1238
01:36:55,055 --> 01:36:57,489
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1239
01:36:59,215 --> 01:37:02,252
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1240
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:05,492
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1241
01:37:05,615 --> 01:37:07,731
I ask you to help us.

1242
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:10,449
No, I beg you to help us.

1243
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:12,850
We are your humble servants.

1244
01:37:15,975 --> 01:37:18,648
Our fate is in your hands.

1245
01:37:35,175 --> 01:37:39,248
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1246
01:37:41,615 --> 01:37:45,369
Mesa lika dis!

1247
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:47,205
Maybe...

1248
01:37:47,335 --> 01:37:49,769
wesa...

1249
01:37:49,895 --> 01:37:51,692
being friends.

1250
01:38:00,055 --> 01:38:01,773
We've sent our patrols.

1251
01:38:01,895 --> 01:38:05,205
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1252
01:38:05,335 --> 01:38:07,405
It won't be long, my lord.

1253
01:38:07,535 --> 01:38:10,527
<i>This is</i>
<i>an unexpected move for her.</i>

1254
01:38:10,655 --> 01:38:12,566
<i>It's too aggressive.</i>

1255
01:38:12,695 --> 01:38:15,004
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.</i>

1256
01:38:15,135 --> 01:38:17,569
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

1257
01:38:17,695 --> 01:38:19,492
Yes, my master.

1258
01:38:22,895 --> 01:38:24,487
Deysa comin!

1259
01:38:24,615 --> 01:38:25,889
All right!

1260
01:38:29,335 --> 01:38:30,973
They're here!

1261
01:38:31,095 --> 01:38:32,414
Good. They made it.

1262
01:38:36,815 --> 01:38:39,375
Yousa doen grand.

1263
01:38:39,495 --> 01:38:42,453
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1264
01:38:42,575 --> 01:38:44,372
Oh, no, no, no.

1265
01:38:44,495 --> 01:38:47,328
So, wesa make you...

1266
01:38:47,455 --> 01:38:49,844
bombad general.

1267
01:38:49,975 --> 01:38:51,328
General?

1268
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:55,694
Captain.

1269
01:38:55,815 --> 01:38:58,283
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1270
01:38:58,415 --> 01:39:00,212
Almost everyone's in camps.

1271
01:39:00,335 --> 01:39:03,407
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1272
01:39:03,535 --> 01:39:05,969
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1273
01:39:06,095 --> 01:39:08,848
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1274
01:39:08,975 --> 01:39:10,567
and much stronger.

1275
01:39:11,815 --> 01:39:14,773
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1276
01:39:14,895 --> 01:39:17,011
The battle is a diversion.

1277
01:39:17,135 --> 01:39:19,888
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1278
01:39:20,015 --> 01:39:21,494
R2.

1279
01:39:22,575 --> 01:39:25,885
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1280
01:39:26,015 --> 01:39:27,653
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1281
01:39:27,775 --> 01:39:30,733
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1282
01:39:30,855 --> 01:39:33,653
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1283
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:37,048
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1284
01:39:37,175 --> 01:39:38,767
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1285
01:39:38,895 --> 01:39:40,965
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1286
01:39:41,095 --> 01:39:43,484
The diffîculty is getting
into the throne room.

1287
01:39:43,615 --> 01:39:45,810
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1288
01:39:45,935 --> 01:39:50,451
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1289
01:39:50,575 --> 01:39:53,726
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1290
01:39:53,855 --> 01:39:56,847
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1291
01:39:56,975 --> 01:39:58,772
We will send
what pilots we have...

1292
01:39:58,895 --> 01:40:01,807
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1293
01:40:01,935 --> 01:40:04,847
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1294
01:40:04,975 --> 01:40:07,967
The weapons on your fîghters
may not penetrate the shields.

1295
01:40:08,095 --> 01:40:09,653
There's an even bigger danger.

1296
01:40:09,775 --> 01:40:11,572
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1297
01:40:11,695 --> 01:40:13,811
he will return
with another droid army.

1298
01:40:13,935 --> 01:40:17,007
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1299
01:40:17,135 --> 01:40:18,966
Everything depends on it.

1300
01:40:24,095 --> 01:40:26,609
<i>She is more foolish</i>
<i>than I thought.</i>

1301
01:40:26,735 --> 01:40:28,612
We are sending all troops...

1302
01:40:28,735 --> 01:40:31,488
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1303
01:40:31,615 --> 01:40:34,129
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1304
01:40:34,255 --> 01:40:36,689
<i>This will work to our advantage.</i>

1305
01:40:36,815 --> 01:40:39,488
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1306
01:40:40,255 --> 01:40:41,893
<i>Wipe them out.</i>

1307
01:40:43,535 --> 01:40:45,332
<i>All of them.</i>

1308
01:41:14,975 --> 01:41:16,294
Halt!

1309
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:21,765
Starting up the shield.

1310
01:41:50,095 --> 01:41:51,244
Open fîre.

1311
01:42:06,695 --> 01:42:09,767
Once we get inside, you fînd
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1312
01:42:09,895 --> 01:42:11,726
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1313
01:42:27,055 --> 01:42:29,011
Roger, roger.

1314
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:39,727
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1315
01:42:40,775 --> 01:42:42,208
This is too close.

1316
01:42:47,935 --> 01:42:50,210
Ani, fînd cover.

1317
01:42:50,335 --> 01:42:52,530
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1318
01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:49,964
Fighters straight ahead.

1319
01:43:50,095 --> 01:43:51,164
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1320
01:43:51,295 --> 01:43:52,444
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:44:00,775 --> 01:44:01,810
Cease fîre.

1322
01:44:09,055 --> 01:44:11,364
Steady. Steady.

1323
01:44:43,135 --> 01:44:46,207
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:45:02,055 --> 01:45:03,886
Ouch time.

1325
01:45:17,415 --> 01:45:18,450
Fire!

1326
01:45:39,815 --> 01:45:41,567
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1327
01:45:41,695 --> 01:45:43,094
Red group! Blue group!

1328
01:45:43,215 --> 01:45:44,933
Everybody, this way!

1329
01:45:45,055 --> 01:45:47,011
Hey, wait for me!

1330
01:45:47,135 --> 01:45:49,410
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1331
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:51,446
- But l...
- Stay in that cockpit.

1332
01:46:03,135 --> 01:46:06,207
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1333
01:46:25,575 --> 01:46:27,406
We gotta do something, R2.

1334
01:46:49,295 --> 01:46:52,173
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1335
01:46:55,495 --> 01:46:58,407
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1336
01:46:59,375 --> 01:46:59,735
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1337
01:46:59,735 --> 01:47:01,726
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1338
01:47:03,855 --> 01:47:04,765
Yeah!

1339
01:47:09,935 --> 01:47:11,368
Let's go!

1340
01:47:12,415 --> 01:47:14,565
It's on automatic pilot.

1341
01:47:23,295 --> 01:47:25,092
Try to override it.

1342
01:48:22,695 --> 01:48:24,526
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1343
01:48:30,415 --> 01:48:32,167
Look, there they are.

1344
01:48:32,295 --> 01:48:34,570
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1345
01:48:50,895 --> 01:48:53,409
Dumb droid. Take that!

1346
01:48:53,535 --> 01:48:55,366
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1347
01:48:55,495 --> 01:48:56,610
Get off!

1348
01:49:06,255 --> 01:49:08,530
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1349
01:49:17,455 --> 01:49:19,047
This is tense!

1350
01:49:21,255 --> 01:49:23,166
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1351
01:49:23,295 --> 01:49:25,092
It's gonna get us both killed.

1352
01:49:26,695 --> 01:49:29,004
You did it, R2!

1353
01:49:29,135 --> 01:49:30,284
Let's go left.

1354
01:49:35,295 --> 01:49:36,364
Go back?

1355
01:49:36,495 --> 01:49:40,613
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1356
01:49:47,215 --> 01:49:49,570
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1357
01:49:55,015 --> 01:49:57,449
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1358
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:04,970
Go!

1359
01:50:09,615 --> 01:50:11,253
Ascension guns!

1360
01:52:12,255 --> 01:52:13,813
Retreat! Retreat!

1361
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:17,326
Dis is nutsen.

1362
01:52:26,815 --> 01:52:28,692
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1363
01:52:48,575 --> 01:52:50,884
Give me a lift!

1364
01:52:57,855 --> 01:52:59,368
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1365
01:52:59,495 --> 01:53:01,326
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1366
01:53:01,455 --> 01:53:03,332
Here. Taken dis one.

1367
01:53:19,095 --> 01:53:20,130
Jar Jar!

1368
01:53:20,255 --> 01:53:22,132
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1369
01:53:31,895 --> 01:53:34,568
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1370
01:53:46,975 --> 01:53:49,011
We're hit, R2!

1371
01:54:01,695 --> 01:54:04,528
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1372
01:54:11,455 --> 01:54:12,934
Everything's overheated.

1373
01:54:14,335 --> 01:54:16,212
Oops. This is not good.

1374
01:55:25,695 --> 01:55:27,811
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1375
01:55:27,935 --> 01:55:29,732
Mesa think of something.

1376
01:55:29,855 --> 01:55:31,174
Hands up.

1377
01:55:31,295 --> 01:55:34,048
My give up. My give up.

1378
01:55:42,415 --> 01:55:45,407
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1379
01:55:45,535 --> 01:55:47,332
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1380
01:55:47,455 --> 01:55:49,252
this pointless debate in the senate.

1381
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:51,047
Viceroy!

1382
01:55:51,175 --> 01:55:53,006
Your occupation here has ended.

1383
01:55:54,535 --> 01:55:57,766
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1384
01:56:04,095 --> 01:56:05,494
Captain!

1385
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:16,331
Jam the doors.

1386
01:56:19,655 --> 01:56:22,408
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1387
01:57:23,015 --> 01:57:25,404
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1388
01:57:28,575 --> 01:57:29,564
Take this!

1389
01:57:31,495 --> 01:57:32,530
And this!

1390
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:41,767
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1391
01:57:41,895 --> 01:57:43,647
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1392
01:57:43,775 --> 01:57:45,094
Impossible!

1393
01:57:45,215 --> 01:57:47,012
Nothing can get through our shield.

1394
01:57:48,255 --> 01:57:49,973
Let's get outta here.

1395
01:57:57,695 --> 01:58:00,209
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1396
01:58:03,135 --> 01:58:04,648
We didn't hit it.

1397
01:58:07,615 --> 01:58:09,571
Now, this is Podracing.

1398
01:58:11,135 --> 01:58:12,773
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1399
01:58:33,295 --> 01:58:34,694
What the...

1400
01:58:34,815 --> 01:58:36,931
Was'n they doing?

1401
01:58:37,055 --> 01:58:40,491
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1402
01:58:42,135 --> 01:58:44,365
They all broke-ed.

1403
01:59:30,815 --> 01:59:34,046
No, it's too late.

1404
01:59:34,175 --> 01:59:36,370
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1405
01:59:37,615 --> 01:59:39,412
Promise...

1406
01:59:39,535 --> 01:59:41,969
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1407
01:59:42,095 --> 01:59:43,574
Yes, Master.

1408
01:59:47,495 --> 01:59:49,963
He is the chosen one.

1409
01:59:50,095 --> 01:59:53,167
He will bring balance.

1410
01:59:54,335 --> 01:59:55,688
Train him.

1411
02:00:22,095 --> 02:00:23,813
Now, Viceroy...

1412
02:00:23,935 --> 02:00:27,211
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1413
02:00:28,895 --> 02:00:32,046
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1414
02:00:45,215 --> 02:00:48,605
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1415
02:00:48,735 --> 02:00:50,532
And you, young Skywalker.

1416
02:00:51,295 --> 02:00:54,446
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1417
02:01:00,735 --> 02:01:03,169
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1418
02:01:03,295 --> 02:01:06,571
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1419
02:01:06,695 --> 02:01:08,970
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1420
02:01:09,095 --> 02:01:12,849
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1421
02:01:17,695 --> 02:01:21,927
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1422
02:01:22,055 --> 02:01:26,571
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1423
02:01:26,695 --> 02:01:28,492
I do not.

1424
02:01:28,615 --> 02:01:30,606
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1425
02:01:33,415 --> 02:01:35,975
The chosen one the boy may be.

1426
02:01:36,095 --> 02:01:37,653
Nevertheless...

1427
02:01:37,775 --> 02:01:40,528
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1428
02:01:40,655 --> 02:01:44,614
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1429
02:01:44,735 --> 02:01:46,566
I will train Anakin.

1430
02:01:48,735 --> 02:01:50,965
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1431
02:01:51,095 --> 02:01:53,450
Qui-Gon's defîance
I sense in you.

1432
02:01:53,575 --> 02:01:55,406
Need that you do not.

1433
02:01:57,575 --> 02:02:00,692
Agree with you the council does.

1434
02:02:01,775 --> 02:02:04,926
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1435
02:02:31,615 --> 02:02:33,287
What will happen to me now?

1436
02:02:33,415 --> 02:02:36,327
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1437
02:02:36,455 --> 02:02:39,731
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1438
02:02:48,775 --> 02:02:52,006
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1439
02:02:52,135 --> 02:02:54,490
Always two there are.

1440
02:02:54,615 --> 02:02:57,687
No more, no less.

1441
02:02:57,815 --> 02:03:00,613
A master and an apprentice.

1442
02:03:00,735 --> 02:03:02,214
But which was destroyed?

1443
02:03:02,335 --> 02:03:05,168
The master or the apprentice?

1444
02:03:28,815 --> 02:03:30,771
Hidoe, everybody!

1445
02:04:15,495 --> 02:04:17,326
Peace!
