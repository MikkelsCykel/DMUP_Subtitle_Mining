How do you measure The
life of a woman or a man?

21
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:13,771
In truths that she learned?
Or in times that he cried?

22
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:16,342
In bridges he burned?

23
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:21,744
- Or the way that she died?
- It's time now to sing out

December 24th, 1989, 9 p. m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

35
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:38,521
From here on in, I
shoot without a script.

36
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:42,152
See if anything comes of it...

37
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,797
...instead of my old shit.

38
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:47,764
No, get out of here. Hey.

39
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,704
I said, get off the window.

40
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:07,684
How do you document real life

41
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:12,656
When real life's getting
more Like fiction each day?

42
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:14,920
Headlines, bread lines Blow my mind

43
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:19,566

How do you write a song
When the chords sound wrong?

46
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:29,534
Though they once sounded Right and rare

47
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,544
When the notes are
sour Where is the power

48
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:36,445
You once had to ignite the air?

49
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:39,518
- We're hungry and frozen
- Some life we've chosen

50
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:44,590
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

51
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,920
- How we gonna pay
- How we gonna pay

52
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:51,064
- Last year's rent?
- Last year's rent?

53
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,697
- Hello?
- Hey, guess who's back in town.

54
00:05:57,872 --> 00:06:01,467
It's Collins, man.
Throw down the key. Cool.

55
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:04,370
Hey.

56
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,777
- You got a light, man?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:13,750
- Give me that shit.
- Come here, man.

58
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:17,123
Get that son of a bitch.

59
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,762
Pick his ass up. Come on.

60
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:35,709
How do you start a fire
When there's nothing to burn

61
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:40,075
And it feels like something's
stuck In your flue?

62
00:06:40,248 --> 00:06:43,706
How can you generate heat
When you can't feel your feet

63
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,217
- And they're turning blue?
- And they're turning blue?

64
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:47,547
You light up a mean blaze

65
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,087
- With posters
- And screenplays

66
00:06:49,257 --> 00:06:51,623
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

67
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,227
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

68
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,896
- How we gonna pay
- How we gonna pay

69
00:06:57,098 --> 00:07:01,125
- Last year's rent?
- Last year's rent?

70
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:08,575
How do you stay on your feet

71
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:11,177
When on every street It's trick or treat

72
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:13,336
And tonight it's trick?

73
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:16,842
Welcome back to town
Oh, I should lie down

74
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:20,613
Everything's brown
And, uh-oh, I feel sick

75
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,519
- Where is he?
- Getting dizzy

76
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,921
- How we gonna pay?
- How we gonna pay?

77
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:28,584
How we gonna pay?

78
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:31,288
How we gonna pay

79
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:35,765
Last year's rent?

80
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:39,634
The music ignites the
night With passionate fire

81
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:44,645
The narration crackles and
pops With incendiary wit

82
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,944
Zoom in as they burn
the past To the ground

83
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:52,017
And feel the heat Of the future's glow

84
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:55,345
How do you leave the past behind

85
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:59,960
When it keeps finding
ways To get to your heart?

86
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:03,858
It reaches way down deep
And tears you inside out

87
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:07,364
Till you're torn apart Rent

88
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:11,471
How can you connect in an age
Where strangers, landlords, lovers

89
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,506
Your own blood cells betray?

90
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,870
What binds the fabric together

91
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:22,448
When the raging, shifting winds
Of change keep ripping away?

92
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:25,108
Draw a line in the sand
And then make a stand

93
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:28,187
- Use your camera to spar
- Use your guitar

94
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,586
When they act tough You call their bluff

95
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:33,386
We're not gonna pay

96
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:35,926
We're not gonna pay

97
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,530
We're not gonna pay

98
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,133
Last year's rent

99
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:43,930
This year's rent

100
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,266
Next year's rent

101
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,238
Rent, rent, rent, rent, rent

102
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,503
We're not gonna pay rent

103
00:08:51,679 --> 00:09:05,389
'Cause everything is rent

104
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:24,074
Hey.

105
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,542
Bum.

106
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:28,638
Get your ass off the Range Rover.

107
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:31,984
Benny, that attitude toward...

108
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:34,553
...the homeless is exactly
what Maureen is protesting.

109
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:38,556
Maureen is protesting losing
her performance space...

110
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,319
...not my attitude.

111
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,861
Come down, I wanna talk to you.

112
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:11,217
Close-up: Benjamin Coffin
III. Our ex-roommate...

113
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,986
...who married Allison
Grey of the Westport Greys.

114
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:17,189
His father-in-law bought
several buildings on the block...

115
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,958
...and a nearby vacant
lot, home to Tent City.

116
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:23,000
Benny hopes to evict all of
the homeless from Tent City...

117
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,603
...and build a cyber studio.

118
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:28,572
Roger, you're looking good for a guy
coming off of a year of withdrawal.

119
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:31,371
- What do you want, Benny?
- Well, my investor...

120
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,843
- You mean, your
father-in-law? - Right.

121
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:36,483
Read about Maureen's
performance in the Village Voice.

122
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,380
Got pissed and sent me down
here to collect the rent.

123
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:42,784
- What rent?
- This past year's rent, which I let slide.

124
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:44,117
You said we were golden.

125
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,521
- When you bought the building.
- We were roommates.

126
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:48,787
- Remember, you lived here?
- How could I forget?

127
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,863
You, me, Collins and Maureen.

128
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,591
How is the drama queen?

129
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,599
- She's getting ready for a performance.
- I know.

130
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,797
- Still her production manager?
- Not exactly.

131
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:03,034
- Still dating her?
- I was dumped.

132
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,306
- She got a new man?
- Well...

133
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,243
- No.
- What's his name?

134
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:10,280
- Joanne.
- Joanne.

135
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,320
Thanks for being so understanding.

136
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,085
You expect sympathy from the guy...

137
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,195
...who shut off our
power on Christmas Eve?

138
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,533
Got your attention, didn't it?

139
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:29,436
What happened to Benny?

140
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:35,906
What happened to his heart
And the ideals he once pursued?

141
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:42,846
Any owner of that lot next door Has
a right to do with it as he pleases

142
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,780
Happy birthday, Jesus

143
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:46,749
- The rent
- You're wasting your time

144
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,981
- We're broke
- You broke your word, this is absurd

145
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,421
There is one way You won't have to pay

146
00:11:52,593 --> 00:11:55,528
- I knew it.
- Next door, the home of CyberArts

147
00:11:55,696 --> 00:12:01,225
And now that the block is rezoned
Our dream can become a reality

148
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:05,929
You'll see, boys

149
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:10,840
You'll see, boys

150
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:15,243
A state-of-the-art, digital,
Virtual interactive studio

151
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:19,045
I'll forgo your rent
And on paper guarantee

152
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,848
That you can stay here for free

153
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,991
- If you do me one small favor.
- What?

154
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,990
Convince Maureen to cancel her protest.

155
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:29,662
Why not just get an
injunction or call the cops?

156
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,798
I did, and they're on standby.

157
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:36,903
But my investors would
rather I handle this quietly

158
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,334
You can't quietly wipe
out an entire tent city...

159
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,407
...then watch It's A
Wonderful Life on TV.

160
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,304
You wanna produce films and write songs?

161
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:44,944
You need somewhere to do it

162
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:49,310
It's what we used to dream about
Think twice before you pooh-pooh it

163
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,816
You'll see, boys

164
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:58,055
You'll see, boys

165
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:02,491
You'll see the beauty of a studio

166
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:06,792
That lets us do our work And get paid

167
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:11,131
With condos on the top Whose
rent keeps open our shop

168
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:15,241
Just stop the protest
And you'll have it made

169
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,900
You'll see

170
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:20,046
Or you'll pack.

171
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:35,555
Here you go.

172
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:39,698
Merry Christmas.

173
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,847
Hello?

174
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,230
Oh, my God. You okay, honey?

175
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:17,598
- I'm afraid so.
- Did they get anything, or...?

176
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,865
I didn't have any money,
but they took my stuff.

177
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:24,607
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

178
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,314
I'm Angel.

179
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,185
Angel?

180
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:37,053
Friends call me Collins.

181
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,758
Tom. Tom Collins.

182
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,893
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

183
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:51,834
I sort of have to hurry.

184
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:54,497
- I have a Life Support meeting.
- Life Support?

185
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,634
Yeah.

186
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,869
It's for people with AIDS.

187
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,877
People like me.

188
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,311
Me too.

189
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:15,689
I was gonna go try to find Collins.

190
00:15:15,896 --> 00:15:17,830
You wanna come?

191
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:21,833
I thought maybe we could
all grab some dinner.

192
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,436
Zoom in on my empty wallet.

193
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,470
Touch?

194
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:30,337
Take your AZT.

195
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:44,591
I'm writing one great song Before I...

196
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,584
One song Glory

197
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,384
One song before I go

198
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:58,531
Glory One song to leave behind

199
00:16:59,032 --> 00:17:01,330
Find one song

200
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,197
One last refrain

201
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,932
Glory From the pretty-boy front man

202
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:13,308
Who wasted opportunity

203
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,745
One song He had the world at his feet

204
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:21,854
Glory In the eyes of a young girl

205
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:24,818
A young girl

206
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,857
Find glory

207
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,120
Beyond the cheap colored lights

208
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,764
One song Before the sun sets

209
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,764
Glory

210
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:40,100
On another empty life

211
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:43,402
Time flies

212
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:48,742
Time dies

213
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:54,320
Glory

214
00:17:54,655 --> 00:18:01,117
One blaze of glory

215
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:07,824
One blaze of glory

216
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:15,105
Glory

217
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:18,210
Find glory

218
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:23,338
In a song that rings true
Truth like a blazing fire

219
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:26,745
An eternal flame

220
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,216
Find one song

221
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:34,883
A song about love Glory

222
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:38,258
From the soul of a young man

223
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,233
A young man

224
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:46,805
Find the one song Before
the virus takes hold

225
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,704
Glory Like a sunset

226
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:56,641
One song To redeem this empty life

227
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,982
Time flies

228
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:03,884
And then no need To endure anymore

229
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:09,461
Time dies

230
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:55,172
- What'd you forget?
- Got a light?

231
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,640
I know you, you're...

232
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,335
You're shivering

233
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,744
It's nothing They turned off my heat

234
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:11,490
And I'm just a little weak on my
feet Would you light my candle?

235
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:15,089
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing

236
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,822
Your hair in the moonlight

237
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:21,224
You look familiar

238
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,600
- Can you make it?
- Just haven't eaten much today

239
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:31,403
At least the room
Stopped spinning anyway

240
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,512
- What?
- Nothing

241
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,014
- Your smile reminded me of...
- I always "remind people of"

242
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:40,085
- Who is she?
- She died

243
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,484
- Her name was April
- It's out again

244
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:52,063
Sorry 'bout your friend
Would you light my candle?

245
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,891
- Well?
- Yeah?

246
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,333
Oh, the wax

247
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,769
- It's...
- Dripping

248
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:04,104
- I like it between my...
- Fingers

249
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:05,574
I figured

250
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,509
Oh, well, good night

251
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:19,720
- It blew out again?
- No, I think that I dropped my stash

252
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,726
I know I've seen you out and about

253
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:24,658
When I used to go out

254
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,823
Your candle's out

255
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:30,965
I'm illin' I had it
when I walked in the door

256
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:34,307
It was pure Is it on the floor?

257
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:35,604
The floor?

258
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:40,739
They say that I have the
best ass Below 14th Street

259
00:21:40,914 --> 00:21:43,212
- Is it true?
- What?

260
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:45,908
- You're staring again
- Oh, no

261
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,281
I mean, you do have a nice...

262
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:50,453
I mean, you look familiar

263
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:53,923
- Like your dead girlfriend
- Only when you smile

264
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:56,722
But I'm sure I've
seen you Somewhere else

265
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,923
Do you go to the Cat Scratch
Club? That's where I work

266
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:02,624
I dance

267
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,937
Yes They used to tie you up

268
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:07,471
It's a living

269
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:10,769
I didn't recognize you
Without the handcuffs

270
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,474
We could light the candle

271
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:24,648
Oh, won't you light the candle?

272
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:28,722
Why don't you forget that stuff

273
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,831
- You look like you're 16
- I'm 19

274
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:37,231
But I'm old for my age
I'm just born to be bad

275
00:22:37,404 --> 00:22:42,171
I once was born to be bad
I used to shiver like that

276
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:44,572
- I have no heat, I told you
- I used to sweat

277
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:48,243
- I got a cold - Uh-huh,
I used to be a junkie

278
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:51,341
- But now and then I
like to feel good - Uh-huh

279
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,042
- Oh, here
- What's that?

280
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,949
Candy-bar wrapper.

281
00:22:55,122 --> 00:23:00,185
We could light the candle

282
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:09,195
Oh, what'd you do with my candle?

283
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:14,840
- That was my last match
- Our eyes'll adjust

284
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:19,502
- Thank God for the moon
- Maybe it's not the moon at all

285
00:23:20,013 --> 00:23:22,846
I hear Spike Lee's
shootin' Down the street

286
00:23:23,016 --> 00:23:24,916
Bah humbug

287
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,679
Bah humbug

288
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,949
- Cold hands
- Yours too

289
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,288
Big Like my father's

290
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,463
Do you wanna dance?

291
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:39,397
With you?

292
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,798
- No, with my father
- I'm Roger

293
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:46,905
They call me

294
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:51,976
They call me Mimi

295
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:24,510
We got power.

296
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,168
Merry Christmas.

297
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,177
- Speak.
- Speak.

298
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:30,213
Mark, are you there?

299
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:33,250
Are you screening your calls? It's Mom.

300
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,981
I just wanted to call and say we
love you. We'll miss you today.

301
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:39,318
Cindy and the kids are
here. They send their love.

302
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:42,893
Hope you like the hot plate. Don't
leave it on when you leave the house.

303
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:44,996
- Honey, give me the phone.
- Oh, here's Dad.

304
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:48,134
Listen, Mark, I'm sorry to
hear that Maureen dumped you.

305
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:51,828
I say, c'est la vie.
Let her be a lesbian.

306
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:54,200
She doesn't know what she's missing.

307
00:24:54,374 --> 00:24:56,239
Happy holidays.

308
00:24:58,078 --> 00:24:59,602
You know...

309
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:03,573
...there are times
when we're dirt broke...

310
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,310
...and hungry and freezing...

311
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:11,116
...and I ask myself, "Why the
hell am I still living here?"

312
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:15,018
And then they call. And I remember.

313
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:24,633
What's that?

314
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:30,033
The girl downstairs.

315
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,474
Oh, the dancer from
the Cat Scratch Club?

316
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:35,912
- Well, you are going, right?
- No.

317
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:38,050
- Oh, come on, Roger.
- No.

318
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:41,546
- Merry Christmas, bitches.
- Hey, Collins.

319
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:44,555
- Your keys.
- Yeah, 14 hours later.

320
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:47,352
What the hell happened
to you? Are you all right?

321
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,653
I've never been better. Here.

322
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,057
Oh, hi.

323
00:25:51,264 --> 00:25:55,064
- "Oh, hi. " After seven months?
- I'm sorry.

324
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:58,932
You know what you need?
This boy could use...

325
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:02,404
...some Stoli.
- This is a complete Christmas feast.

326
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:05,745
- Thank you.
- You struck gold at MIT.

327
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,406
No.

328
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,275
They expelled me for my
theory of actual reality.

329
00:26:11,451 --> 00:26:13,919
One for you. One for you.

330
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:15,486
Oh, wait.

331
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,890
For me.

332
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:20,424
So I came back home. Merry Christmas.

333
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:23,528
- Cheers.
- Welcome home.

334
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:26,722
I got a teaching gig at NYU.

335
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,163
Oh, so that's how you can
afford to splurge on us.

336
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:31,201
No. Sit down.

337
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:36,764
Gentlemen, our benefactor
On this Christmas day

338
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:41,004
Whose charity is only
matched By talent, I must say

339
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:45,140
A new member of the
Alphabet City Avant-garde

340
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:53,384
Angel Dumott Schunard

341
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:01,291
Today for you Tomorrow for me

342
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:08,267
Today for you Tomorrow for me

343
00:27:08,441 --> 00:27:12,104
- And you should hear her beat
- You earned this on the street?

344
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:15,736
It was my lucky day today On Avenue A

345
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:19,112
When a lady in a limousine Drove my way

346
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:22,846
She said, "Darling, be a
dear Haven't slept in a year

347
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:26,891
I need your help to make my
Neighbor's yappy dog disappear

348
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:33,124
This Akita, Evita, just won't shut
up I believe if you play nonstop

349
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:37,531
That pup will breathe its
very last High-strung breath

350
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:41,498
I'm certain that cur
Will bark itself to death"

351
00:27:41,674 --> 00:27:45,110
Today for you Tomorrow for me

352
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:48,413
Today for you Tomorrow for me

353
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:53,078
We agreed on a fee
$1000 guarantee, tax free

354
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,983
And a bonus if I trim her tree

355
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:59,717
Now, who could foretell
That it would go so well?

356
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:02,987
But sure as I am here That
dog is now in doggy hell

357
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:06,563
After an hour, Evita, in all her glory

358
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:10,730
On the window ledge Of that 23rd story

359
00:28:10,904 --> 00:28:14,169
Like Thelma and Louise
did When they got the blues

360
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,901
Swan-dove into the
courtyard Of the Gracie Mews

361
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:21,514
Today for you Tomorrow for me

362
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:24,844
Today for you Tomorrow for me

363
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,898
Back on the street Where I met my sweet

364
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:47,062
Where he was moaning and
groaning On the cold concrete

365
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,641
The nurse took him home
For some Mercurochrome

366
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,779
Then I dressed his wounds
And got him back on his feet

367
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:55,915
Sing it Today for you

368
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,913
Tomorrow for me

369
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,985
Today for you Tomorrow for me

370
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:03,520
I say Today for you

371
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,750
Tomorrow for me Today for you

372
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:11,625
Tomorrow

373
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:13,927
For me

374
00:29:15,135 --> 00:29:16,762
That was dope.

375
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:20,333
That was fresh.

376
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,171
- Speak.
- Speak.

377
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,506
Mark. Hi.

378
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,911
It's me. Maureen. Look,
I have a bit of a problem.

379
00:29:32,752 --> 00:29:34,083
I really need your help.

380
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:36,518
I hired Joanne as my
production manager...

381
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:39,317
...and I don't think she knows
what the hell she's doing.

382
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,528
If you could just... Please, baby,
come to the performance space.

383
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:45,358
- Hey, Maureen. Hi.
- Hi, baby.

384
00:29:45,565 --> 00:29:47,624
- Sure, I'll be there.
- Thank you.

385
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,563
- Okay.
- Thank you.

386
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:51,431
Okay, see you soon.

387
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:55,131
Can you believe her? I mean,
first she just dumps me...

388
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:57,707
- Maureen dumped you?
- Yes. She dumped me.

389
00:29:57,877 --> 00:29:59,344
For a lawyer named Joanne.

390
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,182
Now she wants me to help
her fix her sound equipment.

391
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:10,379
- Well, Mark, you could've said no.
- I know, but...

392
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:13,583
- That's cute. You still love her.
- Yeah, right.

393
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,954
You do.

394
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,225
- We have to go.
- Wanna go to this gathering?

395
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:23,902
- Where?
- Life Support.

396
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:25,195
On Christmas?

397
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:27,965
Some people don't have
anywhere else to go today.

398
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:29,574
You should come.

399
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:31,608
Knock yourselves out.

400
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:34,880
Everyone's welcome. It's not
just for people with AIDS.

401
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:38,540
Okay, yeah, I'll be there, but
first I got a protest to save.

402
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:41,219
See? Told you.

403
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:47,959
I'm just playing with you, boy.

404
00:30:49,696 --> 00:30:51,254
Well, it's Christmas.

405
00:30:51,464 --> 00:30:53,830
Don't stay in the house all day.

406
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,695
Bye.

407
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:39,939
Hi.

408
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:45,041
Maureen called me to try to
come help fix the equipment.

409
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,981
You're Mark?

410
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:49,584
Joanne?

411
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:03,466
- Maureen said she'd be here.
- Well, don't hold your breath.

412
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:06,104
This is so typical.

413
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:09,332
I told her not to call you.

414
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:11,774
Oh, well...

415
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:14,542
Can I help anyway?

416
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:17,148
I've hired an engineer.

417
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:19,182
Great.

418
00:32:20,086 --> 00:32:22,486
Well, nice to have met you, then.

419
00:32:25,325 --> 00:32:28,089
He's three hours late.

420
00:32:33,633 --> 00:32:36,033
The samples won't delay But the cable...

421
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:39,262
There's another way
Say something, anything

422
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:41,634
Test, one, two, three

423
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,401
Anything but that

424
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:48,173
- This is weird
- It's weird

425
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:50,077
- Very weird
- Fuckin' weird

426
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:53,844
I'm so mad that I don't know what to do

427
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,615
Fighting with microphones
Freezing down to my bones

428
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,987
And to top it all off I'm with you

429
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:05,156
Feel like going insane?
Got a fire in your brain?

430
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:08,823
And you're thinking
Of drinking gasoline?

431
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:12,902
- As a matter of fact
- Honey, I know this act

432
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:15,973
It's called the Tango: Maureen

433
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:20,137
The Tango: Maureen

434
00:33:20,313 --> 00:33:23,749
It's a dark, dizzy
merry-go-round

435
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:27,647
- As she keeps you dangling
- You're wrong

436
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,415
- Your heart she is mangling
- It's different with me

437
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,286
And you toss and you turn

438
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,154
'Cause her cold eyes can burn

439
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:38,387
Yet you yearn, and you churn And rebound

440
00:33:38,865 --> 00:33:41,834
I think I know what you mean

441
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:46,335
- The Tango: Maureen
- The Tango: Maureen

442
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:52,502
Has she ever pouted her lips
And called you "pookie'"?

443
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:53,940
Never.

444
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:57,480
Have you ever Doubted a kiss or two?

445
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,346
This is spooky

446
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:04,215
Did you swoon When she
walked through the door?

447
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,019
Every time, so be cautious

448
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:11,722
Did she moon over other boys?

449
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:15,458
- More than moon
- I'm getting nauseous

450
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:46,560
Where'd you learn to tango?

451
00:34:46,732 --> 00:34:50,327
With the French ambassador's
daughter in her room at Miss Porter's.

452
00:34:50,503 --> 00:34:51,970
And you?

453
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:54,503
With Nanette Himmelfarb,
the rabbi's daughter...

454
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:57,370
...at the Scarsdale
Jewish Community Center.

455
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:03,479
It's hard to do this backwards.

456
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:06,415
You should try it in heels.

457
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:32,042
- She cheated
- She cheated

458
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:34,042
- Maureen cheated
- Fuckin' cheated

459
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:37,882
I'm defeated I should give up right now

460
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:41,409
Gotta look on the bright
side With all of your might

461
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:45,148
I'd fall for her still, anyhow

462
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:49,226
When you're dancing her
dance You don't stand a chance

463
00:35:49,428 --> 00:35:52,761
Her grip of romance makes you fall

464
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:56,561
- So you think, "Might as well"
- "Dance a tango to hell"

465
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:59,830
"At least I'll have tangoed at all"

466
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:04,000
The Tango: Maureen

467
00:36:04,176 --> 00:36:07,771
Gotta dance till your diva is through

468
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:11,348
You pretend to believe her

469
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:15,283
'Cause in the end You can't leave her

470
00:36:15,454 --> 00:36:19,049
But the end, it will come
Still you have to play dumb

471
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:21,989
Till you're glum and
you bum And turn blue

472
00:36:22,862 --> 00:36:26,389
Why do we love when she's mean?

473
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,035
And she can be so obscene

474
00:36:32,004 --> 00:36:34,131
My Maureen

475
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,713
The Tango:

476
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:47,376
Maureen

477
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:50,582
Mark.

478
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:52,717
Mark.

479
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:56,787
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

480
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,428
Actually...

481
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,829
...I feel great now.

482
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,995
I feel lousy.

483
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:15,172
And we're patched.

484
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:17,873
Thanks.

485
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:21,283
- Maureen?
- Hi, baby.

486
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,922
- Hi, honey, we're...
- Pookie.

487
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,717
"Pookie"?

488
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:29,121
- You never called me pook...
- We're late.

489
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,997
Forget it.

490
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:35,895
- We're patched.
- Thank you.

491
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,298
Pookie.

492
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:42,334
Shut up.

493
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,168
Okay, everyone, let's begin.

494
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:16,638
First, I just want to welcome you all.

495
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:21,469
Why don't we start by going
around and introducing ourselves.

496
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:23,444
Steve.

497
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:25,407
Gordon.

498
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:27,211
Ali.

499
00:38:27,687 --> 00:38:29,154
Pam.

500
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,811
Sue.

501
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,082
Hi.

502
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,857
I'm Angel.

503
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:37,861
Tom.

504
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,520
Collins.

505
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:41,398
I'm Paul.

506
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,000
Sorry.

507
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:45,137
Excuse me.

508
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:50,908
And you are...?

509
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:54,638
Oh, I'm not... I don't have...

510
00:38:55,381 --> 00:38:57,315
I'm here with...

511
00:39:02,121 --> 00:39:04,055
I'm just here to...

512
00:39:07,393 --> 00:39:09,122
Mark.

513
00:39:09,328 --> 00:39:11,558
Mark. I'm Mark.

514
00:39:16,769 --> 00:39:19,260
Well, this is quite an operation.

515
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,366
Does anyone have a problem...

516
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:27,034
...if I film a little of
this for a documentary?

517
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:36,284
Make yourself comfortable, Mark.

518
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:41,592
Who wants to begin?

519
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,963
Well, I'm...

520
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,967
Yesterday...

521
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,204
...I found out my T cells were low.

522
00:39:57,376 --> 00:39:59,571
What was your reaction?

523
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:01,679
Scared.

524
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:05,508
How are you feeling today? Right now?

525
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:08,143
Okay.

526
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,813
All right.

527
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,115
Pretty good.

528
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,189
Is that all?

529
00:40:18,464 --> 00:40:20,898
It's the best I've felt in a long time.

530
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:25,670
- Months.
- Then why choose fear?

531
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:28,434
I'm a New Yorker.

532
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:30,438
Fear's my life.

533
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:42,080
Look, I find Some of
what you teach suspect

534
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:45,712
Because I'm used to Relying on intellect

535
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:49,349
But I try to open up
To what I don't know

536
00:40:49,562 --> 00:40:53,999
Because reason says I should have died

537
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,068
Three years ago

538
00:40:58,237 --> 00:41:01,206
There's only us

539
00:41:01,373 --> 00:41:04,900
There's only this

540
00:41:05,077 --> 00:41:08,012
Forget regret

541
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,176
Or life is yours to miss

542
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,581
No other road

543
00:41:14,753 --> 00:41:18,280
No other way

544
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:24,396
No day but today

545
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,922
What's the time?

546
00:41:57,129 --> 00:42:00,664
Well, it's gotta be close to midnight

547
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:06,399
My body's talking to me
It says, "Time for danger"

548
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:10,469
It says, "I wanna commit a crime

549
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:14,272
Wanna be the cause of a fight

550
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:17,040
I wanna put on a tight skirt

551
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:20,117
And flirt with a stranger"

552
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:25,013
I've had a knack from way back

553
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,091
At breaking the rules
Once I learn the game

554
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,491
Get up, life's too quick
I know someplace sick

555
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:35,690
Where this chick'll Dance in the flames

556
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:38,995
We don't need any money

557
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:42,106
I always get in for free

558
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:44,469
You can get in too

559
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:48,238
If you get in with me

560
00:42:48,414 --> 00:42:50,109
Let's go

561
00:42:50,282 --> 00:42:54,013
Out tonight

562
00:42:55,187 --> 00:42:56,620
I have to go

563
00:42:57,222 --> 00:43:00,988
Out tonight

564
00:43:03,462 --> 00:43:06,192
You wanna play? Let's run away

565
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:10,801
We won't be back Before
it's New Year's Day

566
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,337
Take me out tonight

567
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:16,772
Meow.

568
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:24,044
Yeah

569
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:27,518
When I get a wink From the doorman

570
00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:29,950
Do you know how lucky you'll be?

571
00:43:30,422 --> 00:43:31,980
That you're on the line

572
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:36,457
With the feline of Avenue B

573
00:43:36,662 --> 00:43:37,924
Let's go

574
00:43:38,664 --> 00:43:42,361
Out tonight

575
00:43:43,669 --> 00:43:45,398
I have to go

576
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:49,063
Out tonight

577
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:55,009
You wanna prowl? Be my night owl?

578
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,444
Well, take my hand we're gonna

579
00:43:57,616 --> 00:43:59,846
Howl

580
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:02,419
Out tonight

581
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:08,558
In the evening I've got to roam

582
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:12,197
Can't sleep in the
city Of neon and chrome

583
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,825
Feels too damn much like home

584
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:19,471
When the Spanish babies cry

585
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:22,033
So let's find a bar

586
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:25,802
So dark we forget who we are

587
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:31,883
Where all the scars From
the nevers and maybes die

588
00:44:32,051 --> 00:44:33,814
Let's go

589
00:44:33,986 --> 00:44:38,218
Out tonight

590
00:44:38,824 --> 00:44:40,849
I have to go

591
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,394
Out tonight

592
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:49,757
You're sweet Wanna hit the street?

593
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:53,199
Wanna wail at the moon
Like a cat in heat?

594
00:44:53,372 --> 00:44:55,237
Just take me

595
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:58,137
Out tonight

596
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:01,242
Please take me

597
00:45:01,413 --> 00:45:05,076
Out tonight

598
00:45:06,118 --> 00:45:08,382
Don't forsake me

599
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:12,046
Out tonight

600
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,453
I'll let you make me

601
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:19,062
Out tonight

602
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,425
Tonight

603
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:22,498
Tonight

604
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:23,794
Tonight

605
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:32,176
Who do you think you are?

606
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:35,703
Barging in on me and my guitar

607
00:45:35,881 --> 00:45:38,645
Little girl, hey, the door is that way

608
00:45:38,817 --> 00:45:42,082
You better go You know
the fire's out anyway

609
00:45:42,254 --> 00:45:45,121
Take your powder Take your candle

610
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,623
Your sweet whisper I just can't handle

611
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:51,660
Well, take your hair In the moonlight

612
00:45:52,131 --> 00:45:57,626
Your brown eyes Goodbye, good night

613
00:45:57,836 --> 00:46:00,100
I should tell you I should tell you

614
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:03,002
I should tell you, I should... No.

615
00:46:03,175 --> 00:46:05,735
Another time, another place

616
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:09,711
Our temperature would climb
There'd be a long embrace

617
00:46:09,882 --> 00:46:12,851
We'd do another dance
It'd be another play

618
00:46:13,018 --> 00:46:14,485
Looking for romance?

619
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:18,612
Come back another day

620
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:22,820
Another day

621
00:46:23,695 --> 00:46:26,528
The heart may freeze

622
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:30,134
Or it can burn

623
00:46:30,302 --> 00:46:33,271
The pain will ease

624
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:36,765
If I can learn

625
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:40,173
There is no future

626
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:43,371
There is no past

627
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:46,677
I live this moment as

628
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:50,618
My last

629
00:46:50,822 --> 00:46:54,121
There's only us

630
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,877
There's only this

631
00:46:57,912 --> 00:47:01,195
Forget regret

632
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:04,130
Or life is yours to miss

633
00:47:04,303 --> 00:47:07,898
No other road

634
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:11,338
No other way

635
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:17,005
No day but today

636
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:19,878
Excuse me if I'm off track

637
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:22,043
But if you're so wise Then tell me

638
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:23,916
Why do you need smack?

639
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:25,351
Take your needle

640
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:27,219
Take your fancy prayer

641
00:47:27,392 --> 00:47:30,520
Don't forget, Get the
moonlight out of your hair

642
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:33,197
Long ago you might have Lit up my heart

643
00:47:33,365 --> 00:47:38,735
But the fire's dead Ain't
never ever gonna start

644
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:42,401
Another time Another place

645
00:47:42,574 --> 00:47:46,169
The words would only rhyme
We'd be in outer space

646
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:49,508
It'd be another song
We'd sing another way

647
00:47:49,681 --> 00:47:55,085
You wanna prove me wrong?
Come back another day

648
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:00,289
Another day

649
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:03,951
There's only yes

650
00:48:04,162 --> 00:48:07,325
Only tonight

651
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:10,695
We must let go

652
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:13,770
To know what's right

653
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:17,500
No other course

654
00:48:17,676 --> 00:48:20,873
No other way

655
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:27,212
No day but today

656
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:30,913
I can't control

657
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:33,922
Control your temper

658
00:48:34,092 --> 00:48:38,051
My destiny

659
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,562
She doesn't see

660
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:43,530
I trust my soul

661
00:48:43,702 --> 00:48:47,661
- Who says that there's a soul?
- My only goal

662
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,866
Is just to be

663
00:48:52,044 --> 00:48:53,909
Just let me be

664
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,575
- Who do you think you are?
- There's only now, there's only here

665
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:07,123
- Barging in on me and my guitar
- Give in to love, or live in fear

666
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:10,125
- Little girl, hey
- No other path

667
00:49:10,662 --> 00:49:14,598
- The door is that way
- No other way

668
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,968
No day but today

669
00:49:18,003 --> 00:49:20,597
The fire's out anyway

670
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:23,297
No day but today

671
00:49:23,475 --> 00:49:27,172
Take your powder Take your candle

672
00:49:27,346 --> 00:49:30,042
No day but today

673
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:33,878
Take your brown eyes, Your
pretty smile, your silhouette

674
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:36,282
No day but today

675
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:40,892
Another time, another place,
Another rhyme, a warm embrace

676
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:42,923
No day but today

677
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:46,189
Another dance, Another
way, another chance

678
00:49:46,398 --> 00:49:49,595
Another day

679
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:56,731
No day but today

680
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,691
- Speak.
- Speak.

681
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,200
Mark, Roger, it's Benny.

682
00:50:26,405 --> 00:50:29,374
Look, you still got a few
hours to stop Maureen's protest.

683
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,566
My offer expires after dark.

684
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:32,732
Hey.

685
00:50:33,245 --> 00:50:34,837
How you doing?

686
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:43,449
- Look, about last night...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

687
00:50:45,757 --> 00:50:48,988
You know, Mimi's gonna be
at Maureen's show tonight.

688
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:51,058
You should come too.

689
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,897
I'd hate to see you pass up
something that could be good for you.

690
00:50:55,834 --> 00:50:57,859
You'll only regret it.

691
00:50:58,270 --> 00:50:59,897
I'll live.

692
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:04,765
Right.

693
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,676
Will I lose my dignity?

694
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:45,715
Will someone care?

695
00:51:45,884 --> 00:51:49,786
Will I wake tomorrow

696
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:56,588
From this nightmare?

697
00:51:56,795 --> 00:52:01,255
Will I lose my dignity?

698
00:52:01,466 --> 00:52:07,427
Will someone care?

699
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:11,235
Will I wake tomorrow

700
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:18,372
From this nightmare?

701
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:22,748
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose my dignity?

702
00:52:23,154 --> 00:52:25,714
Will someone care?

703
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:29,258
Will someone care?

704
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:32,988
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will I wake tomorrow

705
00:52:33,198 --> 00:52:40,036
- From this nightmare?
- From this nightmare?

706
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:44,539
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose my dignity?

707
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:50,147
- Will someone care?
- Will I lose my dignity?

708
00:52:50,315 --> 00:52:54,615
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will someone care?

709
00:52:54,786 --> 00:53:01,282
- From this nightmare?
- Will I wake tomorrow

710
00:53:01,459 --> 00:53:03,950
- Will I lose my dignity?
- From this nightmare?

711
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:06,596
Will I lose my dignity?

712
00:53:06,765 --> 00:53:11,896
- Will someone care?
- Will I lose my dignity?

713
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,200
- Will I wake tomorrow
- Will someone care?

714
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:20,470
- From this nightmare?
- Will I wake tomorrow

715
00:53:20,645 --> 00:53:23,170
From this nightmare?

716
00:53:23,348 --> 00:53:27,409
- Will I lose my dignity?
- Will I lose?

717
00:53:27,586 --> 00:53:33,684
Will someone care?

718
00:53:33,858 --> 00:53:37,760
Will I wake tomorrow

719
00:53:37,963 --> 00:53:46,302
From this nightmare?

720
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,510
I am so glad you came, man.

721
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:05,280
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

722
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:07,448
Come on, get up.

723
00:54:07,892 --> 00:54:09,655
Come on, let's go.

724
00:54:09,995 --> 00:54:11,792
- Wake up.
- This ain't a campground.

725
00:54:11,997 --> 00:54:12,986
Let's go. You gotta go.

726
00:54:13,198 --> 00:54:15,792
Christ, it's a lady. Come
on, ma'am, you gotta get up.

727
00:54:16,001 --> 00:54:17,969
Smile for Ted Koppel, officers.

728
00:54:21,506 --> 00:54:22,996
Who do you think you are?

729
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:24,698
I don't need no goddamn help...

730
00:54:24,876 --> 00:54:27,037
...from some bleeding-heart cameraman.

731
00:54:27,212 --> 00:54:29,806
My life's not for you to
make a name for yourself on.

732
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:32,040
Easy, sugar, easy. He was just trying...

733
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:34,344
Just trying to use me to kill his guilt.

734
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:36,953
It's not that kind of movie, honey.

735
00:54:37,122 --> 00:54:39,522
This place is full of artists.

736
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,491
Hey, artist, you got a dollar?

737
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,464
Didn't think so.

738
00:55:01,479 --> 00:55:03,447
New York City

739
00:55:03,615 --> 00:55:05,879
- Center of the universe
- Sing it, girl.

740
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:09,077
Times are shitty, but I'm
pretty sure They can't get worse

741
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:12,052
- I hear that.
- It's a comfort to know

742
00:55:12,223 --> 00:55:14,487
When you're singing
The hit-the-road blues

743
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:19,619
That anywhere else you could
Possibly go after New York would be

744
00:55:20,498 --> 00:55:21,931
A pleasure cruise

745
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,432
Now you're talking.

746
00:55:39,451 --> 00:55:42,818
Well, I'm thwarted
by a Metaphysic puzzle

747
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:47,953
And I'm sick of grading
papers, That I know

748
00:55:48,693 --> 00:55:52,322
I'm shouting in my sleep I need a muzzle

749
00:55:53,498 --> 00:55:57,832
And all this misery pays no salary So

750
00:55:58,002 --> 00:56:02,632
Let's open up a restaurant In Santa Fe

751
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:06,971
Sunny Santa Fe would be nice

752
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:11,377
We'll open up a restaurant In Santa Fe

753
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:16,282
And leave this To the roaches and mice

754
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:34,337
- You teach?
- Yeah, I teach.

755
00:56:34,506 --> 00:56:36,497
Computer Age Philosophy.

756
00:56:36,674 --> 00:56:39,108
When my students would rather watch TV.

757
00:56:39,277 --> 00:56:41,302
- America.
- America.

758
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:43,310
You're a sensitive aesthete

759
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:45,949
Brush the sauce onto the meat

760
00:56:46,117 --> 00:56:49,450
You can make the menu
Sparkle with a rhyme

761
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:52,320
You can drum a gentle drum

762
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,720
I can seat guests as they come

763
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:59,626
Chatting not about Heidegger, But wine

764
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:03,597
Let's open up a restaurant In Santa Fe

765
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:07,067
- Santa Fe
- Our labors would reap financial gain

766
00:57:07,272 --> 00:57:08,239
- Gain
- Gain

767
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:09,929
- Gain
- We'll open up

768
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:12,576
A restaurant in Santa Fe

769
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:15,872
- Santa Fe
- And save from devastation our brains

770
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:17,480
Save our brains

771
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:22,586
We'll pack up all ourjunk
And fly so far away

772
00:57:22,754 --> 00:57:27,316
Devote ourselves to projects That sell

773
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:31,690
We'll open up a restaurant In Santa Fe

774
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:36,265
Forget this cold bohemian hell

775
00:58:01,759 --> 00:58:06,492
Do you know the way To Santa Fe?

776
00:58:06,698 --> 00:58:09,531
You know, tumbleweeds

777
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:12,329
Prairie dogs

778
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:15,431
Yeah

779
00:58:21,479 --> 00:58:24,004
Oh, guys, I'm late for Maureen's
sound check. I gotta go.

780
00:58:24,182 --> 00:58:26,013
- Here, you can help me.

781

See you later.

782
00:58:31,389 --> 00:58:33,050
It's cold.

783
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:35,687

01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,386
- All my life
- All my life

811
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:16,259
- I've longed to discover
- I've longed to discover

812
01:00:16,427 --> 01:00:21,694
- Something as true as this is
- Something as true as this is

813
01:00:21,866 --> 01:00:26,303

815
01:00:28,773 --> 01:00:30,934

816
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:32,736
With a thousand sweet kisses

817
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:35,504
- When you're worn out and tired
- I'll cover you

818
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,204
With a thousand sweet kisses

819
01:00:37,382 --> 01:00:39,509
- When your heart has expired
- I'll cover you

820
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:43,085

822
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:48,815

823
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:52,128
- Oh, lover
- Oh, lover

824
01:00:52,163 --> 01:00:57,965
- I'll cover you
- I'll cover you

825
01:01:14,652 --> 01:01:16,745
I'm gonna celebrate tonight.

826
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,722
All right, cool.

827
01:01:23,895 --> 01:01:25,658
- The usual.
- Cool.

828
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,855
- Hey.
- Hey. Can I talk to you for a sec...?

829
01:01:28,032 --> 01:01:32,799
Hey. Lover boy. You
steal my client, you die.

830
01:01:33,004 --> 01:01:35,063
You didn't miss me, you won't miss her.

831
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:38,401
Look around. Got plenty of customers.

832
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:46,815
Look.

833
01:01:48,052 --> 01:01:50,885
About last night, I'm sorry.

834
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:54,057
- I don't know what the...
- Just forget it.

835
01:01:54,225 --> 01:01:58,059
I was out of line. Can
I make it up to you?

836
01:01:59,197 --> 01:02:00,459
How?

837
01:02:00,631 --> 01:02:02,758
Bunch of us are getting
together tonight.

838
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:05,026
At the Life Caf? after Maureen's show.

839
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:06,828
Yeah?

840
01:02:08,673 --> 01:02:10,470
Would you like to come with me?

841
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:17,145
Sure. I'd like that.

842
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:25,419
So you're a tough guy?

843
01:02:25,723 --> 01:02:27,588
No. Not really.

844
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:29,623
That's pretty good.

845
01:02:37,401 --> 01:02:40,029
Over there. The guy with the glasses.

846
01:02:40,238 --> 01:02:41,671
Right there.

847
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:44,205
- Angel.
- Mimi.

848
01:02:45,476 --> 01:02:48,172
Oh, my God, you look so good.

849
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:36,692
Maureen! Maureen! Maureen!

850
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:53,104
Last night I had a dream.

851
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:59,747
I found myself in a
desert called Cyberland.

852
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,145
It was hot.

853
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:03,549
My canteen had sprung
a leak, and I was...

854
01:04:04,689 --> 01:04:06,350
...thirsty.

855
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:09,857
Out of the abyss walked a cow.

856
01:04:10,027 --> 01:04:11,255
Elsie.

857
01:04:11,629 --> 01:04:14,860
I asked if she had
anything to drink. She said:

858
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:21,665
"I'm forbidden to produce milk

859
01:04:21,872 --> 01:04:26,172
In Cyberland we only drink

860
01:04:27,845 --> 01:04:29,710
Diet Coke"

861
01:04:31,882 --> 01:04:33,144
She said:

862
01:04:35,419 --> 01:04:37,319
"Only thing to do

863
01:04:37,488 --> 01:04:42,050
Is jump over the moon"

864
01:04:44,662 --> 01:04:49,099
I

865
01:04:49,267 --> 01:04:51,599
Gotta get out of here

866
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:57,234
It's like I'm being tied to the
hood Of a yellow rental truck

867
01:04:57,408 --> 01:05:01,674
Being packed in With
fertilizer and fuel oil

868
01:05:01,846 --> 01:05:06,943
Pushed over a cliff By
a suicidal Mickey Mouse

869
01:05:09,053 --> 01:05:12,853
I've

870
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:18,860
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta

871
01:05:19,597 --> 01:05:22,896
Gotta, gotta find a way

872
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:28,535
To jump over the moon

873
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:33,871
Only thing to do Is jump over the moon

874
01:05:34,045 --> 01:05:36,513
Yeah! Go, Maureen!

875
01:05:37,281 --> 01:05:40,478
Then a little bulldog entered.

876
01:05:40,651 --> 01:05:44,280
His name, we have learned, was Benny.

877
01:05:46,891 --> 01:05:49,325
And although he once had principles...

878
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:52,394
...he abandoned them
to live as a lapdog...

879
01:05:52,563 --> 01:05:55,031
...to a wealthy daughter
of the revolution.

880
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:59,297
A one, two, three "That's bull," he said

881
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:05,037
"Ever since the cat took up
the fiddle That cow's been jumpy

882
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:09,077
The dish and the spoon were
evicted From the table and eloped

883
01:06:09,246 --> 01:06:12,272
She's had trouble with that
milk And the moon ever since

884
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:15,078
Maybe it's a female thing

885
01:06:15,252 --> 01:06:19,484
'Cause who'd wanna
leave Cyberland anyway?

886
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:21,249
Walls ain't so bad

887
01:06:21,425 --> 01:06:24,326
The dish and the spoon, for
instance, They're down on their luck

888
01:06:24,495 --> 01:06:26,520
They come knockin' On my doghouse door

889
01:06:26,731 --> 01:06:28,961
And I say, 'Not in my
back yard, utensils.

890
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:30,827
Go back to China"'

891
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:36,738
"The only way out is up,"
Elsie whispered to me.

892
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:41,310
"A leap

893
01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:45,575
Of faith"

894
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:48,145
- Yeah.
- That's it.

895
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,843
"Still thirsty?"

896
01:06:51,455 --> 01:06:52,888
"Parched. "

897
01:06:54,692 --> 01:06:56,319
"Have some milk. "

898
01:06:59,597 --> 01:07:03,499
And I lowered myself
beneath her swollen udder...

899
01:07:04,402 --> 01:07:08,839
...and I sucked the sweetest
milk I had ever tasted.

900
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:21,249
"Climb onboard," she said.

901
01:07:21,419 --> 01:07:24,808
And as a harvest moon
rose over Cyberland...

902
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:28,197
...we reared back, we
sprang into a gallop...

903
01:07:29,136 --> 01:07:32,230
...leaping out of orbit.

904
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:34,374
I awoke, singing...

905
01:07:38,645 --> 01:07:41,478
Leap of faith Leap of faith

906
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:43,878
Leap of faith Leap of faith

907
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:46,542
Only thing to do

908
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,488
Only thing to do is jump

909
01:07:49,656 --> 01:07:55,458
Only thing to do is Jump over the moon

910
01:07:55,629 --> 01:08:01,067
Only thing to do is Jump over the moon

911
01:08:01,235 --> 01:08:03,863
Over the moon

912
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:09,304
Over the...
