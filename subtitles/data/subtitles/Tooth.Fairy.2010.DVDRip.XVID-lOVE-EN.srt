00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:43,054
There's a battle on the boards with
both teams really digging for the puck.

2
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,691
Now it squirts loose,
and the Ice Wolves have it.

3
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,419
And the puck is cleared out of their zone.

4
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,395
And here they come!

5
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:56,229
What a hit!

6
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,098
Come on, boys, use the body!

7
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:01,172
- Take him wide, take him wide!
- Rapton's flying up the ice.

8
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:03,070
Take him to the outside! Here we go.

9
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,474
He shoots! Nice save by Drah.

10
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:09,576
What a hit!

11
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,980
What action, eh, Hank?

12
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,111
- The Ice Wolves are just getting hammered.
- Oh, no.

13
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:17,017
Tooth, Tooth, Tooth!

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,420
- There's a familiar chant, Jim.
- Thompson.

15
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:23,256
And the coach is calling for
the big defenseman, Derek Thompson.

16
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,524
And here comes the Tooth Fairy.

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,463
Find a dark jersey and hit it!

18
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,897
Tooth, Tooth, Tooth!

19
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,148
That is an incisor!

20
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,347
I got the tooth.
I got the tooth, baby! Yeah!

21
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:29,859
And the Tooth Fairy, Derek Thompson,
has struck again.

22
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,596
You can't handle the tooth.
And that's the tooth...

23
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,710
...the whole tooth,
and nothing but the tooth.

24
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,676
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.

25
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:51,277
Open the door for the Tooth Fairy.

26
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:55,246
Penalty on number 14, Derek Thompson.

27
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:59,188
- Five-minute major for boarding.
- Yeah!

28
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:03,159
Who's the Tooth Fairy?
Am I the Tooth-? I'm the Tooth Fairy!

29
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,564
Stop it. Stop it.

30
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,797
Yeah, no, I'm not scared, you know.
I play hockey.

31
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,495
We'll go out, have a good time,
see what we make of it.

32
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,401
- What's going on out here?
- Come here.

33
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,701
I want you to meet
the future of our franchise.

34
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,071
- New kid.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,305
He's not gonna be here long
till he gets snapped up by the Kings.

36
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:26,077
But listen, while he is here,
your job on the ice is to take care of him.

37
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,653
- Okay. All right.
- Nothing else matters, right?

38
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:29,914
- Mick?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,026
Derek, Mick Donnelly, our first-line center.
Mick, Derek. He's your bodyguard.

40
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:35,889
- What's up?
- Welcome to pro hockey.

41
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,053
Yeah, is there an old-timers' game today?

42
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,667
I didn't realize you were even still playing,
man. I used to be a big fan.

43
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,872
All right. See you later, man.

44
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,565
So I guess that's my bodyguard.

45
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:49,902
- Crazy.
- He's a big one.

46
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,805
Yeah, he's a big guy.

47
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:57,311
- Hello, Mr. Thompson!
- Mr. Thompson.

48
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,243
Tooth Fairy!

49
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,919
Can I have your autograph?

50
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:04,955
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
What's your name, buddy?

51
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,650
Gabe. I'm the third-leading scorer
in my hockey league.

52
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:09,886
Our team won
the Mighty Mite's Championship.

53
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,258
Wow, that's fantastic.
Good for you, Gabe.

54
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,198
One day, I'm gonna play hockey
in the big leagues just like you used to.

55
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,731
- You work pretty hard at hockey, do you?
- I play almost every day.

56
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:24,740
And I drive him almost every day.

57
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:26,842
- How old are you?
- I'm 8.

58
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:29,573
You're 8. You're 8.
Okay, well, here's the deal, Gabe.

59
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:33,879
You're 8 and you're the third-leading scorer
in your league behind two other 8-year-olds.

60
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:36,113
Well, one's 9.

61
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,747
Okay. Well, see, Gabe, somewhere
in this country, there's a 7-year-old...

62
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,588
...playing against 12-year-olds,
and he's outscoring them.

63
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:46,459
He's killing them, making them wanna
get run over by a Zamboni and die.

64
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:50,069
There are a bunch like that kid in every rink.
When the time's right...

65
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,728
...those kids will battle it out and
only a handful of them will get signed.

66
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:55,772
Now let's say you do make the NHL.

67
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,308
You won't...

68
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,379
...but let's say you do.
You hit the show right out of college.

69
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:04,346
The show hits you right back.
Before you say "slap shot"...

70
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:08,214
...you're down to the minors with
a blown-out shoulder and nowhere to go.

71
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,950
Listen, lower your expectations.

72
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,521
That's how you're gonna be happy.

73
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:19,322
There you go, Gabe.

74
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,474
I want to suck your blood.

75
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:32,509
What? What are you looking at?

76
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:36,274
And laughing at?
Why aren't you afraid?

77
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:39,475
- Because those are french fries.
- No.

78
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,314
I can't eat french fries.

79
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,321
French fries are fatal to vampires.

80
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:52,554
- Hey, I have an idea.
- Can't talk. Still dead.

81
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:58,436
- Mommy, my tooth came out.
- Hey. Yay!

82
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,165
Oh, congrats.

83
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:04,504
- The tooth fairy's gonna visit me tonight.
- You bet. Let's see.

84
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,904
You are such a big girl.

85
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:10,208
Hey, hey, hey, I'm the Tooth Fairy.

86
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:13,247
I thought you said you were a vampire.

87
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,711
You got some inconsistent mythology.

88
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:20,790
I have a lot of homework.
Can I be excused?

89
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,291
Yeah.

90
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:28,994
Mommy, it's time for you to go now
so Derek can start babysitting.

91
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,502
Not just yet.
Wanna go put your jammies on?

92
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,771
I wonder if it would help if Randy
and you had some one-on-one time.

93
00:06:37,944 --> 00:06:41,539
Sure, I could do that. So long as
I don't have to be alone with him.

94
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:47,850
Well, Rene's here. Oh, a little ketchup.

95
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,424
- Oh, tooth fairy.
- You know what? I got it.

96
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,358
Look, I put on my pajamas.

97
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:00,891
Dracula's back from the dead.

98
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:04,127
And your french fries
are not powerful enough.

99
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:09,537
- What do you guys think of Donnelly?
- Man, that kid is fast.

100
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:13,702
- You mean the next Gretzky.
- I love him already, like a long-lost brother.

101
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,045
- Can we just play?
- It's to you.

102
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:19,910
- I'm a little short.
- He's a little short.

103
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:25,114
But this autograph that says
"The Tooth Fairy"...

104
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,351
...is worth 10 bucks on eBay.
Ten of these is 100 bucks, so I'm in.

105
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:31,053
- No, you gotta pay.
- It's not a socialist game, Castro.

106
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:34,928
Hey, it's me. I'm good for it.

107
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:38,227
I'll be right back.

108
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,395
- He took his cards.
- Is this guy serious?

109
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,973
- Just fold so we can play.
- Who takes the cards?

110
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:45,873
Don't the kids have, like,
a piggy bank or something?

111
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,626
- I'm home!
- Hello, gorgeous.

112
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:02,955
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

113
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,962
- Hey, Vinnie's? Some brews?
- Let's do it, boys. Come on.

114
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,827
All we have is juice box here.

115
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:11,596
Know what, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna
hang out, but I'll walk you guys out.

116
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:17,638
Mommy! Mommy!

117
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,972
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

118
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,011
- What happened, honey?
- My tooth is gone.

119
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,616
Well, that's because
the tooth fairy took it.

120
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,977
But there's no money. I looked.

121
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,279
Let's look together.
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

122
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:35,359
- The vampire has returned.
- Not a vampire moment.

123
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:38,053
- It's not anywhere.
- Well...

124
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,600
I bet they took it to weigh it...

125
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,895
...on the toothometer
to see what it's worth...

126
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,901
...before they bring the money. Right?

127
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,540
Sure. That's how the whole
tooth thing works.

128
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,973
No. That's not how it works.

129
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:56,548
You put the tooth under your pillow,
the tooth fairy flies into your room...

130
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,707
...when you're sleeping, takes the tooth...

131
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:02,218
...and leaves a dollar. Where is it?

132
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:06,321
Okay. You tell me when to stop
when the tooth fairy has been here.

133
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:10,087
- Because I have 5, 10. I even got a 20.
- Derek.

134
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,254
Stop.

135
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:16,498
Okay, Tess, you're a big girl now.

136
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,660
You're 6. Let's get this out of the way.

137
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:20,965
There's no such thing as a too-

138
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,566
- Here it is.
- How did it get down there?

139
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:27,941
Oh, you must have rolled over
in your sleep and it fell on the floor.

140
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,121
I forgot. People forget.

141
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:39,747
So your big idea to handle it
was to tell Tess there is no tooth fairy?

142
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:43,293
Come on. The reason why there
are so many unhappy people in the world:

143
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:45,454
They're clinging to some version
of what if.

144
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:46,792
Okay, so dreams are bad?

145
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,594
If they lead to unrealistic
expectations, then yes.

146
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,202
- This is ridiculous.
- I know.

147
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,464
- I'm going to bed.
- No. Carly.

148
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,801
And you...

149
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,636
...are leaving.

150
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:00,237
- Don't get all dramatic.
- I'm her mother.

151
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,405
I get to say when her
childhood fantasies end, not you.

152
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:39,479
What?

153
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:46,255
"Disbelief in fairy. Summons. "

154
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:50,427
What? What?

155
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,372
Yes.

156
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,839
Thompson? Derek Thompson?

157
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:22,113
Yes. Yes, God. It's me.
Is that you, God?

158
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:23,953
You're Thompson?

159
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:26,115
You're God?

160
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,886
No, I'm Tracy. I'm your caseworker.
What is this?

161
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,723
How disappointing.

162
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,196
Come with me, please.

163
00:12:34,934 --> 00:12:38,495
No, thank you. Thank you.
Fairy Krishnas.

164
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,138
What are you wearing?

165
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:43,469
I- I don't know what I'm wearing.
What are you wearing?

166
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:46,635
- Who is this guy?
- Dream killer. I don't like your sort.

167
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:49,443
What'd I do? Why am I here?

168
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,515
- Where am I?
- No one likes your kind here.

169
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:55,347
No one likes your attitude. The way you
show up acting strange. "Why am I here?

170
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:59,218
- What are these giant wings?"
- Hey, hey! Do we have a problem?

171
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:02,384
Yeah, we have a problem.
You just said, "Do we have a problem"...

172
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,427
- ... which has given us a problem.
- Right.

173
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:05,586
- Tracy, right?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,393
- What a pretty girl's name you have.
- Don't laugh at that.

175
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:11,093
That's strike two.
You don't wanna get to strike three.

176
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,501
- Oh, yeah? What happens after strike three?
- Strike four.

177
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:16,402
Yeah.

178
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:20,171
We'll get your uniform sorted out
and then we can get you registered...

179
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:22,746
- ... and begin your training.
- Training for what?

180
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:27,249
"Training for what?" You, Mr. Thompson,
are gonna spend some time...

181
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,615
...as a tooth fairy.

182
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,787
Yeah.

183
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:36,788
"As a tooth fairy. "

184
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,796
Someone get him, please.
Calm down, everyone.

185
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,367
He's relatively harmless.

186
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,164
- Everyone all right?
- Really? What are you, fairy patrol?

187
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:49,706
I'm 230 pounds of man. It's gonna
take more than eight fairies to get me.

188
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:52,504
Get your fairy hands off me.
Is this fairy etiquette?

189
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:54,307
All right. Okay.

190
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,345
- Where were we?
- Help! Wake me up!

191
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:59,383
I'm in a nightmare! Please!
Please, help me!

192
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:02,180
The nightmare's just beginning, buddy.

193
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:06,152
You want a shot at the title?

194
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,555
Is that it? You feeling lucky...

195
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,159
- ... punk?
- Hey.

196
00:14:12,331 --> 00:14:15,323
Maybe I am. Hold these, baby.

197
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:18,561
I can't see anything, give them back.
That- It was a stupid idea.

198
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:22,367
Oh, yeah. You want a piece of this, huh?
I'm ready to go.

199
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:24,666
Hey.

200
00:14:24,844 --> 00:14:27,404
You just made a big mistake.

201
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:29,337
No.

202
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,142
Please. You got a magic wand.

203
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,376
You gonna pull a rabbit out of the hat?

204
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,248
Fairy fight!

205
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,756
- Let's not get carried away.
- Now I got one too.

206
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,917
I'm gonna introduce you to
the Hammer brothers, Sledge and Jack.

207
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:45,086
Who do you want?
Who do you wanna meet?

208
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:47,664
- I can't see. Can't see.
- Oh, dear.

209
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,563
It looks like you picked on the wrong fairy.

210
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:54,067
I can see. Oh, magic wand.

211
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,570
Oh, my gosh,
the magic wand go bang-bang.

212
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,868
What is going on here?

213
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,222
- I'll tell you what's going on.
- The sugar-dumb fairy showed up.

214
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,687
He was gonna introduce me...

215
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:15,190
- ... to the Hammer brothers.
- They're still in town.

216
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:18,228
Stop it! You're behaving like leprechauns.

217
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,524
He has got such a major attitude problem.

218
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,794
Oh, I'm well aware of his attitude,
believe me.

219
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,268
- Hello, Mr. Thompson.
- Hi.

220
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,033
Sorry about the foul-up with your outfit.

221
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,642
Budget problems.
Tracy will take care of it.

222
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,802
Who, him? Yeah, sure. Great.

223
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,713
You, sir, are guilty
of disseminating disbelief.

224
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:40,010
Killing dreams.

225
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:43,053
Committing first-degree murder
of fantasy...

226
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:45,486
- ... which by fairy law-
- Wait, is this because...

227
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,092
- ... of what happened with Tess? Listen-
- Excuse me.

228
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,628
I hadn't finished speaking. Did I look
as though I had finished speaking?

229
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,822
Don't know.
Everybody's got British accents.

230
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,130
You just interrupted me again while
I was admonishing you for interrupting me.

231
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:00,795
Do I not look official enough?

232
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,469
I don't understand...

233
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,441
...why policemen or firemen
don't get interrupted...

234
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:10,514
...but you add a pair of wings and
suddenly all manners go out the window.

235
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,948
Shouldn't you be more in awe
of somebody with wings than without?

236
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:18,423
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

237
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,458
I could just fly up into the air
and do something crazy.

238
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:24,659
Maybe I breathe fire.

239
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,320
You don't know.

240
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:33,171
I'm sorry for interrupting you.
I didn't mean it.

241
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,002
That is better.

242
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,275
In order to pay your debt to humanity...

243
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:42,107
...you are hereby ordered
to serve time as a tooth fairy.

244
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:45,011
The normal sentence is one week...

245
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:48,847
...but because you have the nerve,
the unmitigated gall...

246
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:51,819
...to actually call yourself
a tooth fairy...

247
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:55,051
...thus make a mockery
of everything we stand for...

248
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:59,288
...I'm sentencing you
to two weeks' tooth-fairy duty.

249
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,490
No, no, no. It's unfair. No.

250
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,898
- Interrupting.
- Interrupting again. Unbelievable.

251
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:09,030
Take him away. See that he's properly
outfitted and get him into flying school.

252
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,698
I'm sorry, what?

253
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:15,006
Oh, but first, you get to meet Jerry.

254
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,746
Excuse me, Fairy Godmother?
I have one last question.

255
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:24,122
Does this tutu make my butt look big?

256
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,158
Yes.

257
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,159
Huge.

258
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,861
Egg on the face.

259
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:37,730
- No, don't. No.
- Come on.

260
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:44,799
- All right.
- Good. You got the male version.

261
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:48,378
- Give us a spin so I can see.
- How about I give you a spin with my fist?

262
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:50,208
- What does that mean?
- It's a threat.

263
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:53,079
- It sounds like you're gonna-
- I'll punch you in the nose.

264
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:55,686
- You should have said that. Clearer.
- What's that?

265
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,653
That is just pathetic. Just like a child.

266
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,382
Chicken is fine.

267
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,254
I don't hate your chicken.

268
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,862
I like your chicken. I hate your brisket.

269
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,430
Yeah, I'm coming. Goodbye.

270
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,763
Never marry a leprechaun.
Oh, the dream-popper.

271
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,200
Hey. Did it make you feel good
to lie to that kid?

272
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:16,034
- I didn't lie.
- You told the kid there was no tooth fairy.

273
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,436
- Right.
- Liar.

274
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,010
- Look, I'm sorry I-
- "Sorry" is a beginning.

275
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,273
Now, if you're gonna be a fairy,
you gotta be ready.

276
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:25,212
Although...

277
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,519
Yeah.

278
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,451
Dude, there is a pill.

279
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,319
I mean, an amazing pill.

280
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:37,428
You take this pill,
you don't have to do any of this.

281
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,198
- Really?
- No, I was just kidding.

282
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,527
You're mad. You believed,
then I took it away.

283
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:46,228
Be mad at me, I don't care. I have tenure.
Come on, walk with Jerry.

284
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:50,205
Okay, here's your tool pouch.
Waterproof. A lot of compartments.

285
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,742
You can get a lot of stuff in there.
You dig?

286
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,937
- Yeah.
- Okay. This...

287
00:18:56,348 --> 00:19:00,216
This is your wand. Tooth detector, radar
jammer. Keeps picking up Radio Caliente.

288
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,479
- I don't know what that's about.
- What's that?

289
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:03,952
Magic generator button.

290
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:07,559
Does whatever you want it to do.
But you have to believe or it won't work.

291
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:11,389
So it's pretty much useless to humans.
And this.

292
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,964
You don't ever wanna lose this.

293
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,693
- What is it?
- Well, it looks like an iPod adapter.

294
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:19,633
- Right, so, what is it?
- It's an iPod adapter.

295
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:21,566
What's it for?

296
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,435
Listening to your iPod.

297
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:27,173
You get a free iPod.
Did you not ask for your free iPod?

298
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,745
- No. Really?
- I'm just kidding.

299
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:30,472
Yeah, why do you keep doing that?

300
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,311
I'm not well. I actually
just have a few months to live.

301
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,319
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Of course. Would I share that with you?

302
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:40,425
I just met you. Plus, you lie to kids.
Come on, we got business to do.

303
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,886
Invisibility spray.

304
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:45,292
Use it, nobody can see you
except other fairies.

305
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:48,900
And this, dude, trust me.

306
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:52,593
Shrinking paste.
You put a little on your tongue...

307
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:55,331
...you shrink down
to about 6 inches tall.

308
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,006
You wanna do it?
Come on, let's do it together.

309
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:00,372
Come on, we'll jump
into each other's hands.

310
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:04,073
- I don't wanna jump into your hands.
- Really? Come on. Let's get small.

311
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,582
Sometimes when I'm home
with the wife, right...

312
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:08,049
...I'll take a double hit.

313
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,848
I get down to that big.
My feet dangle in the inkwell.

314
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:13,719
Then when she's out,
I walk all over her body.

315
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:17,260
When she wakes up, there's footprints
all over. She goes, "What is this?"

316
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,694
I go, "Hey, I don't know. "
See, when you're married a long time...

317
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,231
...you do stuff like this.

318
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,362
All right, let's see. What else?

319
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:27,005
Would you like a mint?
I made them myself. Here.

320
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:30,533
Taste them. Come on. Really good.

321
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:31,903
Go ahead. Taste it.

322
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,272
- Yeah, sure. Great.
- Help yourself.

323
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:37,407
These are good.

324
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,714
Yeah, these are good.

325
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,583
- Dog-bark mints. Comes in very handy.
- For what?

326
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,954
Cats, mailmen,
dogs that come up behind you.

327
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,892
- Or if a kid you lied to comes after you.
- How many times...

328
00:20:52,064 --> 00:20:54,624
- ... I gotta say I'm sorry about that?
- Six times.

329
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:00,364
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

330
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,006
I'm sorry. I'm-

331
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:05,405
I'm sorry, I was just kidding.
I can't believe you did this.

332
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:08,376
Did you play without a helmet
or something? What is with you?

333
00:21:08,547 --> 00:21:11,948
It's like your brain is in a penalty box,
I'm telling you. And you got...

334
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,881
...the eyes of a shark, but, like...

335
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,750
...deader. All right, listen.

336
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:20,187
Cat Away. Important.
If you're not a cat person...

337
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,919
...this thing will come in very handy.
Yeah.

338
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:26,123
I almost had a senior fairy moment.
Don't you move.

339
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:33,299
This is my greatest invention ever.

340
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:38,569
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

341
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,177
Yeah, right. Come on.

342
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,075
- That's how it works.
- How what works?

343
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:46,616
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

344
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:48,514
- That's how it works.
- How what works?

345
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:52,589
Amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid
forgets everything for the last few seconds.

346
00:21:52,758 --> 00:21:54,783
- That's how it works.
- How what works?

347
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,984
Never gets old.

348
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,729
You wanna fly, you gotta believe.
But you gotta learn to use your wings.

349
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:03,663
"Use my wings. " You know
how ridiculous you sound right now?

350
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:06,327
Who's your hobbit friend over here?

351
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:10,464
Wait. You stay here, okay?
You have to learn from the best.

352
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:14,704
And some dang fool
accused this guy of being the best.

353
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,611
Me and flying is just not gonna happen.
I've got an old hockey injury...

354
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:20,649
...so I probably got a bad wing.

355
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:23,719
- That's one I never heard before.
- How's it going?

356
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,551
What's up, man?
Want me to turn He-Man into Peter Pan?

357
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:30,092
- Don't get me started, homey.
- What is that? Your secret fairy jiving?

358
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:33,356
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said I've got a bad wing. I can't fly.

359
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,301
- Put me down!
- D.O.D.?

360
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,801
- Yeah.
- I'm cranking this baby up.

361
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:41,633
Put me down.

362
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,900
I think you're ready
to practice the F.O.A.!

363
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,602
F.O.A.?

364
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,008
What's F.O.A.?

365
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:51,845
Flying object avoidance.

366
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,918
I throw something at you,
you get out of the way, okay?

367
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,679
You better not throw anything at-

368
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:01,325
- You wanna get in on this, Tracy?
- Put me down!

369
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:05,153
Imagine these are your responsibilities
and you're avoiding them.

370
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,422
- Bring it on!
- Wimbledon!

371
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,333
It's Hammer brother-

372
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:18,408
Raise your right hand, repeat after me.
I, fill in your name.

373
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:25,440
- I, Derek Thompson.
- Swear to uphold and perform.

374
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,952
Swear to uphold and perform.

375
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,782
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations.

376
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:34,453
The duties, responsibilities
and obligations.

377
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,719
Of a tooth fairy.

378
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,964
Of a tooth fairy.

379
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:49,473
- Of a tooth fairy.
- And that I will not drink and fly.

380
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:52,702
Drink and fly?

381
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,369
Okay, no, that's serious. That's serious.

382
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,539
That I will not drink and fly.

383
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:02,119
Welcome aboard. These coupons
are redeemable at the gift shop.

384
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,812
Maybe I could have a fairy bumper sticker.

385
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,524
All right, I concede. It's real.

386
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:09,718
- Fairies do exist.
- It's too late.

387
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:12,489
- Your sentence begins tomorrow.
- No, no, no.

388
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:16,964
No. There's gotta be a way
to postpone this, like jury duty.

389
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:20,071
I'm sure up here you have fairy duty
or whatever it is you have.

390
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:24,232
I've got a coach breathing down my neck.
I gotta patch things up with my girlfriend.

391
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:30,444
The interrupting thing. I'm sorry.

392
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:32,982
Any assignment you miss,
you get another week.

393
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,279
And if you fail your terms of service...

394
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:39,823
...or tell anyone you're a tooth fairy,
your time will be extended indefinitely.

395
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:42,426
- Oh, really? I'm not leaving.
- Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.

396
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:43,925
No.

397
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:07,913
I'm sorry.

398
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:10,917
For what?

399
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:13,524
What I said last night.

400
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:16,422
Which part?

401
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,723
All the parts that deeply offended you.

402
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,230
Okay? Everything I've ever said...

403
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,196
...or thought. Even before I met you.

404
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:45,417
- Wanna come in?
- Oh, yeah.

405
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,617
You can spend
that one-on-one time with Randy.

406
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,728
Yeah.

407
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,563
Let me go to my car and get something,
and I'll be right back.

408
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:00,765
Me and Randy.

409
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,866
All right. Yeah.

410
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,659
- I didn't know you could shred.
- What do you want?

411
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,955
I brought you a present. Guess what it is.

412
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,223
Is it a puppy?

413
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,836
No, wise guy, it's not a puppy.
It's one of my hockey sticks.

414
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:35,139
And now, after signed, "Your pal...

415
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:36,865
...the Tooth Fairy"...

416
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:40,643
...now it's worth a lot of money.
There you go.

417
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,110
Okay. I'm just gonna leave it right here.

418
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:51,986
I bet you get a lot of chicks
with that guitar.

419
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:53,749
- Can we stop this now?
- Stop what?

420
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:56,258
You're just like
my mom's past boyfriends.

421
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:59,454
- Pretending to be nice to me to impress her.
- No, you're wrong.

422
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:03,123
I'm much better-looking
than your mom's past boyfriends.

423
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:06,833
Big-boy pound
for trying to break the ice.

424
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,968
- No? It's going away.
- I have to get back to practice.

425
00:27:11,143 --> 00:27:14,510
How about you come over to my place,
I could break out my old drum kit...

426
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,843
...you could bring your guitar,
and we could have a jam session.

427
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:21,008
How about I just go tell my mom
you're actually pretty cool...

428
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:24,280
- ... and you stop trying to bond with me?
- I'll take that deal.

429
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:28,351
So you'll never believe what Randy said
about you after you left.

430
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:32,095
He said that you were
actually pretty cool.

431
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,425
Well, I am pretty cool.

432
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:37,431
I'll say.

433
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:42,198
Well, whatever you're doing is working.
So why don't you keep it up?

434
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:56,209
- Who's "T"?
- I have no idea. I don't know.

435
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:59,152
What I do know is I would love for you
to close your eyes...

436
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,349
...because I have an amazing surprise.

437
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:03,619
- Really? Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,194
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

439
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,525
All right. Be right back.

440
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:12,497
Is my surprise 6-foot-3
with dark-brown eyes?

441
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,572
- Oh, you'll find out shortly.
- I love surprises.

442
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:19,740
Get ready.

443
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,050
Oh, I know you're right in front of me.

444
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,687
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay.

445
00:28:32,591 --> 00:28:34,252
Don't look. Everything's okay.

446
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,417
- Don't peek.
- Okay.

447
00:28:41,033 --> 00:28:42,728
- I need some air.
- What?

448
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:44,732
- I'm not feeling well.
- Should I come-?

449
00:28:44,903 --> 00:28:46,165
No! No.

450
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:49,263
- Can you give me some Pepto?
- Of course, where is it?

451
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:51,875
It's upstairs in the bathroom. It's way...

452
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:54,672
- ... upstairs.
- Oh, my gosh.

453
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,282
- Hello?
- Hello.

454
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,441
- Who is this?
- It's me. It's Tracy.

455
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,883
- Tracy who?
- Tracy, your caseworker.

456
00:29:03,055 --> 00:29:05,182
Your first assignment
has just fallen asleep...

457
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:08,690
...so get yourself over quick
to 663 Shelter Cove.

458
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,021
- I thought that was a dream.
- Think again.

459
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:13,187
- Derek?
- Oh, no! No.

460
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:15,629
- Where are you?
- Bushes. Don't come any closer.

461
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:18,929
You can't see me like this.
It'll ruin your romantic image of me.

462
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:21,698
Oh, honey. You are so sick.

463
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,638
- Yeah.
- I checked the entire bathroom.

464
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,005
I couldn't find anything.

465
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,306
Look underneath the sink.
Underneath the sink.

466
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:32,075
Way back deep underneath the sink.

467
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,411
- Okay.
- Hello?

468
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:36,850
You heard the rules.
You can't miss an assignment.

469
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:39,490
Plus those wings will stay
until you get that tooth.

470
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,148
Oh, man.

471
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:43,954
You could clean up a little.

472
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,370
My wing.

473
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,683
- Delicate. Well done.
- I can't believe this is happening.

474
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:10,515
It is happening, so get in the house
and fetch the tooth.

475
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,179
No, no. I'm not going anywhere.

476
00:30:12,357 --> 00:30:14,154
- Why don't you go in?
- It's not my job.

477
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:17,523
That doesn't make sense. You're a fairy.
You go in and get the tooth.

478
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:19,994
I'm not a winged fairy.
I'm a caseworker fairy...

479
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:21,928
...which involves more responsibility.

480
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,433
There's a lot of filing and putting stuff
in envelopes. It's tricky.

481
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:27,629
So you're saying
you're not good enough.

482
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:29,933
- I'm not.
- And they stuck you behind a desk.

483
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,598
No, I'll tell you what they did.

484
00:30:31,776 --> 00:30:34,836
There's a lot of wing discrimination
in the workplace. Very funny.

485
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,481
- How you gonna get the tooth?
- Maybe I'll wing it.

486
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:40,516
- Brilliant. How are you gonna get in?
- On a wing and a prayer.

487
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,483
- This is very funny stuff.
- Which wing of the house...

488
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:45,646
- ... should I start with?
- Want another week?

489
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,224
No. No, no.
I don't want another minute of this.

490
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:51,385
So, what do you suggest, Einstein?
I can't fly, so do what?

491
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:54,464
How about you shrink yourself down
and slide under the door?

492
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:57,534
Just shrink and slide in.
Yeah, that's what anybody would do.

493
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:58,999
It is, actually, okay?

494
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,709
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Let's hope so.

495
00:31:06,811 --> 00:31:10,042
- Come on.
- And how do I get big again?

496
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:13,184
It's automatic. From the moment you shrink,
you start to regrow.

497
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:16,286
It normally takes about an hour.
Come on.

498
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,689
I can't believe this.

499
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,752
- Eat it.
- Shut up.

500
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,555
Down the hatch.

501
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:31,198
Yum, yum, in Derek's tum.

502
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:38,965
Nice?

503
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,840
Oh, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

504
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:48,385
Not so brave now, little wee man.

505
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,446
No, no, no!

506
00:31:51,623 --> 00:31:54,421
Wing jokes aren't so funny now.
The shoe's on the other foot.

507
00:31:54,593 --> 00:31:57,994
- Okay. Okay.
- You should shoe me some respect.

508
00:31:58,163 --> 00:31:59,562
I'll shoe you some respect.

509
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,495
When I get bigger, I'm gonna slap
the glasses off your face!

510
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:06,103
- You "shoe-dn't" upset me.
- Is that the best you got?

511
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:08,300
Just take the money.

512
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,941
Hey, watch it! Don't throw money!

513
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,286
My wing. My wing.

514
00:32:25,323 --> 00:32:27,382
Money's heavy. Money's heavy.

515
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:24,948
I hate this. I can't believe-
Oh, my wing. My wing.

516
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:52,370
Okay.

517
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:19,491
No, no.

518
00:35:20,198 --> 00:35:22,223
I'm the tooth fairy.

519
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,892
The tooth fairy. No, no, no.

520
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:29,664
It's okay, buddy, we're coming.
Don't worry, sweetheart.

521
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:32,469
What's going on? What is it?
Darling, we're coming.

522
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,044
What's going on? Are you okay?

523
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:38,774
- Honey, what's the matter?
- I saw something.

524
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,010
- What did you see?
- It was a little tiny man.

525
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:45,422
Hope you're not hungry.

526
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:49,419
Nice kitty. Don't hurt me, kitty.

527
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:18,655
I'm the tooth fairy!

528
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,382
Disappear! Kitty, be gone!

529
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:02,763
Derek?

530
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:05,835
- Carly?
- Come cuddle with me.

531
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,029
- No.
- What?

532
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:12,108
- Going to bed. Still not well.
- Hey.

533
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:15,337
I'll call you when I'm bigger.
I mean better.

534
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,548
Hello, fans. I'm Steve Levy
coming to you from the wolf den...

535
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:23,050
...here in Lansing, Michigan,
home of the Lansing Ice Wolves.

536
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:26,853
We are about to see
the potentially historic debut...

537
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,890
...of an 18-year-old phenom.

538
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,894
Mick Donnelly is just about set
to take the ice for the first time.

539
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,691
You pumped up for your first game?

540
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,458
Yeah, pops, I'm super pumped.

541
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:39,262
It means one less game
until I'm out and into the bigs.

542
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:40,870
I'm done being generous.

543
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,973
This is my kingdom.
You're in my kingdom.

544
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:45,405
I'm the king. You know what you are?

545
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:50,947
You're like one of those little guys in tights
who run around the court in a poofy wig.

546
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:59,717
Mick the Stick! Mick the Stick!
Mick the Stick!

547
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:27,347
Looks like you've been dethroned.

548
00:38:33,224 --> 00:38:36,022
This is it. Final minute regulation time.

549
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:38,628
The Ice Wolves lead
the Roughnecks two to one...

550
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:41,264
...and the kid Donnelly
has lived up to the hype.

551
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:43,696
He's still working on that hat trick.

552
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:46,494
The puck comes back to the Roughnecks.

553
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:48,434
There's a quick shot. Nice save.

554
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:51,973
The puck goes into the corner,
and Donnelly's picked it up.

555
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:55,374
Now he puts on the brakes
and spins out of trouble.

556
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:57,036
Look at him fly, Jim.

557
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:01,677
He fakes another defender,
and here he comes.

558
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:05,789
Donnelly's rushing up the ice.
Look at those moves.

559
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:09,222
He's going through the Roughnecks
like they're a bunch of rented mules.

560
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:11,692
Donnelly circles around
the Roughneck goal.

561
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:15,026
He looks out front to pass.
Now he kicks it off the board.

562
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:23,035
Now Donnelly clears himself off the boards
and takes a pass in the slot.

563
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,470
He looks to shoot!

564
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:34,709
No, not now.

565
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:43,983
What a bone-crushing open-ice hit
to Donnelly. And he's down.

566
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:46,187
Thompson was gonna
clear Lembeck out...

567
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:51,131
...and suddenly instead, he just dropped
to the ice. No one even touched him.

568
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:02,245
Hey, Thompson. You cost me a hat trick
and an interview on ESPN.

569
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,272
Hey! Get over here.
I wanna talk to you.

570
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:13,884
Hey! What are you doing? Get out here.

571
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:17,858
No, no, I'm very busy right now.
No autographs. I'm busy.

572
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,520
Fine. I'll wait.

573
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:23,030
What are you guys talking about?

574
00:40:23,768 --> 00:40:24,962
What the heck?

575
00:40:25,136 --> 00:40:27,627
- What's he wearing?
- Check out Thompson's feet, boys.

576
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:29,839
Derek.

577
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,137
- He looks like a little girl hockey player.
- Disappear.

578
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:39,579
No, no, no.
Either you come out or we're coming in.

579
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,116
Yeah.

580
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:44,382
- One.
- This is not good.

581
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:45,988
Two.

582
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,426
Three!

583
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:02,096
What happened? Why are you late?
Where have you been?

584
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:04,741
- Don't talk to me. Shut up.
- Why are you wet?

585
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:08,367
- And I hate this job.
- What's that smell? That's intense.

586
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:11,674
I can't breathe. That's too much.

587
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,174
It's making my eyes hurt.

588
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:16,252
- Hello.
- Hi.

589
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,148
- What the-?
- Mom, I'm home.

590
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,860
Where's the kid?

591
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,838
- Be nice. Be respectful.
- I just came out of a toilet.

592
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:38,840
Do you think I care? Mama fairy.
There is your tooth.

593
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:42,138
You do whatever it is you do
here in fairy world with your teeth.

594
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:44,645
Mr. Thompson,
according to your caseworker...

595
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:47,376
...you're not exactly embracing
the tooth-fairy spirit.

596
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:49,645
- Really? Is that what my caseworker said?
- No.

597
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:53,382
You called her. Let me tell you something.
My caseworker here has wing envy.

598
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,684
- Not true.
- It is true.

599
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:56,986
I am a giant fan of all the administrating.

600
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:58,753
- You hate this job.
- I live for it.

601
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,956
- No, you don't. You hate this.
- Will you two stop it?

602
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:05,364
Just look at what you have done
to this family.

603
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:09,868
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

604
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:13,468
- I don't know.
- Am I home yet?

605
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:22,843
- It's not funny.
- See the dog? His eyes were like that:

606
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,683
- You overdid it.
- Fairy Godmother, who is your supervisor?

607
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,520
Who's above you? Gandhi?
Who do I talk to?

608
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:32,720
- I wanna file a complaint now.
- You have another assignment.

609
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:35,695
- Are you kidding me?
- Sometimes there's a double-header.

610
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:38,358
Tell me where the tooth is
so I can get it and go home.

611
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:42,700
Oh, no, not until the child falls asleep.
Till then, I'm afraid you have to wait.

612
00:42:47,011 --> 00:42:50,674
- Come on. I saved you a seat.
- Okay.

613
00:42:54,185 --> 00:42:57,848
One kid falls asleep in the afternoon.
Another kid's up all night.

614
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:28,651
Oh, I love a cup of tea.

615
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:33,414
- Good tea?
- Refreshing.

616
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:55,602
Oh, bull-

617
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:02,648
Hi. You feeling any better?

618
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,782
Yeah, a little bit.
How about you guys come on up?

619
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:08,016
- Hi, Derek.
- Hi, gorgeous.

620
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,494
Actually, I have a really big favor to ask.

621
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:14,130
Tess and I
just got a last-minute invitation-

622
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:17,756
- To a beauty makeover party!
- Nice.

623
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,630
A beauty makeover party.

624
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:22,568
I was wondering,
because you're getting along so well now...

625
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,709
...if Randy can hang out
with you for a little while.

626
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,977
Please?

627
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,477
Yeah. Yes. Of course.

628
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:38,486
Super, thank you.
I'll make it up to you.

629
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:41,955
- Be good. Have fun.
- Bye.

630
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,025
That's awesome.

631
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:07,374
I can see hockey's been really good to you.

632
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:15,822
Do you wanna hang with me or
do you wanna go get a beauty makeover?

633
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,366
- Pretty cool stuff in here, huh?
- Yeah. Whatever.

634
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:25,661
Why don't you take one down,
see how it sounds?

635
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,599
I don't want to.

636
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:29,706
No, here. Give it a shot.

637
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:31,905
- Please. Don't.
- Give it a shot.

638
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:34,010
Let's see how it sounds. Go ahead.

639
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:44,317
That sounds great. I'm gonna go
check out the drums and the sticks.

640
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:49,391
In the meantime, you just keep practicing
because all that is just awesome.

641
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,945
- Hi, Randy.
- Hey, what's up?

642
00:46:10,114 --> 00:46:12,480
- You sound pretty good.
- Thanks.

643
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,411
- You gonna play in the talent show?
- Kelly!

644
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:17,313
There you are.

645
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,119
Why you talking to emo boy?

646
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,885
- Don't be a jerk, Ben.
- Your dad's waiting. We have to go.

647
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:26,229
- Bye, Randy.
- Bye.

648
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:30,824
Don't think about talking to her.
You got it, loser?

649
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:33,094
- Okay.
- You should put this away...

650
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,396
...because you stink.

651
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:40,206
- What are you doing with Randy's guitar?
- I don't know.

652
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:43,608
- So you should give it back to him.
- Okay.

653
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,011
Now you can get out of here. Beat it.

654
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:02,023
- You are in trouble now.
- We'll see.

655
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:05,566
Oh, I know we'll see.
Can you beat two pair?

656
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:07,260
Call me and find out.

657
00:47:07,438 --> 00:47:09,702
Big boy puts in
all his big-boy Doodles.

658
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:14,538
Look at that. Me too. I'm not scared
because it's aces over kings.

659
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:17,778
- Flush.
- No.

660
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:21,611
Yes. Look at all these Doodles,
and they're all mine.

661
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:22,979
- Nice.
- Yeah.

662
00:47:23,154 --> 00:47:25,622
- I'm gonna enjoy these.
- Don't rub it in.

663
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:30,452
Can I ask you something?

664
00:47:37,034 --> 00:47:39,594
It's about your body
and how it's changing, isn't it?

665
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,000
- What?
- Everything that's happening to you...

666
00:47:42,173 --> 00:47:43,902
...and your body now is natural.

667
00:47:44,074 --> 00:47:45,735
- Are you growing-?
- No. No.

668
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,707
- Do you have a funny feeling-?
- Stop.

669
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:50,278
- You'll start to grow-
- No. Stop talking.

670
00:47:50,981 --> 00:47:54,382
- Okay, okay. Well, you-
- That wasn't what I was gonna ask at all.

671
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:56,076
- Okay.
- It wasn't even close.

672
00:47:56,253 --> 00:48:00,155
Okay. All right. Big-boy pound
for not wanting to talk about puberty.

673
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:07,721
Right? Yes, thank goodness. Believe me,
I don't wanna talk about it either.

674
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,034
All right. What's up, seriously?

675
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:13,602
All right. Well...

676
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:17,400
...there's this talent show
coming up at my school and...

677
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:18,633
Okay.

678
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:22,472
My mom thinks I should play in it,
and I'm kind of...

679
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,271
I don't know.

680
00:48:27,284 --> 00:48:28,876
Well, maybe you should play in it.

681
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:30,281
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

682
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:35,414
Yeah, you will be great. I heard you play.
You're really good, man.

683
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:38,218
And the chicks, they love guitar players.

684
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,127
- We're back!
- Hey, baby. We're up here.

685
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,860
Don't tell your mom
I said that about girls.

686
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:49,369
- Hi, boys. How'd it go?
- Hi.

687
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,531
- Well, your son cheats.
- Does not.

688
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:55,770
- He absolutely does, and you look...
- Gorgeous!

689
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:58,244
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

690
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,541
You guys hungry?
How about we get supper?

691
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,482
Love to.

692
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:07,887
Where's your coat, hon?

693
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:12,690
Oh, no.

694
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:15,297
- You guys gotta go.
- Is someone hurt?

695
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,730
No, not hurt in a way
that you have to be worried.

696
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:20,426
Both of you look beautiful.
I'll call later. I'm sorry.

697
00:49:20,604 --> 00:49:22,333
- Okay-
- Bye.

698
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,272
Shrinking paste? Nope, not that again.
Amnesia dust? No.

699
00:49:27,444 --> 00:49:29,708
Flying? Bad wing, forget it.

700
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,010
Oh, hey, and by the way, your
all-purpose magic generator button.

701
00:49:34,184 --> 00:49:36,311
It doesn't work. It's broken.

702
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:38,455
Here's an idea, brain-box.
Why don't you-?

703
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:41,056
- Don't touch my pouch.
- All right. That was too much.

704
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:43,921
- What do you want?
- Get out the magical invisibility spray.

705
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:45,755
Okay? That's relatively idiot-proof.

706
00:49:45,929 --> 00:49:47,920
Yeah, I know that.

707
00:49:53,304 --> 00:49:55,329
Ignore my last comment.

708
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,047
Hey, what a surprise. It doesn't work.
Your stuff stinks.

709
00:50:09,086 --> 00:50:11,145
Nice.

710
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,880
Shame it wears off.

711
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,159
Earthquake.

712
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:27,069
- Did you hear that?
- Yes!

713
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:29,799
Ghosts!

714
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:37,075
Are you lost? Can we help you?

715
00:50:38,415 --> 00:50:40,883
How would you like a little amnesia dust?

716
00:50:47,157 --> 00:50:49,819
- Where am I?
- Just go to the white light, my friend.

717
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:51,858
Just go to the white light.

718
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:55,093
Nice doggy.

719
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,530
Don't hurt me, doggy.

720
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:01,695
What is this?

721
00:51:02,406 --> 00:51:06,240
- It's a long and delightful story.
- Where's the tooth?

722
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:09,202
Can I get a little help here?

723
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:12,443
That'll be all.

724
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:20,523
You might just be
the worst tooth fairy ever.

725
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:23,023
- By the way, I need some more stuff.
- Stuff?

726
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:26,128
Stuff. The magic powder, the gunk.
I need some. Notify Q.

727
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:29,527
- No. No more stuff.
- Well, that's brilliant.

728
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,827
I have a week and a half left.
How am I supposed to do that?

729
00:51:32,002 --> 00:51:35,438
Sorry, we're running very low on funding.
And would you like to know why?

730
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:38,040
No, not really.

731
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,575
Because children aren't believing
as they used to.

732
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:44,272
Oh, it's not just us.

733
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:49,784
It's unicorns, leprechauns, dragons,
all those departments. Completely gone.

734
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,114
If this trend continues...

735
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,917
...Tooth Fairyland will cease to exist.

736
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:59,085
No child will ever again
receive a visit from a tooth fairy.

737
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:02,289
- Ever.
- No more visit from the tooth fairy.

738
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:04,297
So what?

739
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:08,733
You really don't get it, do you?

740
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:11,101
You don't see that children's fantasies...

741
00:52:11,275 --> 00:52:14,574
...their abilities to imagine, are important?

742
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:17,307
Why, it nourishes their very souls.

743
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,075
It's the foundation
that allows them to dream.

744
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,810
Dreams are bad. They're bad.

745
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,977
They're useless.

746
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:29,057
- You're done.
- For the week.

747
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:30,659
No, for the night.

748
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,557
Unless you wish to stay for fairyoke.

749
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,857
Oh, my. No.

750
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:41,126
Fairyoke. Like karaoke isn't bad enough.

751
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:48,738
Me?

752
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,610
I got what you need.

753
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,848
- What's that?
- The goods...

754
00:52:56,019 --> 00:52:57,646
...the stuff, package...

755
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:58,981
...the bag, the bomb...

756
00:52:59,156 --> 00:53:02,717
...the juice, the bing, the bang,
the Frisco special...

757
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:04,724
...pink lady, little drummer boy-

758
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,658
- Who are you?
- Ziggy.

759
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,663
You can call me whatever you want.
Zigman, Zigmeister-

760
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:12,631
- Please stop talking.
- You know, they want you to fail.

761
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:15,136
- What?
- Think about it.

762
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:17,330
You fail, they tack on more time.

763
00:53:17,508 --> 00:53:21,308
It's like credit-card debt, man.
They just wanna keep you paying forever.

764
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:25,245
- Yeah?
- You really wanna play that game?

765
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:28,807
- So...?
- A thousand bucks.

766
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:32,478
- Thousand bucks? You're killing me, Ziggy.
- How bad do you want this to end?

767
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:37,889
Can I write you a check?

768
00:53:46,136 --> 00:53:48,104
Oh, my goodness.

769
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,265
You can see me?

770
00:53:53,377 --> 00:53:54,867
Oh, man. This better work.

771
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:57,172
Oh, no. What is that?

772
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:00,077
What are you doing?

773
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:13,628
What did Ziggy give me?

774
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:16,698
Big head! Really big head!

775
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:21,294
- Just stay calm.
-911? 911?

776
00:54:21,471 --> 00:54:24,031
- I just need the tooth.
- There's an alien on my porch.

777
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,377
You are amazing.

778
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:40,216
Lily is ticked off because she had to
send another fairy to clean up your mess.

779
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:43,416
I learned my lesson.
Never buy black-market stuff.

780
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:46,927
- I can't go another two weeks without it.
- Yes, you can, friend.

781
00:54:47,097 --> 00:54:49,725
You just have to surrender
to a higher power...

782
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,267
- ... and take it one day at a time.
- Hello?

783
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:55,905
Caseworkers decide
who can see us and who can't.

784
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:58,439
Which you'd know,
if you ever paid any attention...

785
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:02,306
...ever listened to anything I say,
but no. You're always:

786
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,674
- Shut up.
- Hey. My friend.

787
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:07,908
You really need to get yourself cleaned up.

788
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:10,144
If you want, I can give you a pamphlet.

789
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,914
And FYl,
your sentence has been extended.

790
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,081
Lily tacked on another week,
so well done.

791
00:55:15,258 --> 00:55:19,627
- Great. Just what I need.
- I think it is what you need, friend.

792
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:22,128
Listen, I can give you
fresh supplies right now.

793
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:24,893
On one condition:
From now on, you follow the rules.

794
00:55:25,068 --> 00:55:28,765
You embrace the fairy spirit. And
you start listening to old muggins here.

795
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:31,931
Fine. I'll be the best tooth fairy ever.

796
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:38,440
You keep running out on me
to see I-don't-even-know-who.

797
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:42,073
And then you never call,
and when I do finally hear from you...

798
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:47,315
...it's to bail you out of jail.
What's going on with you?

799
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:51,722
I wanna tell you, but I can't.

800
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:54,227
- Why not?
- I-

801
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:56,893
I just can't.

802
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:00,969
I know what this is.

803
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:03,538
This is you acting out.
You're afraid of commitment.

804
00:56:03,707 --> 00:56:05,732
You're nervous about us getting serious.

805
00:56:06,977 --> 00:56:09,172
Yes. That's it.

806
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:12,509
You know me so well. I'm nervous
about how serious we're getting.

807
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:14,310
What?

808
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,048
You're a woman. And frankly,
you wouldn't understand.

809
00:56:24,227 --> 00:56:25,751
What?

810
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,296
No.

811
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,726
No, I'm not nervous
about us getting serious.

812
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:35,599
I wouldn't even think about
getting serious with you.

813
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:37,137
What?

814
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:46,348
I freaked. And, Carly, I love you so much.

815
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:49,747
I'm scared of messing up
and I'm scared of losing you.

816
00:56:54,591 --> 00:56:56,115
I understand.

817
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,719
I'm so glad you could share that with me.

818
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:01,793
Where can I get some of that?

819
00:57:02,365 --> 00:57:05,425
What are you doing?
Are you oiling up your abs again?

820
00:57:05,602 --> 00:57:07,832
- I'm coming!
- Hurry up.

821
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:09,631
Hey, I've been stepped on...

822
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,398
...flushed, bitten and arrested.

823
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:15,170
Will you stop complaining?
You promised to embrace the fairy spirit.

824
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:18,610
Oh, I'm embracing the fairy spirit,
all right.

825
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:20,750
But I'm doing it...

826
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,322
...my way.

827
00:57:27,257 --> 00:57:28,986
I'm not sure that's in the rules.

828
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:31,322
Oh, yeah.

829
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,625
I'm just here for the tooth, sir.

830
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:09,860
Just the tooth.

831
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:13,492
I'll take my glove away.

832
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:17,998
That's it.

833
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,205
Now, just hand over the tooth.

834
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:23,510
Nice and easy.

835
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:26,940
Let it go.

836
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:29,178
Let it go.

837
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:31,052
I said, let it go.

838
00:58:32,622 --> 00:58:36,353
Very good. You have a good night, sir.

839
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:43,730
Hey.

840
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:48,026
Who are you?

841
00:58:49,739 --> 00:58:51,229
I'm the tooth fairy.

842
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:55,144
Oh, yeah.

843
00:59:01,785 --> 00:59:05,653
You got it? Let's go. All right, Mick,
how's life in Lansing so far for you?

844
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:08,086
It's been good.
I'm the new blood of the team.

845
00:59:08,258 --> 00:59:11,750
Some of these Wolves are getting
long in the tooth, if you know what I mean.

846
00:59:11,928 --> 00:59:14,829
When you say "long in the tooth,"
that would be a reference...

847
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:16,761
...to Derek Thompson, the Tooth Fairy.

848
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:19,367
It's not a rivalry, you know.
I respect my elders.

849
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:22,733
- Has Thompson taken you under his wing?
- No, his wings are tattered.

850
00:59:22,906 --> 00:59:25,932
My wings are new and ready to fly,
and I like to do my own thing.

851
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:27,633
A confident, young hockey player.

852
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:29,676
- Good luck this afternoon.
- Thank you.

853
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:33,211
The Ice Wolves dump the puck
and look to make a line change.

854
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:35,374
- Mick, get ready!
- Finally.

855
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,918
- Hey, good luck out there, buddy.
- Okay.

856
00:59:38,088 --> 00:59:40,147
No, I mean it.
I think you're gonna do great.

857
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:43,053
- You're the bestest hockey player ever.
- Whatever.

858
00:59:43,226 --> 00:59:45,421
- Mick, change, change!
- Hit him, hit him!

859
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:47,358
- Yeah.
- Come on, Floyd.

860
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:49,562
Donnelly jumps into the play...

861
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,400
...and takes a cross-ice pass.
The Ice Wolves...

862
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:56,767
...charge across the blue line. Big scrum
in front of the net as these two rivals...

863
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,568
...start to get a little feisty
with each other.

864
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:19,624
Oh, yeah.

865
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,957
All right. Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go.

866
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,067
The puck goes into the corner,
where Nubin chases it down.

867
01:00:27,237 --> 01:00:29,705
- What's the matter with him?
- What's up with Donnelly?

868
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:31,636
Get in there, Donnelly! Get in there!

869
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,440
The puck squirts loose.
Now Donnelly picks it up...

870
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:38,945
...skates to the point,
looking to set up a play.

871
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:41,447
- Bring it up. Bring it up.
- Hi.

872
01:00:42,485 --> 01:00:43,952
Donnelly takes a terrible fall.

873
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:46,154
- What happened there, Jim?
- Who hit him?

874
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:48,291
- Someone hit him?
- Anyone know who hit him?

875
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:50,722
What is going on?

876
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:58,299
- What is he doing?
- Stop it.

877
01:00:59,569 --> 01:01:01,400
Is he laughing?

878
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:09,509
Donnelly, you okay, kid?

879
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:12,609
What?

880
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:16,277
- Are you trying to test me, kid?
- Get off the ice!

881
01:01:16,586 --> 01:01:19,817
Listen, you wanna play games?
You can head over to the daycare center.

882
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:21,753
Get out of here. Right now. Move it.

883
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:29,422
So, what'd I miss?

884
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,770
Why you bark?

885
01:01:49,085 --> 01:01:51,553
I'm not gonna be ready.
I'll get up there and blow it.

886
01:01:51,721 --> 01:01:53,985
You'll be fine.
We just gotta keep practicing.

887
01:01:54,157 --> 01:01:56,819
Everyone's gonna laugh at me.
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

888
01:01:56,993 --> 01:01:58,688
Well, maybe they will...

889
01:01:58,862 --> 01:02:03,162
...or maybe you'll blow
the roof off the place, huh?

890
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:07,167
Man, you're good. But you're
not gonna find out if you quit.

891
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:10,336
You can't score
if you don't take the shot.

892
01:02:10,507 --> 01:02:13,408
Yeah? When was the last time
you took a shot?

893
01:02:19,282 --> 01:02:22,513
Listen, when I first started,
I was a scorer.

894
01:02:22,685 --> 01:02:25,381
First-round draft pick of the Devils,
playing in the bigs.

895
01:02:25,555 --> 01:02:28,956
- So, what happened?
- I busted my shoulder one night in Chicago.

896
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:32,060
They sent me down to the minors
to recover, and it took forever.

897
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:33,695
I got so angry and frustrated.

898
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:36,627
One night, I got into it
with some meathead from New Haven.

899
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,268
Knocked out a couple of his teeth,
crowd went crazy...

900
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:43,668
...and they started calling me
the Tooth Fairy, and it stuck.

901
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:47,907
And I haven't scored in years.

902
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:57,246
But I've got more penalty minutes
than anyone else in the league. Yeah.

903
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,548
But, like, isn't your shoulder
all healed now?

904
01:03:00,757 --> 01:03:02,725
It's just not the same.

905
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:05,588
But how do you know?
You don't even try.

906
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:09,597
You can't score
if you don't take the shot.

907
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:16,497
I'll tell you what.
I will if you will.

908
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:25,114
Okay. I'll take that deal.

909
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:29,874
Hey.

910
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:33,018
All right. Thank you.

911
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:35,350
And another tooth.

912
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:43,891
Hey. That must be good.

913
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:47,002
That moment
when you hand over the tooth.

914
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:50,867
Not that I'm interested.
Just wondering, you know, how it felt.

915
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,100
- Why don't you find out?
- We've been through this. I'm not winged.

916
01:03:54,277 --> 01:03:57,041
Okay. Explain to me one more time.
Why can't you have wings?

917
01:03:57,213 --> 01:04:00,808
- Do you know nothing about fairy evolution?
- Fairy evolution. Who wrote that...

918
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:02,815
...Charles Darwing?

919
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,677
Inspired. Brilliant.

920
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:08,221
According to fairy evolution, some fairies
can grow wings and some can't.

921
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:10,120
And I'm one of the unlucky ones.

922
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:13,456
Tracy, you don't have to have wings
to be a tooth fairy.

923
01:04:13,863 --> 01:04:17,856
- Hey, remember, you've got all of this.
- That is true.

924
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:23,131
Somewhere in there, you gotta show them
your strengths. Speed, agility, flexibility.

925
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:25,541
Right. And how am I gonna do that?

926
01:04:27,043 --> 01:04:29,910
Around the cones, around the cones.
Quick feet, quick feet.

927
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,078
No. Come back. Come back.

928
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:42,982
Where are you going?

929
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:44,922
- Look at the size.
- Get over the fence.

930
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:48,029
It's 3 feet high.
You're 8 feet tall. Go back.

931
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:54,430
- A dinosaur!
- No, it's not.

932
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:55,628
What the heck?

933
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:03,802
Come on. Over the fence.

934
01:05:05,548 --> 01:05:07,277
I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay.

935
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:09,384
- You okay?
- No. Good night.

936
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:16,086
- It's a child!
- Why'd you hit the kid?

937
01:05:16,259 --> 01:05:19,353
They've got matching robes.
It's my worst nightmare.

938
01:05:22,932 --> 01:05:25,298
- Don't drop me.
- Yeah.

939
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:26,930
I got it. I got it.

940
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:29,731
I'm there. I'm not there.

941
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:41,277
You look like a beautiful reindeer with
your legs. You're prancing, you're prancing.

942
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,585
Not on the kid, on yourself.

943
01:05:45,888 --> 01:05:47,150
Amnesia dust. Amnesia dust.

944
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:04,172
Yeah!

945
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,135
Dust, dust, dust. Up.

946
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:21,647
You sound great.
You're gonna kill them tomorrow night.

947
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:24,418
So, what do you think?

948
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:34,999
Nice. That is bigtime.
Randy Harris. Talent show.

949
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:38,368
- I like that slot too.
- You think I could be a famous rock star?

950
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:40,907
Like Clapton or Hendrix
or Stevie Ray Vaughan?

951
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:44,204
- You want it straight?
- Yeah.

952
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,142
Okay.

953
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:52,049
You're getting pretty good, right? So
let's say you keep working at it really hard.

954
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:55,151
Then let's say you become
the best 13-year-old guitarist...

955
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:57,623
...in your neighborhood.
Here's the deal.

956
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,985
Remember there are
a lot of neighborhoods...

957
01:07:00,163 --> 01:07:02,028
...with a lot of 13-year-old guitarists.

958
01:07:02,198 --> 01:07:04,758
But somewhere, there's a 12-year-old
who's shredding it.

959
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:07,266
I mean, he is killing that guitar.

960
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:13,700
Yeah?

961
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:18,872
You know what? Yeah. It's possible.

962
01:07:20,283 --> 01:07:21,978
Cool.

963
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:24,448
Go get them.

964
01:07:25,455 --> 01:07:28,219
Late in the third period,
Ice Wolves down four to three...

965
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:32,657
...to the Arrows. Donnelly is getting
a breather, but having another great game.

966
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:36,458
The Arrows leading scorer, Crosley,
takes the pass, and he is on the move.

967
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:37,690
Mickey, your line's up.

968
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:40,199
All right, old man.
Got a fresh pair of Depends on?

969
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,861
You never know, kid.
I just might surprise you.

970
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,376
Ice Wolves dump the puck into
the Arrows' zone, change lines on the fly...

971
01:07:47,543 --> 01:07:49,875
...as the coach throws Donnelly
back in the game.

972
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:55,773
Allegheny's got the puck in their own zone.
They're crossing the blue line.

973
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:57,681
Change! Change!

974
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:02,422
And here comes Thompson off the bench,
replacing Goff.

975
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,590
Thompson knocks Crosley
flat on his back...

976
01:08:11,768 --> 01:08:14,999
...and kicks the puck in the neutral zone,
where Browley picks it up.

977
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:19,369
Thompson jumps back into the play
as Donnelly weaves around Crosley.

978
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:24,137
Now Thompson takes a pass right on
his stick as Donnelly flashes into the play.

979
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:27,282
It's a two-on-one with Thompson
of all people leading the rush.

980
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:28,576
Pass it!

981
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,743
Donnelly's screaming for the puck,
but Thompson won't give it up.

982
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:34,412
- Pass.
- Pass it! Pass it!

983
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:35,648
Pass!

984
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:38,060
Thompson looks to pass.

985
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:40,161
No, he fakes the pass.

986
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:43,093
He's got the top shelf wide open.

987
01:08:43,266 --> 01:08:46,064
- Mickey's open! Pass it!
- Pass.

988
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:50,632
No!

989
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:56,442
- What a hit on Thompson.
- What is he thinking?

990
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:03,076
The Arrows have numbers,
coming up the ice.

991
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:06,688
- They shoot, they score!
- Damn it.

992
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:11,791
Jim, it looked like Thompson was
actually gonna shoot, and he just choked.

993
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:30,835
You're not a hockey player.
You're a sideshow attraction!

994
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:35,306
You know what? Why don't you watch
tomorrow's game from the bench?

995
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:36,948
You bum.

996
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:43,557
Come on, boys. Come on now. Here we go.
Here we go. Come on, let's start up.

997
01:09:48,464 --> 01:09:50,455
Oh, great.

998
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,607
Hey, honey. How was your game?

999
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:05,076
- Not good.
- Derek, guess what.

1000
01:10:05,248 --> 01:10:07,682
- I have another loose tooth.
- Good for you, honey.

1001
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,841
- What's the matter, hon?
- Everything.

1002
01:10:10,019 --> 01:10:13,511
- Nothing. You know, forget it.
- Can we go practice now?

1003
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:16,522
Can we skip today's session?
I just don't have it in me.

1004
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:18,785
- The talent show is tomorrow.
- You'll be fine.

1005
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:21,156
- I need one more run through-
- No, you don't.

1006
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:25,266
No, I do need it. I just need a little
more practice. Just so I can get it down.

1007
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:29,234
It doesn't matter what you do in the show.
You'll never be a famous rock star.

1008
01:10:29,405 --> 01:10:33,034
You'll just be another kid with a guitar.
Do yourself a favor and give it up.

1009
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:34,403
- Derek.
- Look, I'm sorry...

1010
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:36,772
...but it's for his own good. Trust me.

1011
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:40,872
No!

1012
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,789
Come on, Tess. Tess, let's go.

1013
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,190
- What is wrong with you?
- Look, I had a bad day.

1014
01:10:53,362 --> 01:10:55,193
- Had a bad day?
- I had a bad day, okay?

1015
01:10:55,364 --> 01:10:57,195
No. No, that is not okay.

1016
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:59,960
You are never gonna
speak to my children again.

1017
01:11:00,403 --> 01:11:02,200
We are done.

1018
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:04,532
Carly.

1019
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:09,406
You know what your problem is, Derek?
You can't say "what if. "

1020
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:14,443
And you never will.

1021
01:11:36,138 --> 01:11:38,971
Okay. Okay.

1022
01:11:40,242 --> 01:11:43,803
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1023
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:48,513
Who wants to hear some good news?

1024
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:51,619
I do. Come on.

1025
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:56,352
- Why are you here?
- Lily gave me this.

1026
01:11:59,295 --> 01:12:02,355
- Only a permit, but I'm on the way.
- You should be on your way out.

1027
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:04,431
- I'm going to bed.
- It's thanks to you.

1028
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,058
We've gotta celebrate. I know a place
where the hot fairy godmothers hang.

1029
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:11,570
Are you out of your mind?
I just lost everything that's important to me.

1030
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:15,370
My girlfriend, those kids,
and I probably hung up my skates for good.

1031
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,877
All because, like an idiot,
I bought into your tooth-fairy garbage.

1032
01:12:19,048 --> 01:12:20,379
Look where it's gotten me.

1033
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,479
You make one effort
and it doesn't work out...

1034
01:12:24,654 --> 01:12:26,554
...and suddenly
you're just gonna give up?

1035
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:29,850
It's not supposed to be that easy,
and you know it.

1036
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:38,127
I'll tell you what I do know.
I know that you don't have wings.

1037
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,064
So that means you can't fly.

1038
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:46,197
That also means that you can
never, ever, ever be a tooth fairy.

1039
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,209
What happens if you try to escape
out a 10-story building? I'll tell you what.

1040
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:53,780
Splat, just like that.

1041
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,850
You know what's really sad?

1042
01:13:04,026 --> 01:13:06,722
The person you hurt the most
with all your dream-killing...

1043
01:13:06,896 --> 01:13:09,990
...is not Randy or Carly or even me.

1044
01:13:10,266 --> 01:13:11,756
It's you.

1045
01:13:13,035 --> 01:13:15,367
- Get out.
- Fine.

1046
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:16,732
Good.

1047
01:13:19,675 --> 01:13:21,370
Fine.

1048
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:23,534
I'm going to bed.

1049
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:27,073
One twenty-four left in the third period...

1050
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:30,013
...with the Ice Wolves
still trailing one to nothing.

1051
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:33,781
And Derek Thompson is still
completely in the coach's doghouse.

1052
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:37,448
- I don't think he's seen a second of ice time.
- Here we go, here we go.

1053
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:40,686
As he has all game,
Andreas Petrenko, the Mute Brute...

1054
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,390
...continues to replace Thompson
on the first line.

1055
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:47,558
Face-off won by the Lumbermen.

1056
01:13:48,471 --> 01:13:49,802
What a hit!

1057
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:53,237
Donnelly steals the puck, and now
he's rushing up the ice short-handed.

1058
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:56,276
- Only Coletta can get back.
- Let's go, Mick. Let's go, Mick.

1059
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:01,611
This is classic.
Every move Donnelly makes...

1060
01:14:01,784 --> 01:14:03,547
...Coletta's got an answer.

1061
01:14:04,153 --> 01:14:05,814
Donnelly shoots to his left.

1062
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:08,957
He's got Coletta out of position
and Donnelly moves around him.

1063
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:11,218
He's got the defenseman beat. He shoots!

1064
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:13,817
Hits the crossbar.

1065
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:18,126
What happened?
They blew the whistle.

1066
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,235
Back behind the play, Jim,
Petrenko got sucker-punched...

1067
01:14:21,403 --> 01:14:23,132
...and I don't think he's getting up.

1068
01:14:31,947 --> 01:14:33,642
Thompson.

1069
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:35,476
Go.

1070
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:38,047
Go.

1071
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:49,688
All right, here we go.

1072
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:52,129
The Ice Wolves have
less than a minute to score...

1073
01:14:52,301 --> 01:14:54,531
...and send this game into overtime.

1074
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,933
Off the face-off,
it's Plattsburgh with the puck.

1075
01:14:58,107 --> 01:15:00,667
And they start their drive
as the clock winds down.

1076
01:15:00,843 --> 01:15:05,280
I don't know. It looks to me like Thompson
is just going through the motions out there.

1077
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:08,974
Oh, my!
Thompson just got leveled.

1078
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:13,053
How could that not be a penalty?
He just got crushed.

1079
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:20,188
I think the Tooth Fairy
just got a taste of his own medicine.

1080
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,364
Look at Thompson, Jim.

1081
01:16:33,235 --> 01:16:35,703
He looks like he's got some jump
back in those legs.

1082
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:39,568
Thompson's rushing across the ice,
and I don't think it's to make friends.

1083
01:16:39,742 --> 01:16:40,902
Well, this is gonna hurt.

1084
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:45,773
No! He pulled up, Jim.
He didn't throw a check.

1085
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:47,142
Incredible!

1086
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:50,683
He steals the puck and
now is barreling down the ice.

1087
01:16:50,853 --> 01:16:53,549
- Look at him go.
- Ellis can't keep up with Thompson.

1088
01:16:53,722 --> 01:16:56,282
He's making moves
we haven't seen in a long time.

1089
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,482
Who is that guy?

1090
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:01,354
Thompson only has one defender to beat.

1091
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:04,431
He takes the stick to the face.

1092
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,763
- I think he's going down.
- No, he stays on his feet.

1093
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,905
He's gonna shoot!

1094
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,206
He shoots!

1095
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:20,173
He scores!

1096
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:26,644
Yeah!

1097
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:30,953
Yeah. All right, nice shot.

1098
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:41,634
Derek Thompson has not taken a shot
in nine years.

1099
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:46,332
In one of the most amazing shots
I've ever seen, it ties it up at one all.

1100
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:50,167
Call me the Mayor of Shockville.
Let's do it again.

1101
01:17:53,749 --> 01:17:55,376
Hey, old man.

1102
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:57,484
Not bad.

1103
01:18:02,558 --> 01:18:04,321
- Yeah, Derek.
- Nice shot, dude.

1104
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:06,790
Way to go.

1105
01:18:10,499 --> 01:18:12,831
And here we go.

1106
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:17,769
We're under 20 seconds as both teams
head to the center line for a face-off.

1107
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,277
Oh, no.

1108
01:18:30,886 --> 01:18:32,319
The Ice Wolves win the drop.

1109
01:18:32,488 --> 01:18:35,651
There's a cross-ice pass
to Thompson, who ices it.

1110
01:18:35,824 --> 01:18:38,725
- Why would he do that?
- I have no idea, Jim.

1111
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:42,694
No, I can't leave now. This is my
last chance to actually play the game...

1112
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:44,332
...to go out the way I came in.

1113
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,401
I could cover for you.
After what I've seen, you deserve it.

1114
01:18:47,569 --> 01:18:49,833
Thompson, what are you doing?
Who's he talking to?

1115
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:52,405
Aren't you a trainee?
Isn't that breaking the rules?

1116
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,371
Please, I've learned from the best.

1117
01:18:54,743 --> 01:18:57,871
But I do think you should look
at the address before you decide.

1118
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:06,811
It's Carly's house.

1119
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:09,389
Hey, 14. Come on. Let's go.

1120
01:19:09,558 --> 01:19:11,423
Thompson, get back in the game.

1121
01:19:11,827 --> 01:19:15,524
- I can go. Lily does not have to know.
- But I'll know.

1122
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:19,226
This is my house to take care of.

1123
01:19:42,024 --> 01:19:45,425
- Let's do this.
- How? You can't fly.

1124
01:19:45,627 --> 01:19:47,458
Good time to learn.

1125
01:19:47,629 --> 01:19:49,563
I knew you had it in you.

1126
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,471
Go get them.

1127
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,183
You wanna fly, you gotta believe.

1128
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,808
No need to panic.
It's just a giant amnesia gun.

1129
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:17,679
It's painless.
You won't remember a thing.

1130
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:25,658
Don't you forget about me

1131
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:27,419
You will.

1132
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:31,058
Good luck finding your cars.

1133
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:57,358
Tess?

1134
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,021
Derek.

1135
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:02,857
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.

1136
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,267
I like your costume.

1137
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:11,235
I have to tell you something.

1138
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:13,272
I was wrong.

1139
01:22:13,442 --> 01:22:17,173
The tooth fairy is real...

1140
01:22:17,346 --> 01:22:19,371
...and it's me.

1141
01:22:19,548 --> 01:22:21,345
I know.

1142
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:25,452
No, honey, I'm not talking about
the hockey Tooth Fairy.

1143
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:29,782
I'm the real tooth fairy.

1144
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:31,721
No, you're not.

1145
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:47,007
You are the real tooth fairy.

1146
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:50,804
- It'll just be our secret, okay?
- Okay.

1147
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:36,013
Randy?

1148
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:40,888
What are you doing here?

1149
01:23:42,097 --> 01:23:43,462
I have to talk to you.

1150
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,792
Go away.

1151
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:50,734
Listen, those things I said yesterday?

1152
01:23:51,373 --> 01:23:52,897
I was wrong.

1153
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:56,368
I don't care.

1154
01:23:56,712 --> 01:23:59,237
You gotta keep playing guitar.

1155
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:01,279
You're really good.

1156
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:06,082
And nothing you love doing that much
could ever be a waste of time.

1157
01:24:07,823 --> 01:24:10,087
I'm so sorry.

1158
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:27,374
Even if I wanted to, I can't.

1159
01:24:27,876 --> 01:24:30,071
I smashed my guitar, remember?

1160
01:24:30,979 --> 01:24:33,243
Tonight is the talent show.

1161
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:38,648
Hold on one second.

1162
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,561
Maybe this'll help.

1163
01:24:59,307 --> 01:25:00,740
It's awesome.

1164
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:03,309
How-? How did you do that?

1165
01:25:03,478 --> 01:25:05,503
All-purpose magic generator.

1166
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:11,012
- What are you wearing?
- You'll find out.

1167
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:14,849
In the meantime, put some clothes on.
We can still make the talent show, okay?

1168
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:17,051
Come on.

1169
01:25:21,296 --> 01:25:22,763
Derek?

1170
01:25:23,899 --> 01:25:27,096
Mommy, Derek is the tooth fairy.

1171
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:40,438
You rented a fairy costume
to make it up to Tess.

1172
01:25:41,116 --> 01:25:46,110
Yes. That's what I did.

1173
01:25:46,988 --> 01:25:50,617
Hey, Mom. Derek got me a new guitar,
and he's taking me to the talent show.

1174
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,817
What time is it? You'll never make it.

1175
01:25:52,994 --> 01:25:55,462
- It's gotta-
- Don't worry about that. We can make it.

1176
01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:59,191
You, that way. You guys, go up and get
dressed, and we'll see you over there.

1177
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:03,261
Oh, yeah.

1178
01:26:03,438 --> 01:26:05,599
- Where's your car?
- No car. Let's go.

1179
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:09,175
Hang on!

1180
01:26:13,014 --> 01:26:15,175
- How is this happening?
- It's okay. It's okay.

1181
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:16,977
Yeah, but like how is it possible?

1182
01:26:17,152 --> 01:26:20,144
It all started one night.
I got a summons underneath my pillow.

1183
01:26:20,322 --> 01:26:23,018
- What is a summons?
- A summons is like an invitation.

1184
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:25,352
- I got an invitation to Fairyland.
- Fairyland?

1185
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:28,621
It's where I got these wings.
I met this guy up there named Tracy.

1186
01:26:28,797 --> 01:26:31,664
He looks like a walking toothpick
with the eyes of a big tuna.

1187
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,768
By the way,
I can shrink myself down to 6 inches.

1188
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:38,669
Pretty good.

1189
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:46,076
What?

1190
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:51,680
I'm sorry, buddy,
but I've already broken enough rules.

1191
01:27:01,897 --> 01:27:04,730
Randy, there you are.
We've been looking all over for you.

1192
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,300
Get in there and tune up. Come on.

1193
01:27:08,603 --> 01:27:10,195
- Another tooth.
- Thank you.

1194
01:27:10,372 --> 01:27:12,465
You're welcome.
I've got a concert to get to.

1195
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:16,008
No, you skirted quite a few rules
tonight, Mr. Thompson.

1196
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:18,202
But I took care of Carly,
I dusted Randy...

1197
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:21,781
...and Tess, she's only 6,
so pretty soon she'll forget.

1198
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:25,010
And even if she doesn't,
at least now she'll...

1199
01:27:25,186 --> 01:27:27,051
She'll always...

1200
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:30,754
Always what?

1201
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:38,460
She will always believe...

1202
01:27:39,301 --> 01:27:41,098
...like I will.

1203
01:27:41,803 --> 01:27:46,934
I get it. Dreams are good. For everyone.

1204
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,873
Mr. Thompson...

1205
01:27:55,317 --> 01:28:00,050
...I hereby relieve you of tooth-fairy duty.

1206
01:28:05,393 --> 01:28:07,293
- You're good.
- She's a pro.

1207
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:10,090
Congratulations.

1208
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:11,994
Put that away.

1209
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:23,009
I- I tend not to do
the whole physical contact thing.

1210
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:25,169
Oh, you like me. I know you like me.

1211
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:27,975
You do the whole
distant administrator demeanor thing...

1212
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:31,084
...which I understand,
but somewhere in there, you like me.

1213
01:28:35,423 --> 01:28:36,947
Well...

1214
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:38,752
...let's not get frisky.

1215
01:28:39,995 --> 01:28:43,328
- I really gotta go.
- Yeah. Could you wait just one second?

1216
01:28:43,498 --> 01:28:45,432
Tracy, I need another word with you.

1217
01:28:47,636 --> 01:28:48,762
What's this about?

1218
01:28:48,937 --> 01:28:51,929
Anybody that can rehabilitate
Mr. Thompson...

1219
01:28:52,107 --> 01:28:54,371
...more than deserves...

1220
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:55,668
...these.

1221
01:29:05,153 --> 01:29:06,450
Are these...?

1222
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:08,782
It's your wings, Tracy.

1223
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:10,117
Wear them with pride...

1224
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,987
...every time you collect a new tooth.

1225
01:29:13,995 --> 01:29:16,088
- You're a tooth fairy, buddy.
- I got my wings.

1226
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:17,731
You got your wings.

1227
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,067
Here. You need this.

1228
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:23,136
Little bag. I don't know why
I'm speaking like this.

1229
01:29:27,475 --> 01:29:28,942
No?

1230
01:29:30,445 --> 01:29:32,345
Thank you, milady.

1231
01:29:33,081 --> 01:29:36,812
This is great and I'm proud of you.
You're the tallest tooth fairy in the world.

1232
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:39,510
But I gotta go.
Somebody's gotta poof me down.

1233
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:43,988
Tracy, would you like to do the honors
or shall I?

1234
01:29:44,592 --> 01:29:48,722
- Oh, so honors? Oh, a gift. Yeah.
- I'm afraid not.

1235
01:29:50,732 --> 01:29:53,599
You're not gonna remember anything
that happened in Fairyland.

1236
01:29:53,768 --> 01:29:57,704
- Why?
- Because that's just the way we do it.

1237
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:03,177
I'll never forget you.

1238
01:30:07,048 --> 01:30:09,016
I can't believe you showed up at the rink.

1239
01:30:11,052 --> 01:30:12,679
It's just the way we do things.

1240
01:30:16,024 --> 01:30:19,255
Thank you, Tracy, for everything.

1241
01:30:22,464 --> 01:30:24,955
You big four-eyed giraffe.

1242
01:30:25,133 --> 01:30:27,397
Go back to the zoo.

1243
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:30,527
And you get that head back
to Easter Island.

1244
01:30:33,308 --> 01:30:35,606
Hammer brothers are still in town.

1245
01:30:35,777 --> 01:30:37,369
Let me meet those guys.

1246
01:30:40,915 --> 01:30:43,281
- You're my man.
- And you are my fairy.

1247
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:46,887
- Could we e-mail or something?
- We should be able to e-mail each other.

1248
01:30:47,055 --> 01:30:50,422
- Do you blog? I'd love to read your blog.
- I do blog. Wanna read my blog?

1249
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:53,789
- Do you Facebook? I could poke you.
- I'd love to be poked!

1250
01:30:53,962 --> 01:30:55,054
Yes.

1251
01:31:10,612 --> 01:31:12,671
- Oh, there you are. I couldn't find you.
- Hi.

1252
01:31:12,847 --> 01:31:15,975
Yeah, I was just at- I was...

1253
01:31:17,986 --> 01:31:21,649
- I am so excited.
- Me too.

1254
01:31:22,657 --> 01:31:25,524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1255
01:31:26,161 --> 01:31:27,992
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.

1256
01:31:35,036 --> 01:31:36,060
Good job, Timmy!

1257
01:31:36,237 --> 01:31:38,637
Keep it going
for our last performer of the night...

1258
01:31:38,807 --> 01:31:41,241
...Randy Harris!

1259
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:49,448
Randy!

1260
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:19,244
- Go, Randy!
- Yeah!

1261
01:33:39,427 --> 01:33:42,362
- Way to go, Randy!
- Great job!

1262
01:33:51,773 --> 01:33:55,231
Randy! That's my kid!

1263
01:33:57,779 --> 01:34:01,078
Hey, I was just wondering.
What if we got married?

1264
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:09,016
What if we got married?

1265
01:34:11,459 --> 01:34:13,154
Did you hear what I said?

1266
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:16,792
I said "what if. "

1267
01:34:19,801 --> 01:34:21,496
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1268
01:34:30,578 --> 01:34:31,806
We're getting married.

1269
01:34:33,681 --> 01:34:34,773
Yeah!

1270
01:34:41,956 --> 01:34:44,151
We're getting married.

1271
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,502
Good evening, everybody.

1272
01:35:03,678 --> 01:35:08,274
Welcome to Staples Center,
the home of your Los Angeles Kings.

1273
01:35:08,449 --> 01:35:11,441
Now let's introduce tonight's
starting lineup for the Kings.

1274
01:35:11,619 --> 01:35:17,216
- At right wing, number 13, John Zeiler.
- Hey, excuse me. Hey, dude! Dude!

1275
01:35:17,392 --> 01:35:21,226
Hey, big daddy. Just wanna
shake your hand. I don't want anything.

1276
01:35:21,396 --> 01:35:24,229
Excited to see you back in the NHL
right where you belong.

1277
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:26,765
- Look at you now, huh?
- Do I know you?

1278
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:29,926
No, I'm just excited to see you
because I believe in you, man.

1279
01:35:30,104 --> 01:35:33,733
I believe in you, big daddy.
I believe in you, Derek Thompson.

1280
01:35:33,908 --> 01:35:37,071
In goal, number 32, Jonathan Quick.

1281
01:35:38,346 --> 01:35:41,008
And starting at left wing...

1282
01:35:41,182 --> 01:35:45,175
...number 40, Derek Thompson.

1283
01:35:45,686 --> 01:35:47,950
- Yes!
- I got you a few of your favorite things.

1284
01:35:48,122 --> 01:35:50,090
Oh, thank you, Jerry.

1285
01:35:50,258 --> 01:35:52,783
It's not every day
the boss asks me to go off-campus.

1286
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,087
It's about time I got you
out of that basement.

1287
01:35:55,263 --> 01:35:56,662
- That's cool.
- Did you see him?

1288
01:35:56,831 --> 01:36:00,267
- Yeah, we're fine.
- Oh, I miss him.

1289
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:03,529
Yes! Knock him on his bum.

1290
01:36:04,972 --> 01:36:06,269
It's like a whole new you.

1291
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:09,205
I don't know why you like this.
You can't even see the ball.

1292
01:36:09,377 --> 01:36:12,107
- It's called a puck.
- Yeah, but you can't even see it.

1293
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:14,612
I mean, something that small
moving that fast...

1294
01:36:14,782 --> 01:36:17,080
...it'd be so much better
to get closer to it.

1295
01:36:17,251 --> 01:36:18,946
You know what I mean?

1296
01:36:20,254 --> 01:36:21,380
- Jerry.
- I'm gonna do it.

1297
01:36:21,556 --> 01:36:22,887
- You're not.
- I'm gonna do it.

1298
01:36:23,057 --> 01:36:24,684
- No. No, Jerry.
- I gotta do it.

1299
01:36:24,859 --> 01:36:28,090
I gotta do this.
Okay, I'm not gonna do it.

1300
01:36:28,963 --> 01:36:30,555
I'm just kidding, I gotta do it.

1301
01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:35,101
This is gonna be cool.

1302
01:36:35,937 --> 01:36:37,598
I love my job!

1303
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:53,053
That was a rush.

1304
01:37:29,223 --> 01:37:31,316
Thank you.

1305
01:37:54,815 --> 01:37:57,511
I don't know why I'm speaking like this.

1306
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:26,906
Kitty, be gone!

1307
01:38:31,452 --> 01:38:33,511
I hate this job.

1308
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:21,724
Good luck finding your cars.

1309
01:39:56,003 --> 01:39:58,403
My wing. My wing.

1310
01:40:05,112 --> 01:40:07,273
Fairy coming through.

1311
01:41:22,223 --> 01:41:24,690
I got the tooth! I got the tooth, baby!
Yeah!

1312
01:41:24,725 --> 01:41:26,716
I got the tooth! I got the tooth, baby!
Yeah!

1313
01:41:27,716 --> 01:41:37,716
