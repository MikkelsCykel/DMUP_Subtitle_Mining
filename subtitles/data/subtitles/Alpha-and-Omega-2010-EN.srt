1
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,741
It's time to ride the slide
and taste the wind.

2
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:05,707
Humphrey, you are totally genius.

3
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,874
Come on. Let's do it.

4
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,970
Air wolf!

5
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,317
Guys. Guys.

6
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,554
We're not moving!

7
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,757
This caribou is mine.

8
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,523
Kate, I'm not a caribou. I'm your sister!

9
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:32,995
Gotcha.

10
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,198
Omegas don't play like this.

11
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:38,136
You can't escape the greatest Alpha ever.

12
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:39,999
Well, I just did.

13
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,144
We're going to die!

14
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,242
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

15
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,518
What was I thinking?

16
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,229
That was great!

17
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,993
We are flying today, guys.

18
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,163
Humphrey?

19
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,331
Kate?

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,286
What are you doing up here?

21
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,191
I'm practice-hunting for our lunch.

22
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,657
Good, 'cause I'm about to lose mine.

23
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,192
You are?

24
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:36,961
I'll try to swallow it.

25
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,866
Kate!

26
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,428
It's time to go.

27
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,406
I'm coming, Dad.

28
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,005
Where you going?

29
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,878
Spring?

30
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,972
But that's a whole winter away.

31
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:56,685
I know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.

32
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:00,189
But by next spring,
she will be a trained Alpha,

33
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,688
the future leader of the pack.

34
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,993
No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.

35
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,501
Learn to keep the peace.

36
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,094
And Humphrey,

37
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:17,403
remind us all to have fun.

38
00:03:17,596 --> 00:03:18,597
But... But...

39
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:20,701
Alphas and Omegas can't...

40
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,637
How do you say it?

41
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:34,021
That's our custom. The law of the pack.

42
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,088
Wolf pile!

43
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,165
Silly Omegas.

44
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:44,589
Hey.

45
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,297
Take a left! Thirty degrees!

46
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:51,959
Salty, give her some sail draft!

47
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,932
I think I taste the wind.

48
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,871
No, just a bug.

49
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,608
Hey, Mooch, get ready! Lower the boom!

50
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,616
-All right!
-Hang 10, boys!

51
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,053
Guys, we really need to work on the brakes!

52
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,714
-Brakes?
-Brakes?

53
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:19,187
Wolf pile!

54
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,961
Get your butt out of my face.

55
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,627
What did we hit?

56
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,467
Spring.

57
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,507
Look who's back from Alpha school.

58
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,611
Forget about it, Humphrey.
Kate's an Alpha now.

59
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,450
And you're an Omega.

60
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,491
We're friends, okay?

61
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:52,188
Exactly. Just friends. End of story.

62
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,164
You better set your sights over there.

63
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:00,364
Reba and Janice, the vegetarians.

64
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,698
Okay.

65
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,313
Looks like we're
eating caribou tonight, boys.

66
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,644
Hey. Hey.

67
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,649
Eastern Pack wolves.

68
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,786
Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.

69
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,363
Great. There goes dinner.

70
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,102
And there goes Kate.

71
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,154
-Holy...
-Caribou!

72
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,229
Scatter to the sides!

73
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,001
Settle the score, leader.

74
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,289
Are you all right?

75
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:40,633
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Hey, what's your problem,

76
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,833
you stupid Eastern dog?
That was our hunt.

77
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,569
You can't just snake it out from under us.

78
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,110
Can-do, back off.

79
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,507
You better listen to the girl.

80
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,615
Hey, break it up.
Can-do, Hutch, break it up!

81
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,751
All right, Omegas, duty calls.

82
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,051
Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!

83
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,114
-Hey!
-Candy!

84
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,528
-Kate.
-Humphrey?

85
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,533
I'm still going to tear this snaggletooth
fool apart.

86
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,770
Guys, lower the boom!

87
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,474
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.

88
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:32,047
Guys, guys, come on.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

89
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,058
You wolves are making us look bad.
Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.

90
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,551
Now, that's a moon
I don't want to howl to.

91
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:46,192
Western hunt group, get back to the den.

92
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,173
The two of you, go home.

93
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,167
Now!

94
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,404
Omegas, good job.

95
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,351
Great. My first hunt, and I blew it.

96
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,085
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

97
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:11,424
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy.
You were amazing.

98
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:14,396
I mean, if anyone's hungry, they can eat...

99
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,868
They can always eat...

100
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,196
Here.

101
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,633
They can eat berries.

102
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:32,616
Berries are really nutritious.

103
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,641
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.

104
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,187
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.

105
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:23,494
Luckily, the Omegas were there
to break up the fight.

106
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:31,874
-Lilly.
-What?

107
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:36,137
Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.

108
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:39,011
Kate, you're slouching. Thank you, honey.

109
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,142
Do you see how strong
and beautiful you are?

110
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,553
My.

111
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,854
Any food is a blessing, dear.

112
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,593
Winston? Come join us for dinner? Now!

113
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,097
Thank you, honey.

114
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,696
Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.

115
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,697
Not for my pack.

116
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,741
I'm sorry, Dad.
it's just those Eastern Wolves.

117
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,104
It's not your fault, Kate.

118
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,813
When they crossed into our territory,
they broke pack law.

119
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,979
Winston.

120
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,787
Can-do was jumped
by a group of Eastern Wolves.

121
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,490
It ain't nothing.

122
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,468
Quickly, bring him into the den.

123
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,970
Winston, honey, whoever did this,

124
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,375
let's rip his tail off
and shove it down his throat.

125
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:48,651
Sir, are we just going to let them
keep raiding our hunts and...

126
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,850
Put our Alphas on alert.

127
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,421
Already done, sir.

128
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,655
Good job.

129
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,069
Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated.

130
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:12,173
Instead, now, keep an open mind,
I just want you to have an open mind here,

131
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,440
we bring you berries.

132
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,077
How about squirrels?

133
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,651
Bad joke.

134
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,248
Flying squirrels.

135
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,584
Winston!

136
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,485
Tony! You're looking good.

137
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,130
My back feels like wood.
I got this disk that keeps cracking.

138
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:18,838
Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.

139
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,704
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

140
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,104
Like that little game of tag during our hunt.

141
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,571
Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.

142
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,611
You know
there's no caribou left in the east.

143
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:30,949
You got a problem.

144
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:35,788
Unite the packs, Winston.
It was you who gave the big speech

145
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:41,058
that your daughter Kate and my son Garth
would marry and unite the packs.

146
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:47,462
Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?

147
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,567
Don't worry. She knows.

148
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,540
Good.

149
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,242
Then she can meet Garth tonight
at the moonlight howl.

150
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,250
I won't let my pack starve, Winston.

151
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:11,326
If we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

152
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:15,290
That would be a big mistake.

153
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:19,027
Kate. it's...

154
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:24,404
It's okay, Dad. I understand. it's...
it's my responsibility.

155
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,410
Guys, we got to get ready
for the moonlight howl.

156
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,581
Guys, girls.

157
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,279
Girls?

158
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,973
You are cool.

159
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,273
So, let me go ahead...

160
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,180
Prepare the girls for your arrival
and you guys meet me there.

161
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,514
Game on.

162
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,686
Girls.

163
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,061
Kate, you look so beautiful.

164
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:27,399
Now, if Garth gets out of line,

165
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,065
take those beautiful teeth of yours,

166
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,541
go for the throat, and don't let go
until the body stops shaking.

167
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,211
If my little girl doesn't want to do this,
if she's not ready...

168
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,621
Don't worry, Dad. I'm ready.

169
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:50,988
Come on, Lilly.

170
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,426
Okay. Okay.

171
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,045
Your fur... It looks fantastic tonight.

172
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:53,020
Oh, my gosh. I had...

173
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,181
Omega alert.

174
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,056
I will handle this.

175
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,097
It totally relaxes the knots.

176
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,222
Hey.

177
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,259
Hey.

178
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,069
That's all I've got.

179
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:16,011
Wow. This is a new feeling.

180
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,944
I saw the whole thing, guys.

181
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:22,474
And, I cannot believe
they didn't just fall all over you.

182
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,353
When you yelled, "Hey,"
I thought you cinched it right there.

183
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,751
So, you think you can do better?

184
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,225
Please.

185
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:34,355
The next girl that comes up the hill,
she's mine.

186
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:42,695
I've never seen her look that good.

187
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,138
Kate is hot.

188
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,984
I'll be right back.

189
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,153
Hey.

190
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,731
Where do you think you're going?

191
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,858
Humphrey, you know the rules.

192
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,766
You're not allowed to howl with her.
She's an Alpha.

193
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,637
We can eat together.

194
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,670
Guys, I know. I... I was just...

195
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,675
Kidding.

196
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,916
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.

197
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,388
Friends for life!

198
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,224
Ugly-

199
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,891
So, do you see Garth?

200
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,423
Great.

201
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,369
I'm not even sure what he looks like.
But I'm sure...

202
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,271
We'll know him when we see him.

203
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,335
Hey, Kate.

204
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:59,409
What?

205
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,149
Garth.

206
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,347
Lilly, stand up.

207
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,619
Garth, hello. Good to see you.

208
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,558
-Humphrey?
-My butt! My butt.

209
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:15,654
It really hurts.

210
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:17,995
You should really do something
about that cough.

211
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,662
Be careful, Kate.
There's something going around.

212
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:23,035
Tails and ears are falling off, literally.

213
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,835
Name's Humphrey.

214
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:28,170
Garth.

215
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,373
Wow. You are a...
You are a big one, aren't you?

216
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,712
Wow. You're practically a moose.

217
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,842
Where you hiding them antlers?

218
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,317
Who's the coyote?

219
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,018
Who's the coyote? I get it.
That's good, 'cause I'm, like...

220
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,716
No one important.

221
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,151
Lilly, why don't you take
little coyote Humphrey and run along?

222
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,526
Come on, Humphrey.

223
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:57,630
Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.

224
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,074
So, tell me about yourself.

225
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,454
What does Garth like to do?

226
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,050
Well, I'm really into fitness, you know?

227
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:21,625
Rabbit sprints, tree squats.

228
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,240
You know us Alphas got to keep fit
to lead the pack.

229
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,604
But, what really gets me going is...

230
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,895
Was it good for you?

231
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,707
Unbelievable.

232
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,172
You know...

233
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:14,149
I just... Just... Hold on a sec
'cause I'm going to be right back.

234
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:19,348
I... I need some water. Some water. Okay?
So, I'll... Just... Hold on.

235
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:31,859
No worries.
I'll just keep my vocal chords warm.

236
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:33,363
Yeah.

237
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,800
"Oh, he's no one important.

238
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:39,467
"Just take little coyote Humphrey
and run along."

239
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,272
Coyote.

240
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,750
-Where's Barf?
-it's Garth.

241
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,454
And we're just taking a little break.

242
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:00,822
A break?

243
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,489
What? Is that so strange?

244
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,194
No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding?

245
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:08,999
I always like to take a break
10 minutes into a howl.

246
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,801
Well, I do.

247
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:15,333
Your howling partner, he's not a...
He's not a stud.

248
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,177
Not a stud but, like, it's like "stud" but...

249
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:21,741
A dud. A dud. That's it. isn't he?

250
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,181
No.

251
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,514
He is not a dud.

252
00:22:28,112 --> 00:22:32,857
In fact, Humphrey,
you'd be surprised to find that he is...

253
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,489
Strong!

254
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:42,698
Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's... He's...

255
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,266
-Proud!
-Yes! Yes.

256
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,806
Proud. And he's...
What's the word I'm looking for?

257
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,976
An Alpha's Alpha.

258
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,980
That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.

259
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,185
You make me so mad!

260
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,149
Hey, I was just kidding.

261
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,490
You're kind of cute.

262
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:15,766
Really? You think... So, wow. Okay. Cute.
Yeah. That's... Look...

263
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,773
Thank you, first of all,

264
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:22,744
but do you mean "Cute" in, like, a rugged,
kind of handsomely "Cute"?

265
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:27,611
Again with the butt.
These mosquitoes are out of control.

266
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,085
I'll meet you on Mars,

267
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:36,952
right after I eat the Milky Way.

268
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,188
That sounds good.

269
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:46,501
Save some for me.

270
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:54,372
Bag them up, boys. We're going to Idaho.

271
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,809
You got it, chief.

272
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,780
Okay. There we go. Watch out there.

273
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,819
Kate?

274
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,303
Where am I?

275
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:05,714
Humphrey?

276
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,306
Is that you?

277
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,113
Kate! Where are we?

278
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,451
I don't know.

279
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,749
Maybe we're dead.

280
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,791
Nope. Definitely not dead.

281
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,395
At least they left us some water.

282
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:21,759
You got water?

283
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,466
Nope. Definitely not water.

284
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,465
Kate, what are you doing?

285
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,500
Trying to get out.

286
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:35,702
Calm down.

287
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,179
Listen, maybe they're taking us
to where there's more food.

288
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,011
Or maybe we are the food.

289
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:44,885
Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

290
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,552
Yeah.

291
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,491
All right. Set them free.

292
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,637
Look at them go.

293
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,207
Wow.

294
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,115
This isn't Jasper.

295
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,457
Yeah, but it sure does... Rock!

296
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,654
Quick, get down!

297
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,128
What are they doing?

298
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,062
What a smashingly brilliant story this is.

299
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:39,775
The golfing goose from the low regions
of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.

300
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,311
He's using the wrong club.

301
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:52,687
Could you do me a favor, Needles,
and shut the hole that makes the words?

302
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,692
Looks like they're playing
some sort of weird game.

303
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,921
Maybe they can tell us how to get home.

304
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:02,157
Yeah. And if they can't, we can eat them.

305
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,029
Yeah. Follow my lead.

306
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:21,744
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

307
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:37,555
Now you will see, this shot is mine.

308
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:46,603
Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.

309
00:27:58,142 --> 00:27:59,177
Just a minute!

310
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,697
It's ugly, but a good runner.

311
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:28,940
Did you see that? Did you see that?

312
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:31,746
I guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.

313
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:34,222
You mark it "Birdie"
because it would have gone in.

314
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,952
Technically, sir, it might have gone in.

315
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:39,688
That silly bird
stopped my shot from going in.

316
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,390
So, I will not take an extra stroke.

317
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,057
Mark it Birdie!

318
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:45,896
Well, it... It was an obstacle.

319
00:28:49,293 --> 00:28:52,240
And everyone has to play
with the obstacles.

320
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,173
You know, we wouldn't want to lie.

321
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,975
This is not a lie.
This is not a lie if you are French.

322
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:02,916
Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash,
a hyphen, in between there.

323
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,579
-I say French.
-Canadian.

324
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,054
-French.
-Canadian.

325
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:08,351
-French!
-Canadian, sir.

326
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,416
May I just say, though,
that you are a wonderful golfer.

327
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:17,558
And you are a very good caddie.

328
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:20,295
Take off!

329
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,666
Paddy, what is wrong with you?

330
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,373
Hello.

331
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,105
You are two wolves.

332
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,738
I have not seen many wolves
in these parts.

333
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:35,443
But I am not afraid of wolves. No.

334
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,110
I like wolves.

335
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,850
Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you
a few questions.

336
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:44,984
Yes. Quick! Look behind you!

337
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:48,659
Grab him!

338
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,203
So, you want to face
the French Resistance?

339
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,897
That's French-Canadian!

340
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,297
My butt! My butt! My butt!

341
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,098
Omegas.

342
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,005
This is not a game anymore!

343
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:06,848
Don't you wash your feet?

344
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,641
Look out for the trees!

345
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,785
Watch that.

346
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:12,912
Nice one, sir.

347
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,082
Gotcha.

348
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,215
Oh, no.

349
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:21,991
That's got to hurt.

350
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,829
How do you like it now, wolf?

351
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,195
Hole in one, sir.

352
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:38,514
You have bit off more than you can chew
this time, my friend.

353
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,106
My goodness. I... Look out for the...

354
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:43,078
No. No. No. No. No. No.

355
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:53,457
He's a goner for sure.

356
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:56,295
Hey, Frank.

357
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,671
Okay. You have a question?

358
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,182
Yeah. Where are we?

359
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:15,774
Idaho?

360
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,278
Ida-who?

361
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:21,622
Oui, Idaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes,

362
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,618
and a few billion potatoes.

363
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,787
Sawtooth National Wilderness.

364
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,694
What are we doing in Idaho?

365
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:33,424
You were relocated to repopulate.

366
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:42,410
They want you big wolves
to make a lot of little wolves.

367
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,275
Sounds good to me.
Park shouldn't be without some wolves.

368
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:49,045
I mean, only for the good of the park.

369
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:52,747
So you two are undomesticated partners?

370
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,381
Paddy, please. Don't be rude.

371
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:59,360
So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?

372
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,091
You are an item?

373
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,529
-Well...
-No.

374
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:08,001
You wolves, you are funny.

375
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,174
We have to get home now.

376
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,733
There's going to be trouble
if I don't get back to Jasper.

377
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,280
Right. All right. You're freaking out.

378
00:32:18,335 --> 00:32:21,441
I'm not freaking out.
I just have to get home.

379
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:24,247
-Is this about Barf?
-it's Garth.

380
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:27,881
And it's about responsibilities.
So, I don't expect you to understand.

381
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,453
Can you help me?

382
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:31,993
I need to get home fast.

383
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,493
All right, Miss Fast.

384
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:37,189
Where is home sweet home?

385
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:39,993
Jasper Park, Canada.

386
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:44,767
Jasper park? Get out of here.
We love Jasper Park!

387
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,435
Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.

388
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,604
Paddy, please. We've toured it many times.

389
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,311
I dated a Pintail from Jasper once.

390
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,908
She never stopped quacking.
Drove me nuts.

391
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:58,885
Drove her right to me.

392
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,018
Bound to happen. Bound to happen.

393
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,921
So, you can help me, then, get home.

394
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:08,987
We haven't played Jasper in quite a while.
I think it would be a smashing idea.

395
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,936
This is true. So, of course I will help.

396
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,971
I like you two. You make me laugh.

397
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,301
And you didn't eat me, so I owe you favor.

398
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,477
Where did she go?

399
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,349
Maybe I should ask you.

400
00:33:31,408 --> 00:33:33,319
You know that's not my style.

401
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,150
My wolf, Can-do, knows your style.

402
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:41,222
I just want to say one thing.

403
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,892
If any of you wolves
have hurt my daughter,

404
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:51,372
I will personally rip out your eyes
and shove them down your throat

405
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:55,035
so you can see my claws
tear your carcass open!

406
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,537
Mom?

407
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:02,413
Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.

408
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:06,052
Well, since Kate stood up Garth,

409
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,317
I could show him around
until she gets back.

410
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:11,017
I wouldn't say "Stood up."

411
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:12,685
Garth!

412
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,820
Sounds good to me.

413
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,124
Well, come on, Garth.

414
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:25,632
Isn't that sweet? She gets it from me.

415
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:30,835
I'll give her till the full moon.

416
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,782
It is beautiful out there.

417
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:46,020
Almost makes you want
to hit the potato patch.

418
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,360
If you haven't already hit the outdoors,
get on out your door.

419
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,865
The weather today is...

420
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,094
Your ride home.

421
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,534
Quick! Get in!

422
00:34:57,227 --> 00:35:01,869
What? Boxed up twice in one day.
What are the odds?

423
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,308
-Hide!
-Hide!

424
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,050
That right there
is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.

425
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:14,749
Lucky for you, they travel every year
to Jasper right after Sawtooth.

426
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:19,318
The day's looking pretty,
and so is my woman.

427
00:35:23,787 --> 00:35:26,097
This is the song we met to.

428
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:28,466
Come here, you. Let's dance.

429
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,531
-Down here.
-Hurry.

430
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:38,404
Now, he was in a motorcycle gang,
and she was a librarian.

431
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,449
And opposites attract, if you will.

432
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:43,849
Exactly. In this case,
it was a bookstore that also sold beer.

433
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:44,942
So, they met.

434
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,425
Come on. We have to get in.

435
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,396
All right. Here we go.

436
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,008
You're just a dream.

437
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:19,583
I'm like a little bunny. Aren't I, dear?

438
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,655
I love you, Deb.

439
00:36:29,586 --> 00:36:31,190
I love you, too.

440
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:40,903
Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.

441
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,570
Well, back in a box.

442
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,250
Good luck, you two!

443
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,913
We will be watching out for you
from above!

444
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:56,048
Well, I'll be watching out for you.
He will be breathing heavily.

445
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:19,039
If we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

446
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:25,878
Humphrey?

447
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,357
So, why is this called
Rabbit Poo Mountain?

448
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:08,924
Because this is where rabbits like to poo.

449
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,630
I was just kidding.

450
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:16,635
I get it. You're a funny Omega.

451
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,864
Okay. Make me laugh.

452
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,280
What am I?

453
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,081
You got me.

454
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:35,646
It's a turtle that fell and can't get up.

455
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,221
That's pretty good.

456
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,454
Okay. What's this?

457
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,663
It's turtle road kill.

458
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,098
What else can you do?

459
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,636
I just do turtles.

460
00:38:48,692 --> 00:38:50,194
Okay, it's my turn.

461
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,762
You want to see something
an Alpha can do?

462
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:55,136
Would my mother approve?

463
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,576
Of course.

464
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,237
Well, okay then.

465
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,787
Keep searching.
We must find her before tomorrow night.

466
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,582
Winston?

467
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,856
Don't worry, Eve.

468
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,756
She's the finest Alpha I've trained.

469
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:46,488
I'm not, Winston.

470
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,554
She's also the finest Alpha
I've ever trained.

471
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:09,015
We stopped.

472
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,628
-What's wrong with you?
-I have to go.

473
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,189
You can't leave. Can't you hold it?

474
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,256
No! I can't.

475
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:28,498
Well, did you try crossing your legs?

476
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:29,901
-Yes!
-Holding your breath?

477
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,701
Yes! I almost passed out.

478
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,175
-Closing your eyes and...
-In or out, I am going.

479
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,941
Would you hurry?

480
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:41,312
I can't go when I feel pressured.

481
00:40:41,371 --> 00:40:42,406
Go!

482
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,942
What is he doing?

483
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:26,993
Where is he?

484
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:30,188
Come on, Humphrey.

485
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,278
It's a rabid wolf!

486
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,787
Max, bring that gun!

487
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,258
This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?

488
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,438
Max, they’re getting away!

489
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,806
Not if I can help it.

490
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,673
-No!
-We're trapped.

491
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:21,304
I got you both now.

492
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:22,714
Shoot them!

493
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,620
Nicely done, Max.

494
00:42:57,574 --> 00:43:00,453
Okay.
Thinking with my belly instead of my head,

495
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,889
not a good idea. I get it.
I say we build a comfy den...

496
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:06,325
-I'm going home.
-Great.

497
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,795
You're going home, and it's raining.

498
00:43:09,419 --> 00:43:11,057
I'm not stopping.

499
00:43:11,788 --> 00:43:13,995
Rain, rain, go away

500
00:43:14,057 --> 00:43:15,934
Get out of here, rain
No one wants you around

501
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:17,232
What are you doing?

502
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,774
It's...
it's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.

503
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,307
'Cause you're wet
And you really are going to ruin our day

504
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:25,869
Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.

505
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:33,944
Right! Well, I'll just do it backwards.

506
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:41,455
That actually worked.

507
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:50,997
Kate?

508
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,400
That's not a good idea.

509
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,738
Hold on, Kate!

510
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,164
No!

511
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,202
Hold on, Kate! I'm coming!

512
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,443
Let me think. Let me think.

513
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,119
Humphrey!

514
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,192
Don't worry, Kate. It's all part of my plan.

515
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:51,630
I can see that.

516
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,529
Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.

517
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,969
Grab your what?

518
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,871
Take those Alpha jaws and grab...

519
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,701
My tail. My tail.

520
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:08,181
Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.

521
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:14,046
That tickles. My tail hurts!

522
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,788
Who knew I was ticklish there?

523
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,569
I can't take any more.

524
00:45:32,862 --> 00:45:35,138
My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!

525
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:42,049
Your tail. I'm so sorry.

526
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:43,914
My tail's actually fine,

527
00:45:45,508 --> 00:45:47,283
last time I checked.

528
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:56,357
Come on. Let's get out of the rain.

529
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,830
Okay.

530
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,467
Thank you.

531
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,782
Sir, we've searched the entire territory.

532
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,487
Still no sign of Kate.

533
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,020
Sir?

534
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,464
We must defend our territory.

535
00:46:54,944 --> 00:46:56,218
Fore!

536
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:01,892
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

537
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:04,158
I say, we've caught them
at quite the bad time.

538
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,291
No, I'd say we caught them at a good time.

539
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,063
Indeed, sir. Indeed.

540
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:09,970
What are you doing here?

541
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:13,132
No, the question
is what are you doing here?

542
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:15,972
I give you a first class ticket home...

543
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:17,602
It's a straight shot right to the pin.

544
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:19,169
-And you blow it?
-Yep.

545
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:21,715
Over a cupcake.

546
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:24,443
Ridiculous dessert. "A cupcake."

547
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:25,952
Actually, they're quite delicious.

548
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:29,112
There has to be another way
for us to get to Jasper.

549
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,183
Another way? Another way?

550
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:35,161
Always another way.
What am I, a travel agent?

551
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,358
Come on. What, are you kidding me?

552
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,163
A great sportsman like yourself
always knows a few ways to win the game.

553
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:44,228
Well, there could be a train.

554
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,900
Actually, there is a train.
it's the Canadian Express and...

555
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:49,443
Paddy, please.
it's called the Canadian Express...

556
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,308
Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.

557
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,507
Right by Jasper Park.

558
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,277
-If you can catch it...
-You'll be home in no time.

559
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:56,578
No time. Very fast.

560
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:58,949
Great. So where do we board?

561
00:47:59,008 --> 00:48:00,988
Where do you board?

562
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,421
Watch this.

563
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,693
On the other side of that mountain.

564
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,197
Paddy, please.

565
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:11,732
Come on!

566
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,702
Let it slip, but may I say,
that was a stupendous shot.

567
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,399
You may,
and it was pretty good, wasn't it?

568
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,168
Indeed, sir. Indeed.

569
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:40,255
Dinner for two.

570
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,591
It's a new move
I've been working on for stalking prey.

571
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:45,462
You're good.

572
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:48,469
Thanks. Now you try.

573
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:50,769
No. I...

574
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,767
I'm not much of a hunter.

575
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,968
Come on. You'll do great.

576
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:57,071
Just do what I do.

577
00:48:58,134 --> 00:48:59,169
Okay.

578
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,605
Ready?

579
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,385
-One.
-One.

580
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,250
-Two.
-Two.

581
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:07,720
Three!

582
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,257
Lilly!

583
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,398
Lilly?

584
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,239
A turtle, right?

585
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,308
-It sure is pretty out there.
-Yeah.

586
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,744
Maybe this will help.

587
00:49:42,278 --> 00:49:43,552
Wow.

588
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,354
"Wow" what?

589
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:46,758
Your eyes.

590
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:48,261
They're beautiful.

591
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,661
Come on. Let's try again.

592
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:02,506
-It sure is pretty out there.
-Yeah.

593
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,643
-I'll race you to the top.
-You're on.

594
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:11,143
Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.

595
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,018
Humphrey?

596
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,961
Omega one, Alpha zero!

597
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:28,399
Okay! Okay!

598
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,564
Enough, enough! Stop! Stop!
I get it. I get it. I get it.

599
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,132
How's that for a girl's throw?

600
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,471
Very funny.

601
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:40,006
Well, look who's having fun.

602
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,379
You know, I should go check on the train.

603
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,181
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.

604
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,922
Hi, there.

605
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:51,083
What are you?

606
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:52,990
Well, I'm a wolf.

607
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:56,792
I've never seen a wolf.
You are really strange.

608
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,598
Am I now?

609
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:01,901
You're totally weird.

610
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,374
I'm going to get you!

611
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,743
No. Look out! Look out!

612
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:21,113
Okay, you asked for it.

613
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:30,124
No, no, no. it's okay. it's okay.

614
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,389
I'm really sorry.

615
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,103
Oh, poo.

616
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,572
Mad...

617
00:51:46,235 --> 00:51:47,236
Mad bear.

618
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:51,012
Kate! Get the snowballs ready!
Mad bear on the attack!

619
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,649
The Canadian Express!
Humphrey, the train is coming!

620
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,127
Kate!

621
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:02,861
Humphrey?

622
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:07,293
What's wrong with you?

623
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,125
That!

624
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,773
Don't move. We can handle this.

625
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:16,833
We can?

626
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:21,579
Okay, we're in trouble.

627
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,177
Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.

628
00:52:26,242 --> 00:52:30,952
So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown,
and one of the bears says,

629
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,324
"Does this taste funny to you?"

630
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,196
A simple "Boo" would have sufficed.

631
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,493
Man.

632
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:01,652
Watch this. One more. One more.

633
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,217
Get up. Kate, get up.

634
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:14,929
Where are those two?
Why must they make this so difficult?

635
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,665
I believe the term is
"high maintenance couple," sir.

636
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:30,083
Stuck between the cliffs and the claws.
This isn't good.

637
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:40,249
Good luck joking your way out of this one.

638
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,388
What's your name, sir?

639
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:45,298
Growl. All right.

640
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:56,671
Do you need a hug?

641
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,647
Good talk!

642
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:36,111
Hey, need a ride?

643
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,645
Jump! Trust me!

644
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,186
I told you, you could trust me.

645
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,728
Hang a left!

646
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,796
Go right!

647
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:06,979
Why are you looking at me like that?

648
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:16,816
Unbelievable. They have missed the train.

649
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,629
Or not.

650
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,783
-I know. it's not very good, is it?
-Well...

651
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:56,756
That was so awesome.
You with the snowballs.

652
00:55:57,753 --> 00:56:02,361
And you with that little bear
in that snowball fight. It was so cute.

653
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:06,700
But then you with the log!

654
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:08,708
The look on your face was so good.

655
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:10,535
And then we...

656
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,840
You know, we make a pretty good team.

657
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:19,443
Kate and Humphrey, world adventurers!
What do you think?

658
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:21,416
I think you're crazy.

659
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:22,854
You think I'm...

660
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:25,825
No, I'm telling you,
we're onto something here.

661
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,384
Stick with me, pup. We'll go places.

662
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,062
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

663
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,005
All right. Take a deep breath.

664
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:42,136
Howl from right here.

665
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,446
And I'll join in.

666
00:57:02,184 --> 00:57:03,561
Humphrey,

667
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,060
what are you doing?

668
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:09,797
I'm sorry. The moon, the moment.
I just thought...

669
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:14,666
Come on, Kate. Howl at the moon with me.

670
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,272
See? That's so good.

671
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,414
No. You better go.

672
00:59:09,478 --> 00:59:11,549
But no one has to know.

673
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:14,458
Please. Go, now.

674
00:59:16,585 --> 00:59:17,586
No.

675
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:21,893
Dad.

676
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,070
Howling with an Omega, are we?

677
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:29,109
-I was just...
-Get with the others.

678
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:30,870
What's going on?

679
00:59:30,933 --> 00:59:32,708
We're going to take the valley,

680
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,210
and our caribou.

681
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:49,195
-Dad!
-Lilly, what's wrong?

682
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:51,390
The Eastern Wolves. They're coming!

683
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:53,528
Come on!

684
01:00:06,068 --> 01:00:08,878
Just do it.
She howled at the moon with you.

685
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,985
That was just the moment.

686
01:00:13,442 --> 01:00:15,820
Bonjour, my furry friend.

687
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:17,850
What?

688
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:23,419
Are you guys crazy?

689
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,760
That's up for debate.

690
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,734
And where is... Mademoiselle.

691
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,099
She's sleeping, so be quiet.

692
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:31,634
Yes. Quiet.

693
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,450
What are you guys doing here?

694
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,921
Making sure that you don't forget
the run of the course.

695
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,050
Jasper Park, it is a few miles up.

696
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:54,191
Do not miss it.

697
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,093
Jasper, few miles, got it.

698
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,290
Good.

699
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:02,063
I've got to say, your girlfriend
looks quite pretty when she sleeps.

700
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:04,770
She's not my girlfriend.

701
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:09,637
You should work on that.

702
01:01:37,426 --> 01:01:40,032
It's the full moon, Winston.

703
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:43,067
I can see that, Tony.

704
01:01:43,566 --> 01:01:45,944
I didn't want it to come to this.

705
01:01:46,268 --> 01:01:47,406
But here we are.

706
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:50,211
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

707
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:54,015
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

708
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:56,784
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

709
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:24,876
Kate.

710
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,186
Kate, wake up. Wake up.

711
01:02:29,044 --> 01:02:32,116
Humphrey? Where are we?

712
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,650
We're... We're in Jasper.

713
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,266
We're home.

714
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:48,865
Yup. We're home.

715
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:51,902
-There's something...
-There's something...

716
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:54,038
Please, you first.

717
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,206
Humphrey, I just wanted to tell you,

718
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,277
these past couple of days,
they've been, kind of,

719
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,647
fun.

720
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:06,917
You've been, kind of, fun.

721
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:09,056
Really?

722
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,429
Really.

723
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,468
Well, that's... That's great.

724
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:17,197
I told you, we make a pretty good team.

725
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:19,495
We do.

726
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:23,641
Okay.

727
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,838
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
You have to go to the bathroom again.

728
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,644
Why, do you see a truck stop?

729
01:03:31,807 --> 01:03:35,084
I just wanted to tell you I... I...

730
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,590
-I... I just wanted to tell you...
-No.

731
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:42,424
I... I love...

732
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:44,928
Oh, geez.

733
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:55,268
All I asked was for you
to follow our customs, unite the packs.

734
01:03:55,597 --> 01:03:59,545
But, no.
Your daughter had to up and run away.

735
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:00,773
I didn't run away.

736
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,345
Kate!

737
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:06,818
She's back!

738
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:18,960
-We were so worried.
-Where have you been?

739
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,494
-In Idaho.
-Idaho?

740
01:04:21,957 --> 01:04:23,800
What were you doing in Idaho?

741
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,901
We were taken by humans to another park.

742
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:29,499
We were supposed to repopulate.

743
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:36,149
No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.

744
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,742
Humphrey actually helped me get home.

745
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,452
What a nice boy.

746
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:50,088
-I came back...
-You came back to marry Garth.

747
01:04:56,992 --> 01:04:57,993
Yes.

748
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,737
And unite the packs!

749
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:17,149
Good for the pack, good for the belly.

750
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:41,076
Marry? You're getting married?

751
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,684
Yes. isn't it great?

752
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:50,389
No more fighting during hunts.
No more scraps and bones at dinnertime.

753
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:52,790
We're going to unite the packs.

754
01:06:02,624 --> 01:06:04,194
Welcome back, Humphrey.

755
01:06:04,259 --> 01:06:06,296
Good job bringing her home.

756
01:06:27,749 --> 01:06:31,060
Wow. it's a big crowd.

757
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,900
Yeah. Good times.

758
01:06:34,523 --> 01:06:37,504
So I heard
you and Garth spent some time together.

759
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:39,698
Lilly.

760
01:06:39,761 --> 01:06:40,796
Sorry.

761
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,207
I'm sure he's perfect marrying material.

762
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:52,175
Well, if you like that sort of thing,
big, brawny, and perfect.

763
01:06:54,576 --> 01:06:56,453
Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.

764
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,725
Sorry. I know.

765
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,187
But, I liked it.

766
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:08,426
Right on the pin.

767
01:07:09,124 --> 01:07:10,660
Marcel! Paddy!

768
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:14,869
When it comes to hugs,
we are all French, Paddy?

769
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:17,443
Well, I'm English, so we don't hug!

770
01:07:18,233 --> 01:07:20,713
But for a first, I'd say that was a good one.

771
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:22,840
I'm so happy to see you two.

772
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,851
We flew in to see that you made it home.

773
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,682
And what do we find?

774
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:31,088
-You're getting married!
-You're getting married!

775
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,587
Yeah. I'm getting married.

776
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,460
-Who told you?
-I did.

777
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,400
Humphrey.

778
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:42,800
We should be going.

779
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,132
Yes, yes.

780
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,045
Excuse me. A flea.

781
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:55,647
And a little something for your big day.

782
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:58,149
Thank you.

783
01:07:58,206 --> 01:07:59,651
Just wanted to say good-bye.

784
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:01,251
Good-bye?

785
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,620
Yeah. I'm thinking
about doing a little traveling,

786
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,784
you know, seeing where the train takes me.

787
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,353
And maybe I'll visit our friends the bears.

788
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,493
Our old buddies, see how they're doing.

789
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:13,632
I'll tell them you said hi.

790
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:17,998
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?

791
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,201
Yeah. You know, it's alone wolf thing.

792
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,973
I know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega,

793
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:30,479
not Humphrey, the lone wolf.

794
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,418
So I'll be a fun-loving lone wolf.

795
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,155
I don't doubt that.

796
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:46,694
You know, Marcel,
I am a stickler for tradition,

797
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:49,361
but this one, I just don't understand.

798
01:08:50,325 --> 01:08:53,499
These wolves are mysterious creatures.

799
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:10,651
Tony.

800
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:12,550
So...

801
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,619
Are you ready?

802
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,489
Yes.

803
01:09:19,154 --> 01:09:20,258
Good.

804
01:09:22,457 --> 01:09:23,936
Are you okay?

805
01:09:25,193 --> 01:09:26,501
You bet.

806
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:28,438
No problems on this end.

807
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,670
Ready to go, go, go.

808
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:36,573
So, you want to start this thing or me?

809
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:37,912
We'll start together.

810
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,284
Start together. Yeah.

811
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,016
So, what's happening?

812
01:09:43,478 --> 01:09:45,788
They're accepting each other's scent.

813
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:49,927
And now, the nibble on the ears.

814
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:55,092
Do you think I can make it?

815
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:59,572
Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks,
you should see an open train car.

816
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:04,907
Well, avoid truck stops, bears, and that
hideous dessert. What is it called?

817
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:07,446
-Cupcakes, sir.
-Yes. Cupcakes.

818
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:09,709
I will. Thanks, guys.

819
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,849
You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental
about cupcakes.

820
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,444
They really are quite delicious.

821
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:16,113
I wouldn't know.

822
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:22,753
And finally, they will rub noses
to symbolize that they are

823
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:25,454
mates!

824
01:10:43,338 --> 01:10:44,908
Kate, what are you doing?

825
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:46,777
I...

826
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,624
I can't.

827
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,390
You can't!

828
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,319
I mean, you can't?

829
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,765
What is this, Winston?
Why can't she marry Garth?

830
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:01,994
Quiet.

831
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:05,934
Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?

832
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,336
Because I...

833
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:13,736
I fell in love with an Omega.

834
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:15,512
An Omega?

835
01:11:16,938 --> 01:11:20,147
Humphrey? That sly dog!

836
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,965
An Alpha in love with an Omega.
That's against pack law.

837
01:11:38,026 --> 01:11:39,300
Dad.

838
01:11:40,228 --> 01:11:43,209
I also am in love with an Omega.

839
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:45,603
What?

840
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,307
What have you done to my son, Winston?

841
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:53,182
An Omega and an Alpha?
An Alpha and an Omega?

842
01:11:53,241 --> 01:11:55,414
Eve, help me out.

843
01:11:59,714 --> 01:12:03,662
This is madness. This isn't our custom.

844
01:12:03,718 --> 01:12:07,564
This isn't our way. Take the valley!

845
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:18,809
I just love weddings!

846
01:12:35,717 --> 01:12:38,391
Stampede! Stampede!

847
01:12:38,453 --> 01:12:41,297
Everyone, run! Run!

848
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,563
To the sides of the valley!

849
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:55,310
It's that darn disk in my back.

850
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,146
Come on!

851
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:09,751
No! They're trapped!

852
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:18,997
Humphrey!

853
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,095
Kate!

854
01:13:20,161 --> 01:13:21,367
We have to help them!

855
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,302
Look!

856
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:33,377
Faster, Tony! Faster!

857
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:47,695
Go left!

858
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:51,160
Roll right!

859
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,097
You're getting good at this.

860
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:56,608
I had a good teacher.

861
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,705
They're too far ahead. We'll never make it.

862
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,078
Hold on.

863
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:12,180
Look!

864
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,564
World adventurers.

865
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,299
I told you we'd make a good team.

866
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,568
Did you say that? I thought I said that.

867
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:34,672
Kate!

868
01:14:58,793 --> 01:15:00,500
Kate. Kate.

869
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,244
Please, Kate.

870
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:10,009
Please, you can't do this.

871
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:22,659
I love you.

872
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:15,907
Kate!

873
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:21,515
Humphrey?

874
01:16:22,343 --> 01:16:23,447
I thought I'd lost you.

875
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,255
Is everyone staring at us?

876
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:37,903
Well, no, not... Not every... Well, yeah.
Now they are.

877
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:41,837
Darn. 'Cause I wanted to tell you something.

878
01:16:46,067 --> 01:16:47,171
What?

879
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:50,642
Really?

880
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:56,078
Okay.
Well, I wanted to tell you something, too.

881
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,062
Maybe this can work.

882
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:15,063
All right.

883
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,302
Garth!

884
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:31,155
Tony, what do two old wolves do
after they retire?

885
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:36,662
Gentlemen, may I introduce you to golf?

886
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:41,523
Fore!

887
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:55,579
Yeah, yeah.

888
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,205
Oh, that's good.

889
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:09,856
Come on, honey.
Let's show 'em how it's done.

890
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,693
You ready to shake your tail?

891
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:21,396
Now that's a howl.

892
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:39,683
Are you ready?

893
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:41,158
Yeah. Ready.
