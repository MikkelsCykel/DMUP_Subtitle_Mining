Yeah, like you, who can't put his book aside
for a minute while Dad dies.

00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:31,022
I've got to get this thing finished, Wendy.
My editor thinks it's a good time for it.

773
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:33,889
Everyone's really itching for a book
about Bertolt Brecht this holiday season.

774
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,689
<i>Wendy, I'm working.</i>

775
00:55:35,762 --> 00:55:37,753
I'm working.

776
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,231
[Sighs]
I know you are.

777
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,598
L- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

778
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:44,694
<i>It's just-</i>

779
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:47,433
It's just I got a lot riding on this book.

780
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:52,137
And-And your life's
much more portable than mine.

781
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:55,113
What is that supposed to mean?

782
00:55:55,182 --> 00:55:58,743
What, like-like a toilet?
What, like a porta-potty?

783
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:03,381
No, it's just, you know,
you don't have a job job, I do.

784
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:05,084
I have obligations.

785
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:08,594
<i>You're- You're freelance.</i>

786
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:12,098
Couldn't you just hook up
with a temp agency around here?

787
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:16,025
Actually, Jon...

788
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:22,102
I'm being funded right now,
to work on my plays.
