1
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,418
Sam.

2
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>How much time did you spend at
the dresser compared to last week?</i>

3
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,866
<i>- Less.
- How much less?</i>

4
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,577
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

5
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:22,077
<i>You wanna make a guess,
roughly, for the week?</i>

6
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:25,946
<i>Oh, not even an hour a day.</i>

7
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,877
<i>And...</i>

8
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:33,114
<i>...how long has it been now,
since your loss?</i>

9
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:35,848
<i>You're hoping I guess again,
aren't you?</i>

10
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,585
<i>How long?</i>

11
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,587
<i>Fourteen months, six days.</i>

12
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:44,461
<i>I can tell you what time it was, down
to the hour and minute if you want.</i>

13
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:47,231
<i>I can't help it.</i>

14
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:51,004
<i>It's all right.
It's just a memory doing its job.</i>

15
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,362
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, what are you doing?</i>

16
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:21,194
I'm just running out the door. I'm late
for my appointment with Munce.

17
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:24,698
Listen, I was thinking maybe
we could go out to dinner tonight.

18
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:29,603
I don't know. I think I'd
rather stay home. I'm sorry.

19
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,743
All right, well, that's fine.

20
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:34,311
<i>I'll cook something fancy.</i>

21
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,174
No, no, no.

22
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:37,646
It's too much for you.

23
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,878
No, I want to.

24
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,816
Jim, I want to, okay?

25
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,285
- Hey, Eliot.
- I miss you, sweetie.

26
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:52,190
- Where have you been?
- I know. I haven't called.

27
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:56,356
Don't be silly. I didn't mean it like that.
We haven't hung out in a while.

28
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:00,469
- Give me a call, we'll do something.
- I'd love to. Bye.

29
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:10,474
You need some help?

30
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:13,740
I parked my car here.
Right here, last night.

31
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:15,576
What kind of car is it?

32
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:17,810
Red Volvo.

33
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,447
Thanks.

34
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,024
I forget all the time.

35
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,021
Jim says I have a death grip
on the past.

36
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,098
How are you getting along?

37
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:38,233
Did you fight at all this week?

38
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,738
Jim doesn't fight. He negotiates.

39
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,408
Are you comfortable physically?
How's the sex?

40
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,676
How would you feel
if I asked you that question?

41
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,785
How's the sex with Mrs. Munce?

42
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,318
Would you answer?

43
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:59,115
Yes, but I'd have to
charge you more.

44
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,061
- What's wrong?
- L... I had my coffee.

45
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,462
No, not today.

46
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,236
No, I just had some.

47
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:16,599
I offered, but you said no this time.

48
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,271
Last time, you had a cup.

49
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,308
Memory slips.

50
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,239
I didn't forget.
I can still taste the coffee.

51
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:27,979
You...

52
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,813
You smell my coffee, and you
manufacture a memory, a taste.

53
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:33,476
That's all.

54
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,623
You do hang on hard.

55
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,722
Sometimes the mind...

56
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:43,089
...needs help in letting a thing go.

57
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,158
You expect me to let go of my son?

58
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,396
You think you amplify
some of these memories of Sam?

59
00:06:54,574 --> 00:06:55,939
Add to them?

60
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,175
No.

61
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,778
Why would I?

62
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,518
Hey. What's the occasion?

63
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,783
You going back to work.

64
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,621
- I think it's great.
- It's just a freelance edit job.

65
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:19,729
- Not even sure I wanna do it.
- I think you should do it.

66
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,923
It could be great for you.
What's the book?

67
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,962
<i>Psychotic Women and the Men
Who Love Them.</i>

68
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,202
No, I'm kidding.
It's a children's book.

69
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:36,838
Sorry. Sorry.

70
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:38,544
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:41,979
Let me get the nice glasses
your mother gave us. Okay?

72
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:44,847
- Speaking of psychotics.
- Yeah.

73
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,722
What kind of a kids' book is it?

74
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:06,733
What have you done, Jim?

75
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,904
- What?
- What have you done?

76
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,736
- Telly.
- Why'd you change the picture?

77
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:14,004
- I didn't change anything.
- Think this helps? Taking him away?

78
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,510
- Calm down.
- I want the picture of the three of us.

79
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:20,584
What did you think, that I
wouldn't notice? I wouldn't care?

80
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:02,180
I come here hoping
to meet other swingers.

81
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,186
You're the first one.

82
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:09,194
We know each other. I'm Telly.

83
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:13,766
Remember? Telly Paretta.
Sam's mom?

84
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,569
We're all tired of condolences,
but I miss Lauren too.

85
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,906
Well, I'm...

86
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:29,980
I'm done for the night, so I gotta go.

87
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:31,810
You don't remember me.

88
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:36,314
- Sure. You want my swing?
- No.

89
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,422
Do you want to come home
with me?

90
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:43,355
- Just live over there.
- Good night, Ash.

91
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,060
You do know me.

92
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:50,899
That's why you won't
come home with me.

93
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,798
Jim.

94
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,470
Please don't ask me to let go.

95
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,544
Jim.

96
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,392
<i>Mom, look.</i>

97
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,293
Hurry up, Mom.

98
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,245
- There's your plane.
- Yeah, I know.

99
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,771
Sam.

100
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,849
Jim Paretta, please.

101
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,649
Yeah, I'll take the voice mail.

102
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,949
I can't...

103
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:27,058
I can't believe what you did
with the book and...

104
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,400
And I was so good...

105
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:35,232
...with the photos and the lock.

106
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,840
You still...

107
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,873
Do you want to make me hate you?

108
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:43,808
Do you want to make me hate you?

109
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:08,567
Please, oh, please.

110
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:11,364
Please. Please.

111
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,903
Telly?

112
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,871
Telly.

113
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,552
I can't...

114
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,749
...be with you anymore.

115
00:15:09,991 --> 00:15:11,720
I don't wanna see you anymore.

116
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:14,225
- Telly, wait.
- The book...

117
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,956
The book, I can lose, but...

118
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,463
You erased our son.

119
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:24,627
You erased my boy.
You made it all blank.

120
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:27,797
- You took him away.
- Stop. They were always blank.

121
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:32,206
- What? What are you saying?
- You're healing. You're coming back.

122
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:35,040
- Dr. Munce is coming.
- Let me go! Let me go!

123
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:38,480
This is good.
God, Telly, this is real.

124
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,245
The tapes were always blank.

125
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,582
Do you know what he's telling me?

126
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:46,689
Yes.

127
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,589
Is he psychotic?

128
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,888
No.

129
00:15:55,566 --> 00:15:57,397
My child.

130
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:00,900
My Sam.

131
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:03,531
Telly.

132
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:07,333
There was never a Sam Paretta.

133
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,509
You never had a son.

134
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,676
- This is insane.
- I'm so sorry.

135
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:14,817
I wanted to help you slowly.

136
00:16:14,985 --> 00:16:17,817
- Gently. But I never thought you...
- He erased the tapes.

137
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:20,387
He replaced the book.
How can you believe him?

138
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:22,456
Sam, he grew up. He was 9.

139
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,923
Nine. I had nine years of memories.

140
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,128
Invented memories, Telly.
It happens.

141
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:29,820
People do this.
It's called paramnesia.

142
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:32,330
- You imagined a life...
- Everyone remembers Sam.

143
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,933
- Everyone.
- Telly.

144
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:35,433
You had a miscarriage.

145
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,470
Your life was in danger.
The baby was premature.

146
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:42,674
- It was stillborn. You almost died.
- Stop it.

147
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:45,539
Post-traumatic shock.
It affects everyone differently.

148
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,772
Some people actually invent
entire alternate lives...

149
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,382
...with imagined friends
and lovers and children.

150
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,883
Stop. Why are you doing this?
Why are you trying to take him away?

151
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:57,784
I made him up? I made him up?

152
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:05,127
This is so simple.
There are photographs.

153
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:09,126
People with your condition
look at a photo and see...

154
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:12,270
...what their mind tells them to see.
You used to see Sam.

155
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:14,996
- No. Sam took that picture.
- You're recovering.

156
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:17,766
There was a woman.
We asked her to take a picture...

157
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:21,672
...and that's the one that Jim took away.
We have a million photographs.

158
00:17:21,845 --> 00:17:24,404
No. No, he took the real book away!

159
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,514
Telly.

160
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:31,948
Telly, I was hoping we could do this
without hospitalizing you.

161
00:17:42,397 --> 00:17:44,661
All right, all right.

162
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,166
No, there... There...

163
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,304
There are...

164
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:54,304
There are photos that he didn't take.

165
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,372
I'll show you.

166
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:01,071
And we'll end this. We'll end this.

167
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,769
Telly.

168
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:28,906
Let's just sit down.

169
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:39,815
Telly.

170
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:48,453
Telly! Telly!

171
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:52,287
Where are you going?
Where are you...? Telly!

172
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,438
I need to see some newspapers.

173
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:15,445
Daily papers from 14 months ago.

174
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:25,019
You need to fill this out.

175
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,507
What papers do you need?

176
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:53,377
How could...?

177
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,285
How could it not be
in any of these?

178
00:19:56,453 --> 00:19:58,478
You sure of the date?

179
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:02,317
What are you trying to find?

180
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:06,018
"Six Brooklyn Children Feared Dead
in Missing Plane".

181
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,127
How could it not...?

182
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,294
I have to go.

183
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,898
I have to go.

184
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:36,644
- Eliot.
- Christ.

185
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:38,983
Telly. What are you doing
in the dark?

186
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:40,591
What's wrong?

187
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,226
I had a fight with Jim.

188
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:44,326
Oh, I'm sorry. Come inside.

189
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,488
We fought about Sam.

190
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:48,626
I'm sorry, about what?

191
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:52,561
Sam.

192
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,769
Sam. Who's Sam, sweetie?

193
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,674
Eliot, he's my son.

194
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:00,700
Your son?

195
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:03,311
El, please.

196
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,278
You knew my son.
You babysat him a thousand times.

197
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,418
- I don't know what you're trying to say.
- You knew my son.

198
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:12,019
You talked to him,
you took him to a Mets game...

199
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,622
...you bought him a hat.
He always wore that hat.

200
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,122
You're scaring me.
Tell me what's wrong.

201
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,261
Telly?

202
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,456
Telly!

203
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:28,959
Telly!

204
00:21:49,122 --> 00:21:50,350
<i>Who the hell is it?</i>

205
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:54,289
It's Telly Paretta. Ash, please.

206
00:21:54,459 --> 00:21:56,086
<i>Are you gonna go away?</i>

207
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,956
No.

208
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,269
Remember me?

209
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:09,401
Yeah.

210
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,910
Who am I?

211
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:17,044
You're in worse shape than I am.

212
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:35,953
What the hell are you doing?

213
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:39,497
I was here once before,
with my son.

214
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,602
- Do you remember?
- You an old fan, is that it?

215
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:46,334
Oh, yeah. That's...
That's right. You...

216
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:48,270
You were a hockey player.

217
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,639
Ex-Ranger.
Lauren was very proud of that.

218
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:55,009
- Well, tell Lauren I appreciate it.
- I don't follow hockey.

219
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:57,173
My son, Sam, was a baseball fan.

220
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,783
Oh, baseball.

221
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,444
It's a great game.

222
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:06,150
The only sport you can play
while taking a nap.

223
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:09,857
- You drinking?
- No, I just wanted to talk to you.

224
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,257
About what?

225
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:15,163
- Your daughter.
- I don't have a daughter.

226
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,491
Do you get drunk every night?

227
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:24,270
No. Sometimes I'm drunk by noon.

228
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:28,472
- What do you want?
- I had a son.

229
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,874
My son and your daughter
were friends...

230
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,381
...and I'd come here sometimes
to drop Sam off or pick Lauren up.

231
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:36,814
Can we talk about this after?

232
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,744
After what?

233
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,514
After I sleep.

234
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,722
Somebody else has a daughter,
you know.

235
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:52,892
Somebody else knows your son.

236
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:56,864
It's not me.

237
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,273
That's nice.

238
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:15,828
Did we get married?

239
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:18,627
It's not me.

240
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:20,666
It's you. It's Jim.

241
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:24,032
I don't know who else or what else.

242
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:25,968
I don't know anything.

243
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:29,075
I don't know why
it's not in the papers.

244
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:30,767
I don't know anything.

245
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:34,210
But it's not me. I'm not insane.

246
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:37,544
Go look in your office.
It used to be your daughter's room.

247
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:44,822
You let her draw on it.
These are her drawings.

248
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:47,819
- What did you do?
- She was showing Sam her room.

249
00:26:47,993 --> 00:26:50,188
I was there. Her bed was here.

250
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:53,627
Her desk was here, with pictures
from magazines, collaged.

251
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,734
- You're out of your mind.
- This was her room.

252
00:26:56,936 --> 00:27:00,462
Somebody lived here before me.
They papered over their kid's room.

253
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:04,165
- I'm calling the cops.
- We were there, at the awful funerals.

254
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:06,503
- You and me and your ex-wife.
- Get out!

255
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:09,271
You seemed much more
upset than your wife.

256
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:11,437
She was like my husband,
she held it in.

257
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:14,243
- But you and I...
- Listen, listen, listen!

258
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:17,444
We have never met at a funeral.
I do not know you.

259
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:21,283
Lauren and Sam were friends.
We put them on a plane together...

260
00:27:21,457 --> 00:27:24,517
...to go to camp, and we lost them.
They died over a year ago.

261
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:26,525
- Come on.
- You weren't drinking then.

262
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:32,532
- How do you know that?
- I met you.

263
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:34,726
You weren't like this.

264
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:38,765
It was about 14 months ago
you started drinking, wasn't it?

265
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,765
Wasn't it?

266
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,570
That's when Lauren died.

267
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,243
- I never had a kid.
- You remembered her before this.

268
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:51,213
Everybody remembered our children.
Something happened...

269
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:55,320
...in the last weeks or days, I don't know,
but our children have been forgotten.

270
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,855
- That's it. Let's go. Come on!
- No, no! Say her name, and I'll go!

271
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,754
I say his name every day!

272
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,651
Just say it.

273
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,855
So you can hear it. Lauren.

274
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:08,829
Say it.

275
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,033
Lauren.

276
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,464
Now look around again.

277
00:28:19,777 --> 00:28:21,574
She was here.

278
00:28:22,513 --> 00:28:24,344
She lived here.

279
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:29,642
- I need a minute.
- Tell me if...

280
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,309
I need a minute.

281
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,567
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

282
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:02,710
I know this is difficult.

283
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,412
How much do you remember?

284
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:17,862
I... I called the police.

285
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,791
Look, you need some help.
I never had a kid.

286
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:26,102
You gotta get some help. I'm...

287
00:29:26,871 --> 00:29:28,839
I'm real sorry.

288
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:37,738
Yeah.

289
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,878
One second, okay?

290
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,324
It's the best thing.

291
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:53,387
They say I dreamed it all.

292
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:55,188
Do you think I dreamed it?

293
00:29:56,265 --> 00:29:57,925
We have to go.

294
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,025
Hi. Carl Dayton,
National Security Agency.

295
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,662
Telly Paretta? We're taking custody.

296
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,732
- Can I see some ID?
- Check with Captain Mills. He'll verify.

297
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,611
Hi, Dad.

298
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,886
Sorry, Dad.

299
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:08,924
Which one do you think
I should wear, Daddy?

300
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,400
Wait! Wait!

301
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:23,240
- Where is she?
- The feds have her.

302
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:31,375
Stop.

303
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,086
- You gotta let her go.
- Mr. Correll, step back.

304
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:37,985
You don't understand.

305
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:39,954
Telly. Get off...

306
00:31:41,627 --> 00:31:44,289
- I remember. I remember.
- Get off.

307
00:31:44,464 --> 00:31:46,398
I remember.

308
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:49,128
- Get him off the car!
- I remember.

309
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:51,599
Get off me. She's right!

310
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:59,908
- Grab his hands!
- Run!

311
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,838
Run!

312
00:32:07,251 --> 00:32:09,185
Run!

313
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:50,308
- T-E-L-L...?
- Y. Telly.

314
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,978
They told me there was
a complaint against her.

315
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,475
She trashed an apartment
and wouldn't leave.

316
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:59,812
- Who? Whose apartment?
- Mr. Ashley Correll. Do you know him?

317
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,614
- No.
- Ex-New York Ranger.

318
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,257
- Pretty good.
- What does he have to do...?

319
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,722
She was claiming her son
was missing and dead.

320
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:08,258
We never had a son.

321
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:10,557
Why would she say that?

322
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,824
My wife is delusional.
She needs help.

323
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,934
Where is she?

324
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:18,500
She was turned over
to federal agents.

325
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,400
And she fled custody.
Now, Mr. Paretta...

326
00:34:21,573 --> 00:34:24,565
...why would the NSA
be interested in your wife?

327
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:27,768
You're asking me?
This is crazy.

328
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:30,038
They don't care about
anybody's apartment.

329
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:35,117
- And they don't trace missing children.
- There was never a child.

330
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:15,779
<i>Do what they say, all right?</i>

331
00:35:15,956 --> 00:35:17,787
Okay. I love you.

332
00:35:20,193 --> 00:35:22,423
I'm gonna miss you so much.

333
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:25,526
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

334
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,990
Have fun.

335
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,829
I love you, Mommy.

336
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,595
- Sam.
- Yeah?

337
00:35:32,772 --> 00:35:36,172
- See you.
- See you.

338
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:14,401
I was hoping you'd come here.

339
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:16,108
Me too.

340
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:26,776
I don't understand it.

341
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:32,419
I keep thinking I'm crazy, you know?

342
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,955
How could I forget her?

343
00:36:35,261 --> 00:36:37,024
My little girl.

344
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,390
How...?

345
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:41,966
I can't do this.

346
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:44,199
You have to.

347
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,301
Because I can't do this alone.

348
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,035
Come on, we shouldn't
hang around here.

349
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,678
First, I thought it had to do
with the plane crash.

350
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,515
Remember when that flight
crashed over Long Island...

351
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,089
...and everybody thought
it was friendly fire...

352
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,691
...some government cover-up?

353
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,522
- Yeah, I remember that.
- But then I thought...

354
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:15,563
...how could the government
erase our memories?

355
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:18,598
It's just not possible. It's so...

356
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:20,292
- What?
- Please don't think...

357
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:23,233
...I'm out of my mind.
- I don't anymore.

358
00:37:23,506 --> 00:37:27,203
Do you ever feel like somebody...?

359
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,900
Something's watching you?

360
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:32,045
Like surveillance?

361
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:36,377
No, I mean that sometimes
people are...

362
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:39,110
...taken. We hear that.

363
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:43,814
- What are you talking about?
- Abduction.

364
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:51,288
<i>You're freaking me out.
I'm having a National Enquirer moment.</i>

365
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:53,261
No, listen to me.
What do we know?

366
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:55,993
I had a son, you had a daughter,
they had lives...

367
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:59,605
...they died, and everyone besides us
believes they never existed.

368
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:02,171
What could do something like that?

369
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,365
No. There's gotta be
another explanation.

370
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:08,104
Who could erase our kids?
Every... Every picture of them gone.

371
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,148
Every newspaper article gone.
Every memory gone.

372
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,716
No agents. No government.
Who could do that?

373
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,278
I don't know.

374
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,355
We need to find a hotel.
You got any cash?

375
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:29,824
No, not much.
I have some credit cards.

376
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,231
Forget it. Clerk runs your card,
and they got us.

377
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:34,961
Don't you watch TV?

378
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,703
I read.

379
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,340
Goddamn snob.

380
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:46,206
No. Goddamn editor.
Why are you so pissed at me?

381
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:52,312
- You okay?
- Yeah.

382
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,715
My door.

383
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:57,584
- NSA! We need to talk to you!
- Just stay by the car!

384
00:38:57,757 --> 00:38:59,850
Stay by the car!

385
00:39:30,288 --> 00:39:31,584
This way!

386
00:39:39,429 --> 00:39:40,862
- Where did they go?
- In here!

387
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:01,840
In here!

388
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,089
Get down.

389
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,591
Goddamn it, we've lost them.

390
00:40:22,802 --> 00:40:25,498
All right, search the fields.
We'll check the streets.

391
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:27,764
All right. Come on.

392
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:30,270
I got left side.

393
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:15,272
<i>- Petalis, come in.
- Go for Petalis.</i>

394
00:41:17,118 --> 00:41:18,949
<i>What do you see? Nothing there?</i>

395
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,884
<i>- Yeah, the field's clear.
- Okay, hook up with us.</i>

396
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:23,614
Okay. I'm coming back to you.

397
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,054
What's your 20?

398
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:59,119
<i>- Hello?
- Dr. Munce, it's Telly.</i>

399
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:03,191
Telly. Where are you?
Are you all right?

400
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:05,527
No.

401
00:42:05,696 --> 00:42:10,689
I mean, I'm not hurt,
but there are people after us.

402
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:12,195
What? What do you mean?

403
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:14,268
<i>I found someone else.</i>

404
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:17,463
His daughter was on the same flight.
He didn't remember her.

405
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,107
But now he does.

406
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:21,071
How do you explain that?

407
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:23,711
How do you explain
the people chasing us?

408
00:42:24,946 --> 00:42:28,438
Telly, this is a panic attack.
You just hold on, all right?

409
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:32,985
Now, tell me where you are,
I'll leave right away. You need help.

410
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:37,789
No, I need you to start believing me.

411
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,733
Found an all-night place.

412
00:42:59,812 --> 00:43:01,279
Didn't have much.

413
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,443
You should eat something.

414
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,886
Just deciding whether I want
too much salt or too much sugar.

415
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,992
Sugar.

416
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:29,998
Wish you wouldn't do that.

417
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:33,336
Don't worry about it.

418
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:43,951
Think I'm just gonna go to bed.

419
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:11,603
- You held out.
- What?

420
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:15,178
You held out and I didn't.
I forgot her.

421
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:17,781
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

422
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:21,885
What's so important about us?
Or our kids?

423
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:26,419
I mean, the kids are dead.

424
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,524
Why try to erase our memories?

425
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:31,225
It's not like we're gonna
go look for them.

426
00:44:56,552 --> 00:44:58,246
Sam.

427
00:45:29,014 --> 00:45:30,879
Ash.

428
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,813
Ash. Wake up.

429
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:36,513
Come on.

430
00:45:37,222 --> 00:45:39,918
Come on, wake up. Wake up.

431
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:43,623
Wake up, wake up.
Come on. Wake up.

432
00:45:43,794 --> 00:45:45,489
Wake up.

433
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,425
Wake up!

434
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:54,994
Ash.

435
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:57,968
Ash.

436
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,040
Wake up.

437
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:02,404
- Listen to me.
- What the hell are you doing?

438
00:46:02,578 --> 00:46:04,443
- You nutjob!
- Listen to me.

439
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,909
You didn't know it,
but you were right.

440
00:46:07,082 --> 00:46:09,482
If the children were dead,
they would leave it.

441
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:12,677
If we all thought they were dead,
why would they erase them?

442
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,981
Why would they need
to make us forget them?

443
00:46:15,156 --> 00:46:16,952
I think the children are alive.

444
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:21,083
That's why I can still feel him, why
I can't let go. The children are alive.

445
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,762
Don't you feel that
Lauren's alive out there?

446
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:25,455
I don't know, maybe.

447
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:34,100
Yes.

448
00:46:37,477 --> 00:46:40,468
Jim usually leaves the office
by 12:15.

449
00:46:40,946 --> 00:46:42,971
We need to get Jim alone.

450
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:46,675
- What's he like?
- We had our problems.

451
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:49,484
He loved Sam.

452
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,314
Make him say Sam's name.

453
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,082
Like you made me say "Lauren".

454
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,430
- Watch out!
- Get out of the way!

455
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:23,308
Behind you!

456
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:28,283
Get out of the way!

457
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,850
Oh, my God!

458
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:35,790
- Is he...? Did we...?
- I don't know.

459
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,923
I've seen him before.

460
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,897
Don't answer it.

461
00:47:44,371 --> 00:47:47,305
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, is this Telly Paretta?</i>

462
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:50,806
<i>- Who is this?
- Telly, this is Detective Anne Pope.</i>

463
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:52,535
We didn't mean to hurt anybody.

464
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:55,579
The man in front of our car
wouldn't get out of the way.

465
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:58,215
<i>- What?
- We're just trying to find our children.</i>

466
00:47:58,383 --> 00:48:00,078
<i>- Hang up.
- Yes, I know.</i>

467
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,378
- You know?
- I know about your case.

468
00:48:02,554 --> 00:48:03,987
<i>Hang up.</i>

469
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:05,645
Is that Ashley Correll?

470
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,189
They took our kids.

471
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,690
<i>They made us think
they died in a plane crash.</i>

472
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,658
Anne. Look, I know this doesn't
make any sense...

473
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,391
...but my son, Sam Paretta,
and Ash's daughter, Lauren Correll...

474
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:18,432
...they were on the same plane.

475
00:48:18,602 --> 00:48:20,193
Now, how could two people...

476
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,897
<i>...remember two different children
if they never existed?</i>

477
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:53,456
Jim.

478
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,227
Hi. I...

479
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:58,267
I'm sorry, do I know you?

480
00:48:58,772 --> 00:49:00,569
What's the matter? It's me.

481
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:04,039
I'm lost. Can you help me out here?

482
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:08,303
Oh, God, what did they do to you?

483
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,540
It's me. It's Telly.

484
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:14,949
I'm sorry. We know each other?

485
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,549
I know your wife.

486
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:23,853
Right. Got it. Not married.
Wrong Jim.

487
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,223
James William Paretta.

488
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:28,825
Who are you?

489
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,403
Do you know a Sam Paretta?

490
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,740
- No relation.
- Maybe it would help...

491
00:49:38,908 --> 00:49:40,899
...if you said the name. Sam.

492
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:43,638
You lost me.

493
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:56,183
What about Jim?

494
00:50:05,399 --> 00:50:06,923
It's them.

495
00:50:37,461 --> 00:50:41,488
We gotta get out of here.
Out of the city, at least for tonight.

496
00:50:43,267 --> 00:50:45,633
I know someplace far enough.

497
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:51,272
- Telly.
- He didn't even know me.

498
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,170
He forgot me.

499
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,543
Swear to God. They hit the guy,
he crashes into the pump. Look.

500
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,053
Look at that. Then he gets right up.
I didn't just see it, I heard it. Bang.

501
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:11,817
This guy bounces off
the gas pump, gets right up.

502
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:13,221
There's no blood.

503
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,954
There's gotta be.

504
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:19,429
- Feds wanna talk to you.
- What?

505
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,425
Detective Pope.

506
00:51:21,601 --> 00:51:24,035
Okay, wait right here, all right?

507
00:51:25,305 --> 00:51:27,739
I'm Carl Dayton, NSA.

508
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,033
- So you're here to rent a car?
- Pardon?

509
00:51:32,311 --> 00:51:34,438
What are you doing
in my crime scene, Carl?

510
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:37,241
What's so national security
about this?

511
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:39,407
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- Liberty to say.

512
00:51:39,585 --> 00:51:41,382
You guys need new material.

513
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,948
We've been on this case.

514
00:51:44,222 --> 00:51:48,716
So any new information
that you get on Paretta or Correll...

515
00:51:49,494 --> 00:51:51,758
...you give me a call any time,
day or night.

516
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,522
You like this part, don't you?

517
00:51:53,697 --> 00:51:56,131
The part where you get
to take away my case.

518
00:51:56,466 --> 00:51:58,093
I'd rather be sailing.

519
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,670
I'm conducting
an investigation here.

520
00:52:00,837 --> 00:52:03,431
And until I know differently,
Paretta and Correll...

521
00:52:03,607 --> 00:52:06,006
...have been breaking only
the laws of New York.

522
00:52:06,175 --> 00:52:08,973
I am the city of New York,
and I'm on it.

523
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:12,905
Your involvement wouldn't have to do
with the plane crash...

524
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:16,676
...they claim killed their two children?
- Children?

525
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:18,975
There are no children.

526
00:52:21,189 --> 00:52:23,282
But there was a plane crash.

527
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:24,686
No.

528
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:27,054
We know nothing about
a plane crash.

529
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:30,354
You don't know very much.

530
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,726
National security, huh?

531
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,095
Better buy better locks.

532
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,200
<i>Dr. Munce? Telly Paretta.
If you wanna help us, then...</i>

533
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:46,000
<i>when you get this message,
call my husband and ask him about me.</i>

534
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:36,549
Put your eyes back
in your head, warden.

535
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:38,696
I'm not looking at you.

536
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,130
I had a wife.

537
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,601
Could feel a woman's eyes judging me
if I was in a coma.

538
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:47,604
Ash, please don't drink.

539
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:51,676
See, I told you
you were watching me.

540
00:53:52,117 --> 00:53:53,415
You know what?

541
00:53:53,586 --> 00:53:56,249
- I wish I didn't have to.
- Then don't. I'm sick of hearing it.

542
00:53:56,424 --> 00:53:58,950
Sorry to interrupt your
feeling sorry for yourself.

543
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:01,557
Well, not all of us
can be heroes, lady.

544
00:54:01,732 --> 00:54:05,727
You think I wouldn't drink that entire
bottle for a few seconds of peace?

545
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:08,306
You're in this. You don't get
to drink your way out.

546
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:11,138
What makes you so fucking special?

547
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,818
I let her go.

548
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,585
My little girl.

549
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,326
They took her away from me,
but I let her go.

550
00:54:25,034 --> 00:54:27,230
What kind of father does that?

551
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:36,082
I need you to stay clear.

552
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:07,696
- I'm not doing this for you, you know.
- I know.

553
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,133
I'll never forget her again.

554
00:55:11,837 --> 00:55:13,669
I know you won't.

555
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:15,903
You know everything, right?

556
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:21,811
I don't know how
to get my son back.

557
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,227
We'll figure something out.

558
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,843
- And?
- Dayton? He is NSA, but it's tagged.

559
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:46,182
He's got special clearance.
Some unit within the NSA.

560
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:48,587
- These people are down deep.
- Doing what?

561
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:52,219
I'd say God only knows,
but I don't think he's in the loop.

562
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:56,268
I gotta pick up my sister's kid.
Get some sleep.

563
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:59,033
Good night. I need you
to get that on my desk...

564
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:01,940
- Excuse me, Lieutenant Pope?
- No, I'm gone, in my car.

565
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:04,048
- I'm almost home.
- I'm Dr. Jack Munce.

566
00:56:04,216 --> 00:56:06,082
Telly Paretta's my patient.

567
00:56:06,253 --> 00:56:08,654
I'd like to help.
Telly's contacted me.

568
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,885
What can you tell me about Telly
that might help me find her?

569
00:56:12,128 --> 00:56:15,725
I used to think that she was
purely delusional.

570
00:56:16,868 --> 00:56:19,236
I'm not sure anymore.

571
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:24,976
So how is it that she and Mr. Correll
are having the same delusion...

572
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:28,984
...making up imaginary children
from the same plane crash?

573
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:31,623
Well, I don't... I don't know Correll.

574
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:33,953
He could be saying anything
to be with her.

575
00:56:34,395 --> 00:56:36,125
Well, if she calls again, call me.

576
00:56:36,298 --> 00:56:39,292
I think it's important
that I'm there when you find her.

577
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:42,236
You'll be dealing with
a possible psychotic break.

578
00:56:42,407 --> 00:56:43,966
You don't wanna do more damage.

579
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:48,104
- I'll call you, Dr. Munce.
- No, that's not what I mean.

580
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:52,049
It's... It's my fault she's out there.

581
00:56:52,322 --> 00:56:53,847
Why?

582
00:56:54,258 --> 00:56:55,851
She was in my care.

583
00:56:56,462 --> 00:56:58,897
She still trusts me,
or she wouldn't have called.

584
00:56:59,066 --> 00:57:04,701
She'll call again, and when she does,
you'll know because I'll be with you.

585
00:57:04,874 --> 00:57:07,867
You're gonna need me to find her.

586
00:58:15,181 --> 00:58:16,409
Oh, shit.

587
00:58:16,816 --> 00:58:18,409
"A. Petalis".

588
00:58:18,919 --> 00:58:21,287
What's the A stand for?

589
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:26,294
What?

590
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:31,269
- You don't have to do that.
- This?

591
00:58:31,438 --> 00:58:32,838
Just stop it!

592
00:58:34,109 --> 00:58:35,668
Al.

593
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,076
Al Petalis.

594
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:44,149
You don't want this kind of trouble,
so just drop it right now. Right now!

595
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:48,524
Tell him to stop, Miss Paretta,
before this goes any further. Tell him!

596
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,495
We just want our children.

597
00:58:51,468 --> 00:58:55,634
There are no children.
Forget the children.

598
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,173
What did you say?
Did you say to forget the children?

599
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,913
- Who are you?
- Where are the children?

600
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:05,214
Why were they taken?
Why were the children taken?

601
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,564
If I swing this thing again,
I'm gonna break your kneecap.

602
00:59:12,032 --> 00:59:13,660
I swear it.

603
00:59:13,835 --> 00:59:15,531
Where are the children?

604
00:59:15,704 --> 00:59:18,800
No! No, I...

605
00:59:19,443 --> 00:59:21,605
It's not me, it's...

606
00:59:22,148 --> 00:59:25,676
It's not us. We... We...

607
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:28,713
We cooperate.

608
00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:30,860
Cooperate with who?

609
00:59:31,295 --> 00:59:32,695
With who?

610
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:34,897
Why do you cooperate with them?

611
00:59:36,069 --> 00:59:38,595
- Survival.
- Who, yours?

612
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,769
Yours too.

613
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,775
You were right.

614
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,280
Where are they from? Who are they?
Why do they want the children?

615
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:51,356
Tell us the truth.

616
00:59:54,496 --> 00:59:55,794
The truth.

617
00:59:55,966 --> 00:59:59,597
The goddamn truth
won't fit in your brain.

618
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,731
It won't fit in anybody's brain.

619
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:04,173
Just tell us how to get
the children back.

620
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:09,280
I don't know. I don't know
anything about that.

621
01:00:09,453 --> 01:00:13,949
All I know is that you were supposed
to forget like everybody else did.

622
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,426
This was not part of it.

623
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,494
Part of what?

624
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,794
Part of what?

625
01:00:23,741 --> 01:00:25,903
Part of...

626
01:00:26,077 --> 01:00:29,537
...this particular experiment.

627
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:32,650
- Go on.
- I can't.

628
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,186
- Yes, you can!
- No, I won't.

629
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:37,020
- Yes, you can! Yes, you...!
- No! No!

630
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:44,160
Do you have children?

631
01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:52,847
Please.

632
01:00:54,353 --> 01:00:56,049
Please tell me.

633
01:00:57,058 --> 01:00:59,687
No one will know that you told us.

634
01:00:59,861 --> 01:01:01,329
Just...

635
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,699
Just tell us...

636
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,466
...how to get the children back.

637
01:01:08,642 --> 01:01:10,668
No one will blame you.

638
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:14,544
I swear to you. I swear to you.

639
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:21,890
They're listening.

640
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,286
You okay?

641
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:10,701
- Why didn't they take us?
- I don't know.

642
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:17,807
Our best guess is a gas leak.

643
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:20,972
But nothing's burned.
There's no sign of fire.

644
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:22,982
There's no sign of blood.

645
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:26,084
Just this.

646
01:02:28,128 --> 01:02:31,827
"Anne Pope, our children are alive.
We believe they were abducted.

647
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,632
We know we couldn't sound crazier
if we tried. Please help us".

648
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:38,742
Abducted.

649
01:02:38,911 --> 01:02:40,572
That's an interesting word.

650
01:02:40,948 --> 01:02:43,247
Most people say kidnapped.

651
01:02:44,486 --> 01:02:48,549
- Troopers found this.
- Excuse us, Dr. Munce.

652
01:02:52,564 --> 01:02:54,590
Witnesses only saw
Paretta and Correll...

653
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:57,067
...running from the cabin
after the explosion.

654
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,209
And there's no sign
of another body inside.

655
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:03,472
Where did this come from?

656
01:03:07,354 --> 01:03:09,084
Brasher, how old's Cassidy?

657
01:03:09,257 --> 01:03:11,351
She's 7, why?

658
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:15,124
What if I told you your daughter
never existed? That you made her up?

659
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:16,699
Why would you do that?

660
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:21,101
Yeah. Why?

661
01:03:46,212 --> 01:03:49,273
QuestAir. The name of the airline,
the small airline.

662
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,920
It was QuestAir. Remember?

663
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:54,615
QuestAir. So...

664
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:58,890
So we're saying that
it never crashed at sea.

665
01:03:59,065 --> 01:04:01,934
We're saying that they
somehow took the kids...

666
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:05,267
...and that the...
The plane and the pilot...

667
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,606
...that all of it,
all of it is part of them.

668
01:04:09,481 --> 01:04:11,278
QuestAir.

669
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,709
Oh, my God. Who are you?
What are you doing here?

670
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:16,814
Sorry, we didn't think there'd be
anyone here. I'm Claire.

671
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:20,146
I'm Mr. Shineer's assistant.
And you are?

672
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:23,819
Eileen, the accountant the court
appointed for the bankruptcy.

673
01:05:23,992 --> 01:05:28,455
- Oh, of course. I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

674
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,603
I was told that QuestAir employees
are not allowed here.

675
01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:34,742
That's okay. Mr. Shineer needs
some items from his office.

676
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:37,975
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Nothing is allowed to leave.

677
01:05:38,648 --> 01:05:40,173
They're just personal letters.

678
01:05:40,718 --> 01:05:43,779
Yes, well, if anything turns up,
I'd be happy to have them...

679
01:05:43,957 --> 01:05:45,515
...sent to Mr. Shineer's home.

680
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,422
Gonna have to go by court procedure.

681
01:05:47,996 --> 01:05:52,628
That's fine. The West Side address
isn't good anymore, though, the co-op.

682
01:05:52,803 --> 01:05:54,032
Which one do you have?

683
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:58,244
Where would I have that?

684
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:04,052
Let's see what I've got here.

685
01:06:04,821 --> 01:06:07,621
Okay, Robert Shineer.
I've got the one on Long Island.

686
01:06:07,959 --> 01:06:11,157
165 Colony Way.

687
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:53,018
Nobody lives here.

688
01:06:53,194 --> 01:06:55,561
Yeah, that's strange.

689
01:06:55,731 --> 01:06:58,667
They didn't move out, they just left.

690
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,100
- Go ahead, you should sleep.
- What about you?

691
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,217
I'm finally awake.

692
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,600
Do you think it's safe?

693
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,200
Well, if it wasn't,
we'd know by now.

694
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:09,800
I can't do this right now.

695
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Ok.

696
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,300
We could just hold on.

697
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,700
Better not.

698
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:27,500
The idea of holding each other...

699
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,501
ten minutes into that
and you'll be all over me.

700
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,542
- Hey, get in.
- Where are we going?

701
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:42,773
They've been ID'd. They scammed an
accountant for an address. Long Island.

702
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,467
Ash.

703
01:11:34,344 --> 01:11:36,470
- Shineer.
- Ash?

704
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:42,070
Telly.

705
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:46,413
- Look. It's the guy from the car rental.
- I know.

706
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:50,040
We have to get to the airport,
the one the kids left from.

707
01:11:57,089 --> 01:11:58,716
They're in the house with us.

708
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:01,518
Come on, let's go.

709
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:16,625
It's jammed.

710
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,334
- Meet me at my apartment.
- What are you doing?

711
01:12:39,512 --> 01:12:42,843
One of us has gotta get out of here.
Go. Go on. Go!

712
01:12:50,717 --> 01:12:52,241
Stay here.

713
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,650
Stay inside.

714
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:10,326
Freeze. Right there.
Hands on your head.

715
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,696
I want you on your knees. Now.

716
01:13:14,196 --> 01:13:15,493
I will shoot.

717
01:13:16,164 --> 01:13:17,495
Now.

718
01:13:22,268 --> 01:13:23,928
Halt!

719
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:29,865
Halt!

720
01:13:42,111 --> 01:13:44,271
- Are you Munce?
- Yes, what happened in there?

721
01:13:44,446 --> 01:13:47,141
- Where's Telly?
- Telly left. We gotta get out of here.

722
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:49,509
- What about Pope?
- You wanna help Telly? Drive.

723
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,382
Drive!

724
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:53,373
Come on.

725
01:14:07,591 --> 01:14:10,218
Telly! Telly, wait.

726
01:14:10,393 --> 01:14:13,020
Telly, I'm Anne. Anne Pope.

727
01:14:13,195 --> 01:14:14,491
No, wait. Please listen.

728
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:17,289
I know. I know.

729
01:14:18,564 --> 01:14:21,589
I believe you, Telly.
I believe you about everything.

730
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:25,029
I've seen it.
It's not human. Jesus Christ.

731
01:14:25,201 --> 01:14:27,725
- And the children?
- Yes, everything.

732
01:14:27,903 --> 01:14:32,031
We'll find them. I promise you that.
Do you hear me? We will find them.

733
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:34,638
We will find your son...

734
01:14:54,084 --> 01:14:55,482
Telly?

735
01:15:05,522 --> 01:15:06,819
Ash?

736
01:15:07,657 --> 01:15:09,249
Ash.

737
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:14,686
They took Anne Pope
right in front of me.

738
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:18,456
Munce is downstairs.

739
01:15:18,629 --> 01:15:21,028
- He'll take us to that airport.
- Beautiful view.

740
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:25,925
What have you done with our kids?

741
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:34,536
Ash.

742
01:15:34,705 --> 01:15:36,399
- No, Telly. Stay back!
- Ash.

743
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,335
No!

744
01:15:38,974 --> 01:15:40,201
Ash!

745
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:43,133
No!

746
01:15:43,776 --> 01:15:45,403
Ash!

747
01:15:59,318 --> 01:16:00,580
Telly.

748
01:16:01,953 --> 01:16:03,613
Come with me.

749
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,793
- We have to go to the police.
- No, we have to go to the airport.

750
01:16:17,194 --> 01:16:19,559
Please, Telly. We need help.

751
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,394
Get out.

752
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:36,193
No, I'll take you.

753
01:17:29,232 --> 01:17:33,291
He's one of them.
You have my son. Where is he?

754
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:42,833
You know this is getting
out of control.

755
01:17:43,007 --> 01:17:44,837
It's finished now, end it.

756
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:47,205
Make it right.

757
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:53,103
Where is my son?

758
01:17:58,781 --> 01:18:00,543
It's not over.

759
01:18:12,956 --> 01:18:14,582
You're one of those agents.

760
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,153
No, I'm just...

761
01:18:20,093 --> 01:18:22,424
...one of the few who knows.

762
01:18:23,128 --> 01:18:24,685
So you help them?

763
01:18:24,862 --> 01:18:29,126
They don't need help. They run their
experiments with or without our help.

764
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:33,363
They've been doing it for years.
Maybe forever.

765
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:35,830
And you just let them do
whatever they want.

766
01:18:36,402 --> 01:18:37,891
Let them?

767
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:40,696
I don't have a choice.

768
01:18:40,871 --> 01:18:43,667
We just try to minimize the damage.

769
01:18:43,839 --> 01:18:46,068
I just want my son.

770
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:51,473
Telly, you'll never get Sam back.

771
01:18:52,743 --> 01:18:56,336
You've held on, and they don't
know why. You're just a lab rat to them.

772
01:18:56,512 --> 01:19:00,276
I don't believe that. He said
it's not over. I can still get him back.

773
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:05,010
You know them. Help me.

774
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:11,276
If you go any further,
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

775
01:19:34,999 --> 01:19:36,795
Is my son in here?

776
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,167
You never doubted.

777
01:19:39,702 --> 01:19:41,328
Not for a second, did you?

778
01:19:42,137 --> 01:19:43,569
He's here.

779
01:19:43,837 --> 01:19:46,066
He's now just a memory, Telly.

780
01:20:14,287 --> 01:20:16,254
Can you picture him here?

781
01:20:18,055 --> 01:20:19,544
Now?

782
01:20:31,029 --> 01:20:32,655
Sam!

783
01:20:33,197 --> 01:20:36,290
Honey! Wait!

784
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
He can't hear you.

785
01:21:06,401 --> 01:21:08,401
And he can't see you.

786
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:11,800
Does he remember me?

787
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,800
In his mind,
life is going on as it always has.

788
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,000
He took the plane, right?
He went to camp.

789
01:21:19,001 --> 01:21:21,800
He had a good time.
He came home.

790
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:24,000
Right now,
you're downstairs in the kitchen...

791
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:27,001
making him a snack
before he goes out to play.

792
01:21:27,202 --> 01:21:28,400
Chicken noodle soup.

793
01:21:28,401 --> 01:21:31,401
Why can't you let him go?
He's not an experiment, he's a child.

794
01:21:31,402 --> 01:21:34,802
No, you're right.
He's not the experiment.

795
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,450
You are.

796
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,400
Your connection... mother to child.

797
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:44,300
Like an invisible tissue.
We can even measure its energy.

798
01:21:44,301 --> 01:21:47,700
But we don't fully understand it,
so I posed the question:

799
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:49,701
"Can it be dissolved?"

800
01:21:49,941 --> 01:21:51,200
And it can.

801
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,100
Except for you.

802
01:21:56,359 --> 01:21:58,850
Do you remember
the last time you saw Sam?

803
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,151
Of course I do.
It was right here.

804
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:06,200
It was... it was, it was here at...

805
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,300
What was his favorite sport to play?

806
01:22:14,007 --> 01:22:15,200
Please.

807
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,000
Please don't do this.

808
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:23,300
But there would be no suffering at all,
if only you would forget him.

809
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,600
Who were his best friends
while growing up?

810
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,000
What frightened him most
as a baby, Telly?

811
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,400
What flavor ice cream did he like?

812
01:22:57,502 --> 01:22:59,502
When did he get his first haircut?

813
01:22:59,803 --> 01:23:01,503
What colour were his eyes?

814
01:23:03,504 --> 01:23:05,504
When did he take his first steps?

815
01:23:15,005 --> 01:23:18,000
Can you remember before that?
Can you remember not being a mother?

816
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,480
Telly, stop.

817
01:23:36,213 --> 01:23:37,700
You don't have to die.

818
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,500
What was his name?

819
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,700
Who?

820
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,400
That boy.

821
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,500
Do you know who that boy was?

822
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,900
No.

823
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:22,200
We're done here, Telly.

824
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,981
I had...

825
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,851
life inside of me.

826
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,400
I had life.

827
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,800
I have a child.

828
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,700
I have a child.

829
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,200
I have a son.

830
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,201
His name is...

831
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:25,700
Sam.

832
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,301
Now it's over.

833
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,500
You'll be the only one to remember.

834
01:26:42,084 --> 01:26:43,700
Sam Paretta, do you know him?

835
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

836
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,200
It's not time to go yet, is it?

837
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,300
Mom, I can't breathe.

838
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,701
I'm sorry. I just...

839
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,120
I just wanted you...

840
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,200
to button up.

841
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:42,701
Can I play till 5:30?

842
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

843
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:46,600
Yeah, 5:30's okay.

844
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:48,001
Okay. Thanks.

845
01:27:48,402 --> 01:27:49,402
See you.

846
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,403
See you.

847
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:48,370
Hi.

848
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Hi.

849
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
I guess they...

850
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,200
- They don't want parents around.
- No.

851
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,600
That's ok, though.

852
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:09,300
You keep watching him.

853
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,101
It's hard not to.

854
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,400
They're okay.

855
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,300
I know.

856
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,301
I'm Telly.

857
01:29:26,002 --> 01:29:27,100
Sam's mom.

858
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,500
I'm Ash.

859
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:31,600
I think we met before.
