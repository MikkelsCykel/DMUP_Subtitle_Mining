00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:06,305
That's the pawn shop my friend
from the OC told me about.

2
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:10,173
It's surrounded by the Feds.
They're watching these Russians.

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,007
There he is.

4
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,749
- Oh, yeah.
- His name's Roman Bulkin.

5
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:19,246
What are you doin'?

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,915
Are you crazy?
They know what you look like.

7
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:23,357
What are you gonna tell 'em?

8
00:00:23,427 --> 00:00:26,055
No more than I have to, if that.

9
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:34,295
<i>- One twenty-two. George.
- That's 4-8-8 Sunset.</i>

10
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,895
<i>Subject's approaching
northwest corner.</i>

11
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,244
You've got a lot of balls.

12
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,217
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

13
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,816
There's half a dozen
undercover cops outside.

14
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,122
Don't give 'em a reason to come in.

15
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:59,787
<i>Nyet!</i>

16
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:03,494
Now, did you take this picture?

17
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,096
Go to hell, you greasy wop
son of a bitch.

18
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:10,936
Now you're the one
that's gonna need protection.

19
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:18,675
You go now.

20
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:23,380
Is that chest hair real?

21
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,626
Roman, look at me.

22
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:39,200
The next time you send someone over
to kill me, make sure I'm home.

23
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:40,759
Have a nice day.

24
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:54,948
Yes!

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,058
Like that?

26
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:25,908
Scorchin'!

27
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,478
Mr. Palmer.

28
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:31,953
- How are you doin', Marla?
- All right.

29
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,679
- You got a second?
- Sure.

30
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,588
So, what are you
doing here, Mr. Palmer?

31
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,253
Well, you know, when I was a kid,
I went to a Jimi Hendrix concert

32
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:41,354
and this pawn shop here
has got a '68 Stratocaster,

33
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:43,161
the same guitar he used to play.

34
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:44,996
And the guy won't sell it to me.

35
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,832
This guy look familiar to you?

36
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:49,372
Maybe from back
in your Brooklyn days?

37
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:53,869
Yeah. That's Joe Lupino.

38
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:56,242
Joe Loop.
Is that his head shot?

39
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:59,009
Couple's in Griffith Park last night,
two dudes pulled in,

40
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,744
one of them's wearing
one of those pimp hats,

41
00:03:00,818 --> 00:03:04,618
they pop the trunk, toss out a body
that's been worked over by a baseball bat.

42
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:05,780
It's Joe Loop.

43
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,619
- Baseball bat, huh?
- Baseball bat.

44
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,090
Yeah, and they pulled
a Mama Cass on him, too.

45
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,492
The coroner found half a ham sandwich
stuffed down his throat.

46
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,589
You wouldn't happen to know
what Joe was up to, now, would you?

47
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,931
No, but I wouldn't be surprised
if he was in the record business.

48
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,697
Think it coulda been a mob hit?

49
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,934
Maybe. Except for the ham sandwich.

50
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,771
There he is.
Right there.

51
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,506
See the two seats next to him?
That's where we are. Come on.

52
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,016
Chil. Do you think Steven's
gonna remember me?

53
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:10,986
Edie, believe me,
you're hard to forget. Come on.

54
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:25,562
- Edie, over there.
- Got it.

55
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,327
- How'd you get these seats?
- I have a friend.

56
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,058
They're incredible.

57
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,192
<i>Your attention. Please.</i>

58
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,326
<i>At the conclusion
of tonight's game.</i>

59
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:02,099
<i>Listen for the Laker wrap-up show
on your Laker flag...</i>

60
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,677
Oh, my God!
Look at you!

61
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:11,008
Baby, you look gorgeous.

62
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,275
Oh, my God!

63
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:13,611
You look incredible!

64
00:05:13,684 --> 00:05:15,845
- How are you?
- I'm great!

65
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,352
Well, look at you.

66
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:19,821
Look how those legs go up
and make an ass out of themselves.

67
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,381
You still got that Aerosmith tattoo
on your ass?

68
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:23,585
Where would it go?

69
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,486
It's working.

70
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:28,395
Well, I tell you what,
why don't you park that right there?

71
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:41,809
Tell me something.
What was that stuff you put in our clothes?

72
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,505
Do you mean the lavender water?

73
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,047
Yeah, the lavender water.

74
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,540
- I can't believe you...
- I'll never forget that smell.

75
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:49,586
Joe Perry's still talking about that.

76
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,120
Oh, my God!

77
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:53,053
Steven, I want you to meet
my very good friend.

78
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:54,818
It's an absolute honor to meet you.

79
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,483
The shylock.

80
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,584
Yeah.

81
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,891
<i>I saw you on Larry King.
It was you and...</i>

82
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:02,158
- Ariel Sharon.
- That was a hell of a show.

83
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:04,200
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,902
Robert, listen to me.
There's no problem.

85
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,674
No one's left the Chicks.
We're gonna play the gig, bro.

86
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,539
<i>Ciao.</i>

87
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,111
Linda's gonna play the gig?

88
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:23,675
What do you think?

89
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:27,584
Where the hell is Joe Loop?

90
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:28,955
I haven't seen him.

91
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,584
Not since I paid him.

92
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,955
Gave him what he had coming.

93
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:35,996
Christ.

94
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:38,159
I'm bangin' the phones
from dawn till dusk.

95
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:40,863
Bobby finally wants the Chicks
to play Last Samurai,

96
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,302
but we don't have Linda.

97
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:43,634
I feel you, man.

98
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,868
- My man.
- My man.

99
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:50,037
You guys will never guess
who I saw today.

100
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:52,641
Chili Palmer.

101
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:54,773
<i>Has anyone not seen him?</i>

102
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:56,409
I'm at the Boot Barn on Sunset,

103
00:06:56,486 --> 00:06:59,216
and I see him talking to this cop
in a Crown Vic.

104
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,847
You guys remember the pawn shop
by the bakery?

105
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:03,153
Yeah, I know that place.

106
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:04,716
Stolichnaya?

107
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,228
It's thick with Russians.

108
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:10,858
Well, one of 'em walks out,
points his fingers like a gun at Chili.

109
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:13,735
Jesus Christ.

110
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:16,535
The guy in Chili's house,
the dead guy?

111
00:07:17,507 --> 00:07:19,202
I read in the paper he was Russian.

112
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,699
So?

113
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:24,076
So these Russians are probably
the ones that killed Tommy Athens.

114
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:26,741
And they know Chili can identify 'em.

115
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,084
Why you trippin', man?

116
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:32,519
Why am I trippin'?

117
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:36,485
I'm trippin', G,
'cause there is actually

118
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,792
someone who wants
Chili Palmer dead more than me.

119
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:43,798
I say we help him get what he wants.

120
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:46,162
Bam!

121
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:51,401
<i>'M a believer</i>

Damn, she's good!

125
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,981
She sings, she writes her own stuff.

126
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:04,452
She got it going on.

127
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,988
Not only does she write
her own stuff,

128
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:07,683
I mean, she's got the voice,
she's got the look.

129
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:08,782
This girl's the whole package.

130
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:10,156
She wanted me to put her
in a movie.

131
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:12,923
- You know, struggling singer...
- That makes it big.

132
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,463
Exactly.

133
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:18,525
Look, she sounds cool,
don't get me wrong,

134
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:20,331
but I gotta tell you guys,

135
00:08:20,404 --> 00:08:23,305
I'm not one of those singers
who shows up in movies.

136
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:25,273
I made it this far
without having to do it.

137
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,742
No, Steven. We don't want you to be
in a movie with her.

138
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,142
Then what's this all about?

139
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,113
I know that look, Chili.
I mean, what are you thinkin'?

140
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:40,156
I'm thinkin' of a song.
One of yours, Steven.

141
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:41,485
<i>Sweet Emotion.</i>

142
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:45,725
<i>Sweet Emotion.
I love that song.</i>

143
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,128
I mean, it's a classic.

144
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:49,792
Do you mind my asking you,

145
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,096
what were you thinking
when you wrote that?

146
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,932
What was I thinking about?

147
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:58,266
Man, at that point in my life, Chil,

148
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:00,969
<i>we were neck deep
in Toys in the Attic.</i>

149
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:03,740
I mean, I had this high.

150
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:06,647
This buzz was going on, see?

151
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,947
This incredible emotion
like I never felt before.

152
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,984
Or maybe it was just the rock 'n' roll.

153
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:15,156
That is interesting.

154
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,654
Would you like to know what I think?

155
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:21,687
I don't think it was the rock 'n' roll.

156
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,824
I think it was your daughters.

157
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,924
My daughters?

158
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,093
Mia, Liv.

159
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:29,468
Nah. They were babies back then.

160
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,528
That's right.

161
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:34,907
And you were a father for the first time,
feeling things you had never felt before.

162
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,307
It's different than music and tours.

163
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,677
This was pure.

164
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:41,410
You wanted to be with them,
you wanted to protect them.

165
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:44,545
No. This high you were feeling,
that wasn't rock 'n' roll.

166
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,854
It wasn't?

167
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:49,858
It was the love you felt for your girls.

168
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,394
That sweet emotion.

169
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:01,636
It was. You're right.

170
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,433
I never thought about it like that.

171
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,034
You see, Steven, you and me,
we're not that different from each other.

172
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:11,547
That's why you can understand
why we care about this girl Linda Moon.

173
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,775
I'll give it some thought.

174
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,446
Yes!

175
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:21,588
You know what else...

176
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:26,993
I can't believe Linda's gonna play
with Aerosmith.

177
00:10:27,063 --> 00:10:28,155
How about this idea?

178
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:31,928
We get Linda to do a duet with Steven
and use his name to promote her CD.

179
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:34,994
Oh, my God,
that's genius, Chil.

180
00:10:38,074 --> 00:10:40,838
You know, there's something
I've been wanting to do for a long time.

181
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:42,572
Yeah? What is that?

182
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,346
Don't move.

183
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,145
Did you put the TV on?

184
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,412
No.

185
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:53,513
I didn't think so.
Stay here.

186
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:57,854
<i>He took a second look at you</i>

187
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:00,055
<i>But he's in love with me</i>

188
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,832
<i>Well. don't know
where that leaves you</i>

189
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,926
<i>Oh. But know where stand</i>

190
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:11,599
<i>'Cause you ain't woman enough
to take my man</i>

191
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:19,008
Elliot, what are you doing?

192
00:11:19,683 --> 00:11:21,674
I've been waiting
on your ass all night.

193
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:25,278
Got so goddamn bored,
I made some tea, I put in my video.

194
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:26,447
You broke into my house?

195
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:27,820
You told me you were gonna call me.

196
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:29,791
I left you a message two days ago.

197
00:11:29,859 --> 00:11:33,192
Elliot, I said I would
get you the audition, and I will.

198
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,731
When? When?!
What the hell are you waiting for?

199
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,929
If you don't mind my saying,
I don't like your attitude one bit.

200
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:46,841
Now apologize.

201
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,276
I'm sorry, Chili.

202
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:56,717
All right.

203
00:11:56,786 --> 00:12:02,782
It's... I bought a brand-new suit,
I bought new shiny red boots,

204
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:05,726
I got my new headshots done.

205
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,621
<i>I even prepared a monologue
from Bring t On.</i>

206
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,494
Well, then do it.

207
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,871
<i>Well. don't know
where that leaves you</i>

208
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:18,874
<i>Oh. But know where stand</i>

209
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,409
<i>said...</i>

210
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:36,148
You guys have to go to nationals!

211
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:40,157
What is this, hush money?
We don't need you.

212
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,697
Why are you so mean?

213
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,697
I'm just trying to be strong
for my squad.

214
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:47,099
And I'm trying to make it right.

215
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,694
You wanna make it right?

216
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:50,433
Then when you go to nationals...

217
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,668
...bring it!

218
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,713
I'll bring it!
Don't worry.

219
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:03,218
I never do.

220
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,285
Scene.

221
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:17,760
Is that the only monologue
that you got?

222
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,296
- Yeah.
- Okay.

223
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:22,633
Well, that wasn't bad,

224
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:25,072
but you gotta remember,
when you're doing a monologue,

225
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,371
you don't do both parts
of the conversation.

226
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:29,912
You choose one continuous speech.

227
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:33,642
And you might think about
doing a part that's written for a man.

228
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,409
Right.

229
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,010
Now, you sing, right?

230
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:40,046
Yeah.

231
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:43,251
- Raji directed the video, though.
- Well, I like it, I like it.

232
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:46,955
But you might think
about singing a man song.

233
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,357
Okay.

234
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,098
Yeah. Thanks.

235
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:56,638
- Thanks. Thank you.
- All right.

236
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:58,196
Come on,
give me that eyebrow thing.

237
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:05,912
Look at that.

238
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,113
I mean, that's somethin'.

239
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,257
When are you gonna call me?

240
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:16,587
When your phone rings.

241
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,554
Okay. All right.

242
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:22,155
You guys can keep the tape.

243
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:24,528
I got another one.

244
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:25,966
- Thank you.
- All right.

245
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,559
- Thank you.
- See you, Elliot.

246
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,272
Red aluminium.

247
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:14,075
I hear we can help each other.

248
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,611
So I've got ten seconds alone
with Madonna, right,

249
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,656
and I'm like, "Look, I sat front row
at Blonde Ambition tour.

250
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:21,781
I am not intimidated
by your sexuality... "

251
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:22,847
What's up?

252
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,855
- We heard about Aerosmith.
- How about that?

253
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,487
Where the hell was I, you guys?
I mean...

254
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:29,532
- Where's Linda?
- I don't know, man.

255
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,965
Linda hasn't shown up.
I haven't seen her since yesterday.

256
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,798
What do you mean
she hasn't shown up?

257
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,030
I'll call her.

258
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:37,564
Linda.

259
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,267
<i>Do sound like Linda. Bitch?</i>

260
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:40,400
Who is that?

261
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,842
Yo, Vanilla Ice, just put her
on the damn phone.

262
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,880
<i>Miss Moon's about ready
to go on stage right now.</i>

263
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:47,382
<i>You wanna talk to her.
You best wait till after the show.</i>

264
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,077
<i>Bee-yatch!</i>

265
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,617
What are we gonna do?
They're making her perform.

266
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,317
I'll handle this.

267
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,527
Itchi gitchy ya-ya da-da

268
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:08,332
Mocha-choca-latta ya-ya

269
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:14,739
Creole Lady Marmalade

270
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:18,542
<i>Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
ce soir?</i>

271
00:16:18,615 --> 00:16:21,675
<i>Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?</i>

272
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,747
We come through with the money
and the garter belts

273
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,652
Let 'em know we 'bout that cake,
straight out the gate

274
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:28,657
We independent women,
some mistake us for whores

275
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:30,590
I'm sayin', why spend mine
when I can spend yours

276
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,754
Disagree? Well, that's you,
and I'm sorry, I'ma keep playin'...

277
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,957
This ain't no damn negotiation.
We got a contract.

278
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:37,397
You're making a mistake here,
believe it.

279
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,765
You want your money, you better
get your ass out there on stage.

280
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,531
I ain't doing this.
You gonna perform or not?

281
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:42,696
How about not?

282
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:43,830
Hi, honey.

283
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,734
Hiya, Chil.

284
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,605
We were just talking
to your friend Linda here

285
00:16:47,677 --> 00:16:51,545
about the kind of Spice Girl cash
she can make if she stays with the Chicks.

286
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:53,514
Well, I can see
by the dressing room

287
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:56,643
that it's just a preview
of good things yet to come.

288
00:16:57,253 --> 00:16:59,346
At least we can afford to record her.

289
00:17:00,023 --> 00:17:02,457
Don't think I don't know
that NTL is broke.

290
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,958
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

291
00:17:04,027 --> 00:17:05,790
You know what?
This is bullshit.

292
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:08,729
You wanna go?
After all I did for you?

293
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,063
Fine. But let me tell you
something, sweetheart.

294
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:15,036
- You're a dime a dozen.
- That's right.

295
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:17,868
We got gigs lined up,
recording sessions scheduled.

296
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:21,377
There are dozens of girls
who are dying to take your place.

297
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:24,743
Here. You want her so bad,
you're gonna need this.

298
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,213
What is this?

299
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:30,685
It's where Linda's contract is.

300
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,252
Are you trying to set me up, Nicky?

301
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:34,847
I don't go by that name anymore.

302
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,687
Then why don't I call you Joe Loop?

303
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,557
Seeing how he doesn't
use his name anymore, either.

304
00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:40,823
What are you talking about?

305
00:17:40,897 --> 00:17:42,023
Nicky, look at me.

306
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:43,861
Do you even know
where Joe Loop is?

307
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,833
How the hell do I know where he is?

308
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,665
Why don't you ask Sisqó?

309
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:51,197
Man, we can handle this shit
like gentlemen,

310
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,674
or we can get into some gangsta shit!

311
00:17:53,743 --> 00:17:56,109
You shouldn't talk shit
about what you don't know.

312
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:58,875
What? Do you mean
that you beat Joe Loop with a bat

313
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:00,848
and dumped his body in Griffith Park?

314
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:03,181
Raj, what the hell is he talking about?

315
00:18:03,252 --> 00:18:04,241
He's just talkin'.

316
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,185
It's impossible
that you're this stupid.

317
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:09,281
That's probably his gun
you got stuck in your waist there.

318
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:12,454
Look, all I know is
Raji told me to come here

319
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:15,122
if I wanted my money
for the Viper Room gigs.

320
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:16,859
,

321
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,195
Am I gonna pay you or not?

322
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:20,963
Are you gonna honor
your goddamn contract or not?!

323
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:22,197
Then you get paid!

324
00:18:22,271 --> 00:18:23,898
This man can't do shit for you!

325
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,065
Oh, yeah?

326
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:27,507
Then why is she playing
with Aerosmith this weekend?

327
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:28,908
What?

328
00:18:28,978 --> 00:18:31,003
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

329
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,571
We'll leave some tickets for you
at will call.

330
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:38,215
- You didn't tell me!
- Yeah!

331
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,023
You hit the goddamn hit man.

332
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,090
The man was bad at his job, man!

333
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,363
Yeah. Just like you, stupid-ass.

334
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,974
- Look, you know what?
- What?

335
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:01,977
- I'm so sorry, Chil, for real.
- Why is that?

336
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,945
Because I didn't even
wanna come here.

337
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:06,675
Raji said he was gonna pay me
the money he owes me,

338
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:08,080
and I'm broke, so...

339
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:10,711
Look, at least we can
get my contract back.

340
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:12,914
Believe me, honey,
there is no contract.

341
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:14,684
This whole pawn shop thing's
a set-up.

342
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,726
It's Nicky Carr's way
of getting my head blown off.

343
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:19,591
What's this?

344
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:30,267
Well, now imagine my surprise.

345
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,671
We out getting Mongolian barbecue,

346
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:36,439
and we come across
your little weak-ass ride.

347
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,571
Did you leave any food in Mongolia?

348
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:44,652
What do you get on those Hummers,
about, what, 12 miles to the gallon?

349
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,812
Nine.

350
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,989
Thank you, Mr. Goodwrench.

351
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:55,830
Now, I told you you had till Friday.

352
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:57,627
Your time is running out.

353
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,793
I know how
the days-of-the-week thing works.

354
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:00,961
You'll get your money.

355
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:03,164
Well, consider this a courtesy call.

356
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:07,801
Because come tomorrow,
my nine gonna be a lot less courteous.

357
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:11,108
Since you are being so courteous,
I'd like you to meet Linda Moon.

358
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,340
Linda, this is Sin.

359
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,541
And Dabu.

360
00:20:15,251 --> 00:20:18,379
Yeah, I know who you are.

361
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:22,049
You did the remix
on Samurai Soul's album, right?

362
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,286
Linda Moon.
You the girl with...

363
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:33,662
Could you make your dining experience
a little less obtrusive?

364
00:20:33,736 --> 00:20:37,194
So, you the girl with that big voice
I've been hearing so much about.

365
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,103
If you ever decide
to get out the bargain basement,

366
00:20:41,177 --> 00:20:43,737
maybe I can remix a song for you.

367
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:46,179
No. You're too pricey for us, Sin.

368
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:48,912
A brother gotta get paid, right?

369
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:52,619
Miss Moon.

370
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,286
Chop, chop.

371
00:20:58,361 --> 00:20:59,419
Yeah.

372
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:00,653
Dabu.

373
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,095
Player.

374
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:14,200
Damn.

375
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:16,370
Can you stop playing with that thing?

376
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:17,878
You ain't gonna figure out
your two-way, Elliot.

377
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:19,005
Why don't you take a break

378
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,446
and daydream about things
that you like, man?

379
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:24,282
Like, you know, flying on a unicorn
with chocolate-covered cherries raining.

380
00:21:24,353 --> 00:21:26,685
I'm not the one
who disrespected you, Raji.

381
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,223
Nick did.

382
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,724
Not me. Nick.

383
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:32,920
Man, Nick ain't even my boss.
How's he gonna do me like that?

384
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:36,192
We're supposed to be partners.
Damn.

385
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:39,359
Raji, Nick left a message for you.

386
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:43,997
If you go near Linda, he'll see
that you suffer excruciating pain

387
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,836
and never walk again in your life.

388
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,376
In other words, he'll break your legs.

389
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:51,208
Why's he gotta say it
all poetic like that?

390
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,646
Why can't he just say
"I'm gonna break your legs," man?

391
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:56,207
Nice ass won't get you
through your whole life!

392
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:58,981
When you turn 30,
you better have a personality.

393
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,691
You don't need him anymore, Raj.

394
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,020
I say it's time you took Nick out.

395
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,591
What about Chili Palmer, genius?

396
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,864
Man, you can't even work your pager,
you sittin' there schemin'.

397
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:16,905
You'll get to Chili in good time.
Don't worry about Chili.

398
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:18,065
Nick's the problem.

399
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,267
Man, if I take Nicky out,
all roads lead to me, Elliot.

400
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:21,674
You don't think about shit, man.

401
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:23,507
Not if it ain't you who does it.

402
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,243
I'm talking about a set-up, bro.

403
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:37,884
Hello.

404
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,428
<i>- Sin LaSalle?
- Yeah. Who wants to know?</i>

405
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:43,056
<i>Shut your punk-ass mouth!</i>

406
00:22:43,132 --> 00:22:45,930
<i>NTL owes you 300 large. Right?</i>

407
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:48,470
Chili Palmer was gonna pay you,

408
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,768
but Nick Carr says, "Sin LaSalle?

409
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:55,277
Man, I wouldn't give my money
to that Alabama porch monkey. "

410
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:57,608
Alabama porch mo...
Nick Carr said that?

411
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,238
<i>Man. You heard me. Fool!</i>

412
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:01,306
He told Chili to give him
the 300 grand instead,

413
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:04,717
in exchange for some contract
and whatnot.

414
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:06,584
Look, man, you want your chips?

415
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,521
Do you want your chips?

416
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:10,491
Then you best see Nick Carr.

417
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,757
C-A-R.

418
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,354
If I want my chips?
Yeah, I want my chips.

419
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:17,421
Who is this?

420
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,559
I'm the one schoolin' you, son.

421
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,465
That is beautiful.
You did it.

422
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,941
Man, let's get some Roscoe's
up in this bitch.

423
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,570
You want some chicken breast?
Some collards?

424
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:31,874
Some yams?

425
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:34,575
Some waffles, man?
Extra syrup.

426
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,776
I love Roscoe's.

427
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:38,342
You know, I never told you this.
You know what I love about Roscoe's?

428
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:41,754
I could take one drumstick
and put it in my mouth

429
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,385
and suck all the meat off it at one time
and then just pull out that bone.

430
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:48,294
Don't be puttin' your sucked-on drumstick
with my chicken breast.

431
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:50,525
You better keep that shit...
I'm serious, man.

432
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,896
You better keep that shit separate.

433
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,162
The only thing wet on that shit
better be the syrup.

434
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,076
What's up?
It's Raji.

435
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,646
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.

436
00:24:08,718 --> 00:24:10,151
- How you doin'?
- Good.

437
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:11,584
Yeah.

438
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:13,918
- School was good?
- Yeah.

439
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:15,718
You had a good day at school?

440
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:18,487
You know what,
we gonna skip ice cream today.

441
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:20,791
Let's drop her off real quick.

442
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:21,921
Yeah.

443
00:24:25,134 --> 00:24:29,298
Detective, my husband was
an amazing man.

444
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:30,771
Please.

445
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:38,912
But he didn't leave NTL
in the best financial position.

446
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:41,347
Well, we spoke
with his assistant Tiffany,

447
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:46,548
and she told us about an incident
involving an insurance salesman?

448
00:24:46,622 --> 00:24:47,919
Yes.

449
00:24:50,593 --> 00:24:51,753
Are you okay?

450
00:24:51,827 --> 00:24:53,761
Yeah. Fine.

451
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,091
Mrs. Athens.

452
00:24:55,164 --> 00:24:56,791
Please, call me Edie.

453
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:59,699
Well, Edie, we have reason to believe

454
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:02,567
that this gentleman
was not an insurance salesman at all.

455
00:25:02,638 --> 00:25:04,731
Really?
I don't understand.

456
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:08,208
Do you think it's possible
that your husband was involved with the...

457
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:11,444
...the Russian mafia?

458
00:25:12,248 --> 00:25:13,909
The Russian mafia?

459
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:17,282
I mean, not that I know of, but...

460
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:19,514
I did find something.

461
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:25,057
Maybe this will help.
I found it in Tommy's desk drawer.

462
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:32,256
"Nick Carr. "
It's a pawn ticket.

463
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:34,234
Pawn ticket.

464
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,836
I wanna pick this up.

465
00:25:45,414 --> 00:25:47,848
Get your black ass out of here.

466
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:54,486
You know what you tell a man
with two black eyes?

467
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:56,113
Nothin'.

468
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:58,592
He's already been told twice.

469
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:02,162
Now, are you gonna
get me what I came for

470
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:04,825
or are we gonna have a problem?

471
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,366
<i>Da.</i>

472
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,642
- An envelope?
- That's it.

473
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:17,407
They bought it.
You're up.

474
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:32,150
How much can I get for this?

475
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:41,896
And don't worry, your hair looks fine.

476
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,233
Damn! I'm walkin', man!
I'm walkin'!

477
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,902
Have you lost your...

478
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,241
Sit yo' ass down.

479
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:52,337
I'm fine, I'm fine!

480
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:53,904
Hang up the phone, Nick.

481
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:55,075
Stop it! Shit, man.

482
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,617
Good-bye, Marty.

483
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:01,716
Sin, good to see you, bro.

484
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,882
Sit yo' ass down.

485
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,323
Sin, I can explain it to you.

486
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,088
You best hope you didn't lie to us.

487
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:07,321
I'm just sayin'
if I could explain what happened,

488
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:09,193
we could maybe get
on the same page here.

489
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:10,289
You know what I'm sayin'?

490
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,766
Jesus Christ.
What the hell's going on?

491
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:14,735
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Shut yo' ass up!

492
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:17,271
Your man here says
you got our money.

493
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:19,204
I can explain it to you.

494
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,910
- Raji said that?
- It's a misunderstanding.

495
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:24,275
Would you shut it up?!

496
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:25,370
...excited here, man.

497
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:28,075
Let me tell you something.
NTL owes us 300 grand.

498
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,084
Now, from my understanding,

499
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:33,747
Chili Palmer took that money,
gave it to you for some contract.

500
00:27:33,822 --> 00:27:35,722
Raji said that?
He's full of shit.

501
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,487
Watch what you say,
'cause we will drop his ass.

502
00:27:38,561 --> 00:27:39,721
Take him outside.

503
00:27:39,795 --> 00:27:42,229
Fine.
Come on, man, easy!

504
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:44,425
Don't land on my Porsche.

505
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:52,031
Man!
This ain't cool, man!

506
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,904
Come on, man.
Pull me up, man!

507
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,375
You can't hang me like this!

508
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:57,844
Stop this shit, man!
It's a long way, man!

509
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:59,505
Come on, man.
Pull me up, man!

510
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:02,551
Come on.
There's cameras all over this bitch, man.

511
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:04,108
You're gonna be
all over the surveillance, man.

512
00:28:04,186 --> 00:28:05,414
I'm asking you, please!

513
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,182
Help! Help!

514
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:09,952
Stop playin', man!
Stop bullshittin', man!

515
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:12,550
Man, there's a law office
down there, man!

516
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:14,721
I'ma wake the lawyers up.
Lawyers, what's up?

517
00:28:14,797 --> 00:28:16,458
Lawyers, can you see me?

518
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:18,591
It's Raji from Carosell.

519
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:22,728
C-A-R-O...

520
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:24,602
I'm gonna drop yo' ass.

521
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:26,163
You can't hit me, man.

522
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,608
You can't hang me over a thing
and hit me!

523
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,009
Pull my ass up!

524
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:35,443
Sin, my bro.

525
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:38,077
Would you cut the "my brother" shit?
You're insulting my mother.

526
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:41,611
I'm not in business with Chili Palmer.
I'm the one trying to get him out.

527
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,817
The piece of shit stole my act.

528
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:46,326
You son of a bitch.

529
00:28:46,395 --> 00:28:47,953
You set me up.

530
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,089
Who the hell are you?

531
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,133
I give you ticket,

532
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:56,535
and you tell me Chili Palmer come
to my store and I kill him.

533
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:59,938
<i>But nyet.
No Chili come.</i>

534
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:02,307
Yo, Tolstoy.
Take a number.

535
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:05,142
The cops come with ticket.

536
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:06,238
Cops? What cops?

537
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:07,543
Excuse me, Vladimir?

538
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:11,609
I don't know how they do it in the Ukraine,
but I believe I was here first.

539
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:13,621
Be cool, nigger.

540
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,685
Nigger?

541
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,095
Look, you don't understand.

542
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:25,258
This is how Chili Palmer operates.

543
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:26,392
It's like a game between us.

544
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:29,596
He knows I tried to set him up,
so he did it right back to me.

545
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:31,970
Then game is over.

546
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,906
No more set-ups.

547
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:36,706
- No more...
- You know that video's got you!

548
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,973
Nigger cops.

549
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,708
Have you lost your mind?

550
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:43,980
I mean, how is it that you can
disrespect a man's ethnicity

551
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:47,784
when you know we've influenced
nearly every facet of white America,

552
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:50,484
from our music to our style of dress,

553
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,962
not to mention your basic imitation
of our sense of cool...

554
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,227
walk, talk, dress, mannerisms.

555
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,461
We enrich your very existence,

556
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:03,630
all the while contributing
to the gross national product

557
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:06,072
through our achievements
in corporate America.

558
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:07,802
It's these conceits that comfort me

559
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:12,677
when I'm faced with the ignorant,
cowardly, bitter and bigoted

560
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:15,876
who have no talent, no guts,

561
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:19,512
people like you who desecrate
things they don't understand

562
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:23,786
when the truth is
you should say, "Thank you, man,"

563
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,884
and go on about your way.

564
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:29,158
But apparently,
you're incapable of doing that.

565
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:30,562
So...

566
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:37,700
,

567
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:40,173
And don't tell me to be cool.

568
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,039
I am cool!

569
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:47,980
Racial epithets.

570
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,678
Why does it always come down to that?

571
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:53,017
Makes me sad for my daughter.

572
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,716
You need money?
I got you!

573
00:30:56,425 --> 00:30:57,722
I got you.

574
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:01,822
Focus.

575
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:06,491
Sin, I'm the one who promoted you.

576
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:09,059
I'm the reason
you're even owed 300 grand.

577
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:12,630
I'm telling you, you want Chili Palmer.

578
00:31:13,442 --> 00:31:15,410
Pull my ass up!

579
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:17,468
Bring his ass back inside.

580
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:26,983
All right, I want y'all to give it up

581
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:30,855
and lay it down
for a good friend of mine... Linda Moon!

582
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:54,281
There was a time
when I was so broken-hearted

583
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:59,082
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine

584
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:03,719
The tables are turned, yeah

585
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:07,228
'Cause me and them ways have parted

586
00:32:07,296 --> 00:32:12,791
But that kind of love
was the killing kind

587
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:14,028
Yeah

588
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:20,200
All I want is someone
I can't resist, yeah

589
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:25,975
I know all I need to know
by the way that you kiss

590
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:29,347
I was cryin' when I met you

591
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:33,582
Now I'm tryin' to forget you

592
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:38,616
Your love was sweet misery

593
00:32:39,494 --> 00:32:42,520
I was tryin' just to get you

594
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:46,625
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you

595
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:51,899
Do what you do down on me

596
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:53,032
Baby

597
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:09,756
'Cause what you got inside

598
00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:13,625
It ain't where your love
should stay, yeah

599
00:33:13,695 --> 00:33:19,531
Our love, sweet love, ain't love
till you give your heart away

600
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:23,002
Yeah

601
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:26,097
I was cryin' when I met you

602
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:30,634
Now I'm tryin' to forget you

603
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:34,978
Your love was sweet misery

604
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,142
Baby

605
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:39,585
I was tryin' just to get you

606
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:44,558
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you

607
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:47,254
Do what you do down on

608
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,388
Baby, baby, baby

609
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,432
Baby, baby

610
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,201
She's a diva.

611
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,212
Told you.
She's gonna be huge.

612
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,284
Ain't that right, Joe Perry?

613
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:23,160
Baby, yeah

614
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:26,257
I was cryin' just to get you

615
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:30,931
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you

616
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,941
Do what you do,
what you do down on

617
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:37,308
Baby, baby, baby, baby

618
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,609
Baby, baby

619
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,713
Yeah

620
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:49,646
Linda Moon!

621
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:51,750
- Linda Moon!
- That's right.

622
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:02,497
Give it up, L.A.!
I said Linda Moon!

623
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:04,402
You expect me to follow that?

624
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:07,874
That was incredible.
I feel like I can't even breathe right now.

625
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:10,639
Well, 20,000 people will do that to you.

626
00:35:10,712 --> 00:35:12,043
Oh, my God.

627
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:13,945
Listen, you were great.
Good luck.

628
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:16,576
And you know, the crowd's
only gonna get bigger for you.

629
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,312
- Thank you.
- See ya.

630
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:22,653
Linda Moon!
Careful what you wish for.

631
00:35:24,326 --> 00:35:25,987
What about our girl, huh?

632
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:28,461
- She was amazing!
- Amazing.

633
00:35:29,865 --> 00:35:31,799
- To Linda Moon.
- To Linda Moon.

634
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:33,300
To you.

635
00:35:34,636 --> 00:35:37,901
You know, you said something
when Elliot was here,

636
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,838
that you wanted to do something.

637
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,068
What was that?

638
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,387
I think it might've been
something like this.

639
00:35:59,127 --> 00:36:02,153
Are you just using me
to get into the music business?

640
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,199
Edie, I like you.

641
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:07,928
Good.

642
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:43,901
Wake up.

643
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,537
- What is it?
- Listen!

644
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:47,700
What's wrong?

645
00:36:48,977 --> 00:36:51,377
I didn't leave the stereo on.

646
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:55,348
<i>It sounds like
Knockin' On Heaven's Door.</i>

647
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:58,848
All right, I'll check it out,
I'll check it out.

648
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,223
Evening, gentlemen.

649
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:16,567
Interesting choice of music.

650
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:22,877
That cold black cloud's comin' down.

651
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:25,407
Gotta love Dylan, man.

652
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,846
<i>Biograph. It's a great album.</i>

653
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,407
You know, we wouldn't have
this song without it.

654
00:37:30,485 --> 00:37:31,850
But we would've.

655
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,151
Because, you see, Dylan wrote that
originally for that Peckinpah movie

656
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:36,713
with James Coburn.

657
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:39,858
You're in no position to correct me.

658
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:48,361
<i>It was to a soundtrack.
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.</i>

659
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:52,429
Yup. Same song they played
when Slim Pickens died in his wife's arms.

660
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:53,735
Right?

661
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:55,867
This man knows his westerns.

662
00:37:57,946 --> 00:37:59,379
Good movie.

663
00:38:00,749 --> 00:38:06,119
Gentlemen, thank you very much
for that VH1 moment in music history.

664
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:11,221
Time's up.
I want my money.

665
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:13,420
All right, well, tomorrow
you come by the office

666
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:14,655
and we'll deal with it.

667
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:17,961
How bad you want this?

668
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:19,861
Know what that is?

669
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,562
It's Linda Moon's contract.

670
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,503
- Nick Carr give you that?
- Much to his dismay.

671
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:27,337
,

672
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,536
I just doubled it.

673
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:32,307
And you got one minute
to come up with my money.

674
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,075
And at the end of that time,

675
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:37,141
I wanna smell money or smell blood.

676
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:38,982
It's your choice.

677
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:42,921
Sin, I want you to hear something.

678
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:44,390
I don't wanna hear shit.

679
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,394
You call that a minute?

680
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:49,623
You don't even have to say nothin'.

681
00:38:49,698 --> 00:38:51,996
I already know. I know.

682
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:56,094
I can't help it, man!

683
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:58,571
Don't give me no gun, then.

684
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,767
You know what I'm gonna do.

685
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,544
Look, Sin, you're a music producer.
You gotta hear this.

686
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:07,912
Look, shoot me later,
but hear this now.

687
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:15,652
<i>Like you've been left alone.
But you know deep down you're wrong</i>

688
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:21,128
<i>wonder. Have you ever. Ever felt
a little unsure</i>

689
00:39:21,196 --> 00:39:23,460
<i>But then again secure?</i>

690
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:27,968
<i>Tell me. Have you ever felt
just like letting go?</i>

691
00:39:28,036 --> 00:39:29,765
What the hell is going on here?

692
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:31,999
<i>Ain't no reason...</i>

693
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:33,563
I'm playing Sin the CD.

694
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:36,805
Yeah. I noticed.

695
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:39,239
Sorry to wake you, Edie.

696
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:42,215
But your girl here's got a good voice.

697
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:45,219
I mean, the first song was nice,
but this one...

698
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,847
powerful lyrics...
just resonates with me.

699
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,083
You know what Sin said,
he said it's all there,

700
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:51,591
he just needs to put his touch on it.

701
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,752
That's it.

702
00:39:52,827 --> 00:39:54,522
That's exactly what I said.

703
00:39:54,596 --> 00:39:58,225
So, how is Sin proposing to do this?

704
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,597
Let me produce her.

705
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:02,228
I'll fatten up her sound,
give her some edge.

706
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,239
Maybe even add in a little... a little...

707
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:10,408
...a little blues guitar.
Yeah, huh?

708
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:12,105
Man's got a point, Edie.

709
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,616
Nothin' against Hy Gordon,
but the man is white.

710
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:16,878
That's true, Sin.

711
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:20,785
But what's that gonna cost me?

712
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,189
Well, just a producer's credit.

713
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:25,192
And a little something
on the back end.

714
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,854
Which could end up being millions.

715
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:30,159
Only if I make it a hit.

716
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:35,795
Tea?

717
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,065
What's with the finger?
What's that?

718
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:41,336
That's not gangsta.
That's not gangsta.

719
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,070
Got you.

720
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,746
<i>- What do you want. Raj?
- Sin LaSalle produced her single.</i>

721
00:40:53,822 --> 00:40:54,846
<i>So?</i>

722
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:56,584
Man, that bitch hung me out a window!

723
00:40:56,658 --> 00:40:59,320
Now he gets to be a producer?
I ain't havin' it.

724
00:40:59,394 --> 00:41:02,852
At least he's not hanging out at strip clubs
in the middle of the day.

725
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:04,489
Listen to me.
Chili called.

726
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:07,467
He said Linda played with Aerosmith
and killed.

727
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:10,902
<i>Tried to offer me some kind of a
back-end bullshit deal to promote her.</i>

728
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,906
Can you believe the balls on this guy?

729
00:41:12,974 --> 00:41:15,238
So what you sayin'?
He's gonna make her a big star?

730
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:17,606
Not if he's dead.

731
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,242
Are you sayin' we can smoke him?

732
00:41:20,315 --> 00:41:22,806
I'm saying you and Elliot
take care of him.

733
00:41:22,884 --> 00:41:25,011
And I'll forget you tried to take me out.

734
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,607
Elliot, you home?

735
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:06,921
<i>Elliot? Chili Palmer.</i>

736
00:42:06,995 --> 00:42:09,623
<i>Got you an audition
on a Nicole Kidman picture.</i>

737
00:42:09,697 --> 00:42:11,688
<i>T's next Tuesday at 3.00.</i>

738
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:12,790
<i>Give me a call.</i>

739
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:17,871
No, he ain't.

740
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:19,930
Delete that shit.

741
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,900
I love that blues guitar.
It's nice.

742
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:59,813
I mean, it's lyrical, but it's tough now.

743
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,280
I could almost see the video.

744
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,340
We should get Shotgun
to do the video.

745
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:04,977
Now, he tight.

746
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:06,042
We'll never get him.

747
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,920
The man's the Scorsese of music videos.
It won't happen.

748
00:43:09,991 --> 00:43:12,289
<i>The man was my production assistant
on Get Leo.</i>

749
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,554
I'll get him.

750
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:16,529
<i>Linda! T was beautiful.
But when you do the hip thing.</i>

751
00:43:16,598 --> 00:43:18,498
<i>need like a... more hip.</i>

752
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:20,534
<i>Like a... sexier hip.</i>

753
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:23,765
<i>Like a bigger. Sexier hip.
You... you'll do it.</i>

754
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:25,032
I'll be back.

755
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:27,006
<i>Okay? Right on action.</i>

756
00:43:39,988 --> 00:43:43,719
It's late. Shouldn't you
and Baby Huey be sleeping?

757
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,351
That's it?
No "Hey, Nick"?

758
00:43:46,427 --> 00:43:48,895
"Good to see you, man"?
"Did you lose weight?"

759
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:51,856
She's good, bro.

760
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:54,868
You get Miss Bangkok in there
and you've got something.

761
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:56,904
Well, you always had an eye
for talent, Nick.

762
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:59,166
I think it's time you, me, and Edie
had a little talk.

763
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,333
You wanna talk business,
you talk to me.

764
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:02,706
You leave Edie out of this.

765
00:44:02,777 --> 00:44:04,904
I'm already in negotiations with Edie.

766
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,243
I'm just coming to get you.

767
00:44:08,516 --> 00:44:09,813
Is that right?

768
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:37,868
Well, if it isn't Flea Diddy.

769
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:39,072
It's P. Diddy.

770
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:42,139
Don't be comin' up in here
like you know anything about rap.

771
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,843
I bet I know more than you do.

772
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:46,318
You probably don't even know
who the Sugar Hill Gang is.

773
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:49,356
But I know who
the Bust A Cap In Yo' Ass Gang is.

774
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:54,393
Let me tell you something, Chil.

775
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:57,954
When I told you I wanted us
to work together, I was being genuine.

776
00:44:58,032 --> 00:44:59,795
I could tell.

777
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:01,391
But now that Linda's making
a name for herself,

778
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:04,529
she's gonna need a real professional
managing her career.

779
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:07,040
So I'm gonna need
that contract back.

780
00:45:14,749 --> 00:45:17,479
You know, just take it.

781
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:18,985
It's yours.

782
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:24,123
It takes a big man to realize
a bigger man swings a bigger dick.

783
00:45:24,192 --> 00:45:26,922
Nobody's a bigger dick than you, Nick.

784
00:45:29,497 --> 00:45:31,226
So what the hell is this?

785
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,460
That's Linda's contract.

786
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:35,729
We thought you'd appreciate the irony.

787
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:37,737
You know how turnabout's fair game.

788
00:45:37,805 --> 00:45:41,002
Fair game. I like that.

789
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:43,543
That could be the name
of my next girl group.

790
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:45,636
Take care, Chil.

791
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:51,979
You disrespected me.

792
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,816
Move yo' ass.

793
00:45:53,888 --> 00:45:55,515
It's a damn shame, Chili.

794
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,990
'Cause now what you're gonna do
is have to go commit suicide

795
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,754
up in a dark alley, man.

796
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:03,391
There goes your audition.

797
00:46:05,233 --> 00:46:06,291
What audition?

798
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,994
I left you a message.

799
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:09,366
Stop bullshittin', man.

800
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:11,667
- At home and on your two-way.
- You didn't leave me a message.

801
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,400
I checked my messages.
Nobody called me.

802
00:46:13,474 --> 00:46:15,567
Sounds like maybe
somebody erased your messages.

803
00:46:15,643 --> 00:46:17,508
Check your two-way.
Go ahead.

804
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:21,447
Stop this shit.
We got business to take care of.

805
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:25,816
- You need help?
- All right.

806
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:27,979
There you go.

807
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:30,047
Is that it?
Just hit that button?

808
00:46:39,267 --> 00:46:40,632
How could you do that, Raj?

809
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,795
What are you talking about, man?
Why am I standin' here?

810
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,929
You've been erasing my messages?

811
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:47,031
I have an audition on Tuesday.

812
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:48,097
What?!

813
00:46:48,176 --> 00:46:50,770
Ain't no damn message on that thing.
Green light's on, man.

814
00:46:50,845 --> 00:46:53,279
- How could you do that, man?
- Why you trippin' on me like that?

815
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:55,338
- E. Weazy!
- Elliot, be cool, man.

816
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:56,713
Cap easy in yo' ass!

817
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:58,274
- How could you do that?
- You actin' crazy, man!

818
00:46:58,352 --> 00:46:59,842
Put the gun back
where it belongs, man!

819
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:01,252
You never wanted to see me in movies!

820
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:03,756
- Come on, sugar tank.
- After all these years, "sugar tank"?

821
00:47:03,825 --> 00:47:05,588
- Come on, man. Check in.
- You afraid of the big gay man?

822
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,457
I'm your ace, man!
I've been your ace!

823
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,195
What? They got me!

824
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,937
Get 'em! They got me, Elliot!

825
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:25,635
They got me, man!

826
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:30,748
- Tuesday, right, Chili?
- That's right.

827
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:56,610
Sorry about your comrade, comrade.

828
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,344
- What the hell is this?
- Don't know.

829
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:15,996
- What the hell?
- Nick Carr!

830
00:48:18,132 --> 00:48:20,498
You're under arrest
for the murder of Joe Loop.

831
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:27,505
And now, the final nominee
for MTV's Best Video of the Year.

<i>Linda Moon, with her performance
of her smash hit Ain't No Reason.</i>

833
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:38,115
Tell me, have you ever felt
like the sky was falling down

834
00:48:38,186 --> 00:48:40,654
But the sun is gonna shine again?

835
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:45,555
Tell me, have you ever felt
like you've been left alone

836
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:48,060
But you know deep down you're wrong?

837
00:48:48,129 --> 00:48:53,590
I wonder, have you ever,
ever felt a little unsure

838
00:48:53,768 --> 00:48:56,236
But then again secure?

839
00:48:56,304 --> 00:49:00,604
Tell me, have you ever felt
like you've been left alone?

840
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:02,336
But you can't 'cause you know

841
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,344
Ain't no reason to

842
00:49:04,412 --> 00:49:07,347
No, no, no, no

843
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:09,875
No, no

844
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:15,514
Have you ever felt like giving up

845
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,115
But you know you love him
way too much?

846
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:22,261
I wonder if you've ever felt

847
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,527
Yeah

848
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,794

849
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:30,065
No, no, no

No, no, no, no

Somethin', somethin'

853

Somethin' goin' down

854
00:49:46,854 --> 00:49:48,685
Yeah, yeah, yeah

855

No, no, no

864
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:35,158
Tonight, you've heard
the five nominated songs. Dabu.

865
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:36,931
Yeah, I'm Dabu the Great,
you know what I'm sayin'?

866
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:38,699
We got the Dub MD's in the house.

Yeah.

This is amazing.

who has believed in me
