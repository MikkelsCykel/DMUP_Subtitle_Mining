was not only my father,

he was my comrade,
my leader in battle.

And now his fight

is my own.

25

His army is under my command,

26
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,168

27

become reality.

28

00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,893
No longer can we be ignored.

33
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,764
Now, we are the occupiers.

Any attempt to
penetrate its borders

35

will be met with
fierce resistance.

Should our demands go 
unanswered, they will go off.

39
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,218
Such an explosion would
produce a radiation cloud

the bombs dropped on Japan.

227 political prisoners
you've held captive.

We call for the complete and total
 independence of Pasalan.

44

Nothing less will be
deemed acceptable.

45
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,712
Prime Minister Musayev, this fight is not
 only about country and politics,

46
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,909
it is about blood.

47

We have your children.

50

51
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,989
they will be the first to go.

52
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,662
I urge you to act responsibly.

53

Yes.

72
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,670
Is it necessary for you to question
 the things you don't know?

73
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,748
- No.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

74
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,379
Thank you.

75
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,849

move your right fingers,

76
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,751
one by one, beginning with
 the forefinger?

77
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,790
- Limited range.
- All right.

78
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,951
Okay.

79
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,630

80
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,993
Yes.

81
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,932
I'm gonna cool you off.

82
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,017
Very good.
You were very good today.

83
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,048
So you've seen the security tape
 from the museum?

84
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,317
I have.

85
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,995
You want to describe
what you saw, or shall I?

86
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,888
I saw an armed assailant
take direct hits to vital areas

87
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,460
and still manage
to overpower a security detail.

88
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,569
This remind you
of something?

89
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,641
White Tower was shut
down over a year ago.

90
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,001
- Maybe it was something else. 
- Maybe.

91
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,474
But we should still
prepare for the worst,

92
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,742
however remote
the possibility.

93
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,785
So, if we assume the worst,
the problem becomes ours to share.

94
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,412
Hypothetically.

95
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,587
So then, hypothetically,

96
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,387
What is our
shared solution?

In the 1960s,

what we've now come to call
the Universal Soldier program.

<i>fueled by high-concentrate

120
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,409
<i>A soldier that operates Without 
conscience or hesitation.</i>

<i>repairing it and reheating it

<i>and, in the process,
improve them.</i>

<i>Programmable and erasable.</i>

<i>One that you can
turn on and turn off.</i>

128
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,333
That's right. Five years ago,
 the program was suspended,

But there was a break-in.

146
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,475

including a Series 7 model.

unaffected by radiation.

Now there's four.

159
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,646
What happened to the fifth?

160
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,817
He's the subject of a privately-funded
 program run by Dr. Sandra Fleming.

 him into society.</i>

166
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,277

 but by far the best of the group.</i>

167
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,647

 research in Switzerland.</i>

168

LUC: I think of escape.

169
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,151

170
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,325
Shame.

I don't know.

179
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,496

180

182
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,688
Helpless.

the weight of responsibility.

You may have forgotten our
 agreement, Doctor, but I haven't.

192
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,107
Consider this
my last reminder.

193
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,706
I haven't forgotten,
I've been in surgery,

194
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,116

be quite a success.

195

It'll be taken care of.

199

So you want to wait? Then I guess
 the wire transfers can wait as well.

is growing anxious.

203

 It can't possibly wait.

 the dismantling of the detonators,

216

and the extraction
of the two known hostages.

217
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,203

However, their positions
 could be fluid,

If it comes
down to either-or,

we take the reactor.

Is that the best
you can do, Doctor?

230

It's probably programmed
to defend the reactor site,

231
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,676
so it'll stick close
to it like a nest,

You often think about
humankind and its destiny?

633
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,062
Yes or no?

I'm on your side. It's okay. It's okay.

640
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,277
Are you one of them?

641
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,009
Who? One of the ones
who can't be killed?

642
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:52,750
Let's hope so. Now come with me and
be very quiet. Come on.

643
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,491
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go!

645
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,813
Colonel, they've reactivated
the detonators.

646
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,788
What the hell are
you talking about? Look.

647
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,323
What's the communication status
on Captain Burke?

648
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,519
None.

649
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,020
TECHNICIAN: Game's back on.

650
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,399
Communications are down.

651
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,532
We've got no way of knowing if anyone's
alive over there.

652
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,304
What about Burke?
Nothing.

653
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:26,677
Is it possible your creation might have had
an episode, Dr. Porter?

654
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:27,771
It's possible.

655
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,448
Thirty minutes.
We're officially at Defcon One.

656
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:33,948
Where are we with Deveraux?

657
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:37,082
As he is right now, he wouldn't stand
a chance against the NGU.

658
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,217
Dr. Fleming?

659
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,658
If we proceed with
the double dosage

660
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:40,922
and leave him
something in reserve,

661
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,258
it's possible we
can get him there.

662
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,523
Then let's do it.

663
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,860
But understand this
is your last bullet.

664
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,731
Assuming he survives,
there'll be no controlling him,

665
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,805
no communication hookup.

666
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:51,634
He'll know only what
he's been programmed for.

667
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,335
To find those kids
and stop the detonation.

668
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,604
Beyond that...
Who's gonna dose him?

669
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:58,009
It's not gonna be safe
in there. I'll do it.

670
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,843
No, I will.

671
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:02,174
I owe it to him.

672
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:31,746
I know what's happening.

673
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,941
What is happening, Luc?

674
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,209
I'm going back.

675
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,449
I'm going to fight.

676
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:46,085
Yeah.

677
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:51,029
I remember.

678
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,675
Give it to me.

679
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,410
I'll do it.

680
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:07,843
I want to be
here with you.

681
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,884
It's not safe for you.

682
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:15,687

Nothing.
