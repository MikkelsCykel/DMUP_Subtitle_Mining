1
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,934
More blood!

2
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,138
Great. Keep it coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.

3
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,340
Don't be stingy.

4
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,440
Watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.

5
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,246
Chase, keep that claw
really moving.

6
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,276
Jeffrey, jam it on there
just like Freddy would.

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,153
Good, good. And cut!
Print that, Gretchen.

8
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,189
Chase, you're a genius.

9
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,663
This makes his old claw look
like Mother Teresa's mitten.

10
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,996
You better thank them.
They're very sensitive.

11
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,002
Chuck, Terry, great blood.

12
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,005
- Thank you very much.
- Some of our best work.

13
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,904
Hey, monkey man,
want to see some neat stuff?

14
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,702
Come on.

15
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,108
It's only make-believe.

16
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,306
Marianne, I gotta go.

17
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,050
Low bridge.

18
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,983
Let's see if we can
scare the P.J.'s off Mommy.

19
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,259
Hey, Heather.

20
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,504
You hungry, Dylan?

21
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,539
Gotcha.

22
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,074
It should have flexed more.

23
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,781
I think the servos
got shorted out with blood.

24
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,985
Well, take it apart,
pull it out...

25
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,856
and insulate them
with some styro.

26
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,919
The thing wasn't meant to be
submerged, for Pete's sake.

27
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,122
I don't like that thing.

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,827
That thing puts bread
on our table.

29
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,858
Is it alive, Daddy?

30
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,736
Heather,
you're in the next shot.

31
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,003
State-of-the-art animatronics
with bio-organic grafting.

32
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,273
Bull tendons, nerve bundles
from a live Doberman.

33
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,664
Must've have picked up a signal
from an Eighties walkie-talkie.

34
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,632
- Sure it's off?
- It's off.

35
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,034
Funny, it's warm...
just like a real hand.

36
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,565
Oh, God.

37
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,278
What the hell's going on here?
Cut the effects!

38
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,751
Terry, where is it? Terry!

39
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,453
Chuck, get off me!

40
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,923
Heather, where is it?

41
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,760
Chase, where the hell is it?

42
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,869
Come on.

43
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,309
What the fuck?!

44
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,983
Earthquake. Come on.

45
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,202
Mommy!

46
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,127
What is that?

47
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,868
Car alarms.

48
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,342
You OK?

49
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,875
You OK, chief?

50
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,250
Honey, do you have a fever?

51
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,751
Just another earthquake, Dylan.

52
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,447
Getting kind of fun, huh?

53
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,921
Daddy. Blood.

54
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,254
It's nothing, guys.

55
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,125
It's a scratch. Really.

56
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,789
Where did you get that?

57
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,321
I don't know. Picture, I guess.

58
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,834
When it fell. It's no big deal.

59
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,927
Put a bandage on it.

60
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,437
Don't worry about it.

61
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,973
Geologists at Cal Tech...

62
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,506
have confirmed
this morning's aftershock...

63
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,075
Do we have to watch that?

64
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,586
...five-point-three
on the Richter scale.

65
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,746
Thought you turned it on.

66
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,653
It was strong enough
to cause further collapse...

67
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,124
of the already badly damaged
parking structure...

68
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,990
I'll turn it off.

69
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,428
Officials say
that this is normal...

70
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,762
following a quake
of last week's magnitude...

71
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,632
now thought to be a massive 6.8.

72
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,602
Dylan, this is breakfast,
not arts and crafts.

73
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,773
What?

74
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,801
Did you get any sleep
last night?

75
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,212
More or less.

76
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,240
OK, time to get dressed.
I'm late.

77
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,081
You going away?

78
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,486
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.

79
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,789
Is there anything other than
the obvious bothering you?

80
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,425
I think five earthquakes
in three weeks is enough.

81
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,330
Hasn't been another phone call,
has there?

82
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,971
Good sign.

83
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,410
Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.

84
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,142
He's closer, if anything.

85
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,707
It's giving me nightmares,
Chase.

86
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,276
Did you have one last night?

87
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,421
It's just the earthquakes,
Heather.

88
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,948
Maybe.

89
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,255
Maybe I shouldn't do
this interview today.

90
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:15,495
No. You gotta get back
on the horse sometime.

91
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,936
Look, you had a nut case
making harassing phone calls.

92
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,438
I know how scary that's been.

93
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,407
No, you don't.

94
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,070
OK, I don't.

95
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,581
But it doesn't mean
that it can't be over.

96
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,378
But what if it isn't over?

97
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,621
Maybe you should
tell me your dream.

98
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,553
It was nothing. I was...

99
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,263
You and I were working on
this movie, together for once...

100
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,960
and one of your special effects
went really wrong.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,437
And Chuck and Terry got hurt...

102
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,666
and...

103
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,907
Well, your fingers were cut.

104
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,410
Right here?

105
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:05,011
Heather, you were
probably half awake...

106
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,110
and saw my fingers get nicked
when the mirror fell.

107
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,848
Dreams are like that.

108
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:17,027
Look, if you don't want me
to go on this job, I won't.

109
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,129
Just be careful, OK?

110
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,931
I think I can survive
two days in Palm Springs...

111
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,939
supplying soap bubbles
for a detergent commercial.

112
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,099
I guess so.

113
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,402
You guess so?

114
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,403
Come here.

115
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,814
Forty-eight hours.

116
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,986
I'll be back in no time.

117
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,324
I gotta go.

118
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,262
I love what you've done
with the place.

119
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,935
Knock 'em dead.

120
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,876
Dylan, I gotta go.
Take care of Mommy.

121
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,969
Nancy.

122
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,939
Dylan, I don't want you
watching this.

123
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,948
Dylan, what's wrong?
What's wrong?!

124
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,456
What's happening to you?

125
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,438
One, two...

126
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,521
Freddy's coming for you!

127
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,401
Someone's coming.

128
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,600
What?

129
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,791
Are you OK, honey?

130
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,040
Is everything OK?

131
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,071
It's just these quakes.
Did you feel one just now?

132
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,982
No. A big truck went by
before you opened the door.

133
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,815
It's life on the fault line.

134
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,878
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.

135
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,522
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning.

136
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,795
No, he seems OK.

137
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,995
Are you sure
that's all that's wrong?

138
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,300
Leave us alone,
you son of a bitch!

139
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,101
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.

140
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,370
Just wanted you to know
I'm out front.

141
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,150
I'm sorry.
Can you hang on a minute?

142
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,096
What is it?

143
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,291
I don't know.

144
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,894
I just have
this weird feeling today.

145
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,099
Mommy? Stay home, then.

146
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,577
This damn caller.

147
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,580
He's started again?

148
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,983
Sick fuck.

149
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,283
Sorry.

150
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,252
Dylan doesn't seem
to have a fever.

151
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,763
It's probably just your nerves.

152
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,356
Nerves?

153
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,402
I just meant from the shaker
this morning.

154
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,735
Everybody's freaked out about
how many we've been having.

155
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,434
And then these phone calls.

156
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,608
Don't answer it.

157
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,114
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we are going to be late.

158
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:30,375
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?

159
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,740
Bye.

160
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,989
I'll call the cops for you.

161
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,324
You've got the number
on the fridge, right?

162
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,953
Give them
the time they called...

163
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,590
and they're keeping this list,
supposedly.

164
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,328
Julie, I'm really sorry.

165
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,336
My nerves are
a little raw these days.

166
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,530
It's OK.

167
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,177
Yeah. I gotta go.

168
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,239
- Morning.
- Good morning.

169
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,959
You played that girl.

170
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,499
In that movie.

171
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,060
With the guy with the...

172
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,265
Yeah, sure. That's you.

173
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,503
That's what I love
about this job.

174
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,205
I get to meet the stars.

175
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,339
I'm hardly a star.

176
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,144
What, are you kidding?

177
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,310
I love your stuff.

178
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,020
The first was the best.

179
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,682
Where the girlfriend's cut open
and dragged across the ceiling.

180
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,851
It was awesome.

181
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,852
And when all that blood comes
out of your boyfriend's bed?

182
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,728
I thought I'd shit.

183
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,393
But they never should
have killed off Freddy.

184
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,163
Heather, look, we gotta go.

185
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,696
Cutting it close, aren't you?
You trying to get me fired?

186
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,265
OK! We're coming!

187
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,105
So, Heather, we're approaching
the tenth anniversary...

188
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,775
of this whole
"Nightmare on Elm Street" thing.

189
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,274
I mean, the original,
five very popular sequels.

190
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,381
How has all the success
affected you personally?

191
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,052
I don't know
if it really has, Sam.

192
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,324
God. With the exception
of One and Three...

193
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,194
I pretty much stayed out of it.

194
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,325
Well, I'm doing a lot more
television now...

195
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,232
so those hours
let me spend a lot more time...

196
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,600
with my husband
and my little boy.

197
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,935
You have a little boy.
What's his name?

198
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,267
Dylan.

199
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,005
With Dylan,
does that change your feeling...

200
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,275
your perspective
about horror movies?

201
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,009
No, not really.

202
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,983
Would you let him
see one of your movies?

203
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,110
My son? No.

204
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,519
I'm sure people ask you this
all the time...

205
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,921
Is there going
to be another sequel...

206
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,655
and what's more,
is Freddy really dead?

207
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,391
Of course he is.
Freddy's dead and gone.

208
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,094
And how about your costar
in the original...

209
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,534
would you trust him
alone with Dylan?

210
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,266
Robert? I don't know.

211
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,501
Why don't we ask him
how he'd feel about it?

212
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,000
We've got a big surprise for you
and for our audience.

213
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,070
Let's bring him out.
He is the best of the bad.

214
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:25,140
Let's say hello
to Robert Englund.

215
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,992
Love ya, babe!

216
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,587
We'll do lunch!

217
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,328
I'm alive once again!

218
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,603
Freddy's back! Give it up
for your Uncle Freddy!

219
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,301
Just when you thought it was
safe to get back into bed!

220
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,113
Give me five!

221
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:07,355
I'm back,
and I'm badder than ever!

222
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,994
You are all my children now!

223
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,871
I got to go, Robert.

224
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,536
Just a second. I'll walk you.

225
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,067
There you go, kids.

226
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,739
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

227
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,140
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

228
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,744
Well, everything went great,
I thought.

229
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,516
We really got you, didn't we?

230
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,523
I don't know why
you didn't tell me.

231
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,856
Come on. They loved
the expression on your face.

232
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,384
I think they'd like
to see us together again.

233
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,488
In what, a romantic comedy?

234
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,998
Just because
it's a love story...

235
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,058
doesn't mean you can't
have a decapitation or two.

236
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,094
- There's a call for you.
- For me?

237
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,628
I'll talk to you later.

238
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,803
Heather, it's Sara Risher
over at New Line Cinema.

239
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,177
How are you?

240
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,944
How are you?
This is a voice from the past.

241
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,109
It sure is.

242
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,312
Listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.

243
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,787
It's just that we have
something to propose to you...

244
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,916
and I wonder
if you'd stop by the offices.

245
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,858
Bob would love to talk to you.

246
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,087
Sure. When?

247
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,790
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.

248
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,594
- Now?
- Just take a minute.

249
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,226
You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Bye.

250
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,523
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.

251
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,189
Was Bob expecting you?

252
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,196
Sara. How are you?

253
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,600
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.

254
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,604
- You look great.
- Thank you.

255
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,801
Bob is dying to see you.
Can I get you something?

256
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,536
- Coffee would be fine.
- Black?

257
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,635
- Black's fine.
- Could you get us some coffee?

258
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,009
- Sure.
- Thanks.

259
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,514
I think the guy
is a little bit of a jerk...

260
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,813
but we won't know
until we've read the script.

261
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,876
Anyhow, I'll give you a call
when I...

262
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,946
Listen, man, I got to go.

263
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,184
Call me
when you get to Milan...

264
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,419
and don't forget...
risotto con tartufi.

265
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,586
It's fantastico!

266
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,926
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

267
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,989
Boy, do you look great, Heather.

268
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:31,264
- How are you?
- Great. I'm fine.

269
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,362
And I don't have to ask
how you're doing.

270
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,202
Well, so far so good.

271
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,038
Which is why we asked you
to come by today.

272
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,340
- Thanks, Kim.
- Sure.

273
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,878
Look, Heather,
let me cut to the chase.

274
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:49,013
How would you like to join us
in the definitive "Nightmare"?

275
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,254
I thought you killed Freddy off.

276
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,351
Well, we did, but the fans...

277
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,363
God bless them,
they're clamoring for more.

278
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,695
I guess evil never dies, right?

279
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,723
Anyhow, a few weeks ago,
I got a call from Wes...

280
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,861
and he pitched me
this really exciting idea...

281
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,234
and I started thinking...

282
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,206
"Who better to resurrect
Freddy than his creator?"

283
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,971
I thought Wes stopped
doing horror movies.

284
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,411
He actually told me he hadn't
called in the last ten years...

285
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,814
because he hadn't had
any really scary nightmares.

286
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,614
They're his inspiration
for this thing.

287
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,884
Anyhow, he's right
in the middle of the script.

288
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,391
Which means
he's having nightmares again.

289
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,223
He's very excited about it.

290
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,491
- The nightmares?
- No, the script.

291
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:36,256
And you should be, too,
because you're the star.

292
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,795
I don't know, Bob.

293
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:44,002
I'm flattered, really,
but I have a kid now.

294
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:45,441
Well, so?

295
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,640
So I'm not sure
about doing horror.

296
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,875
Come on, Heather.
Kids love horror.

297
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,652
Thank you so much, Bob.

298
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,949
I have other things happening.

299
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,517
Look, we'll match any offer
that's on the table for you.

300
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,256
No, it's not that.
Look, I have a fan.

301
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,025
Heather, you got plenty of fans.

302
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,793
We've been doing
marketing research on you.

303
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,028
You are rating right up there.

304
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,696
We've got Chase working on
a prototype for the new glove.

305
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,864
What?

306
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,500
We asked him to kind of
keep it as a surprise...

307
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,170
until you and I could have
this conversation.

308
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,547
How long has Wes been
working on this script?

309
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,816
I don't know.
A couple of months. Why?

310
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,379
And since you've been
thinking of making it...

311
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,050
has anything funny happened?

312
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,323
What do you mean?

313
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,056
Like weird phone calls.

314
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,792
Or nightmares.

315
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,132
Why don't you answer
your phone, Bob?

316
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,006
That's what we got people
we pay around here for.

317
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,014
Will someone pick up
the damn phone?

318
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,024
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

319
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,574
What the...

320
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,716
Never sleep again.

321
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,891
What is going on?

322
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,234
You didn't let him watch
the movie on TV, did you?

323
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,968
Movie? He didn't watch
anything on TV.

324
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,636
He was taking his nap,
and I heard him screaming.

325
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,747
Honey, are you OK?

326
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,685
Rex saved me.

327
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,019
He did?

328
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,695
Is Rex going to die?

329
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,767
Rex is not going to die.

330
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,274
I promise you, sweetie.

331
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,970
Do you know where the sewing
stuff is in the kitchen?

332
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,777
Sure.

333
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,681
We'll do an operation, OK?

334
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,977
Come on.
Dr. Dylan and Dr. Julie.

335
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,354
Fix him up good as new, OK?

336
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,963
Hey, Chase. You've got a call.
It's your wife.

337
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,107
Chase, you better come home.

338
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,412
Heather, I'm stuck here.

339
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,749
Neither Chuck or Terry
came in today.

340
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,617
Why? What's the matter?

341
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,590
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?

342
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,554
Hold on.
The phone's breaking up.

343
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,762
What's going on with Dylan?

344
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,634
He's had some sort
of an episode.

345
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,229
What?

346
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,899
What kind of episode?

347
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,466
He was just acting
very strangely.

348
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,970
Like somebody was after him.

349
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,447
It's scary. It scared me.

350
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,718
He was acting like...

351
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:48,912
Like what?

352
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,650
Like Freddy.

353
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,582
Heather, has there been
another phone call?

354
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,999
Why didn't you tell me
you were working on a new glove?

355
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,399
And why aren't Chuck and Terry
at work today?

356
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,631
Forget those clowns. Answer me.

357
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,798
Has there been another
phone call today or not?

358
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,076
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.

359
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,379
- Danny, I got to go.
- What's up?

360
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,584
My kid's sick. I got to fly.

361
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,311
"As soon as the sun was up...

362
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,280
"the witch made Gretel fetch
the wood and kindle a fire.

363
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,249
"'We will bake cookies first,'
she said.

364
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,718
"'I've heated the oven
and kneaded the dough.

365
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,881
"'Crawl in and see if the fire
is blazing high enough now.'

366
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,016
"And she pushed Gretel
toward the oven.

367
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,357
"The witch went to shut the door
and bake her inside."

368
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,022
This is so violent.

369
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,897
I don't know why you like
these stupid old fairy tales.

370
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,424
Finish, please.

371
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,801
- They'll give you nightmares.
- I like this story.

372
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,775
"But Gretel guessed what
the witch was planning.

373
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,540
"'I don't know how to
get in,' Gretel said.

374
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,172
"'How am I to manage it? '

375
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,479
"'Stupid girl,' shouted
the witch, rushing to the oven.

376
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,851
"'The opening is big enough.
See? I can fit myself.'

377
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:33,187
"Quickly, Gretel came behind
and pushed with all her might...

378
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,091
"plunging the wicked old woman
headlong into the flames...

379
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,288
"banging the door shut
and bolting it tight.

380
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,595
"The witch howled..."
That's enough.

381
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,296
"The witch howled
like a scalded cat...

382
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,397
"but Gretel ran and left her
there to perish nonetheless.

383
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,237
"She ran to her brother
as fast as she could...

384
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,607
"flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel,' she cried.

385
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:55,306
"'We're saved!
The witch is dead."'

386
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,279
Time for sleep.

387
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,048
Say how they find
their way back home.

388
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,854
- Tomorrow night.
- No. Tonight.

389
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,882
It's important.

390
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,830
Dylan, you know as well as I do.

391
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,426
They followed the trail of
breadcrumbs back to their house.

392
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,403
And then their father
covered them with kisses...

393
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,699
and they were safe.

394
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,674
They were safe,
and they could sleep.

395
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,206
- What is that?
- Rex.

396
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,778
Come on.

397
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,559
Rex keeps him down there.

398
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,993
Who?

399
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,432
The mean old man with the claws.

400
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,401
He wants to come up
while we sleep.

401
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,870
I keep my feet up here.

402
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,668
Rex keeps him down there.

403
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,271
He's my guard.

404
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,814
You should have a guard, too.

405
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,653
There's nothing down there.

406
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,124
Come here.

407
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,889
Look. See?

408
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,434
It's different when you're gone.

409
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,933
Come on.

410
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:41,949
On, please.

411
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,216
OK, sweetie.

412
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,219
Night-night. Sleep tight.

413
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,491
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

414
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,159
- Daddy coming home?
- He's on his way.

415
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,728
He can follow
the breadcrumbs, right?

416
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,205
Right.

417
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,740
If the birds
don't eat them first.

418
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,412
Perfect, perfect, perfect!

419
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,909
Come on, come on, come on.

420
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,848
That's me in the corner

421
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,882
That's me in the spot

422
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,519
Light

423
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,789
Light

424
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,594
Losin' my

425
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,032
Religion

426
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,490
Mommy's scared?

427
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:08,027
Dylan, Mommy's fine.

428
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,660
It was just a bad dream.

429
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,796
What are you doing out of bed?

430
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,069
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting.

431
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,508
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.

432
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,110
I'm not sleepy.

433
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,630
Police, ma'am.
Will you open the door?

434
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,037
Heather Langenkamp?

435
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,880
Is Chase Porter your husband?

436
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,753
There was an accident.

437
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,157
It appears he fell asleep
while driving, ma'am.

438
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,987
Is he... I mean...

439
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,225
Is he hurt?

440
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,093
I'm afraid
it's worse than that, ma'am.

441
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,038
Is he dead?

442
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,310
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,545
Are you sure it's him?

444
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,047
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.

445
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,485
I want to see his body.

446
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,122
No, you don't, ma'am.
It's not necessary.

447
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,233
I want to see it for myself.

448
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,347
- Can you hand me that?
- Sure.

449
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,513
Excuse me.

450
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,715
- Could I help you?
- Porter.

451
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,652
Chase Porter.

452
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,092
It's back here.

453
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,766
You said Chase?

454
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,179
I'm sorry.

455
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,993
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.

456
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,998
I'd like to see once again.

457
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,401
I'm sorry?

458
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,566
Could you lift
the sheet again, please?

459
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,015
More, please.

460
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,016
What is that?

461
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,027
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.

462
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,292
The head's gonna be all right
for the funeral, but...

463
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,131
Hey, lady. You OK?

464
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,605
You sure?

465
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:21,283
Oh, God. What did that?

466
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,219
They said the truck
was tore up something awful...

467
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,348
so you can imagine him
not being in...

468
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,585
well, exactly top shape.

469
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,122
It looks like he was clawed.

470
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:41,134
That's why we don't lift
the sheet past the face, ma'am.

471
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,240
Sometimes it's what we don't see
that gets us through the night.

472
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,311
So, if you'll just sign...

473
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,589
God is our hope and strength...

474
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,428
a very present help in trouble.

475
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,164
Therefore, we will not fear...

476
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,229
though the earth be moved...

477
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,400
and though the hills
be carried...

478
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,433
into the midst of the sea...

479
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,209
though the waters thereof
rage and swell...

480
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,115
and though
the mountains shake...

481
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,346
at the tempest of the same.

482
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,352
- Julie, where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

483
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:27,110
Dylan, grab Mommy's hand.
Grab it!

484
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,304
Oh, my God!

485
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:31,872
Hurry!

486
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:41,619
Let go of me!

487
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,058
Stay with me.

488
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,328
Stay with me, Heather.

489
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,202
- Where's Dylan?
- He's all right.

490
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,727
He's right here.

491
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,102
- What happened?
- Earthquake.

492
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,170
You got knocked off your feet.

493
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,978
You got a pretty good bump,
actually.

494
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,542
May he rest in peace, children.

495
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,022
And may you all get home safely.

496
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,785
Amen.

497
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,899
If there's anything
I can do, Heather... anything.

498
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,911
Thank you, Robert.

499
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,348
Sweetie.

500
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,161
Tina?

501
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,588
Who are you?

502
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,408
Baby, wake up.

503
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:14,942
Honey. Dylan.

504
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:17,140
Dylan, get over here!
Honey! Honey!

505
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,408
Come on.

506
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,250
OK, sugar, we're gonna
go back to bed now.

507
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,688
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.

508
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,659
Honey, you have to sleep.

509
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:35,859
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

510
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,868
Where did you hear that?

511
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,565
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?

512
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,799
Dylan,
where did you hear that song?

513
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,367
In my bed.

514
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,214
In your bed?

515
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,615
Under my covers. Kids singing.

516
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,780
Way down there with the man.

517
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,983
The mean man.

518
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,353
What is that man doing?

519
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,591
Trying to get up.

520
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,794
Trying to get up into our world.

521
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,624
Where's Daddy now?

522
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,568
Daddy's in heaven.

523
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,537
He's with God now.

524
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,851
Do you have to die to see God?

525
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,616
I don't think so.

526
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,721
I think you have to pray.

527
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,527
And reach out.

528
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,703
Why does God let there
be bad things?

529
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,501
I honestly don't know, honey.

530
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,640
Please try to get some sleep.

531
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,323
Can you come with me
in my dreams?

532
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,430
I think that only
happens in the movies.

533
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,004
But I'll always, always...

534
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,375
be right here when you get back.

535
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,350
And I'll make sure
that nobody gets your toes.

536
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:02,297
I know his behavior
is bizarre...

537
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:04,899
but he's usually so normal
and well adjusted, John...

538
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,136
I can't believe it's him...

539
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,043
and not something outside
influencing him.

540
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,512
Or is that how denial works?

541
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,915
It is denial.

542
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:17,682
I don't think
that's the case here.

543
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,382
If you're really worried
about Dylan...

544
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,414
have a doctor check him out.

545
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,050
You'll see. Everything's fine.

546
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,893
You're not just saying that
to help a crazy friend cope?

547
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,495
Everything about Dylan's
behavior is understandable...

548
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,698
for a kid
who just lost his father.

549
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:38,265
How does a child
process a thing like that?

550
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,935
I don't know.

551
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,337
I've not been able
to process it very well myself.

552
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,214
And you're not crazy,
by the way.

553
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,778
Seeing Freddy in that grave
and then jumping in...

554
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,015
You didn't jump in.

555
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,184
That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.

556
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,692
"Seemed," not "was."

557
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:02,799
It's in my family, you know.

558
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,824
What is?

559
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,928
A very close relative
died in an institution.

560
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:12,340
Really? If having a screwy
family made a person crazy...

561
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,577
the whole world
would be one big loony bin.

562
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,940
You have a crazed fan after you.

563
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,442
That's what's making you crazy.
Probably Dylan, too.

564
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,115
I never mentioned that to him.

565
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,387
Kids know when something's
bugging the parent.

566
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:34,228
You have no idea
who this is calling?

567
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,926
- Freddy, for all I know.
- Come on.

568
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,092
He's a man.

569
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:45,267
Or a boy
with a deep Freddy voice.

570
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,767
Six weeks, and you're surprised
you got Freddy in your dreams?

571
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,178
Hell, Sonny Bono,
after a while...

572
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,446
began seeing his stalker
everywhere, even at Mass.

573
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,645
Really?

574
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,317
How many times
did Letterman call the cops...

575
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,950
thinking that woman
was down in the kitchen again?

576
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:07,320
Really gets under your skin
if you let it.

577
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,932
You really think Dylan's OK?

578
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,304
Dylan's fine. You're fine.

579
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,366
You're hurting,
but you're fine...

580
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,138
and you're definitely not crazy.

581
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,540
My worst fear...

582
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:28,045
that whatever madness
is in my family I have...

583
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,222
and I've passed it onto Dylan.

584
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,975
- Make sure he's OK, John.
- Are you all right?

585
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,579
Are you OK? Are you sure?
Does anything hurt?

586
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,384
Dylan, are you all right?

587
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,859
Honey, are you all right?
Are you sure?

588
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,327
God wouldn't take me.

589
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,060
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.

590
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,658
It's unbelievable.

591
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,458
- You doing all right?
- Hanging in there.

592
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,589
You know the guy that was
calling me all the time?

593
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,065
He started again...

594
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,091
and he's putting stuff
in my mail again.

595
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,865
Listen, the S.O.B. Probably
read about the funeral...

596
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,304
in the papers or something.

597
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,637
Sick mother.

598
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,303
That's the last thing
you need right now, I'm sure.

599
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,802
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.

600
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,214
Wait a second.
Now, let me get this straight.

601
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,186
You're having nightmares
about Freddy? As in me?

602
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:48,453
No. It isn't you. He's scarier.

603
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,387
He's...

604
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,423
Darker?

605
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,524
More evil?

606
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,762
Yeah. How did you know?

607
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,793
Call it a guess.

608
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,896
Pretty damn good guess.

609
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,467
Anyway
what I was calling about was...

610
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,842
have you seen any of the script
by any chance?

611
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:12,576
No. Wes won't show it
until he's finished.

612
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,208
At least that's what he told me.

613
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,650
When is it gonna be done?

614
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,849
The way he's writing, who knows?

615
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,948
It's so weird.

616
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,856
I asked him how far
he was at the funeral.

617
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,191
What did he say? Oh, yeah.

618
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,254
"As far as Dylan
trying to reach God."

619
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,358
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?

620
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:34,165
Putting your kid in the script.

621
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:38,436
Robert...
have you been having nightmares?

622
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,047
Look, we need to talk,
but not over the phone.

623
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,141
Can I come over?

624
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:52,247
Actually, Heather...
today's no good.

625
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:56,248
There's something
I have to finish.

626
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,726
Tomorrow maybe, huh?

627
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:01,026
OK, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.

628
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,726
And meanwhile, Robert,
take care, OK?

629
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,159
Yeah. Sure.

630
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:33,942
Damn it!

631
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:54,762
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

632
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:08,214
Three, four,
better lock your door

633
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:16,692
Five, six, grab your crucifix

634
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:24,266
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

635
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:28,529
Dylan, don't sing that song.

636
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,634
Nine, ten, never sleep again!

637
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,347
Dylan! Stop it!

638
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,915
No! Don't!

639
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,554
Never sleep again

640
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:53,324
Never sleep again

641
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,560
Never sleep again

642
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,296
Never sleep again

643
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,136
I touched him.

644
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,673
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

645
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,338
Diabetes?

646
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:21,313
Was there a trigger event,
trauma, shock?

647
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,878
You haven't shown him
the films you've made, have you?

648
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,548
The horror stuff?

649
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,080
His father just passed away.

650
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,286
I'm sorry.

651
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,928
But I'm convinced
those films can tip...

652
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,593
an unstable child over the edge.

653
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:39,897
Unstable?

654
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,068
Dylan's not unstable.
He's just upset.

655
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,735
We'll run a battery of tests
and know in a few days.

656
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:49,244
Does he have to stay overnight?

657
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:50,769
Absolutely.

658
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,085
Anything more happen
we need to know about?

659
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,050
Like what?

660
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:07,627
Sometimes what a child
says or fantasizes...

661
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,928
will give a clue
to what ails him.

662
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:13,697
Did he say anything
while he was still lucid?

663
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,149
What do we have here?

664
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,748
Too soon to know for sure.

665
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,056
The early symptoms point
to childhood schizophrenia.

666
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,599
Dylan, can you hear me?

667
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:50,804
Dylan, you have to fight it,
whatever is after you...

668
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,671
and you got to come back to me.

669
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:55,610
You can't make it alone.
Do you hear?

670
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:02,182
If you can hear me, tell me
what you need to feel safe.

671
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,460
Rex? Is that what you want?

672
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:18,656
Well, Rex is at home,
and that's where you should be.

673
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,330
But you got to get better before
they'll let you come home.

674
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:23,634
Do you understand?

675
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:27,067
Home.

676
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,908
Home. Home, that's right.

677
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,312
That's where I want you,
sweetie.

678
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,317
And, you know,
we're not that far away.

679
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,377
Look right out there.

680
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,720
Past the freeway is our home.

681
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:46,855
But to get there, you have to
come out from where you are...

682
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,730
so that they'll let you
come home to Rex.

683
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,200
And to me.

684
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,630
Time for your medicine, cowboy.

685
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,867
- Here you go.
- What is that?

686
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,968
Something to help him sleep.

687
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,645
There you go. It looks good.

688
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,750
There you go.

689
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,522
Good. Good. Attaboy.

690
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,657
Come on,
lie down and take a little nap.

691
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,565
You should get some rest, too.

692
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,934
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests...

693
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,563
and then
you can come back later.

694
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,704
Can you get
that other side, please?

695
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,711
I grabbed his things.

696
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,975
These are
his favorite pajamas here.

697
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,519
Honey, I've got to go.

698
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:44,815
I love you, Dylan.

699
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,483
Remember what I said.

700
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,290
We'll take care of everything.

701
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,340
Wake up, lady!

702
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,211
Don't lose it now!

703
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,332
Seismologists at Cal Tech...

704
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,807
have counted
over 300 temblors so far.

705
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,140
Though most were too faint
for us to feel...

706
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:18,045
seven have shaken our community
in the last few weeks...

707
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,174
and now scientists
are speculating...

708
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,344
there might be an unknown fault
running beneath Los Angeles...

709
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,717
a fault that could...

710
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,558
Hi. You've reached
the Englund residence.

711
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,999
We're out of town.

712
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,469
You can leave a message
if you wish, but...

713
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,938
we'll be gone for some time.

714
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,666
I wish I could tell you
where the script was going.

715
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,167
The fact is I don't know.

716
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:16,467
I dream a scene at night,
I write it down in the morning.

717
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,031
Beyond that, your guess is as
good as mine where it's going.

718
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,407
At least tell me
what it's about so far.

719
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,980
- Coffee.
- Thanks.

720
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,949
I can tell you what
the nightmare's about so far.

721
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:32,216
It's about this entity...
whatever you want to call it.

722
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,985
It's old. It's very old.

723
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:38,619
It's existed in different forms
in different times.

724
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,721
The only thing that stays
the same is what it lives for.

725
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,425
What is that?

726
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,366
The murder of innocents.

727
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:50,165
This is still a script
we're talking about, right, Wes?

728
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:55,802
I sort of think of it
as a nightmare in progress.

729
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,642
In this nightmare in progress...

730
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,705
does this thing
have any weaknesses?

731
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,876
It can be captured sometimes.

732
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:04,216
Captured? How?

733
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:06,346
By storytellers, of all things.

734
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:10,216
Every so often, they imagine
a story good enough...

735
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,250
to sort of catch its essence.

736
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,287
Then, for a while,
it's held prisoner in the story.

737
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:19,563
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly.

738
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,797
But the problem comes
when the story dies.

739
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,237
And that can happen
in a lot of ways.

740
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:24,933
It can get too familiar...

741
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,943
or somebody waters it down
to make it an easier sell...

742
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:32,607
or maybe it's so upsetting
that it's banned outright.

743
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:35,208
However it happens,
when the story dies...

744
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,412
the evil is set free.

745
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:41,583
You're saying Freddy
is this ancient thing?

746
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,457
Right. The current version.

747
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,930
And for ten years, he's been
held captive as Freddy...

748
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:51,024
in the "Nightmare on Elm Street"
series, but...

749
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:55,470
now that the films have ended,
the genie's out of the bottle.

750
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:59,464
That's what the nightmares
are telling me and I'm writing.

751
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:04,276
If Freddy's loose in
your script, where's he going?

752
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,975
Another age? Another form?

753
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:10,383
No, that's not what
the dreams have him doing.

754
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:11,852
What is he doing?

755
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:15,387
He's sort of gotten used
to being Freddy now...

756
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:18,018
and he likes
our time and space...

757
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:22,827
so he's decided to cross over
out of films into our reality.

758
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,301
Isn't there somebody
who can stop him?

759
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:32,830
Actually there is a person
in the dream...

760
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,275
sort of a gatekeeper,
so to speak.

761
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,007
Somebody Freddy has to get by...

762
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:41,312
before he can
come into our world.

763
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,046
That person's you, Heather.

764
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:45,451
It's me?

765
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,653
Why me?

766
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,387
Dramatically speaking,
it makes perfect sense.

767
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,054
You played Nancy, after all.

768
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,393
You were the first
to humiliate him, defeat him.

769
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,161
That was Nancy. Not me.

770
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,136
But you gave Nancy her strength.

771
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,298
So in order to get out,
he's got to come through you.

772
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,640
He's gonna try to do that
at your most vulnerable points.

773
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,242
Oh, my God, Wes.

774
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,806
Did you know?

775
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:19,680
It was a script.
It was a dream.

776
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,883
I didn't know.

777
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,984
You know damn well
it's more than that now.

778
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,499
How can we stop him?

779
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,329
The only way
is to make another movie.

780
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,533
I swear, I'm gonna stay
by this computer...

781
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:42,510
and keep writing until I finish
the script, but...

782
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,378
when that time comes,
you'll have to make a choice.

783
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,006
Choice?

784
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,539
What kind of choice?

785
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,883
Whether or not you're willing
to play Nancy one last time.

786
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:21,149
"Many of the symptoms
of childhood schizophrenia...

787
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,650
"are duplicated in children...

788
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,654
"suffering
from sleep deprivation."

789
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:35,495
"Sleep deprivation can produce
trance-like states...

790
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,658
"mechanical behavior.

791
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,531
"The child might..."

792
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,559
Rex woke me up.

793
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,869
He was fighting the mean old man
with the claws.

794
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,307
You have no idea
who this is calling?

795
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:48,833
Freddy, for all I know.

796
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,106
As in me?

797
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,876
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.

798
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,746
Darker, more evil?

799
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,115
How did you know?

800
01:05:56,152 --> 01:06:00,179
He's decided to cross over,
out of films, into our reality.

801
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:03,919
Never sleep again.

802
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:19,298
The world of horror films
suffered its own terror today...

803
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,607
as two of Hollywood's best known
special-effects technicians...

804
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,273
were found dead
in a vacant field.

805
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,646
Terrance Feinstein
and Charles Wilson...

806
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,412
two special-effects artists...

807
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,716
reputedly working
on a top-secret project...

808
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,949
for the makers of
the Freddy Krueger films...

809
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,858
were found brutally slashed
to death early this morning.

810
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:47,998
Freddy's glove was missing...

811
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,938
and police are speculating
the murders were the result...

812
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:52,304
of a botched theft...

813
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,333
which apparently took place
two days ago.

814
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:58,176
At this point,
the murder weapon has not...

815
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,651
Oh, God.

816
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,904
Miss me?

817
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,935
Nancy.

818
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,332
There are no visiting hours
this late.

819
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,530
You must understand.

820
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,004
No, I don't understand.

821
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,666
I told you I'm his baby-sitter.

822
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,972
I'm a close friend
of the family, damn it.

823
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,240
I just need to see him
for a minute.

824
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:11,507
Sixty seconds. Come on.

825
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,879
You have to understand.
You can't see him.

826
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:17,884
What are you doing here?

827
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,149
I don't know.

828
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:24,791
I had this really terrible dream
about Dylan.

829
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,261
I had to come and see him.

830
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,992
You must think I'm crazy.

831
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:32,833
No, I don't.

832
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,165
Is he all right?

833
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:37,070
I don't know.
They wouldn't let me in.

834
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:40,337
There are no evening visiting
hours in intensive care.

835
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,741
Is he all right?

836
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,177
Dylan? He's holding well.

837
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,147
Earlier he had some problems.

838
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,242
- He's in an oxygen tent now.
- Oh, my God.

839
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:55,683
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp. May I?

840
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,460
Those are nasty cuts.

841
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:01,861
How did you get them?

842
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:05,162
It happened in the earthquake.

843
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,429
I fell.

844
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:07,992
I need to see Dylan.

845
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,473
In a moment.
First let's see about you.

846
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:19,674
If these had been a few inches
nearer the wrist...

847
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,240
What did you say
you cut yourself on?

848
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,809
It was the earthquake.
It was dark. I have no idea.

849
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:27,748
But these look quite fresh.

850
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:30,657
They are. It happened
in tonight's earthquake.

851
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,159
It happened just 15 minutes ago.

852
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,789
You must have felt it.

853
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:41,526
Guess we lucked out over here.

854
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:45,973
Your son...

855
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:49,409
is apparently
terrified of a man...

856
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:53,176
someone he thinks
is going to come out of his bed.

857
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,810
One of the nurses heard him
talking to himself.

858
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,821
Do you have any idea
who that man is?

859
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,555
I forgot to bring
his dinosaur Rex.

860
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,857
He keeps Freddy
from coming up out of his...

861
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,587
bed.

862
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,600
The man from your films?

863
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,232
Freddy Krueger?

864
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,366
With the claws?

865
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,502
Is that who he's afraid of?

866
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:28,413
You have let your child
see your films, haven't you?

867
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,975
Every kid knows who Freddy is.

868
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,988
He's like Santa Claus...

869
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,887
or King Kong or...

870
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:41,096
Well, interesting talking
with you, Miss Langenkamp.

871
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,527
I hope you understand.

872
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,535
My concerns are simply
for the welfare of your son.

873
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:10,419
How's he doing?

874
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:56,869
Honey.

875
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,135
- You shouldn't do that.
- Too late.

876
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,009
I'm almost there, Heather.

877
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,744
Almost there.

878
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,654
Daddy!

879
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,534
- Doctor!
- Keep her right there.

880
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,059
We can't hold him much longer.

881
01:13:29,104 --> 01:13:31,766
Get the full anesthetic, stat.

882
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:33,206
We don't have that here.

883
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:36,405
No anesthetic, you say?
Screw it. I'm going in.

884
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,675
Little booger's full of
something I don't like.

885
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:41,548
Let's get him open,
good and proper.

886
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,380
Cut this evil out of him.

887
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,349
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby!

888
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,326
- Who?
- Freddy!

889
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,090
Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?

890
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,097
- What the hell's going on?
- My baby!

891
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,156
Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.

892
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:03,363
I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

893
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,736
Your son is fine.

894
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,264
He's downstairs
for further testing.

895
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:08,640
But he was just here.

896
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:12,579
He was here, you fell asleep,
we took him.

897
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,639
You looked so exhausted...

898
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,742
frankly,
we didn't want to wake you.

899
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,754
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.

900
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:21,915
That's his baby-sitter, right?

901
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,721
Believe me. Everything is fine.

902
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,957
Everything's not fine.

903
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:30,725
Damn!

904
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:31,994
Call security.

905
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:38,004
Security, code yellow.

906
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,234
Pediatric testing.

907
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:48,650
This is a restricted area.
Do you have a pass?

908
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:49,810
Screw your pass.

909
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:51,251
It's all right.

910
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,412
Where is he?

911
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,285
Just stay calm.

912
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,790
How's her little boy doing?

913
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:57,382
He's fine, actually.

914
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,792
He came around
about ten minutes ago.

915
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:03,491
He seems to be suffering
from acute sleep deprivation.

916
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:06,000
I don't think
she ever lets him sleep.

917
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,331
What are you saying?

918
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:08,597
Where is he?

919
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:13,203
I've got someone here
who wants to see you.

920
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:27,853
Are you OK, champ?

921
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,915
Can we go get Rex now?

922
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,426
The bad man's getting
awful close.

923
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,196
I know he is.

924
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,097
We're gonna go get Rex
right now.

925
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,863
I'm afraid Dylan should
stay here until we know...

926
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,497
what's causing these episodes.

927
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,700
I'm sure you understand.

928
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:51,405
Good.

929
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,115
I'll tell you what.

930
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,849
I'm gonna go home
and get Rex right now.

931
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,050
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

932
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,752
Right across the freeway.

933
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:05,919
That's right.

934
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,428
I won't be gone long...

935
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:10,056
and Julie's gonna stay here
with you.

936
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:11,463
Yeah, you bet.

937
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,601
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.

938
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:22,074
I promise. Cross my heart.

939
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,907
But, Dylan...

940
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:26,380
until Mommy gets back...

941
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,178
whatever you do...

942
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,649
don't fall asleep.

943
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:34,812
Julie, don't let him
out of your sight.

944
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,585
What's going on?
Your hair's turning gray.

945
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,393
Julie, keep him awake.

946
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,166
Understand?

947
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,801
Excuse me, miss.
Would you come with us?

948
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,605
What? Hey!

949
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,669
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

950
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:59,476
Get your hands off me!

951
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,078
Do you mind?
What the hell is this?

952
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,110
Just a quick word...

953
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:07,985
for Dylan's sake.

954
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:17,126
We've had an exciting day,
haven't we?

955
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,268
This one?

956
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,362
Right there.

957
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,437
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

958
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,206
You won.

959
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,720
Would you mind stepping outside
for one moment?

960
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:46,387
As a matter of fact, I would.

961
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,725
What are you doing?

962
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:50,891
It's just a little shot
to see that he sleeps.

963
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,900
No. His mother
specifically said...

964
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,936
- I said no.
- Do it.

965
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,036
All done.

966
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,737
He'll be asleep soon.

967
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:06,612
- Would you let go of my arm?
- You bitch!

968
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,247
Hey, you can't do that!

969
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:18,716
I know what's in that one.
Do you know what's in this one?

970
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,661
Or what's gonna happen to you
when I stick you with it?

971
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,494
And I will.

972
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:34,064
I want you to stay awake, OK?

973
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:37,044
Keep your eyes open for me.
Come on.

974
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:43,584
Has there been any use
of recreational drugs...

975
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,677
in your family?

976
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,212
Or any history
of mental disturbance?

977
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,553
What are you asking?

978
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,152
Please, don't take it wrong.

979
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,323
If there was,
there's a good chance...

980
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,197
Dylan could be suffering from
something passed down to him.

981
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:04,301
Have you been suffering
from any delusional events?

982
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:13,076
This man from your films...

983
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,140
Freddy Krueger.

984
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,644
Have you been seeing him?

985
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,556
Would you get those keys
down here?

986
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,690
I want you to stay awake.

987
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,597
Keep your eyes open for me.

988
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:34,864
Where's Mommy?

989
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,564
She'll be back. Now stay awake.

990
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:42,066
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.

991
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:44,101
We could...

992
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:47,309
put Dylan in foster care
for a short while.

993
01:19:47,349 --> 01:19:50,375
Just long enough to run
some tests on you.

994
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:53,012
Keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, OK?

995
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:56,046
Come on. You can stay awake.
Stay awake for me.

996
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,718
I want you to stay awake.

997
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:59,659
Keep your eyes open.

998
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:05,557
Dylan, what's the matter?

999
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,904
Julie, behind you.

1000
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,303
There's nothing there.

1001
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:21,645
Dylan, what's wrong?

1002
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,119
Dylan, stop it.
You're scaring me.

1003
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,816
I want my son out of here
right now.

1004
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:34,986
Very well.

1005
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,658
As soon as we can gather
the appropriate papers.

1006
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,428
You don't understand.

1007
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:41,458
If Dylan falls asleep, then...

1008
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,404
I got it.

1009
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,251
Dylan, get out of here!

1010
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,024
Ever play skin the cat?

1011
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:27,241
Come on.

1012
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:40,389
Help me.

1013
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:49,700
Mom!

1014
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,230
Rex!

1015
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:54,640
What the hell's going on?

1016
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,670
You can't go in there. No.

1017
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:01,809
Wait, wait.

1018
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:08,856
Code yellow
to pediatric testing.

1019
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,990
Where's my son?!

1020
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,227
Where is he?!

1021
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,736
Have you seen my son?

1022
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:25,035
He was just here.

1023
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,199
The boy.

1024
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:28,937
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.

1025
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,911
He doesn't have to be awake
to be on his feet.

1026
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,244
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot.

1027
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,182
He's fully capable of walking
out of this hospital.

1028
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:37,377
Oh, shit.

1029
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,529
John, it's Heather.
I need your help.

1030
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,101
Why? What happened?

1031
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,830
Dylan's run away
from the hospital.

1032
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,566
I don't know if he's wandering
or headed for the house...

1033
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,039
but I think Freddy's after him.

1034
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,736
I know that sounds crazy, but...

1035
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,641
You're right. That sounds crazy.

1036
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,108
Oh, my God.

1037
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,690
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

1038
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,292
Right across the freeway.

1039
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:07,706
Krueger, you bastard!

1040
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:10,004
Take me!

1041
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,677
Are you OK?

1042
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:45,872
You OK?

1043
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,154
My son is out here!

1044
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,791
Let me go! Dylan!

1045
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:42,702
I'm sorry. What happened to you?
Are you all right?

1046
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,602
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?

1047
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,402
Take it easy, take it easy.

1048
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:48,432
Relax. He's right there.
What happened?

1049
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,136
Oh, God.

1050
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,843
What's going on, Heather?

1051
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:56,544
What in the world happened?

1052
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,746
I know how Chase really died.

1053
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:03,086
- What do you mean?
- Fred Krueger did it.

1054
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,794
Yeah. Sure.

1055
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,702
You saw him, didn't you?

1056
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,335
Coming for you

1057
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,470
Nancy, let's go outside.

1058
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,002
He'll be all right.

1059
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,047
I'll be right back.

1060
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,530
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?

1061
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:57,878
Why are you calling me Nancy,
John?

1062
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,073
Why are you calling me John?

1063
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,851
Nancy, pull yourself together...

1064
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,187
before you make yourself
and that kid nuts.

1065
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,061
Would you call Robert?

1066
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,366
Robert Englund.

1067
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:26,335
- The guy who plays Freddy.
- Freddy who?

1068
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,773
Freddy Krueger.

1069
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:32,544
Nancy, Freddy's dead.

1070
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:40,747
Don't start losing it
like your mother did.

1071
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:43,950
I love you, sweetheart.

1072
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,256
Don't forget that.

1073
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:58,365
I love you, too...

1074
01:27:58,406 --> 01:27:59,566
Daddy.

1075
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:31,196
Get yourself some rest,
Nancy, please.

1076
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:09,707
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

1077
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:20,144
Who's there?

1078
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,587
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.

1079
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:27,753
I'm gonna get the guy
who did it...

1080
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:30,764
and I want you to arrest him
when I bring him out, OK?

1081
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:34,461
Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

1082
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,265
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.

1083
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:37,737
Yeah, sure.

1084
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,336
Dylan's sleeping pills.

1085
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:16,699
Say how they find
their way back home.

1086
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:18,302
It's important.

1087
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,442
Breadcrumbs.

1088
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:27,881
Too late, Heather.

1089
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,415
Too late.

1090
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:31,809
Join you.

1091
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:36,083
You've given me a way
to join you.

1092
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:18,675
Almost there.

1093
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,054
"The more she read,
the more she realized...

1094
01:35:03,097 --> 01:35:06,498
"what she had in her hands
was nothing more or less...

1095
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,798
"than her life itself.

1096
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:11,862
"That everything she had
experienced and thought...

1097
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:14,170
"was bound within these pages."

1098
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:19,244
"There was no movie.

1099
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,443
"There was only... her life."

1100
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:25,846
It's just me.

1101
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:32,622
Are you OK? Are you all right?

1102
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,453
Where's the man?

1103
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:36,122
I don't know.

1104
01:35:36,163 --> 01:35:38,859
He had me,
but then he let me go.

1105
01:35:42,103 --> 01:35:43,900
Meet your maker.

1106
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:57,040
Pick a pet for the rugrat,
bitch.

1107
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:10,257
Fuck you!

1108
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:15,699
Get over there, Dylan!

1109
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,686
Take this!

1110
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:54,073
Come here, my piggy.
I got some gingerbread for you.

1111
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:15,655
Gotcha!

1112
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:32,335
Where's your mommy,
piglet, huh, huh?

1113
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:38,011
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

1114
01:39:14,915 --> 01:39:16,576
Come to papa.

1115
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:23,085
Gonna eat you up.

1116
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,708
Leave him alone!

1117
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:07,166
Dylan, get out of there!

1118
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:06,485
Push!

1119
01:41:33,353 --> 01:41:34,615
Run!

1120
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:08,882
Are you OK?

1121
01:42:14,728 --> 01:42:16,662
Honey, honey.

1122
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:21,666
Oh, my God.

1123
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:24,933
We're saved. The witch is dead.

1124
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:28,339
And his mother covered him
with kisses, and they were safe.

1125
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:41,451
"Heather...

1126
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:44,321
"thanks for having the guts
to play Nancy one last time.

1127
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:47,885
"At last Freddy's back
where he belongs.

1128
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:49,896
"Regards, Wes."

1129
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:07,879
Is it a story?

1130
01:43:07,915 --> 01:43:10,907
Yeah. It's a story.

1131
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,680
Read me some.

1132
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:18,685
"We open on an old wooden bench.

1133
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:21,421
"There's fire and tools...

1134
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:23,691
"and a man's grimy hands...

1135
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:28,531
"building what soon is revealed
as a gleaming set of claws.

1136
01:43:28,569 --> 01:43:30,901
"And the claws are moving now...

1137
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:35,966
"as if awakening
from a long and unwanted sleep.

1138
01:43:36,009 --> 01:43:39,968
"Then the man lays one trembling
hand flat upon the table...

1139
01:43:40,013 --> 01:43:44,279
"and with his other
picks up a thick, sharp blade.

1140
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:49,051
"Behind the lights,
faces watch from the darkness...

1141
01:43:49,089 --> 01:43:53,526
"ready to laugh
or scream in terror."
