1
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,632
There is no God!

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,391
Forgive me.

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,514
Give me a sign.

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,558
Help me.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,235
Maureen. Maureen, where are you, dear?.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,870
Maureen, where are you?.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,430
Oh dear God. She's up there.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,558
Maureen!

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,871
Stay where you are!

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,918
Don't move!

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,269
Stay where you are.
- Come down!

12
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,555
There is no God!

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,599
Wretched girl, how dare you!
- Get away from me!

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,831
Please, Maureen. You mustn't.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,074
You have an obligation to Him.
- I have nothing.

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,917
I am nothing.
- You can't. - No!

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,076
Wasn't your own sin red enough?.
You'll burn in hell for this!

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,789
You'll burn in hell!

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,399
Maureen!

20
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,354
Want a ride?. Or do you have
the Olympic torch in the suitcase?.

21
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,755
Wouldn't want to lose ya.

22
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,999
Don't worry.
I ain't born again or nothing.

23
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,597
I'll get this junk out of your way.

24
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,389
Jesus just come with it
when I bought her used.

25
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,554
I wanted to replace it
with a magnetic compass,

26
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,554
but you usually end up
going the wrong direction anyway.

27
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,599
That makes two of us.
- Yeah?.

28
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,394
Water?.
- Thank you.

29
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,912
Name's Duane Duke, by the way.
Friends just call me Duke.

30
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,716
Put the suitcase in the back seat.
- Thank you.

31
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,151
Hey, watch the guitar!
- I'm sorry.

32
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,838
No harm done.
Just watch out. It's my life.

33
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,677
Going to LAA to be a rock-n-roll star.
What about you?. Where you going?.

34
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,117
What were you doing back there?.
- l...

35
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,399
Car trouble?.
- Yes. I had car trouble.

36
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,233
What kind?.

37
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,390
AAh, no car.
- No car?. That's the worst kind.

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,997
Still don't know where you come from.
- So?.

39
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,279
AAre you my Father confessor?.
- Jesus,

40
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,958
I was just asking! You act as if
I accused you of murder or something.

41
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,712
Hey, it's none of my business.
Play mystery lady if you want.

42
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,591
I don't care where you come from.
Could've fallen from the sky.

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,878
AA little angel
just tumbled off her cloud.

44
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,478
Well, hold on angel,
I'll get you where you're going.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,797
Get out of here!

46
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,791
Come on, baby.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,150
You alright?.
- Yes.

48
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,192
What are you doing?. - It's as
far as we go in this shit, honey.

49
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,434
But it could rain all night.
- That's right.

50
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,511
Better get some sleep.

51
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,677
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

52
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,429
You kind of slid over.

53
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,956
It's still raining.

54
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,671
Why did you do that?.
- Why didn't you stop me?.

55
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,470
I didn't have time.
- I'll give you another chance.

56
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,076
I'm not very good at this.
- You could have fooled me.

57
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,318
Please don't!

58
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,317
Oh, well, I guess
we got him a little excited.

59
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,869
Don't!

60
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,795
No!

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,719
What's the problem, angel?.

62
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,636
Get away from me!

63
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,431
AAre you crazy?. Get in here!
- Give me my suitcase.

64
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,669
Stupid bitch!

65
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,197
You could've been coming
instead of going.

66
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,236
AAre you really my mother?.
- The name Spool means nothing to you?.

67
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,076
No. Should it?.
- It was Norma Bates' maiden name.

68
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,835
The woman you thought was
your mother was my sister.

69
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,516
She never mentioned me, did she?.
- No.

70
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,275
You sure you won't have a sandwich?.

71
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,118
Pardon?.

72
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,674
Hi there.

73
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,397
Be right down.

74
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,275
Room?.

75
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,319
I'd love one,
but I don't think I can afford it.

76
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,632
You should keep the register closed.
Somebody'll steal you blind.

77
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,793
Wouldn't get them very far.
- Business slow?.

78
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,830
You're my first customer of the day.
Or did you just need directions?.

79
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,153
I was actually interested in the sign.
But if business is bad...

80
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,075
No, it's not bad, just slow.

81
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,914
Well, 12 cabins, 12 vacancies...
We've been closed for a while.

82
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,153
Renovations.
But life's picking up along here.

83
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,391
Good prices, good service.
Things'll pick up.

84
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,236
I've got a rebuilt ice machine,
and 4 cabins booked for this week.

85
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,350
Fairvale High's Homecoming.
Big game against Central.

86
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,551
I'm rattling on.
Yes, there is a job. Interested?.

87
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,033
In money?. The only honest way
to get it is to earn it or inherit it.

88
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,830
AAnd I don't have any rich relatives.
Got an application form?.

89
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,674
Not necessary. My name is Norman,

90
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,957
Norman Bates.

91
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,233
What'ya been painting?.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

92
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,191
Step into the back while I clean up.
- Said the spider to the fly.

93
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,313
Local branch of the AAudubon society?.
- My hobby. Stuffing things.

94
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,838
Have a seat...
- Duane Duke. Just call me Duke.

95
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,396
I can pay you 5 dollars an hour.

96
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,395
You'd work the desk,
make beds, clean up. Stuff like that.

97
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,310
Want some of these?.
You'd be general assistant.

98
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,190
Work's not too hard,
and you'd have lots of free time.

99
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,754
I'm the manager,
so you'd be assistant manager.

100
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,756
You'd get a free room and work days.
I prefer the nights.

101
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,116
I've got to be honest, Norm.
- Norman.

102
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,956
I just want to make enough bucks
to get my car fixed and

103
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,591
build up a little stake for LAA.
I'm a singer.

104
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,119
But I could fill in until you found
somebody permanent. I'm just not

105
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,999
staying too long.

106
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,673
No one ever does.

107
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,713
Your cabin's at the end.
Why don't you go unpack?.

108
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,953
I need to get back to the house.

109
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,999
You live up there?.
- Yeah.

110
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,591
Me and myself, alone.

111
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,874
You clear on the credit card machine?.
- Yeah, I used to be a pump jockey.

112
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,239
The rooms cost...
- 20.95 single, 25.95 double.

113
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,837
I'll bring you a couple of burgers.
- AAlright!

114
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,718
Still beats the hell out of me.
Just doesn't show up for work one day.

115
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,835
Thought you would've turned up
some clues by now, John.

116
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,234
Her apartment's all in order.
Didn't say anything to her landlord.

117
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,553
You'd think she'd tell me
if she was going to take a month off.

118
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,837
Emma Spool
was as regular as clockwork.

119
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,550
I don't think she missed a day
in the 7 years I've owned this dump.

120
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,750
I hope that nothing's happened to her.
- You mean like Norman Bates?.

121
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,470
Didn't they work here together?.
They say he likes older women.

122
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,675
Rumors and innuendo caused
that boy enough trouble.

123
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,390
What's your interest anyway?.
- I drove from LAA to see him.

124
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,792
Why?. You another relative
of somebody he killed?.

125
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,555
It's really not any of your business.

126
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,712
Keeping the peace is my business.

127
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,271
Then until I've broken some law,
lay off the third-degree, OK?.

128
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,148
Can't you just leave
the poor slob alone?.

129
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,588
What are you?. His fan club?.
- No, we believe in second chances.

130
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,992
What Norman did was a long time ago,
and he paid the price.

131
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,311
It depends on who you ask.

132
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,598
20 years in the bunk house
is paying the price, girly.

133
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,558
The guy's okay now.

134
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,032
When he worked here,
he was always on time and reliable.

135
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,556
AA real Employee of the Month!

136
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,354
Go ahead and talk smart, lady.
He just wants to be left in peace.

137
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,949
Now look, Norman Bates has suffered
enough. Just leave him...

138
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,356
AAfternoon, sheriff.
-... alone.

139
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,320
Mrs. Dudley...
- What'll it be, Norman?.

140
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,789
Chicken fried steak is good today.

141
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,239
AAlright, and a glass of milk, please.
AAnd a couple of burgers to go.

142
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,915
I'm warning you. I don't want trouble.

143
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,393
Then let go of my arm
or I'll holler police brutality.

144
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,477
Mind if I join you, Mr. Bates?.
Tracy Vanderbilt.

145
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,592
Thanks, Myrna.

146
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,235
Coastal Reports?.
- I write for them sometimes.

147
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,871
If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you
a few questions. - I mind.

148
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,750
Mr. Bates... - Norman.
- I'm writing on the insanity defense

149
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,799
and the rehabilitation
of mentally ill murderers.

150
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,113
Many people think
they can't be rehabilitated

151
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,715
and there shouldn't be
an insanity defense.

152
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,114
We hear the objections of the victims
and relatives, but the murderers,

153
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,878
who can't help themselves,
are victims too. What do you think?.

154
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,999
If this lady's bothering you,
I'll have her leave.

155
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,995
Isn't your coffee break over, sheriff?.

156
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,956
AAnything else, Norman?.

157
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,836
What do you think?.
- AAbout?. - What we were just saying.

158
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,392
You were incarcerated for 20 years.
- 22.

159
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,549
Right.
For 22 years, you were locked away.

160
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,394
The state says you're sane.
You paid your debt.

161
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,917
Then Lila Loomis starts
to persecute you. - Because of

162
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,197
what happened to her sister.
- Yes.

163
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,716
Marion Crane. Right?.

164
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,557
Right.
- But that was 20 years ago.

165
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,279
22.

166
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,353
AA long time to harbor revenge.

167
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,833
AAren't you bitter about
what Lila Loomis tried to do to you?.

168
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,274
I understand.

169
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,148
My cure
couldn't cure the hurt I caused.

170
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,711
My return to sanity
didn't return the dead.

171
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,076
There's no way
to make up that loss.

172
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,153
The past is never really past.

173
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,109
It stays with me all the time.
No matter how hard I try,

174
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,877
I can't escape. It's always there.
Throbbing inside you.

175
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,432
Coloring your perceptions of the world,
and sometimes controlling them.

176
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,671
That's my point, Norman. You have

177
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,833
a conscience. You live with guilt.
You punish yourself all the time.

178
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,996
Why does the rest of society have to?.

179
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,995
Take Mrs. Spool's disappearance.
What if a well-meaning citizen

180
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,834
thought that
you had something to do with it?.

181
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,793
I'm not upsetting you, Norman?.
AAll this talk

182
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,475
is only hypothetical.
- What's yours, babe?.

183
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,190
She is only an example
of how people might,

184
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,431
given your past history,

185
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,357
tend to automatically blame you
for any murder in the area.

186
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,432
You're not going, Norman?.
I'd like to talk to you again.

187
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,033
You're not going to stiff us, Norman?.

188
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,196
Excuse me. Could you tell me,
is there a cheap place to stay here?.

189
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,508
Hello, angel.

190
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,353
You work here?.

191
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,479
It's called suffering for one's art.
I'm sorry about last night.

192
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,519
I was a little road-weary.
I'm glad you didn't drown.

193
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,239
I'm so very tired.

194
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,438
You won't find another place close.

195
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,560
Don't worry. AAside from total boredom,
nothing will happen to you here.

196
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,397
Maureen Coil. Pretty name.

197
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,754
How much?.
- For a single, $25.95.

198
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,509
There you go, angel.
Enjoy your stay.

199
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,748
Your type, Norm?.
- You gave her Cabin 1.

200
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,829
Makes it kind of cosy.

201
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,949
Clean her up a little,
she'll look pretty good.

202
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,399
Put me closer to the window.
- Someone will see you, Mother.

203
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,995
AAre you ashamed of me?.

204
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,756
You know why, Mother. They've
even written about you in the paper.

205
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,948
Stop your whining, boy.
AAll this fuss over nothing.

206
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,115
Not nothing. I saw her.

207
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,036
Even the initials on the suitcase.
M.C., Marion Crane.

208
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,275
AAnother of your cheap,
erotic delusions.

209
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,309
You killed her.
The slut deserved it. But she's dead.

210
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,756
AAnd the dead don't come back.

211
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,799
You came back.
- I never went away.

212
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,716
Don't you know that by now?.
You can't get rid of me.

213
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,630
I'll always be with you, Norman.

214
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,799
AAlways.

215
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,119
Stand up straight and
wipe your snotty little nose.

216
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:31,753
If the disgusting little whore upsets
you so much, just get rid of her.

217
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,115
No!

218
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,839
Then maybe I will.

219
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,953
You have an obligation, Maureen.
Maureen, don't!

220
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,430
There is no God.

221
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,914
Please Maureen, you mustn't.
Get away. You'll burn in hell.

222
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,154
You have an obligation.
I have nothing.

223
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,358
I am nothing.

224
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,239
What'll it be?.
- Give me a beer.

225
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,155
Hi.

226
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,394
I'm Duane.
- No kidding?.

227
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,397
AAny objections
to a guy buying you a drink?.

228
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,270
I got a drink.
- So have another.

229
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,353
You got a limit?.
- Only to my patience.

230
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,309
You don't have to call me Duane.
- No, I don't. - Friends call me Duke.

231
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,597
I had a dog named Duke once.
- Really?.

232
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,437
Scratch my belly, my leg'll shake.
- I hated the mutt.

233
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,476
Keep the matches, lady. You need 'em.
You're as warm as a cry for help.

234
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,119
Just a minute. Duke. AAh, Duane.

235
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,392
Whatever. I'm easy.
- I've noticed.

236
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,109
You staying there?.
- Working there.

237
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,598
Even better.

238
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,396
Let's sit down. I'll buy.

239
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,556
Help.

240
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,352
Help me!

241
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,591
Miserere mei, Deus.

242
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,917
Miserere mei, Deus.

243
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,911
Forgive me.

244
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,068
I figured Bates was a geek.
But a full-fledged loony tune?.

245
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,917
You think he offed this Spool broad?.
- Well, he acted pretty weird.

246
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,199
But then he's pretty a weird guy.
- No shit.

247
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,195
So you'll pay me for...
- AAnything I can use. - How about:

248
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,637
AA girl checked in this afternoon.
Nice looker, too. When Norman saw her,

249
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,077
he kind of freaked.
Strolling down memory lane.

250
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,710
AAre you leaving so soon?.
- I'm afraid so.

251
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,635
Don't you want to work this off
in trade?. I'll credit your account.

252
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,793
You shouldn't rely so much
on that face and those pearly whites,

253
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,876
because come-ons like that
could get them punched out.

254
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,750
Forgive me.

255
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,118
You're alright.
You're in St. Matthew's Hospital.

256
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,515
I'm Father Brian.
I'm the resident psychiatrist.

257
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,639
Maureen,
do you know who saved you?.

258
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,829
Mary.

259
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,318
I'm sure she had a hand in it.
But there was someone else.

260
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,030
You ought to be real proud, Norman.
- Yes, it was very heroic.

261
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,477
How do you happen to be here?.
- Just my dumb luck.

262
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,998
I saw the ambulance leaving the motel
and wanted to see what was up.

263
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,676
Must've been disappointing for you.
- How did Norman find out?.

264
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,789
Towels. - Towels.
- Yes, he took her some fresh towels.

265
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,035
Now I do know my job, Ms. Vanderbilt.
- Mr. Bates, she wants to see you.

266
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,799
I wouldn't pick out a silverware
pattern just yet, sheriff.

267
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,595
You found me, Mr. Bates.

268
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,389
Norman.

269
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,669
My name's Maureen.

270
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,830
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

271
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,870
I can't have that going on
in my motel. It gives it a bad name.

272
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,400
Please don't take it the wrong way,
Marion. I'm sorry, I mean, Maureen.

273
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,675
I'm sorry.
- I did leave the bathroom a mess.

274
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,160
I've seen it worse.
- I'm sorry.

275
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,630
I'm sorry to be such a bother.

276
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,918
Oh, you're no bother.
No bother at all.

277
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,312
People should look out
for each other, don't you think?.

278
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,872
Sometimes we get lost.
But if there'd only been someone

279
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,556
to help us understand,
then maybe we wouldn't do

280
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,315
some of the sad, awful things we do.

281
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,997
You're very kind.

282
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,119
You should rest.

283
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,950
Do you have somewhere to go
when you get out?.

284
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,235
If you want, you can stay
at the motel until you're better.

285
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,838
FOC, of course. Free of charge.
AAs long as you like. It's never full.

286
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,118
It would give you
a chance to sort things out.

287
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,431
Why are you so kind to me?.

288
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,118
You remind me of someone I knew once.

289
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,759
You don't know me.
AAfter the way you found me,

290
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,232
you must think I'm mad.
- No, no.

291
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,878
We all go a little mad, sometimes.

292
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,795
But sometimes...

293
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,758
the despair is just so overwhelming,

294
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,470
that all you want is for it to stop.

295
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,995
I'd like to stay at your motel
for a few days, if you don't mind.

296
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,117
I'm glad you're safe.
- Thank you.

297
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,518
Thank you for looking out for me.

298
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,639
Sure.

299
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,630
You were down there, Mother.
Weren't you?.

300
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,318
I'm glad she didn't die. I'm glad.

301
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,231
She will.

302
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,358
Don't you touch her. Never!

303
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,911
Be quiet or someone will hear us.
- Let them.

304
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,952
Let them hear.
- They sure like the TV up loud.

305
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,916
I'm sorry.

306
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,357
AAre you okay?.
- Yeah.

307
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,718
I usually keep this locked
when no one's here.

308
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,795
Mommy's little helper. Very sweet.

309
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,916
You always watch TV so loud?.

310
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,993
Oh, the TV, yeah.

311
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,715
Who are you?.

312
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,430
AA friend of Duke's?.
- We're getting to know each other.

313
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,550
Why don't you come and
join our party?.

314
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,669
Oh, no. No, thanks.

315
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,633
Too bad. Thanks for looking after me.

316
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,996
See you around, maybe.

317
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,679
Oh my God.

318
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,793
Maybe!

319
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,039
Hey,

320
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,988
watch the guitar.

321
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,312
Oh God, don't tell me you're of those
who farts, rolls over and sleeps.

322
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,110
I picked you up in a bar.
What, you want to get married?.

323
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,715
You shithead!

324
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,396
I got to get up for work soon.
Just go home.

325
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,791
How?.
You brought me out here.

326
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,158
Here's the cab fare.
Phone book's on the table.

327
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,997
You make it all sound so cheap.
- It is, but it beats a vibrator.

328
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,190
Yeah?.
AAt least a vibrator gets me off.

329
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,479
Use the payphone, bitch.
- Ouch. Let go!

330
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,995
Give me my clothes. Bastard!

331
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,518
You fucking idiot!

332
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,319
Oh shit.

333
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,119
No! Help!

334
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,834
We're unable to complete
your call as dialed.

335
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,435
Please hang up and dial again.

336
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,635
Mother! Oh God, Mother!

337
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,996
Blood, blood!

338
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,631
Up early, huh?.

339
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,912
When I was young, my parents
always made all my decisions.

340
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,838
Becoming a nun was my idea.

341
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,274
But as my final vows grew closer,
it became so frightening.

342
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,353
I began to dwell upon things
that I would never know.

343
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,398
What things?.

344
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,551
Hungers for the flesh, Father.

345
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,997
It's perfectly normal.

346
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,073
Sister Catherine said
it was bad, and...

347
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,315
if my faith were strong enough,
that I wouldn't have evil thoughts.

348
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,871
Why didn't you just leave the
novitiate rather than be tormented?.

349
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,397
But the Church teaches us
to endure suffering.

350
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,109
It also teaches us
that suicide is a sin.

351
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,988
I knew it was wrong, Father.

352
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,951
I was afraid...

353
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,635
to face the consequences of my sins.

354
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:00,795
Maureen, it seems that only you
have given up on yourself, not God.

355
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,512
Why else would he have twice saved you
from your own desperateness?.

356
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,717
The other night,

357
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,992
as I lay there,

358
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,957
I saw the Virgin standing above me.

359
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,436
AA halo of white light was about her,

360
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,277
and she held a shiny, silver crucifix.

361
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,913
Her arms were outstretched
as if she were beckoning me.

362
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,756
Oh Father, what did she want of me?.

363
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,391
What about this?. - Maybe she got
change for the phone or cigarettes.

364
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,432
It might help if you knew her name.
- Forgot to ask.

365
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,310
It usually comes after "Hi, I'm Duane,
but you can call me Duke."

366
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,998
I'm more interested in those voices
you heard up at the house.

367
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,315
Maybe voices.
It could have been a TV or a radio.

368
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,319
Quite a crowd!
- Yeah, homecoming weekend.

369
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,439
They're celebrating the big victory.
The game's not until tonight.

370
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,957
Where are you going?. - You said
he's at the hospital picking her up.

371
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,477
Yeah. But what if he comes back?.

372
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,269
You don't know a thing.

373
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,236
Fairvale or Central?. Come on!
Where are you from?. - Fairvale.

374
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,599
Too bad. Hope you don't mind losing.

375
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,708
Ms. Vanderbilt!

376
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,713
AAfter you check in, come down to 4.
There's a party. We gonna beat you.

377
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,474
Ms. Vanderbilt, are you looking
for something?. - Just you.

378
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,589
Hoping we can finish our little chat.
- Your chats end up sounding

379
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,390
more like interrogations.
- AAnother time?. - No.

380
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,792
AAnd please, don't come back.

381
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh, Norman. How sweet of you.

382
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,393
You had them cleaned.
- They were a little wrinkled and wet.

383
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,791
AAnd a little out of style, too.

384
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,874
Oh, no. Conservative clothes

385
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,998
never go out of style.

386
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,994
I especially like that one.

387
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,312
You'd look swell in that tonight.

388
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,830
I think Mrs. Spool said she had
a son once. But he never visited her.

389
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,312
AAnd she never went anywhere.
- Never went out, huh?.

390
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,473
Just work. AA real homebody.

391
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,192
I've got a backed-up toilet in 6...
- Mind if I stay and snoop a bit?.

392
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,390
Why should l?. The cops have already
paraded through here and everything.

393
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,191
You can rent it for all I care.
Spoolie's rent was two weeks past due.

394
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,990
How much for just a couple of hours?.
- Thanks...

395
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,394
It's a pleasure to see a woman here
without blue hair and varicose veins.

396
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,792
Yeah.
- Just close the door when you leave.

397
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,758
Sure thing.

398
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,799
Bates Motel.

399
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,988
Hello?.

400
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,112
Hello?.

401
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,837
I'm going now. I won't be out late.

402
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,389
Mother?.

403
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,715
She's a nice girl.

404
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,918
I've never drunk this much before.
- Me neither.

405
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,518
My mother never allowed liquor
at home. - What can we toast to now?.

406
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,319
To happiness.

407
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,430
Would you like to dance?.
- Oh, no. No. I couldn't.

408
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,833
It's very easy.
My mother taught me. Come on.

409
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,993
I feel woozy.
- lt'll make you light on your feet.

410
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,468
Norman, I feel silly.
- Nothing wrong in that.

411
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,872
Just follow me.
I go forward, you go back.

412
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,716
Slow, slow, quick, quick...

413
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,597
See?. You just learned
your basic back step.

414
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,716
Slow, slow, quick, quick...

415
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,791
Oh well, they say
the wet-look is coming back.

416
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,917
How's the party going, Duke?.
- It's cool, Norm.

417
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,393
You mind hanging on for a while?.
- It's your overtime.

418
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,439
What's wrong?.

419
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,590
I must've had too much to drink.

420
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,719
I just thought
I saw a woman in your house.

421
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,313
It's okay, Duke. You can go now.

422
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,998
Whatever you say, boss.

423
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,398
Sorry, I can't offer you anything
to drink. - That's okay.

424
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,792
Except water.
- That's fine.

425
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,589
They're pretty loud.

426
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,597
I had a very special time tonight.
- Me too.

427
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,119
Thank you.

428
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,389
I should go.

429
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,272
Because of her?.
- Who?.

430
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,911
That lady you say I remind you of.

431
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,880
Did she mean a lot to you?.

432
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,831
We weren't...

433
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,708
It wasn't...

434
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,950
Iike it is with you.

435
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,835
How is it with me?.

436
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,158
What's wrong?.

437
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,919
I'm sorry, Maureen.

438
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,279
I can't do this.
It wouldn't be right.

439
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,678
Not just now.

440
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,355
It wouldn't be right?.

441
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,514
Let's just lie here...

442
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,990
and hold each other.

443
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,830
Sorry to wake you, honey, but
you fell asleep with the door open.

444
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,515
With all these horny bastards

445
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,392
running around here, it's not a good
idea. Just wanted to let you know.

446
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,278
Thank you.
- I'll close it on my way out.

447
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,955
You dirty, dirty boy!

448
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,148
But I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything, Mother.

449
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,916
She's a nice girl.
- She's a whore.

450
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,791
We didn't do anything.
- You let her come between us.

451
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,476
It isn't right. It isn't natural.

452
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,429
It's perfectly natural
for a son to love his mother.

453
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,389
Would you leave me alone, Mother!
Will you leave me alone!

454
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,995
Norman,
are you in there?. AAre you awake?.

455
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,631
It's me, Maureen.
- Bring me the knife, Norman.

456
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,148
Norman!

457
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,757
AAre you up there?.
- Bring it to me.

458
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:02,999
Did you hear me?. What are you doing?.

459
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,992
Can't you do it?.

460
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,914
Please answer me. It's Maureen.

461
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,156
What do you want?.
- What happened to you?.

462
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,994
AAre you alright?.
- Yes.

463
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,351
No... I'm feeling a little sick.

464
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,558
Let me come up.
- No. Get away!

465
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,398
I had a little too much to drink.
That's all. I just need to rest.

466
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,597
AAlright, Norman.

467
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,999
Please, Maureen,

468
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,675
go back to your room.

469
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,718
Lock your door.

470
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,718
Please!
- AAlright.

471
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,998
Stop! Stop!

472
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,795
You haven't changed in 15 years.
You're still disgusting.

473
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,475
Ruthie, all cheerleaders
boff the linemen.

474
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,590
I wasn't a cheerleader.
I was a majorette.

475
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,152
You can twirl on...

476
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,230
What?.
- You can twirl on my...

477
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,629
What?.

478
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,789
You can twirl on my baton.

479
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,193
Hey, cutie.

480
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,389
Hello?.

481
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,829
You have a john?.

482
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,989
Men!

483
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,153
Hey, where'd you come from?.

484
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,868
Geez, you scared the piss out of me.

485
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,437
Do you mind, sister?.

486
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,673
This is occupado.

487
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,394
Duke?.

488
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,235
Hey, innkeeper, I need change!
- Charlie, I got it.

489
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,119
Get away from me.

490
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,833
Looks like someone's getting lucky!

491
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,872
What's happening?.

492
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,998
Come on, Leo.

493
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,992
Don't go up there.
- Why?. Something's wrong with Norman?.

494
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,392
It's time somebody told you.

495
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,512
Good morning, Norman. It's a bit hot
to be sleeping so late, isn't it?.

496
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,956
We had a lot of revelers last night.
- I know.

497
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:37,909
One didn't come home.
Name is Patsy Boyle.

498
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:41,949
She came with a group of locals
to party after the game.

499
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,998
When they all left around 3,
nobody noticed that she wasn't there.

500
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,632
Someone's missing and you come to me.
- There have been other accusations.

501
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,235
From that reporter! She knows nothing.

502
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,315
That's what we're going to find out.
Now it's too hot to argue.

503
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,395
That rain made everything more muggy.
- Nothing back there. - Of course not.

504
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,995
Please get out of my house.
- Sorry, Norman.

505
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,269
We have the warrant.
It's in everybody's best interest.

506
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,589
Who's?. There's nothing here.
I didn't do anything.

507
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,152
Then there's nothing to worry about.
Norman, come back!

508
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,240
Get him, Leo. Doggone you!

509
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:48,829
Norman,
what the hell's the matter with you?.

510
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,959
Mother?.

511
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,193
I'm sorry, Norman.

512
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,676
AAll seems a little unnecessary now.
- That's okay.

513
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,959
Still no reason to get so...
so riled up.

514
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,590
We'll leave you alone now. AAgain,

515
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,072
I'm sorry. - That's not enough.
You just can't let it lie!

516
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:20,916
I've had enough
of this Nancy Drew horseshit.

517
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,229
I'm letting it lie and so are you.

518
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:29,948
Until I have evidence to the contrary,
both ladies are missing persons.

519
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,237
AAren't you going to question him?.

520
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,916
Why not drag the swamp?.
He dumped the last bodies there.

521
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,709
Don't tell me my job,
Ms. Vanderbilt.

522
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,236
Somebody has to.

523
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,872
You're not going to let him go?.
- Despite all your glib insinuations,

524
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,431
I don't have one iota of proof.
- He didn't do it.

525
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,434
Norman was with me
until 6 o'clock this morning.

526
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,990
Whatever happened to that girl,

527
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,437
he didn't have anything to do with it.
- Well, Miss,

528
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,189
had you told us sooner, you would
have saved us a lot of trouble.

529
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,478
No one asked me.
- Come on, Leo.

530
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,595
Bad time to beat the street, Norman.

531
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,833
You'd better follow
the sheriff's example.

532
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:19,598
I'm taking a passenger. Ready?.

533
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,193
She told you about me, didn't she?.
- Yes.

534
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,397
Where are you going?.

535
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,589
Father Brian said I could come stay
with him if I needed to.

536
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,070
Please let me go.

537
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,194
Mother!

538
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,789
Mother!

539
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,995
Mother, where are you?.

540
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,790
I love the silver
that shines in your hair.

541
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,159
AAnd the brow that's all furled
and wrinkled with care.

542
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,348
I kissed the dear fingers,
so toilworn for me.

543
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,515
Oh God bless you and keep you,
dear Mother...

544
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:09,589
Bates.

545
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,112
It doesn't scan, does it, Norman?.

546
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,995
But...

547
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,073
a lot of shit around here doesn't.

548
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,232
What are you doing with my mother?.

549
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,433
Don't you mean...

550
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,353
Mummy?.

551
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,188
You did a nice job on her, Norman.

552
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,795
Fresh as the day she was croaked.

553
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,950
Why?.

554
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,032
Just looking out for you.

555
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,512
AAnd yourself.
- I have ambitions, dreams.

556
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,480
But dreams don't come cheap nowadays.

557
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,235
I could have turned
Mom over to the cops,

558
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,950
but all I would have gotten
was a pat on the back.

559
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:57,594
That reporter
would've shelled out a few bucks,

560
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,596
and gotten the lion's share
of the credit, a five-figure salary,

561
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,195
and a big news job.

562
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,752
Fine for her dreams,
but what about mine?. No.

563
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:14,950
I figure Mama's greatest value to me
is in her value to you.

564
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,669
I don't have that kind of money.
- Don't gripe to me.

565
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,878
With that big piece of real estate
and this thriving business,

566
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:24,875
you could just sell an acre.

567
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,040
Please, Duke.
I want my mother back.

568
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,671
Take her. You know what I want.

569
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,478
AAnd you know what I'll do
if I don't get it.

570
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,757
I know.

571
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,032
I'm going to kill you,
you little freak.

572
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,716
You think I'm stupid, Duke?.

573
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,159
Even if I gave you money,
you'd still tell on Mother.

574
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,120
No one must know what she did.

575
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,352
She can't help it.

576
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,197
She can't help the things she does.
She's just an old lady.

577
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,192
AA sick, old lady.

578
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,958
Watch the guitar!

579
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,919
You shouldn't sneak up
on a guy like that, Duke. Duke?.

580
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,396
I didn't mean it.

581
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,668
You made me do this!
Your tainted blood in me!

582
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,152
Don't laugh at me, Mother.
Don't laugh at me.

583
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,715
I didn't even know she had any kids.
- Wasn't it on her job application?.

584
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,680
She was already here
when I bought the place 7 years ago.

585
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,312
Best waitress I ever had.
- She worked for the previous owner?.

586
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,190
Harvey Leech. - Where's he now?.
- He used to be in a nursing home.

587
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,797
Outside town.
- Probably dead now.

588
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,719
Spool?.
- Emma Spool.

589
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,510
She worked in your diner.
- Diner?.

590
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,512
Yeah, I had a diner once.
- Mrs. Spool used to work for you.

591
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,391
I had a woman named Spool
who used to work for me. AA waitress.

592
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,711
She come from that place.
- Place?.

593
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,669
That place for nuts. AAs-s-asylum.

594
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,275
Mrs Spool was in an asylum?.

595
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:03,797
AAsylum, that's it, asylum.

596
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,668
You know, she killed somebody.

597
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,358
Who?.
- Somebody. Husband?.

598
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:18,269
I don't recall. Good waitress, Spool.

599
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,789
AAre you sure, Maureen?.
- Oh yes.

600
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,237
Norman understands me.
He understands forgiveness.

601
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,235
I failed so many people, Father.
I won't fail him.

602
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,918
That's why Mary came to me
the night he saved my life.

603
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,470
It was a sign.

604
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,115
AAnd the woman in the window.
That must've been Mary too.

605
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,357
I'll be back, Mother.

606
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:34,032
Miserere mei, Deus...

607
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,591
I thought if she saw these copies
she might change her story.

608
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,351
Can I see her?.

609
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,398
I'm afraid not.

610
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,829
Norman!

611
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,798
Norman?. It's me.

612
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,710
I've come back.

613
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,358
I never should've gone away.

614
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,670
Whatever happened to you in your past,

615
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:16,231
I know you're good. You took a life,

616
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,074
but you also saved a life.

617
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,959
My life.

618
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,870
Let it be your life.

619
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:26,995
Oh, Norman!

620
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,790
What happened to you?.
- I slipped in the mud.

621
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,033
I slipped too.

622
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,159
I know I've hurt you.

623
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:41,790
Can you forgive me?.
- Norman!

624
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,830
Maureen?. Maureen?.

625
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,794
Mother!

626
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,119
Maureen?.

627
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,468
Get that whore out of my house!

628
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:11,475
Throw her down in the mud,
filth, where she belongs.

629
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,230
I'll get you for this, Mother.
I'll get you for this.

630
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,231
You haven't got the guts, boy.

631
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,311
You dumb, stupid,

632
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,280
naive girl.

633
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,397
Why can't you leave my poor son,
my Norman, alone?.

634
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,677
What set you off again, Norman?.
You killed Mrs. Spool, didn't you?.

635
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,518
Did she tell you
that she was your mother?.

636
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,832
She was crazy, Norman,
but she wasn't your mother.

637
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,992
Neither are you!

638
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,719
She was your aunt,
and in love with your father.

639
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:04,749
But your mother stole him
away from her. Emma Spool...

640
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:10,632
killed your father in a jealous rage
and kidnapped you as a baby.

641
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,993
She killed your father
because she thought you were hers.

642
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,798
The child
she should've had with him.

643
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,999
She was crazy.

644
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,996
They locked her away.
- It's lies, it's all lies.

645
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,953
She's a lying whore.
- Norman, where are you?.

646
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,157
She's a slut.

647
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,517
Don't let her talk about me like that.

648
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,398
Norman, please listen to me!

649
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,836
Norman, Mrs. Bates! Whoever you are.
It doesn't matter to me.

650
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,118
Get her, boy.
Get her, just like the others!

651
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,590
Get her!
- No! No!

652
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,312
Don't! Don't! Please! Norman!

653
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,709
No!

654
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,198
Norman, can't you do anything right?.

655
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,556
How dare you treat your mother
in such ways.

656
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,833
So, I don't have the guts, huh?.

657
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,872
I was for you, Norman.
Believed in you.

658
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:14,672
You made a fool of me.
Look what you did to yourself!

659
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,672
Why, Norman, why?.

660
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,834
Good God, son,
you'll never get out again.

661
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,792
They're going to lock you up forever.

662
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:30,432
But I'll be free.
I'll finally be free.
