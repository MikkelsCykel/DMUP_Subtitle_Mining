give your pants a nice double stitch.

307
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,829
It'll make 'em real strong
and you're gonna look real sharp.

308
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:49,234
- No, single stitch is fine.
- But double stitch, she last forever.

309
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,811
Why on earth would I want
a double stitch?

310
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,779
To pad your account.
Single stitch is fine.

311
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,616
Damn.

312
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,493
[Sings]

313
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,999
What the heck?
Mr Moosburger is such a nice man,

314
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,897
I'm gonna give him
a double stitch anyway. [chuckles]

315
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,767
That's some strong stitch, you bet.

316
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,545
<i>[Laughter]</i>

317
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,927

[Mussburger laughs]

320
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,843
The Einstein of Enterprise.

00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,382
The Edison of Industry.

The Billion-Dollar Oranium.

323
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,654
Idea Man.

324
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,384
Not one of you mugs
has given me a story on him.

325
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:29,260
Bunch of lamebrained... Facts,
figures, charts never sold a newspaper.

326
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:33,198
This morning's edition of the <i>Argus,</i>
I'd wrap a fish in it.

327
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,100
I'd use it as kindling.
I'd train my poodle on it,

328
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,572
if he wasn't a French poodle
and partial to <i>Paris Soir.</i>

329
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,907
I wouldn't shell out a nickel
to read the darned thing.

330
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,638
Ohief, give us a break.

331
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,875
Sure, Tibbs. Take a break.

332
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,554
Go to Florida. Lie in the sun.

333
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,485
Wait for a coconut to drop.
File a story on it.

334
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,626
Better than your piece
on the Oommie grain surplus.

335
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,421
The human angle,
that's what sells papers.

336
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,192
We need a front page with a heart.
The Idea Man can put it there.

337
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,959
If we had more access...

338
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,661
If a frog had wings
it wouldn't bump its ass.

339
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,740
I don't want excuses, I want results.
What makes the Idea Man tick?

340
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,604
Where's he from?
I want to know everything.

341
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,476
- Has he got a girl? Parents?
- Everybody has parents.

342
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:19,672
Right.

343
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,718
How many? How about it, Parkinson?
You've been awful quiet.

344
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,124
- Er...
- Still waters run deep.

345
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,555
Only things deep are his ear-holes.

346
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,729
Yes, Idea Man.

347
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:35,421
What are his hopes and dreams?
His desires and aspirations?

348
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,898
Does he think all the time
or a portion of the day?

349
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,799
What's his shoe size?
Where does he sleep?

350
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,133
Does he putjam on his toast or not?

351
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,367
If not, why not? And since when?

352
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,343
Well?

353
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,777
You're useless.

354
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,214
Yes, Idea Man.
Oreator. Innovator.

355
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,945
Oerebrator.

356
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,783
- [Woman] Fake.
- Huh?!

357
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,753
I tell you, the guy's a phony.

358
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,587
- [Ohief] Phony?
- As a $3 bill.

359
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,228
- Says who?
- Amy Archer.

360
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,297
Why is he an idea man?
Because Hudsucker says so?

361
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,626
Why can't anyone interview him?

362
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,532
Five buck says
she mentions her Pulitzer.

363
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,501
Again? You're on.

364
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:20,667
Take a look at the mug on this guy.
The simian forehead, the idiotic grin.

365
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:22,972
He has a face only a mother could love.

366
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,576
On pay day. The only story here is
how this guy made a monkey out of you.

367
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,811
Monkey or not, I'm still editor.

368
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:34,047
What about your FBI piece?
"When Will Hoover Marry?"

369
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,227
I filed it yesterday.

370
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,726
Do a follow-up:
"Hoover: Orime-buster or Pantywaist?"

371
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:43,331
The rest of you mugs
get me that Idea Man story.

372
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,059
Hal, he's the bunk.

373
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,310
I'll stake my Pulitzer on it.

Say, where'd you get the new duds?

00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,816
How'd old Bucketbutt
like his blue letter?

377
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:05,113
Did he bust a gut? Die?
Hello, Mr Mussburger.

378
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,190
- Lobby. We haven't got all day.
- Right away, sir.

379
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,418
How are you this fine morning, sir?

380
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,792
It's been a pleasure
serving you today, sir.

381
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,592
Pleasure serving you, too... buddy.

382
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:22,137
Sid, shouldn't we be concerned
with the downward spiral of our stock?

383
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,400
You're the expert, but at Muncie...

384
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,737
Relax. It's only natural,
in a period of transition,

385
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,039
for the timid to run for cover.

386
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,775
You're the expert.
But do you remember the plan I outlined

387
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:37,510
the day I set fire to your office...
the day I was promoted?

388
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,250
I do remember, and I was impressed,
but that's all forgotten now.

389
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,223
Thank you.

390
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,332
I mention it because it would require
such a small investment.

391
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,867
- Again, you're the expert...
- Damn it, where's my car?

392
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,767
...demographics, baby boom,
burgeoning middle class...

393
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,069
I'd like to bounce the idea
off a few people.

394
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:05,238
Sure, sure. Whoever you want.
I'd like to hear about it, too.

395
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,418
[Tyres screech]

- I got gas, Benny.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,266
[Lou] No kiddin', Benny. I got gas.

398

Enter the dame.

401
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,401
[Benny] There's one in every story.

402
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,741
[Lou] Ten bucks says
she's looking for a hand-out.

403
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,349
[Benny] Twenty bucks says not here,
she don't find one.

404
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,145
- [Lou] Looking for her mark.
- [Benny] She finds him.

405
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,188
[Lou] She sits down... and orders...

406
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,155
a light lunch.

407
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,956
- [Benny] How will she pay for lunch?
- [Lou] She looks through her purse.

408
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:58,191
- [Benny] No money.
- [Lou] The mark notices.

409
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,271
- [Lou] He's not noticing, Benny.
- [Benny] Maybe he's wise.

410
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,839
[Lou] He don't look wise.

411
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,311
[Benny] Plan 2.
Here come the waterworks.

412
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,846
- [Lou] Yellowstone.
- [Benny] Old Faithful.

413
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,711
[Lou] Hello, Niagara.

414
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,580
- [Benny] He notices.
- [Lou] She's distressed.

415
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:22,886
- [Benny] He's concerned.
- [Lou] She explains her predicament...

416
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,823
[both] Enter the light lunch.

417
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,433
- [Benny] She's got other problems.
- [Lou] There's illness in the family.

418
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,764
- [Benny] Her mother needs an operation.
- [Lou] Urgently.

419
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:36,166
- [Benny] Adenoids.
- [Lou] No, Benny.

420
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:41,342
- [Lou] Lumbago.
- [Benny] That gag's got whiskers on it.

421
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,505
- [Lou] Uh-oh. He ain't bitin', Benny.
- [Benny] She's losing him.

422
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:49,619
- [Lou] Maybe he's wise.
- [Benny] He don't look wise.

423
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:53,086
- [Lou] How does she pull this out?
- [Benny] He's gettin' away.

424
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,249
- [Lou] She'd better think fast.
- [Benny] She isn't...

425
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,758
[both] She is!

426
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:03,559
- She's good, Benny.
- She's damn good, Lou.

427
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,998
Oan I get you boys anything else?

428
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,934
Bromo.

429
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,608
Bromo.

430
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,972
[Amy] Sorry about the stairs,
it was that horrible elevator boy.

431
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,013
I so much appreciate
your listening to my story.

432
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:25,052
I'm so lucky to find someone
with a stout heart and a ready ear.

433
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:29,692
There I was traveling the country.
Some I met were kind, others cruel.

434
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,362
Traveling by bus, rail, even thumb...

435
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,894
Oouch, please.

436
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,431
Hoarding dollars,
counting nickels, pinching pennies.

437
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,399
It's been a long road
to that coffee-shop.

438
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,836
Not that I'd trade a day,
an hour, a moment of it.

439
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,875
What came over me? The shock
of eating after so long without.

440
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,809
The enzymes kicking in after so long...

441
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,280
- [Norville pants]
- [Inaudible]

442
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:58,649
But you couldn't possibly know
what it is to be tired and hungry.

443
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:02,815
- [Wheezes] Hungry, anyway.
- I won't bore you with my story.

444
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm jobless, not for want of trying;
friendless, no one to take care of me.

445
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,059
Had you not come along,
at the moment you did...

446
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,770
- [Norville] I...
- I arrived not ten days ago

447
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,236
full of dreams,
anxious to make my way in the world.

448
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:21,002
A little naive but with determination
and a solid work ethic,

449
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,645
and an indomitable belief in the future,

450
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,080
only to have that optimism
dashed against the modern workplace.

451
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,880
- Such is life. Seek and ye shall find.
- Oigarette?

452
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:36,549
No. Work and ye shall prosper.
The watchwords of my education.

453
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,992
The ethos of my tender years,
the values instilled in me

454
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,395
while I grew up in a town
you've probably never heard of.

455
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,034

- Adenoids?
- Lumbago.

Just the person I want to apologize to.

No, no. He's no faker.

As pure a specimen
as I've ever run across.

512
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,204
OK. If I'm not an expert,
my name isn't Amy Archer

513
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,870
and I never won the Pulitzer Prize.

514
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,879
In 1957.

515

My... Oh, my series
on the reunited triplets.

- Three letters: A flightless bird...
- Not now, I'm busy.

518
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:35,064
I said hammerhead, a ten-letter word
for a bullying newspaper man.

519

Gnu. G-N-U.

State Building with a guide.

Here comes the gravy.

522

The chump really likes me.
A Muncie girl.

523

- Better off falling for a rattlesnake.
- He's a patsy, but what for?

524
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,380
There's a real story here,
some kind of plot, a cabbala.

525
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,552
- And did I tell you?
- Money?

526
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,655
- A sawbuck.
- 10 smackers! Let's grab a highball.

00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,415
On Norville Barnes.

528
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,415
Oopy!

529
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,283
Miss Smith,
would you come in and take a letter?

530
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,860
Of all the cockamamie...

531
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:43,093
Did you see the front page
of today's <i>Argus?</i>

532
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,396
I didn't bother to read the article.
The picture didn't do you justice.

533
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,938
The picture's fine. It's what
that knuckleheaded dame wrote.

534
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,940
Of all the irresponsible...
Take this down.

535
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,079
Dear Miss Archer,

536
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,808
I call you "miss" because
you've missed the boat completely.

537
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,043
How would you know if I'm an imbecile

538
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:06,155
if you haven't the guts
to interview me man-to-man?

539
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,451
Ohange that to "face-to-face".
No, "eye-to-eye".

540
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,092
And guts to "decency".

541
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:15,095
Speculation about my intelligence,
preposterous inventions,

542
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:18,894
are better suited to the pages
of <i>Amazing Tales</i> Magazine.

543
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:23,836
If the editors of <i>The Argus</i> publish
the rantings of a disordered mind,

544
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,943
perhaps they will publish
this letter, but I doubt it,

545
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:31,104
as I doubt also you could find
a home at <i>Amazing Tales,</i>

546
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,182
a periodical
which I have enjoyed for many years.

547
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,615
Sincerely, etc, etc...

548
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,693
Is that all, Mr Barnes?

549
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:51,232
You know me better than this dame.
Am I an imbecile?

550
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,199
- Well, I'm sure I...
- Go on. Tell the truth.

551
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,703
I place a lot of stock in your opinion.

552
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,710
- Well...
- Sure, you're biased.

553
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,506
You're a fellow Muncian.
But let me ask you a question.

554
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:08,240
Would an imbecile come up with this?

555
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,558
I designed it myself.

556
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:20,423
This sweet baby's
gonna put Hudsucker right back on top.

557
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,190
Uh-huh.

558
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,224
You know, for kids.

559
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:31,864
- Why don't I just type this up?
- No, Amy, that won't be necessary.

560
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,239
I shouldn't send it.
She's just doing herjob, I guess.

561
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,914
I don't know.
Maybe she does deserve it.

562
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,982
Maybe she should
have faced you, man to man.

563
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:45,212
- She probably had a deadline.
- She still could've gotten your side.

564
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:49,654
- For the record.
- Well, what's the use of grousing?

565
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,954
Forget the letter,
I just had to blow off some steam.

566
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,293
She's probably just a little confused.

567
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,899
Oonfused?

568
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,900
Probably one of these
fast-talking career gals.

569
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,232
One of the boys,
know what I mean?

570
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,534
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

571
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,438
Probably suffers from
one of these complexes.

572
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:12,309
She's probably very unattractive
and bitter about it.

573
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,145
- Oh, is that it?
- Probably dresses in men's clothing,

574

hob-nobs with a smooth-talking heel
in the newsroom named Biff or...

576
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,886
- Smitty.
- Exactly. And I bet she's real ugly.

577
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,462
Otherwise, they'd print her picture.

578
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,158
Maybe she puts her work
ahead of her personal appearance.

579
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,568
That's what she tells herself. But we
know she's a dried up, bitter old maid.

580
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,912
How about we grab dinner and a show
after work? Maybe <i>The King and I?</i>

581
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,414
How about <i>Oklahoma?</i>

582
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:49,609
You don't know a thing
about that woman, who she really is.

583
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:55,052
Only a numbskull thinks he knows things
about things he knows nothing about.

about me, will you?

608
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:03,746
I don't tell no one nothin'.
Unless they ask.

609
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,415
Thatjust ain't old Moses' way.

610
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:12,317
If you know everything about Hudsucker,
why was Norville Barnes made president?

611
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:17,653
That even surprised old Moses at first.
I didn't think the Board was that smart.

612
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:21,058
- That smart?
- But then I figured it out.

613
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:25,861
They figured Norville for an imbecile,
like some other people I know.

614
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:29,561
Why on earth would the Board
want a nitwit to be president?

615
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:34,005
Because they're little piglets.
They're trying to inspire panic.

616
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,578
Make the stock cheap
so they can snitch it up themselves.

617
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:42,115
But Norville, he's got
some tricks up his sleeve.

618
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,981
You know, for kids. [chuckles]

619
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:49,023
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville.

620
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:54,721
I guess you don't know him
any more than that board does, do you?

621
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,594
- Maybe I...
- Only some kind of knucklehead

622
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:01,362
thinks she knows things
about things she...

623
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,335
...when she don't er...

624
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,966
- How'd that go?
- It's hardly the same.

625
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,476
Why, you don't even know your own self.

626
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,878
You ain't exactly
the genuine article, are you?

627
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:19,578
In connection with my job, sometimes
I have to go undercover, as it were.

628
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,382
I don't mean that.

629
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,925
Why are you pretending
to be such a hard old sourpuss?

630
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,155
Ain't going to never make you happy.

631
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,361
I'm happy enough.

632
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,161
[Guffaws]

633
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,105
OK, Miss Archer.

634
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,867
I got gears to see to.

635
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,011
[Laughs]

636
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,943
I'm plenty happy.

637

[Steam hisses]

638
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:55,350
Hello? [echoes]

639
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,793
- I can't print that.
- Why not?

640
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,794
The Board's using the guy,
depressing the stock.

641
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,695
Speculation.
They'd have my butt in a satchel.

642
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,392
- Satchel-butt.
- They'll buy that stock.

643
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,903
The stock's cheap.
What are they waiting for?

644
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,871
- I don't know.
- Amy's hunches are usually good.

645
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:17,478
You don't accuse someone
of stock manipulation on a hunch.

646
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:21,378
Readers aren't interested
in sensationalism, gossip.

647
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,383
Facts, figures, charts,
the tools of the trade.

648
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,581
It's as if you're trying to take
the heat off Barnes, gone soft on him.

649
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,419
[Smitty] That's a low blow.

650
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,255
Archer's not gonna
go gooey for an idiot.

651
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,694
All right. But you're out of line
with this stock story.

652
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,391
Get me more
"Moron from Sheboygan" stuff.

653
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,333
- Muncie.
- Whatever. That sells newspapers.

654
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,235
I got a harder story:
"Sap from the Oity Desk".

655
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,502

- Sure, let's grab a highball.

659
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,956

[Mrs Mussburger] Enchanting!

[Mrs Mussburger]
A man of great managerial potency.

664
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:28,948
My husband is also a president,
Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

665
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,451
- Do you know him?
- Your companion is an ode.

666
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:36,717
- [Mrs Braithwaite] Are you betrothed?
- Amy works at my office.

667
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,953
- She works the mimeograph...
- The folly of youth!

668
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,131
Those green, remembered hills.

669
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,859
That bourn
from which no traveler returns.

670
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,334
I once ran the mimeograph for Sidney,

671
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:51,905
though engaged at the time
to <i>quelqu'un d'autre.</i>

672
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:55,704
My water cooler romance
became a mad passion,

673

an <i>amour fou,</i> a <i>folie à deux.</i>
[Chuckles]

Pierre of Fifth Avenue.
Do you know him?

676
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:12,156
Sidney and I are planning a trip
to Paris and points continental.

[Both women laugh]

678
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:18,158
- Aren't we, dear?
- Sure, sure.

679
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:22,532
I'd like to borrow Norville for a while
if you don't mind, dear.

680
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,866
Oh, frankly, I...

681
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,669
You have a very charming wife,
Mr... Sid.

682
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:29,641
So they tell me.

683
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:33,213
Let me shepherd you
through some of the introductions.

684
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:37,945
Try not to talk too much.
Some of our biggest stockholders are...

685

Scratch that. Say what you like.

Shake hands
with Sears Braithwaite of Bullard.

687
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,294
Pleasure to know you, Barnes.

688
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:50,331
This is Zebulon Oardozo, one of our
largest and most loyal stockholders.

689
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,630
What's this about you being an imbecile?
What's ailing you?

690
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,671
Last week, my stock was worth
twice what it is now.

691
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:03,073
I'm thinking of getting out
unless I see a vast improvement.

692
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,111
What you got here is a range war.

693
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:10,752
You're gonna have to circle our wagons
or I'm getting out of your wagon train.

694
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:17,054
No need for concern. It's only natural
for the timid to run for cover.

695
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:21,458
- Yellow? I'll show you yellow, boy.
- Zebulon, you mind, now.

696
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:26,500
- Quit actin' like such an old grizzly.
- Step lively, here, Norville.

697
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,002
Sorry, Sid. I thought
if I showed him the long view...

698
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:35,805
This is Thorstenson Finlandson, who
heads a group of disgruntled investors.

699
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:40,881
Pleased to meet you. I studied
a little Finnish in high school.

What happened?

Nothing. Just the more timid investors
are no longer running for cover.

It's not your fault. You're the one
person that's been standing by me.

723
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,646
Norville, there's something
I have to tell you.

724
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,687
You see, I'm not really a secretary.

725
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,689
- I know that, Amy.
- You do?

726
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,988
You're not very skilled
in the secretarial arts.

727
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:37,098
And I'm not that skilled as president.

I don't blame them, really.
I suppose I have made a mess of things.

731
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,683
They have to protect their investment.
Most of them are very nice.

732

You can't trust people here
like you did in Muncie.

Well, no, I never...

Oute place,
near my apartment in Greenwich Village.

743

It's called Ann's 440.
It's a beatnik bar.

You don't say! A beatnik bar.

You can get carrotjuice or Italian
coffee and the people there...

The Hindus say,
and the beatniks also,

755
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:22,928
that in our next life,
some of us will come back as ants.

Some'll be butterflies, others
elephants, or creatures of the sea.

00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:32,740
What do you think you were
in a previous life, Amy?

759
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,110
Oh, I don't know.

760
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,618
Maybe I was just
a fast-talking career gal

761
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,552
who thought she was one of the boys.

762
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:46,252
No. Pardon me for saying so,
but I find that very far-fetched.

763
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,830
That kind would come back
as a wildebeest or a warthog.

764
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,763
I find it more likely that you were...

765
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,668
...a gazelle.

766
00:57:55,872 --> 00:58:00,309
With long, graceful legs,
gamboling through the underbrush.

767
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:06,211
Perhaps we met once,
a chance encounter in a forest glade.

768
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,712
I must have been an antelope or an ibex.

769
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,687
The times we must have had,
foraging together for sustenance.

770
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,861
Snorfling water from a mountain stream,

771
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:24,466
picking the grubs and burrs
from one another's coats.

772
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:31,034
Or perhaps we simply touched horns
briefly and went our separate ways.

773
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:35,041
I wish it were that simple, Norville.

774
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:42,481
I wish I was still a gazelle
and you were an antelope or an ibex.

775
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,255
Well...

776
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,151
Oan I at least call you...

777
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,223
...dear?

778
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,651
You're funny.

779
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,561
Seriously, it's what
your beatnik friends call "karma".

780
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:01,203
The great circle of life,
death and rebirth.

781
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:05,067
I think I heard of that.
What goes around comes around.

782
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:08,835
That's it, a great wheel
that gives us all what we deserve.

783
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:13,110
I gotta show Sid and the guys
I deserve their confidence.

784
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:17,844
Tomorrow's my big presentation
to the Board.

785
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,682
Kiss me, Amy.

786
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,720
Kiss me once for luck.

787
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:25,453
Sure, Norville. Sure.

[Norville] You know, for kids.

790
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:11,034
It has economy, simplicity,
low costs, mass appeal,

791
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,265
and that means profitability.

792
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:17,936
I had R&D throw together this prototype
so our discussion had some focus

793
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:22,015
and to give you a first-hand look
at how exciting this gizmo is.

794
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:25,745
It's fun, healthy, good exercise,

- Is it a game?

799
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,870
- Will it break?
- It'd better break eventually.

800
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:48,168
- What if you tire?
- Oould we charge extra for batteries?

801
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,836
- Is it safe for toddlers?
- How'd you make it stop?

802
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,846
- Is it a boy's model?
- Oan parents assemble it?

803

- Is there a model for the obese?

804
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:03,149

- Well, it's...

805

needs at this juncture.

809
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:21,401

there'll be enormous demand for this...

811
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:27,739
Oongratulations, kid.
You've reinvented the wheel.

812

1062
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:41,143
Niblicker.
Get more loft, more backspin.

1063
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:48,187
That dame.

1064
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,484
She got your throat pretty well slit.

1065
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,991
When you're dead, you stay dead.

1066
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,596
If you don't believe me,
ask Waring Hudsucker.

1067
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,359
Tough luck, kid.

1068
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:05,869
You had a short climb up
but it's a long way down.

1069
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:20,283
"Stole the hoop idea..."
You can't print that.

1070
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,286
We are printing it.
She hits the streets tonight.

1071
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,516
And she's dynamite.

1072
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:29,322
It's the bunk. Norville showed me
his design the day I met him.

1073
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:32,500
Buzz couldn't have invented it.
He's an imbecile.

1074
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:36,329
You're a broken record.
He did design it. Some kind of prodigy.

1075
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:38,403
- Says who?
- We all have sources.

1076
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:42,201
Smith's source is on the Hud Board.
Very senior and hush-hush.

1077
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,935
I bet his initials are
Sidney J Mussburger.

1078
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,273
You lost it. You're going soft.

1079
01:24:47,482 --> 01:24:49,848
Soft on the dummy from Dubuque.

1080
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,484
- Muncie.
- Whatever.

1081
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,553
The story's hot
and you're no longer on top of it.

1082
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:59,159
It's the scoop of the century. The other
papers won't have it till tomorrow.

1083
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,521
They'll be choking on our dust.

1084
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:05,256
You're fools, both of you.
You're being used, don't you see?

1085
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:08,732
Take a break. You worked hard
on this story. You broke it.

1086
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,804
It's passed you by
and Smith is taking up the slack.

1087
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:16,339
You want slack?
I'll give you slack.

1088
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:19,002
You're not putting me
out to pasture. I quit.

1089
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,772
- Oonsider this my resignation.
- [Thud]

1090
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,248
Effective immediately.

1091
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,255
Soft.

1092
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:41,629
<i>[Dr Bromfenbrenner] So, tell me, why do</i>
<i>you feel this woman betrayed you?</i>

1093
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:45,363
<i>What's the difference?</i>

1094
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:48,270
<i>[German accent]</i>
<i>The whole world is against you?</i>

1095
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:52,310
<i>- I don't know.</i>
<i>- And the elevator boy, Buzz.</i>

1096
01:25:52,514 --> 01:25:54,948
He too works against you?

1097
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,617
<i>[Norville] Well, yeah.</i>

1098
01:25:56,784 --> 01:26:01,551
Olassic. The patient displayed
listlessness, apathy, indifference

1099
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,587
and was blue and mopey.

1100
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,783
When asked what
four Rorschach stains represented,

1101
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:10,954
patient replied "Nothing much",
"I don't know", "Just a blotch"

1102
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,793
and "Sure beats me".

1103
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,232
Patient shows no ambition,
no get-up-and-go, no vim.

1104
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,031
He is riding the grand loopen-ze-loop

1105
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:22,038
that goes from
the height of delusional gaiety

1106
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,438
to the trough of despair.

1107
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:27,638
He's now near, but not yet at,
his lowest point.

1108
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:33,845
When he reaches bottom he may erupt
and pose a danger to himself and others.

1109
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:35,989
Diagnosis, Dr Bromfenbrenner?

1110
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:41,185
Patient is manic-depressive, paranoid
type B, with acute schizoid tendencies.

1111
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,795
So, patient is...

1112
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,668
[Dr Bromfenbrenner] Precisely. Nuts.

1113
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,630
- Prescription?
- Three things.

1114
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:54,433
Oommitment,
electro-convulsive therapy,

You better get down here.
Says he's a friend of yours.

1120
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:23,462
No, he didn't say,
but, man, is he from Squaresville.

1121
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:28,234
[Norville] M-A-R...

1122
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:36,345
I want a martini. It's New Year's Eve,
I deserve a martini.

1123
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,485
It's like I said, you can't...

1124
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,018
I thought you served misfits here.

1125
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:44,055
That's a roger,
but we don't sell alcohol.

1126
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,693
What kind of bar is it?
Oan't get a martini.

1127
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:50,352
It's a juice and coffee bar, man,
like I've been telling you.

1128
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,931
Right. So, I want

1129
01:27:54,002 --> 01:27:55,867
a martini.

1130
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:59,165
I've had a martini in every bar
on the way down here.

1131
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,841
Martinis are for squares, man.

1132
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:06,236
What did you call me?
You beatnik son of a...

What? Oh, look who's here.

1135
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:17,555
Amy Archer. Prizeitzer Pul winner.

1136
01:28:17,759 --> 01:28:19,954
Looking for a nitwit to buy you lunch?

1137
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:22,288
- Norville...
- Bar fella.

1138
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:24,964
- I'm sorry.
- I'd like a martini.

1139
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,930
I tried to tell you so many times.

1140
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:32,665
It's hard to admit
when you've been wrong.

1141
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,401
If you could just find it in your heart

Ha!

You take no prisoners,
you get no second chances.

1145
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:48,117
Please, Norville,
give me one more chance.

1146
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:51,292
And yourself, too. We both deserve one.

1147
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:55,394
Just give us a second chance,
and together we can fight this thing.

1148
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,121
I know this story was a lie
and we can prove it.

Release a statement.
I can help you write it.

I've seen Norville Barnes,
the young man in a big hurry,

1155
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:23,112
and I've seen Norville Barnes,
the self-important heel.

But I've never seen
Norville Barnes, the quitter.
