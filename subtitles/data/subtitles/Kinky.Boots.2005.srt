1
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,049
Come on.

2
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,095
Come on, you stupid boy.

3
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,580
OK now, Charlie.

4
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:21,288
I'm going to show you the most
beautiful thing in the world.

5
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,974
- Do you know what it is?
- A shoe.

6
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,972
A lot of people would say
it'd be an oak tree in spring.

7
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,493
It's a shoe.

8
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,049
Lot of people would say
it'd be a field of flowers.

9
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:34,936
Do you know what I think it is?

10
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,089
A shoe.

11
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,852
I think it's a shoe.

12
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,695
Every machine. You'll learn how
to work every machine, Charlie.

13
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,738
And by the time you're old enough,
and married probably,

14
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,892
taking over the factory from me,
believe me,

15
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:25,815
first thing you'll notice
about a person is their shoes.

16
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:28,808
Come on.

17
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,693
You know, it's funny.
It's always struck me

18
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,013
that in terms of love, strength
and attention to detail,

19
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,818
marriage is pretty much like...

20
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,332
A pair of shoes.

21
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,650
And today again, I'm not wrong...

22
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,415
They take you to places,
perhaps, you weren't expecting.

23
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,649
My son. Off to London.

24
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,689
His fiancée been transferred
to an even bigger estate agents.

25
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,088
Young Charlie,
what have you decided

26
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,171
to try your hand at down there?

27
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,769
Marketing.

28
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,689
Marketing.

29
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,129
To my future daughter-in-law.

30
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,777
And to my wonderful son.

31
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,814
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

32
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,853
Ah, Mr Price.

33
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,817
Do let me show you around.

34
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,813
This is the new layout designed
with the young couple in mind.

35
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,652
As you see,
one good size bedroom,

36
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,970
with en-suite shower room.

37
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,133
And through here,
a fully-furnished lounge.

38
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,611
Oh, and best of all, Mr Price,
best of all...

39
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,538
The view.

40
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,018
It's not Northampton.

41
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,249
It's not Northampton.

42
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,375
No.

43
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,609
<i>Not Northampton</i>

44
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,258
<i>Not Northampton</i>

45
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,854
<i>We're not in Northampton anymore</i>

46
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,894
<i>- We're going where...
- Hello?</i>

47
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,414
<i>... sky is blue</i>

48
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,776
<i>Cos the best thing
about London is</i>

49
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,737
<i>No more bloody shoe...</i>

50
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,698
Yeah, this is his son.

51
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,009
Mr Price.

52
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,615
He'd have been proud of you
coming back, Mr Price.

53
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,849
Charlie.

54
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,650
Price factory has to have a Mr Price,
Mr Price.

55
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,655
George...

56
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:31,533
Bugger.

57
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,091
Dad always used to say that...

58
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,451
And in a sense...

59
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,331
He ain't pressed the button.

60
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,849
- My heart is...
- Press the red button.

61
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,456
That's a good start.

62
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,416
Right.

63
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,973
I'm not my dad. OK.
You shouldn't expect that.

64
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,177
But I've spent my life with
each one of you at some point,

65
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,935
training on these machines.

66
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,493
- I was bloody useless.
- Too right.

67
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,377
Thanks, Don.

68
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,980
Listen. Dad believed

69
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,690
there would always be a place
for craftsmanship.

70
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:00,533
And whether you realise it or not,
that is what you all are.

71
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,850
Craftsmen.

72
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,610
So let's make shoes.

73
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,129
Let's make shoes?

74
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,736
Don't worry, love.
Don't get it on your jacket.

75
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,254
I'll get some roll.

76
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,971
Pat, what order is the company
working on at the moment?

77
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,417
It's a big one, love.
Chambers Wholesale. Why?

78
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,740
What the hell was he playing at?

79
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,856
I mean, why didn't he...

80
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,975
Why did he carry on making 'em?

81
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,575
This happened before. 1992.

82
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,490
Customer went into receivership

83
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,855
and your dad got stuck
with 600 Oxfords.

84
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,975
And?

85
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,459
Bill Sampson in London

86
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,019
took 'em at cost.

87
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,572
Right. Pat, I'm going to London.

88
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,738
I just happen to find myself

89
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,778
with 1,200 pairs of brogues,
and I know, a few years back,

90
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,579
your dad took some at cost
off my dad and I thought...

91
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,209
That was a few years back, Charlie.
Things have changed a bit.

92
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,455
But look, I'll tell you what.

93
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,451
I'll take 200 pairs off your hands.
For old time's sake.

94
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,815
Hey, and this hurts.

95
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:24,096
Being a Forest fan giving
charity to a Northampton...

96
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,014
I mean, when I say charity
I'm not... you know.

97
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,896
Imported from Slovakia.
Wanna know how much?

98
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,369
Harry. A Price's shoe
will last a man a lifetime.

99
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,735
Poor sod that buys these will be back
in ten months for new ones.

100
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,176
I know. And isn't that great?

101
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,610
Spare some change, guv?

102
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,897
Here. This is a Price's shoe.

103
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,008
And it'll last a man a lifetime.

104
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,010
You got it in a size ten?

105
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,733
- Slow yourself down a bit.
- Wanna come to a party?

106
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,811
All right, gorgeous?

107
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,889
Come here.

108
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:31,891
Covering something, princess?

109
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,490
Where do you think you're going?

110
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,652
Don't worry, I'm not gonna harm you.
Just want a chat.

111
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,729
All right, lads?

112
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,295
I think you should just leave
her alone now, don't you think?

113
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:55,894
- Yeah? Come on then.
- Don't you?

114
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,858
Very sweet.
You riding to my rescue.

115
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,250
Very Prince Charming.

116
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,331
Pass me my boobs, will ya?

117
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,894
Here.

118
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,447
Didn't look like you
needed much rescuing.

119
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,817
Well, a girl has to know
how to look after herself these days.

120
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,937
There are some
very funny people out there.

121
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,378
How's that wound?
Let's have a look.

122
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,331
Don't flatter yourself.

123
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,617
Vodka. Helps you forget pain.

124
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,817
Well, it does me.

125
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:02,099
God. Clean off, again.
Like most things in life,

126
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,057
it cannot stand
the weight of a man.

127
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,052
Here we go. Oh. God love us.

128
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,017
Hold on.

129
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,652
Thank you again, Mr...

130
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,288
Sorry to be presumptive.
Are you a Mr?

131
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,735
I'm a Charlie. From Northampton.

132
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,970
Well, I rather thought you might be.

133
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,731
<i>... my unspoiled gender</i>

134
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,379
<i>Prim and proper</i>

135
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,088
<i>The girl who's never been cased</i>

136
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:22,173
<i>I'm tired of being pure and not chased</i>

137
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:27,697
<i>Like something that
seeks its level</i>

138
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:28,848
<i>I wanna go to the devil</i>

139
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,611
<i>I wanna be evil</i>

140
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:33,009
<i>I wanna spit tacks</i>

141
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,657
<i>I wanna be evil</i>

142
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,650
<i>And cheat at jacks</i>

143
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,934
<i>I wanna be wicked</i>

144
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,611
<i>I wanna tell lies</i>

145
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:45,375
<i>I wanna be mean
and throw mud pies</i>

146
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,689
<i>I want to wake up
in the morning</i>

147
00:17:47,779 --> 00:17:49,735
<i>With that dark brown taste</i>

148
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,778
<i>I wanna see some dissipation
in my face</i>

149
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:55,815
<i>I wanna be evil</i>

150
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:57,935
<i>I wanna be mad</i>

151
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,657
<i>But more than that</i>

152
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,333
<i>I wanna be bad</i>

153
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,094
<i>I wanna be evil
and trump an ace</i>

154
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:10,536
<i>Just to see my partner's face</i>

155
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,894
<i>I wanna be nasty</i>

156
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,458
<i>I wanna be cruel</i>

157
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,530
<i>I wanna be daring</i>

158
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,530
<i>I wanna shoot pool</i>

159
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,417
<i>And in the theatre</i>

160
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,569
<i>I want to change my seat</i>

161
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:28,858
<i>Just so I can step on
everybody's feet</i>

162
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,377
- Oh, no.
- Trish.

163
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,778
Thing is...

164
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:51,134
No, love, please. Please.

165
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:53,050
They've just started school.

166
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:55,733
They just started school
this month, Charlie.

167
00:18:55,819 --> 00:18:59,289
This is their uniforms, love.
This is their dinners.

168
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:02,052
We lost the contract
with Chambers, Trish.

169
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,778
Thing is, we lost the
contract with Chambers...

170
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:07,009
Actually, don't.

171
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,818
This is like apologies
for your train running late.

172
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,254
- It means nothing...
- It's not like that...

173
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,534
...so I'd rather not hear it.

174
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,458
<i>I do mean it.</i>

175
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:34,092
<i>Bernie Taylor to the office.</i>

176
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:35,214
Please.

177
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,097
This is not what I want, Bernie.

178
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:43,572
I don't want to be sitting here
doing this, but you know...

179
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:48,653
Nine out of ten shoe factories
have shut down...

180
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,730
What can I do?

181
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,259
I am sorry it's come to this, Anthony.

182
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:03,328
Daphne.

183
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,454
Janice.

184
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,097
- Derek?
- Eric.

185
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,373
Yes, Eric.

186
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:15,414
What can I do?

187
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,012
Change the product.

188
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,567
- Sorry?
- Like Liptons.

189
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,650
Start making equestrian boots.

190
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,176
Browns. They're making...
Whatever, climbing boots.

191
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,888
All them other sods, they went out
looking for their niche markets.

192
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,257
They just didn't sit back
in their offices going, "What can I do?"

193
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,848
Sorry.

194
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,813
I was just really, really
looking forward to a Chinese tonight.

195
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,576
Now I'm not sure if I can afford it.

196
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,290
In a sense it was lucky, they hadn't
got round to advertising your job.

197
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:15,135
Yeah, lucky.

198
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:17,211
Listen, Nic.

199
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,132
That's the kind of shoe, isn't it?
Don't you think?

200
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:25,291
- What?
- The wedding. At the altar.

201
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:27,813
Is that the kind of thing
you were thinking of?

202
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:29,571
On my foot.

203
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,049
Well, it needs to be a Jimmy Choo,
doesn't it? To work.

204
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:35,414
We might have to think
about the wedding.

205
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,494
Not the wedding, wedding, but...

206
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:45,688
It doesn't have to be all live band
and shoes at the altar, does it?

207
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:49,689
I mean, at the end of the day
it's about the two of us, isn't it?

208
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:56,578
I've made 15 people redundant today.

209
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,972
Lauren.

210
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:52,619
Lauren, you haven't heard
what I was gonna say.

211
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,213
Well, does it involve the words,
"job back"?

212
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,413
Potentially.

213
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:05,888
OK, brace yourself.

214
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:12,498
Ladies, gentlemen and those
who are yet to make up your mind.

215
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:21,653
<i>Whatever Lola wants</i>

216
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,207
<i>Lola gets</i>

217
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:25,891
<i>And little man</i>

218
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,891
<i>Little Lola wants you</i>

219
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:34,533
<i>Make up your mind to have</i>

220
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,292
<i>No regrets</i>

221
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,971
<i>Recline yourself</i>

222
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,572
<i>Resign yourself</i>

223
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:41,933
<i>You're through</i>

224
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:46,890
<i>I always gain</i>

225
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,176
<i>What I aim for</i>

226
00:23:50,259 --> 00:23:52,534
<i>And your heart and soul</i>

227
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,578
<i>Is what I came for</i>

228
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:00,413
<i>Whatever Lola wants</i>

229
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,730
<i>Lola gets</i>

230
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,696
<i>Take off your coat</i>

231
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:07,851
<i>Don't you know you can't win</i>

232
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,811
<i>You're no exception to the rule</i>

233
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:16,255
<i>I'm irresistible you fool</i>

234
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:18,534
<i>Give in</i>

235
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:27,338
Lola.

236
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,895
All me, sweetheart.
I design everything in that club.

237
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:50,088
It's my costumes, my lighting,
my dancers, my show, love.

238
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,135
I mean, it's me.

239
00:24:52,219 --> 00:24:54,938
Bit of a dark horse, your boyfriend.

240
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:56,452
He's my boss.

241
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,372
Well, he was my boss.
I got laid off.

242
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:03,009
But now he seems to think
I'm his business analyst or...

243
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,135
Look, you'll have to excuse Charlie.

244
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,938
We don't have many transvestites
in Northampton.

245
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:10,375
I'm not merely a transvestite,
sweetheart.

246
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:13,098
I'm also a drag queen.
It's a simple equation.

247
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,455
A drag queen puts on a frock,
looks like Kylie.

248
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,770
A transvestite puts on a frock,
looks like...

249
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,214
Boris Yeltsin in lipstick.
There, I said it.

250
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:27,019
Ta. Whatever. Don't kid yourself.

251
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:30,569
You're never more than ten feet away
from a transvestite.

252
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:34,698
You made her redundant?
You miserable sod.

253
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:38,695
Things aren't very good
in men's shoes.

254
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,735
Well, I'm not, certainly.

255
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,379
Yes. Precisely.

256
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,451
How much do you weigh?

257
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,849
The right amount.
How much do you drink?

258
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:56,538
I mean... They're women's boots,
are they, that you buy?

259
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:00,373
You have to buy women's boots
because you...

260
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,334
You see, the distribution of pressure
on a conventional female heel

261
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:08,138
cannot be expected
to support a man's weight.

262
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:12,974
And if trans... you know, whatevers,

263
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:17,814
drag queens are everywhere,
like you said, then, not in a...

264
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:22,212
<i>Living Dead kind of way but...</i>

265
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:28,772
Then, do you think there is
a niche market for proper, good,

266
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,771
decent, built-to-last boots

267
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,011
for women... that are men?

268
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,493
All this way for my advice.
I feel like Oprah.

269
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,810
I'd like to measure you for it,
go home, make a pair.

270
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,377
Who gets to keep the boots?

271
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:23,214
A little warning.
The answer is, "You do, Lola."

272
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,938
You do, Lola.

273
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,409
Where do I come to pick it up?
What, Prices of Northampton, is it?

274
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,888
Yeah, but I'll come to you.

275
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,892
Oh, no. As they say, a good
pair of boots is worth walking for.

276
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,688
No, you see,
I come here all the time, and so...

277
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,769
I'll come to you.

278
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,053
Right.

279
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,449
Look behind you.

280
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:51,019
What? What is it?

281
00:27:51,099 --> 00:27:53,135
It's your niche market, Charlie.

282
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,452
Big niche.

283
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:30,134
Ladies, gentlemen

284
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:33,211
and those of you
who are yet to make up your mind,

285
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,291
our very own Lola.

286
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,094
<i>He walked into my life</i>

287
00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:52,051
<i>And now he's taking over</i>

288
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,016
<i>And it's beautiful</i>

289
00:28:57,859 --> 00:28:59,531
<i>Yes it's beautiful</i>

290
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,331
<i>I've gone with better looking guys</i>

291
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,292
<i>He's gone with prettier looking girls</i>

292
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:12,694
<i>But now we're beautiful</i>

293
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,728
<i>I think we're beautiful</i>

294
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:23,579
<i>I don't need love affairs anymore</i>

295
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:32,092
<i>I don't need love affairs anymore</i>

296
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,137
<i>Can't you see</i>

297
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,494
<i>It's the chemistry</i>

298
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:43,892
<i>You really must agree
together we are beautiful</i>

299
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,132
<i>We are beautiful...</i>

300
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,053
Well?

301
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,087
Cool.

302
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,336
I was thinking, we should...

303
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,980
If you haven't got anything else on

304
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:38,971
then maybe you could come back to...

305
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:43,174
To your house?

306
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:46,610
The factory.

307
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,174
I'm gonna need someone on
the web to research markets and...

308
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:56,376
If Pat got on those websites
she'd have a heart attack.

309
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:58,177
Yeah.

310
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,898
Besides, you started it,
being in that strop.

311
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,211
Oh, well.
I mean, I just had the strop, Charlie.

312
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,494
You saw the idea.

313
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:12,096
And that is why some of us end up
with our names above the factories

314
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,773
and others just on
the clocking-in cards.

315
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:17,528
Right.

316
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,610
Well, as someone
with their name on a factory,

317
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:26,135
can I invite you to have your name
on one of my clocking-in cards?

318
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,571
They say, calm down,
they say whatever life throws at you,

319
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,570
whatever emotions you feel,

320
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,219
somebody somewhere
has written a song about it.

321
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,654
Now, I hope that'll be true.

322
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,650
Until somebody writes a song called

323
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,413
<i>No One Stays Young Forever And
One Day I Hope You Get Dumped</i>

324
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,933
<i>For A Younger Model,
You Whiny Little Welsh Bastard,</i>

325
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,250
I'm just gonna have
to sing your memory.

326
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,897
Show us your tits.

327
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,058
Certainly. Ladies and Gentleman,
there they are.

328
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:02,936
Give 'em a round of applause.

329
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,934
Are they as wrinkly
as your arms, love?

330
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:13,532
- Is there a man in there?
- Good one.

331
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:18,454
I have to tell you, sweetheart,
my breasts are as smooth and beautiful

332
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,370
as the day that I bought them.

333
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:40,654
Bastard.

334
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,930
Hey.

335
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,610
Forget it, Don. Out of your league.

336
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,769
Nah. You seem to forget,

337
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,851
women get turned on
by the sight of the working man.

338
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:57,414
Morning, Charlie.

339
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,534
Lola.

340
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,728
Come in.

341
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,170
Sorry it's a bit messy. We...

342
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,528
I thought we agreed
that I'd come to London.

343
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,610
I warn you, Charlie from Northampton,

344
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,612
I have a terrible habit of doing
the opposite of what people want.

345
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,168
Some might say
that attempts of certain people

346
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:21,969
to make a man out of me as a child
is the reason that I now wear a frock.

347
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,768
If I get the feeling somebody
didn't want me to come to Northampton...

348
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,690
- No.
- Also, I can tell

349
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:31,853
from years of experience when I'm
being smuggled in through a rear door.

350
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,056
- That's the rough-stuff room.
- Is it?

351
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,177
It's where we dump
all the offcuts and misshapes.

352
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:39,568
There you go.
I wondered why I was drawn to it.

353
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,887
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

354
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,810
I'll raise.

355
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,770
That's George.

356
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,534
Listen, Mel, all I say is,
when it comes to attracting women

357
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,610
some men don't have to speak.

358
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:09,650
This is cosy.

359
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,730
All right.

360
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,810
Here we are.

361
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,848
Well?

362
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:51,130
What do you think?

363
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,094
Burgundy.

364
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:07,897
Please, God, tell me
I've not inspired something burgundy.

365
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,813
Red.

366
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,728
Red.

367
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,172
Red.

368
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,130
Red. Charlie boy.

369
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,255
Rule one. Red...

370
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:27,692
<i>... is the colour of sex.</i>

371
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:30,976
Burgundy is the colour
of hot water bottles.

372
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:34,369
Red is the colour
of sex and fear and danger

373
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,010
and signs that say, "Do Not Enter."

374
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:41,739
<i>All of my favourite things in life.</i>

375
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:45,335
- Who's that?
- He's got your new girlfriend in there.

376
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,775
- But they're comfy.
- Comfy?

377
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,976
Sex shouldn't be comfy.

378
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,052
Thank God.
I thought it was just me.

379
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:58,291
I don't know what you're used to makin',
but now you're making sex.

380
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:02,088
Two-and-a-half feet
of irresistible tubular sex.

381
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,489
I mean, that heel. For God's sake.

382
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:06,775
It won't break.
That's what you wanted.

383
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,453
Not if it means looking like
a Ukrainian peasant.

384
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,894
It's better than flouncing around
like a...

385
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,415
You wanna show your niche market
a little more respect, Charlie.

386
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,172
- Let's ask your girls.
- No.

387
00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:19,978
Girls. Would you wear
something like this to go out?

388
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:22,050
No.

389
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,369
You'd look all right in 'em, sweetheart.

390
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,018
You've pulled.

391
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,177
Oh, yeah.

392
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:40,098
Ladies.

393
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:57,971
Well, I'm very flattered.

394
00:37:58,059 --> 00:38:02,018
But frankly,
if you can't get women to wear 'em,

395
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:04,295
you'll never get blokes like me
to wear 'em.

396
00:38:19,179 --> 00:38:21,375
Do we still have a workforce?

397
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,893
Don'll come around.

398
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,891
Once he's stopped...

399
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:28,496
...walking up and down, swearing.

400
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:31,810
- Well, that's his problem.
- No, it's our problem, Lola.

401
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,608
This is Northampton.
You have no idea what it's like, OK?

402
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:38,134
- It's not Soho.
- Amen.

403
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:43,377
Look to the heel, young man.

404
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:50,411
The sex is in the heel.

405
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,453
What's that supposed to mean?

406
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,769
Sex is in the heel.

407
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,137
Stilettos require constant balance
from the upper leg

408
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:12,733
causing the muscles
of the backside to tense

409
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:15,652
and appear pert and ready for mating.

410
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:22,214
It's physically impossible.
I mean, am I missing something?

411
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:27,373
To make a stiletto, something that thin,
bear the weight of a man is just...

412
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,927
Steel shank.

413
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,338
What?

414
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,695
A steel shank, cut thinly,

415
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:38,328
then moulded in a continuous section,

416
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,775
from toe to heel without pinning.

417
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,327
Not even Don would crush that.

418
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:48,648
Lola.

419
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,089
Lola, we might be able to do it.

420
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:55,647
Steel shanks without underpinning.

421
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:57,855
We might be able
to make those boots.

422
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,295
If you could just...
If you're willing to...

423
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,098
I think Don would have
something to say about that.

424
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,650
I gave up the provinces years ago,
and I've just been reminded why.

425
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,775
Lola doesn't do North.

426
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,293
- Northampton's the Midlands.
- No, Charlie.

427
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,496
Tottenham Court Road is the Midlands.

428
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,333
If you'll excuse me,
I have a show tonight.

429
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,253
Look, I'm stood here, trying
to save a factory of four generations.

430
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,614
Of my father,
and his father's father...

431
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:26,248
- Tell me when it applies to me.
- And how it applies to you.

432
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,853
I'm about to take
an almighty fucking gamble.

433
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,170
And in one afternoon, in one drawing,

434
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:33,648
you've said more about
these boots than...

435
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:34,967
I mean, I just...

436
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:39,655
Five weeks, Lola. That's it. I mean,
if I don't have a new collection ready

437
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:43,652
for the Milan shoe fair in five weeks,
I've blown it. I'll have to sell up.

438
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,371
All right, I'll tell you what.
Don't hang around.

439
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,132
It's never gonna apply to you.

440
00:40:53,539 --> 00:40:58,739
What you don't realise, Lola,
is this is not my world either.

441
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:06,614
Where you going, darling?

442
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,690
By the sound of it...

443
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,418
Milan.

444
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,940
I see this as a very positive step
for a company,

445
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:38,136
who spent the last century
making a range of shoes for men,

446
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:44,250
to start the next century
making shoes for a range of men.

447
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,378
Any questions?

448
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:04,047
Sorry, love. I thought you were
going in to work at nine.

449
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:06,528
No, I did, Mrs Cobb, I was.

450
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:09,373
- I am.
- Sorry.

451
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:26,009
Don.

452
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:42,974
Have you got
any toilets down here?

453
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:45,527
I'm afraid we've only got
men's and women's.

454
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,252
Charlie.
She's locked herself in the loo.

455
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,057
- What?
- Come on.

456
00:42:56,779 --> 00:42:58,576
Right. Go in there. Tell her...

457
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,458
- No, the gent's loo.
- Right.

458
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:06,650
What's up, Mel?

459
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,058
Lola, it's Charlie. Are you OK?

460
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,259
Are you ill?

461
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:26,250
Yeah, I'm sick.

462
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:29,411
- Ask your boys.
- Oh, God. Is this Don?

463
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:34,250
Has he nicked your dress?

464
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,971
I came like this.

465
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,614
God. Put on a frock,

466
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:46,692
<i>and I can sing Stand By Your Man
in front of 500 strangers.</i>

467
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:50,328
Put on a pair of jeans, and I can't even
sodding well say hello.

468
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,056
I have to say,
I was going to suggest dressing down.

469
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:03,050
Well, thank you for your concern.

470
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,335
Come on, tell me.

471
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,451
- Boxer.
- Get out of here.

472
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,690
I'm serious.
He had me doing training.

473
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:22,739
Weights. I could bench-press 93 kilos.

474
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:26,971
I owe all my spectacular
muscle definition to my father.

475
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:29,893
What, he never...
The whole wearing frocks thing...

476
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,572
Well, he wasn't stupid.

477
00:44:31,659 --> 00:44:35,618
He knew there'd be few cross-dressing
heavyweight champions of the world.

478
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:37,530
Yeah.

479
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,456
No, he disowned me.

480
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,615
Wouldn't see me.

481
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:53,572
Even when he got lung cancer,
he wouldn't.

482
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,175
So, it's ironic really.

483
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,929
Fags got him in the end.

484
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,049
I mean, that's what it was all about.

485
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:18,295
Fitting in.

486
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,337
Melding in. Not standing out.

487
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:28,293
As far as he was concerned, if you're
big, black and a boxer you are sorted.

488
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,257
If you're big and you're black
and you're in a...

489
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:36,219
you know... strapless cocktail dress,
that's not so good.

490
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,733
That's what my dad wanted, an' all.

491
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,775
A strapless cocktail dress?

492
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:45,011
No. For me to fit in.
To this place.

493
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:49,052
You know, it should be me
that's hiding in here, not you.

494
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:52,371
I'm the one who doesn't know
what he's doing.

495
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,815
God, it'd kill him
to hear me say that, too.

496
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,130
Although he probably knew,
and that's probably what did.

497
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,174
Well.

498
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:09,856
Perhaps we just have to pretend
we do know what we're doing.

499
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:17,577
Charlie from Northampton,
Simon from Clacton.

500
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,931
Come on, let's make boots.

501
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:22,007
Cover me, girls. I'm going in.

502
00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:41,733
For...

503
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:21,210
<i>While tearing off</i>

504
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:23,688
<i>A game of golf</i>

505
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:28,170
<i>I might make a play
for the caddie</i>

506
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:30,375
<i>But when I do</i>

507
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,019
<i>I don't follow through</i>

508
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:38,413
<i>Cos my heart belongs to Daddy</i>

509
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,808
<i>If I invite</i>

510
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,208
<i>A boy some night</i>

511
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:47,259
<i>To dine on my fine finnan haddie</i>

512
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,933
<i>Though I just adore</i>

513
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:52,931
<i>His asking for more</i>

514
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:58,047
<i>But my heart belongs to Daddy</i>

515
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,130
That's where you applaud, Charlie.

516
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:17,012
Don't you have a show tonight?

517
00:50:18,139 --> 00:50:20,369
Sore throat.

518
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,371
<i>But my heart...</i>

519
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:30,931
You know you don't have to work
in the rough-stuff room.

520
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:32,931
But I feel at home here.

521
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:36,614
They're my friends.

522
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,411
Besides, one never knows what joy
one might find amongst the unwanted.

523
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:48,449
And abandoned.

524
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,333
Charlie boy.

525
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:14,210
Morning, stranger.

526
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:18,737
Nic, look, about last night.

527
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:22,088
Things got a little bit crazy
at work and...

528
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,898
It won't always be like that.
I promise.

529
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:29,451
- No, really, it won't be.
- OK.

530
00:51:29,539 --> 00:51:32,770
See, I think I've found
a solution for the factory.

531
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,375
Well, that makes two of us.
Come on.

532
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,690
One second, Mrs Cobb.

533
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:46,288
God.

534
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,574
Come in.

535
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:53,418
- There we go.
- Thank you.

536
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,219
And the room's all right
for you then, love, is it?

537
00:51:56,299 --> 00:52:00,259
Absolutely lovely, Mrs Cobb, yes.
Lots of...

538
00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:01,897
Lots of trinkets.

539
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,858
Now, the little pottery shoes,
they're good luck, you see?

540
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,329
You know, like Whitby
has lucky glass ducks,

541
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,853
Northampton has lucky pottery shoes.

542
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,328
Can I just ask, are you a man?

543
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,088
I am, love, yes.

544
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:22,889
That's fine. Just so's I know
how to leave the toilet seat.

545
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,174
I'll get some biscuits.

546
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,567
Mr Price.

547
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:55,411
Charlie, this is Richard Bailey

548
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,014
I was sorry to hear about your dad.

549
00:52:58,099 --> 00:52:59,771
Shall we?

550
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,976
The beauty is the building.

551
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:05,529
For us developers,
it's more a case of what we don't do.

552
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:08,418
- Isn't it?
- And if you look in here,

553
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,536
you will see the bedroom.

554
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:26,134
So, what do you think?

555
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:29,132
We... I mean, one day, Nic,

556
00:53:29,219 --> 00:53:34,612
if this is what you want, but isn't it
slightly out of our price range?

557
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:42,772
Not all buildings deserve
a second life, Mr Price,

558
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:48,570
but factories like this,
like yours, they're special.

559
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:54,135
Sorry?

560
00:53:54,219 --> 00:53:57,336
Are you under the illusion
that Prices is for sale?

561
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,491
I know you're trying to help
but if you hang in there a bit,

562
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:03,898
I make you this promise.

563
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,130
A promise like the Jimmy Choo shoes?

564
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:09,177
Hang on. You're talking about
the history of my family.

565
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:11,648
But isn't this the future of it
right here?

566
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:13,458
I don't know, Nicola. Is it?

567
00:54:13,539 --> 00:54:16,179
I mean, if I can't get you
to summon up some faith...

568
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:20,969
OK, give me it, Charlie. Come on.
What have I got to have faith in?

569
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:23,255
Now, I've suggested selling the factory

570
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,773
to a brilliant developer
who's interested.

571
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,373
And who's done all that.
You know?

572
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:32,213
Made all that happen.
What's your plan?

573
00:54:32,299 --> 00:54:33,618
Charlie boy.

574
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:36,134
I've found Soho.

575
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:39,211
A little corner of Soho in Northampton,
that brasserie.

576
00:54:39,299 --> 00:54:41,608
We're not talking Hoxton,
but never mind.

577
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:46,056
Sorry, I'm Lola. I'm the one designing
his range of transvestite boots.

578
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:57,498
There's a slight chill in the air.

579
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:59,570
Isn't there?

580
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:13,214
That is the...

581
00:55:13,299 --> 00:55:15,369
- Plan.
- Yeah.

582
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,054
Listen, Nic,
I have not gone into this lightly.

583
00:55:18,139 --> 00:55:19,811
And there is a market...

584
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,210
Can I just say
before you make a fool of yourself

585
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:26,974
trying to save the factory because,
"It's the history of my family",

586
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,847
the reason Richard came to see me,
OK, not you,

587
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,692
was because your dad approached him
about selling.

588
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:39,656
You see, you owe your father nothing,
Charlie Price.

589
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:43,375
You are free.

590
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,132
To walk.

591
00:56:51,539 --> 00:56:53,257
Right. That's it.

592
00:56:53,339 --> 00:56:56,855
We've terminated production
on all Derbys, brogues and Oxfords.

593
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,090
From now on, the factory
is 100 percent on the new range.

594
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:01,578
Or we will not hit Milan.

595
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:04,891
So, we need at least
fifteen new designs from Lola.

596
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,096
And at least six samples of each.

597
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,737
And remember.

598
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:11,492
You are not making footwear.

599
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:13,889
You are not making boots.

600
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:20,327
You are making two-and-a-half feet
of irresistible, tubular sex.

601
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,456
None of the major firms
just take a stand.

602
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:30,248
All the big boys hire the main runway,
so we will need that.

603
00:57:30,339 --> 00:57:33,695
I mean, we need Milan to go like, pow.

604
00:57:33,779 --> 00:57:36,373
Like the two of did
that night at The Angel, yeah?

605
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,132
I mean we need to take
The Angel Club to Milan.

606
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:41,779
We will take
The Angel Club to Milan.

607
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:48,135
Well, you wouldn't put a frock on.

608
00:57:48,219 --> 00:57:51,416
If you don't want to get off
with blokes, why put a frock on?

609
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,855
Thing is, Mike, ask any woman
what she likes most in a man.

610
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:00,297
Compassion, tenderness, sensitivity.
Traditionally the female virtues.

611
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:05,737
Perhaps what women secretly desire
is a man who is fundamentally a woman.

612
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,976
- He's coming.
- Right.

613
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:53,137
Hello, Don. Tell me,
what do you think I could do

614
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:55,528
that would make me more of a man?

615
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,496
Look, a piece of paper down here.

616
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:00,777
Why not write down what you think
would make me more of a man

617
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:04,329
and I'll write down what I think
would make you more of a man?

618
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,252
If I do what's on yours,
you do what's on mine, right?

619
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:11,052
Piss off.

620
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:16,654
Fine.

621
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,018
So, is our Don a man, do you think?

622
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,135
Well, he dresses like one.

623
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,650
- Good answer.
- I was pleased with it.

624
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:30,730
Great, love. Go home.

625
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,016
Come on, Don. Be a man.

626
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:44,489
- You don't have to do this.
- I do. You know why?

627
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:48,016
Cos what Don's written on my paper
is a bloody walk in the park

628
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:49,737
compared to what I've written.

629
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,697
We've 24 hours.
I could do without industrial unrest.

630
00:59:52,779 --> 00:59:54,815
Calm down, it's not boxing.

631
01:00:02,539 --> 01:00:04,018
Sorry.

632
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,972
Play.

633
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:11,373
So, the...

634
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,451
Yeah, well...

635
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:18,617
Why'd you stop?

636
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:22,214
I wouldn't want you
to walk into the factory

637
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,336
and feel that people
didn't respect you, Don.

638
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:28,650
I wouldn't want anyone else
to know what that feels like.

639
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,295
Change your mind about someone.

640
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:49,931
Nice one, champ.
Get the beers in?

641
01:03:50,019 --> 01:03:51,612
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,335
Oh, Christ.

643
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:26,376
How much does that buy us?

644
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,496
The main runway,
from between 4.30 to 5.00.

645
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,934
After Closerie and before Tricker's.

646
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:43,857
OK. Hi. Listen, I'm sorry.
We can't afford it.

647
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,009
Just...

648
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:52,297
- How much for the dancers?
- Well all this is Lola's estimate

649
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,371
for the Blue Angel boys and expenses.

650
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,336
Could you get it for under 20,000?

651
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,614
- Well, why 20?
- Could you?

652
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:01,088
- Why 20?
- Because that is what the bank

653
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:03,215
will give me against my house.

654
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,574
<i>Hello?</i>

655
01:05:05,299 --> 01:05:06,288
What?

656
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:11,291
<i>- Take it.
- Pronto.</i>

657
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:15,931
At least one Mr Price didn't sit around
saying, "What can I do?"

658
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:17,009
Take it.

659
01:05:21,339 --> 01:05:23,728
Come on.
Tea break finished five minutes ago.

660
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:25,810
Come on, you know where that goes.

661
01:05:28,779 --> 01:05:30,418
How are you getting on, George?

662
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:36,177
Why, it's surprisingly easy
if I just imagine Pat wearing 'em.

663
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,538
Is it?

664
01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:44,331
George. There's an indentation
in the leather. Bin it. Do it again.

665
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,536
I don't care, redo it.

666
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:49,213
- What if they're not assembled?
- They will be.

667
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:50,971
It's four o'clock.

668
01:05:51,059 --> 01:05:53,778
They'll have to work over.
This is bloody Milan.

669
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,851
You don't get marks for effort.

670
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:02,458
Caffeine. Give us a hand, would you?

671
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,690
I needed a break
from Mr Shouty back there.

672
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:08,531
He's just tense, all right?

673
01:06:10,179 --> 01:06:11,248
What?

674
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:13,217
Are you aware that you do that?

675
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:15,494
That you instinctively defend him?

676
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:20,610
Look at those puppies.

677
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:24,617
You know,
Charlie's dad used to have this theory

678
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:28,009
that you could tell everything
about a person from their shoes.

679
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,018
- Right. Come on, then.
- Oh, no.

680
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:37,654
Cheap but happy.

681
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,458
Very eager to please.

682
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:46,007
All right, all right.
Those, those, look.

683
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:49,297
Shiny but dull.

684
01:06:50,099 --> 01:06:51,327
Oh, my God.

685
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:55,014
- Hello, Lauren.
- Hello, Nicola.

686
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:57,090
I love those shoes.

687
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,054
- Charlie's treat?
- Yeah, once upon a time.

688
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:02,458
What?

689
01:07:02,539 --> 01:07:05,099
A girl can live with so many
once-upon-a-times

690
01:07:05,179 --> 01:07:07,454
before she finally
has to buy them herself.

691
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:09,735
It's not like that with the factory,
is it?

692
01:07:09,819 --> 01:07:11,252
- Sorry?
- Well, Charlie.

693
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:14,376
He said he was gonna save it.
Most guys would have gone,

694
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,415
"Hey, what can I do?"

695
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,855
Fallen at the first hurdle,
let alone remortgage their house.

696
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,895
You should see him in that factory.

697
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,288
It's like it's made him
twice as determined.

698
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,769
I'm sorry. Remortgaged the... what?

699
01:07:36,579 --> 01:07:38,615
How are we?

700
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:41,771
No.

701
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:44,771
For God's sake, Melanie.
This is Milan.

702
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,851
These seams aren't straight.
You're rushing it.

703
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:50,335
Pardon?

704
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,252
You're gonna have to unpick
all this and start again.

705
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:56,411
Thought that might...
This is Saturday.

706
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,491
- You've got enough completed.
- No, I haven't.

707
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,047
Some of us have got
a life outside this factory.

708
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:04,813
You're gonna have
a bloody lot more of it in a bit.

709
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:10,373
Mel, you don't understand.
This is Milan.

710
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:15,010
It's Mil...
How do you know what Milan is?

711
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:18,012
You don't know. You're guessing.

712
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:20,170
Perhaps you'd have it finished by now

713
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:25,618
if you hadn't made us
undo every single bloody stitch.

714
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,655
But, Mel, they weren't good enough.

715
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,856
- They were good enough for your dad.
- But I'm not my dad.

716
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,579
Hey. I'll tell you what, Charlie Price.

717
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,572
Never a bloody truer word.

718
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,619
Mel. We have to leave
at six in the morning. Please.

719
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,691
A word, Charlie.

720
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,017
I'm actually in a bit of a crisis here.

721
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,298
I think so.

722
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,419
Is it not bad enough
you're making this kind of crap

723
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,331
thinking you'll save the factory?

724
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,615
But the fact
you remortgaged the house...

725
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,419
- What?
- Charlie, Lauren didn't realise.

726
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:07,975
Our house. No one will ever say
I didn't stand by my man, Charlie.

727
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:13,088
I've done it. I'll stand by you now.
Just... a reason.

728
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,012
- Nicola.
- Give me a reason.

729
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,898
- Down there.
- Looking at you, Charlie Price.

730
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,050
Give me a reason. Standing here.

731
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,610
Making porn-wear for hermaphrodites.

732
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,817
Hermaphrodites have both sets
of reproductive organs.

733
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,333
Get out.

734
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,768
Where was it for London?
All this money?

735
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:50,216
Don't. Flat the size of a postage stamp,
because we have to be careful, Nic,

736
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,895
- but hey bloody presto...
- London was for you.

737
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,812
London was for us.

738
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,698
You wouldn't spend
another five grand on us,

739
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,853
but you'll bloody remortgage the house
to keep people we don't know in a job.

740
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,454
I do know them.
It's you that doesn't know them.

741
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:08,735
Because you never come in here.

742
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:14,690
I've already had to fire 15 of them and
they were the 15 worst times of my life.

743
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,372
- So sell it.
- Nicola.

744
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,655
I don't...

745
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:21,538
<i>Do they know
your dad was gonna sell up?</i>

746
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:25,374
You know? Even your dad.
Have you told them that?

747
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,451
I don't care what he was gonna do.

748
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:30,100
I don't care
that he was gonna sell the place.

749
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,136
OK. I, here, me, now. Charlie Price,

750
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,053
doesn't actually enjoy
making people redundant.

751
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:38,735
<i>And if you can't hear a reason yet,
then maybe you won't ever get it.</i>

752
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,095
Maybe you won't ever get me.

753
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:45,139
Maybe Nicola Marsden
will never ever quite get Charlie Price.

754
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:52,417
Maybe I won't.

755
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,414
Oh, sod it.

756
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:59,255
It's probably my fault. Putting Dad up,
making some hero out of him.

757
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,729
You shouldn't do that.

758
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:06,450
I suppose I just didn't wanna be
the last photo in the line, you know?

759
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:09,179
The Price who left nothing.

760
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,377
Maybe you shouldn't
judge it in bricks, Charlie.

761
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,054
Maybe you judge
what you leave behind

762
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,256
by what you inspire in other people.

763
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:31,969
Charlie?

764
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,375
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me please.

765
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,451
Coming through.

766
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,971
Coffee? Cup of tea?

767
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,853
Charlie.

768
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,408
Did you get them to do this?

769
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,254
Rather rose to the challenge
of changing his mind about someone.

770
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,409
You?

771
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,173
No, Charlie. You.

772
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,611
Here we go.

773
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,776
My God.

774
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:25,412
Hey, everyone.
The man from Milan, he say yes.

775
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,176
Cheers.

776
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:31,694
- Come on, Lauren.
- No.

777
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,060
He's had quite an impact
on us girls, hasn't he?

778
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,891
Charlie Price.

779
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,811
I saw a documentary once.

780
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:02,575
Potholers. They'd have a celebration
the night before they went down

781
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,570
in case they never came out.

782
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,333
Of course, now Northampton
is the perfect venue.

783
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,457
- I...
- A little warning.

784
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:12,496
The answer is, "I'd love to, Lola."

785
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,693
Stop it.

786
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,818
- Table for one?
- For two.

787
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,619
- Two. Right here.
- I'll just use your toilet.

788
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:33,294
Toilets, yes,
just down the stairs on the left.

789
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,695
Richard.

790
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:44,849
Oh, Christ.

791
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,338
It's Charlie Price.

792
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:49,218
Oh, no. Absolutely. From Prices, yeah.

793
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,936
Didn't expect to see you at La Conceria.

794
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,454
Not one of your normal haunts this,
is it?

795
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,929
We're having a meeting.
It's about business.

796
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:02,456
Business? God.
Never lets up, does it? Same with me.

797
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:16,695
They're running away.

798
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,016
Charlie boy.

799
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,091
Sorry I'm late.
You know how it is.

800
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,978
I'm sitting with all my dresses
on my bed, thinking,

801
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,939
"Is it hot in Milan? Is it cool?
Does it get cold at night?"

802
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:10,530
Thank you.

803
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,373
You couldn't get me a Bloody Mary,
could you?

804
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:14,813
Bloody Mary for the lady.

805
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,209
The whole potholing thing,
I didn't mean it.

806
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,497
I don't think it will go tits up.
I mean, the show. The routine.

807
01:19:20,579 --> 01:19:23,378
Wait till you see what
I have planned for the catwalk.

808
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,291
- If we market it...
- Lola.

809
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:28,895
It's not just us who'll go for 'em.
There's a whole club scene...

810
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,813
- Stop.
- What?

811
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,619
People are staring.
Come on, what do you want?

812
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,770
I don't think anybody's staring.

813
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,818
You are a man in a frock in Northampton.
They're staring.

814
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,494
Even if they're not looking,
they're staring.

815
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:47,934
I'm a Northampton shoe designer,
Charlie.

816
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:51,932
Yeah, You're that as well.
You're also a man in a dress.

817
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,853
You make it sound as if I put this on

818
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:58,649
because of the lack
of a pair of trousers.

819
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:02,016
Is there a part of you
that actually believes that, Charlie?

820
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,809
I don't know why you wear dresses
and I don't think you do either.

821
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,929
I didn't realise
I was causing you trouble.

822
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:16,012
Forget it. All right.
You are a very good designer.

823
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,137
You'd like me to come and design
then disappear when I'm me.

824
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:23,657
You is the designer. This is not you.
This is you in a dress, looking daft.

825
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,129
You don't have to.
I don't know what you think.

826
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,734
If this is about dodging
what sex you get off on...

827
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:31,254
If you think you are
somehow being mystical,

828
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:35,333
being the best of either sex,
I have to tell you, Simon...

829
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,011
Simon.

830
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:45,048
Stood there in a frock right now
you look like the worst bits of both.

831
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:03,219
Stop hiding. Be brave.
Decide one way or the other.

832
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:06,331
For my sake, tomorrow, please,

833
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,218
turn up looking like
the picture on your passport.

834
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,568
I can't change what I want, Charlie.

835
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,649
I cannot change what I want.

836
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,292
I can't do that.

837
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,254
George.

838
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:16,729
Hey. No Lola.

839
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,092
- George.
- Mr Price.

840
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:20,693
Are we all set?

841
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:22,611
Did she say she was gonna be late?

842
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,649
No, actually she said
she was gonna fly out with the girls.

843
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,698
- What, from London?
- Lola.

844
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:34,730
Funny, isn't it?
They look quite dead like this.

845
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:38,210
Don't worry, George.
It'll be a different story tomorrow.

846
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:45,452
Look. That's us.
The Milan main catwalk.

847
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,934
The Angel girls
wearing our boys, eh, Charlie?

848
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:14,133
You know, as Lola would say, there's
a slight chill in the air, Charlie.

849
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:21,171
- And I'm getting worried...
- I had an argument with her.

850
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:23,410
- What?
- With Lola.

851
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,298
Last night in the restaurant. See...

852
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:30,692
She turned up in a dress and I just...

853
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,172
She didn't go to London, did she?

854
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,611
She didn't get on a plane at all.

855
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,329
Lauren. There was a bloke
that wanted to buy the factory.

856
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:51,935
Richard Bailey. He was with Nicola
at the restaurant and I just...

857
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,692
All that does not apply to me.

858
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,817
What applies is that there is
nobody here to wear our boots

859
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,937
that we have worked our arses off
to get here, Charlie.

860
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,170
OK. I... Yes, I am sorry,

861
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:05,297
but it's just I felt
somehow useless as a man.

862
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:15,329
Sitting there in the restaurant,
I felt somehow useless as a man.

863
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,419
So here we are again.

864
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,413
Charlie Price, standing in front of me,

865
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:31,137
saying, "It's not my fault.
What can I do?"

866
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,570
<i>- Hello, this is Lola.
- Lola.</i>

867
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:54,016
<i>I'm not here now. Well, I am
here, but you know what to do.</i>

868
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:02,016
Lola, when you pick this up,
this is a Charlie from Northampton.

869
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:48,134
OK, we have the exhibitors, please?
For Prices?

870
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,213
That's me.

871
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,416
And the dressers?

872
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,535
That's me.

873
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,133
The models?

874
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,820
That's you as well, isn't it?

875
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:11,092
George. OK, he's all set.
He looks fantastic.

876
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,855
<i>- ... Prices.
- Go.</i>

877
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:19,092
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, please take
your seats for the Prices collection.</i>

878
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,216
Does he look sexy?

879
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,498
He does to me, George.

880
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:39,374
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, please take
your seats for the Prices collection.</i>

881
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:48,498
OK? OK.

882
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:53,289
This is it, it's you, Mr Price.

883
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,648
Shit.

884
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:50,409
<i>You keep lying</i>

885
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,809
<i>When you oughta be truthin'</i>

886
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:59,048
<i>And you keep losin'
when you oughta not bet</i>

887
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:03,736
<i>You keep samin'
when you oughta be changin'</i>

888
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:05,139
<i>Now what's right is right</i>

889
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,654
<i>But you ain't been right yet</i>

890
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:11,420
<i>These boots are made for walking</i>

891
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,173
<i>And that's just what they'll do</i>

892
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:18,731
<i>One of these days these boots
are gonna walk all over you</i>

893
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:27,852
<i>I once met a man
with a sense of adventure</i>

894
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,453
<i>He was dressed to thrill</i>

895
01:31:29,539 --> 01:31:31,178
<i>Wherever he went</i>

896
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:35,253
<i>He said,
"Let's make love on a mountain top"</i>

897
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,934
<i>"Under the stars, on a big hard rock"</i>

898
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:39,612
<i>I said, "In these shoes?"</i>

899
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,258
<i>"I don't think so"</i>

900
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,819
<i>Here I am looking for crime</i>

901
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:45,492
<i>I'm looking for some action</i>

902
01:31:45,579 --> 01:31:47,536
<i>What I have a million times</i>

903
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,655
<i>Will give you satisfaction</i>

904
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,458
<i>So don't you mess around with me</i>

905
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,097
<i>You won't know what to do</i>

906
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:54,771
<i>Cos I'll put on my cha cha heels</i>

907
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,691
<i>And walk all over you</i>

908
01:31:56,780 --> 01:32:00,011
<i>Gimme gimme cha cha heels</i>

909
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,139
<i>All I want is cha cha heels</i>

910
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:07,815
<i>Gimme gimme cha cha heels</i>

911
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:12,178
<i>If I don't get my cha cha heels
I'll walk all over you</i>

912
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:16,733
<i>Zippin' up my boots</i>

913
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,737
<i>Goin' back to my roots, yeah</i>

914
01:32:22,539 --> 01:32:24,576
<i>To the place of my birth</i>

915
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,416
<i>Back down to earth</i>

916
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:36,492
<i>I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around</i>

917
01:32:36,579 --> 01:32:38,218
<i>Zippin' up my boots</i>

918
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,015
<i>Goin' back to my roots</i>

919
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,697
Come on, Lauren.

920
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:15,578
Stand by your man, Lauren.

921
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,137
Thank you.

922
01:33:58,820 --> 01:34:03,496
<i>Lola, this is a Charlie
from Northampton.</i>

923
01:34:03,579 --> 01:34:08,131
<i>I'm looking at a shoe fair programme
with a big gap where you should be.</i>

924
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,176
<i>But I have to say,
unlike most people,</i>

925
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:12,410
<i>wherever you leave,
you leave a gap, Lola.</i>

926
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:17,016
<i>You will in Northampton.
You have in Milan.</i>

927
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,932
<i>Listen, if people ever tell you,
you look half a man,</i>

928
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:22,056
<i>you gotta remember, that's fine.</i>

929
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:24,131
<i>I mean,
I don't know what half a man is.</i>

930
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,972
<i>I don't know what the hell a man is.</i>

931
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:30,291
<i>But I know that
if it involves being brave,</i>

932
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:35,374
<i>you are more of a man than
I will ever be. Goodbye, Lola.</i>

933
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,097
Don't think that's why I came.

934
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,057
I came for the adulation.

935
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,536
Why am I leaving you?

936
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,490
I'm afraid in life,

937
01:35:15,579 --> 01:35:19,255
Lola has always been drawn
to the most exciting,

938
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,854
the most daring,

939
01:35:21,940 --> 01:35:25,454
the most sexy.

940
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:31,328
There is tell of a mystical place,
far north of here,

941
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:33,980
called Northampton.

942
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:38,649
Exciting, because
it contains a shoe factory

943
01:35:38,740 --> 01:35:42,096
struggling to survive
against all the odds.

944
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:47,129
Daring, because it's run
by a man brave enough to recognise

945
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:51,372
that a factory is its people,
not its bricks.

946
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:56,579
And sexy,
well, because now I work there.

947
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,488
And the craftsmen of fantasy,

948
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:05,608
for ladies, gentleman,
and those of you who are yet...

949
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,691
...to make up your minds.

950
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:12,854
Tonight I give you,
the Kinky Boot Factory.

951
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:30,811
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

952
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,449
<i>If you stay you can't go wrong</i>

953
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:36,417
<i>I can boogie</i>

954
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,331
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

955
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:42,777
<i>All night long</i>

956
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:49,493
<i>No sir, I don't feel
very much like talking</i>

957
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:52,572
<i>No neither walking</i>

958
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:55,777
<i>You want to know if I can dance</i>

959
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:04,419
<i>Yes sir,
already told you in the first verse</i>

960
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,537
<i>And in the chorus</i>

961
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:10,896
<i>But I will give you
one more chance</i>

962
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,337
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

963
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,969
<i>But I need a certain song</i>

964
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,856
<i>I can boogie</i>

965
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,737
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

966
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:28,291
<i>All night long</i>

967
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:31,178
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

968
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:34,969
<i>If you stay you can't go wrong</i>

969
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:37,051
<i>I can boogie</i>

970
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:38,731
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

971
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:43,291
<i>All night long</i>

972
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:46,417
<i>Yes sir I can boogie</i>

973
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,288
<i>But I need a certain song</i>

974
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:52,052
<i>I can boogie</i>

975
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:53,937
<i>Boogie woogie</i>

976
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:58,218
<i>All night long</i>
