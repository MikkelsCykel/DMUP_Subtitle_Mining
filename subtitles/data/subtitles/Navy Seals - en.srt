I stopped drinking and started thinking.

66
00:05:11,840 -> 00:05:14,229
You should not do it.

67
00:05:16,120 -> 00:05:18,270
I do not know if I love you, Jim.

68
00:05:18,400 -> 00:05:20,277
Come on, Graham.

69

- Marriage, children, links.

Then what will you?

78
00:05:54,200 -> 00:05:57,988
A fridge full of beer
and the numbers of friends, that's what.

79
00:05:58,120 -> 00:06:01,829
After you separate,
what, a year and a half?

80
00:06:01,960 -> 00:06:03,916
I would not trust what he says.

81
00:06:04,040 -> 00:06:07,794

Sorry guys but

We go out together for three years, boss.

91
00:07:21,080 -> 00:07:23,275
We have to go ... immediately.

It's a joke, right?

95
00:07:39,600 -> 00:07:42,194
- Sorry Jo.
- I know it's the wrong time.

96
00:07:42,320 -> 00:07:45,232
With you is always the wrong time.

97
00:07:46,000 -> 00:07:48,230
I'll call you as soon as I can.

98
00:07:55,920 -> 00:07:57,512
There was a close one, boss!

99
00:07:57,640 -> 00:08:01,428
He was born lucky or unlucky.
Who knows?

100
00:08:03,520 -> 00:08:05,112
- Finished?
- Never started.

101
00:08:05,240 -> 00:08:07,071
It did not last long.

00:08:55,960 -> 00:08:59,236
No! You have not thought of. Nothing.

110
00:09:13,440 -> 00:09:15,795
Get rid of it.

Relax, ok?

123
00:10:56,760 -> 00:10:58,716

124
00:10:58,840 -> 00:11:00,353

They thought he was a spy.
He says that they tortured.

131
00:11:30,680 -> 00:11:34,673
Sailor my balls!

Room Service.

135
00:12:45,720 -> 00:12:49,269
- Where?
- On the roof! Behind us!

136
00:12:51,760 -> 00:12:52,795
God?

137

Here God

138
00:12:54,160 -> 00:12:57,277
There's a sniper in the tower to the southeast.

139
00:12:57,880 -> 00:12:59,836
I see it.

140
00:13:07,000 -> 00:13:09,150
Nice shot, but there are two others.

141
00:13:12,520 -> 00:13:15,717
Nothing on the screen.
Step infrared.

00:13:19,760 -> 00:13:21,671
Wait.

143

- Enemies! Alley! On the back!

148
00:13:57,720 -> 00:14:00,154
Wait! Fuck. We're losing him.

149
00:14:01,520 -> 00:14:04,671
- We have to take it away.
- Come, now!

150
00:14:06,080 -> 00:14:08,036
Come on, we gotta go!

151
00:14:08,800 -> 00:14:11,473
We are isolated from the landing area.

152
00:14:11,600 -> 00:14:13,989
Proceed to zone 2.
Again, Zone 2.

I am calm.
You've never seen rough.

156
00:14:24,680 -> 00:14:27,240
- Take your time.
- How much do you need?

157
00:14:27,360 -> 00:14:29,635
We left at 2:45. Or go back to swimming.

158
00:14:29,760 -> 00:14:33,070
- There were more!
- Ramos help me.

159
00:14:38,800 -> 00:14:41,268
Graham! Cover me!

160
00:14:50,680 -> 00:14:53,638
I hope that the bastards have
paid the gas bill.

165
00:16:19,840 -> 00:16:22,638
Here's why. I'm Stinger.

166
00:16:22,760 -> 00:16:24,876
Fuck! Guided missiles?

167
00:16:25,000 -> 00:16:29,152
Tombola. Leader, Two Bad Karma here.
Can you hear me? Step.

168
00:16:30,560 -> 00:16:33,518
Leader, Two here. Can you hear me?

169
00:16:33,640 -> 00:16:36,359
Leader, Two here. Can you hear me?

170
00:16:39,440 -> 00:16:41,396
- Can I?
- What can you do?

171
00:16:41,520 -> 00:16:43,112
Be '...

172
00:16:43,960 -> 00:16:45,916
This.

173
00:16:48,560 -> 00:16:50,152
Fuck!

174
00:16:50,320 -> 00:16:52,276
And now ...

175
00:16:54,360 -> 00:16:56,794
- This one.
- Damn, Hawkins!

176
00:17:07,760 -> 00:17:10,399
- It is not blown.
- Playing shit!

177
00:17:16,280 -> 00:17:19,875
Hide behind the bags.
Mark out the area.

178
00:17:20,000 -> 00:17:22,798
X-Ray, Bad Karma. We withdrew.

179
00:17:25,960 -> 00:17:28,679
Sniper on the wall!

180
00:17:30,280 -> 00:17:32,475
Another!

181
00:17:37,320 -> 00:17:39,436
X-ray approaches. Take your time.

182
00:17:42,920 -> 00:17:45,229
- On! We must go!
- Where is Hawkins?

183
00:17:48,560 -> 00:17:51,597
X-Ray landed. Su. Go!

184
00:17:51,760 -> 00:17:54,274
OK! Retreat! Away all!

185
00:17:54,400 -> 00:17:55,594
Go!

186
00:17:55,720 -> 00:17:58,792
There is a warehouse crammed with weapons!

187
00:17:58,920 -> 00:18:00,512
- Let them jump!
- What?

188
00:18:00,640 -> 00:18:01,709
Missiles!

189
00:18:01,840 -> 00:18:05,310
- No! We're retreating!
- Give me the explosives!

190
00:18:05,440 -> 00:18:07,476
- No! We retire!
- I can do!

191
00:18:07,600 -> 00:18:10,398
Let's go! Go!

192
00:18:17,400 -> 00:18:19,675
Up! Inside!

193
00:18:34,800 -> 00:18:37,997
Loaded. We return to base.
Check in is 10 minutes.

194
00:18:38,120 -> 00:18:40,395
- How are you?
- If you'll do.

195
00:18:40,520 -> 00:18:43,080
- Good.
- Lieutenant,

196
00:18:43,200 -> 00:18:46,158
really ... You are exceptional. Thanks.

197
00:18:46,280 -> 00:18:50,114
Do not thank us, we do not exist.

198
00:18:50,240 -> 00:18:53,835
We have seen it. Nothing happened.

199
00:18:53,960 -> 00:18:56,520
Here X-Ray. Target in sight.

200
00:18:56,640 -> 00:18:58,596
One last thing.

201
00:18:58,720 -> 00:19:00,676
Please.

202
00:19:02,680 -> 00:19:06,912
Here X-Ray. Received.
306 constant. Optimum speed.

203
00:19:07,520 -> 00:19:11,354
X-Ray Bravo. Ready to land.

204
00:19:25,320 -> 00:19:30,110
- Describe your raid.
- From the roof window.

205
00:19:30,240 -> 00:19:33,277
- Have you had contact?
- One, yes.

206
00:19:33,400 -> 00:19:35,595
Reached the goal, what he did?

207
00:19:35,720 -> 00:19:38,757
By the third place.
From left to right.

208
00:19:38,880 -> 00:19:42,759
- He shot?
- What the fuck, yes ... sir.

209
00:19:42,880 -> 00:19:46,156
- There were other cards?
- I took everything.

210
00:19:46,280 -> 00:19:48,589
- Everything?
- Apart from the onions.

211
00:19:48,720 -> 00:19:52,554
The leader was dead.
The co-pilot seriously injured.

212
00:19:52,680 -> 00:19:55,638
I help to move.

213
00:19:55,760 -> 00:19:57,716
There he started the mess.

214
00:19:57,840 -> 00:20:01,992
Skip the first landing area.
I've covered at the two.

215
00:20:02,120 -> 00:20:04,076
He faced the enemy?

216
00:20:04,200 -> 00:20:06,589
I sprayed them.

217
00:20:06,720 -> 00:20:09,598
Why has blown the door?

218
00:20:09,720 -> 00:20:11,676
I heard something.

219
00:20:11,800 -> 00:20:14,439
It happens to everyone.
But we react differently.

220
00:20:14,560 -> 00:20:18,109
- Others do not react at all.
- Why did you leave there?

221
00:20:18,240 -> 00:20:20,515
I had a plane to take.

222
00:20:21,360 -> 00:20:22,634
I tell him who he is?

223
00:20:22,760 -> 00:20:25,638
Call No. Tel Aviv before.

224
00:20:25,920 -> 00:20:28,388
Why did you decide not to do

225
00:20:28,520 -> 00:20:30,829
skip missiles, Lieutenant?

226
00:20:31,560 -> 00:20:35,394
I had one dead and two wounded.
I could not fuck.

227
00:20:35,520 -> 00:20:38,910
For her search for weapons
fuck is important?

228
00:20:39,040 -> 00:20:41,679
Not m'incolpate of things

229
00:20:41,800 -> 00:20:45,873
services that you had to know.

230
00:20:46,000 -> 00:20:48,116
Anyway, thanks for the tip.

231
00:20:48,240 -> 00:20:52,119
For you assholes 100
is a job easier.

232
00:20:52,240 -> 00:20:56,552
- And then they call lntelligence.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

233
00:21:00,600 -> 00:21:01,953
Mail for the crew.

234
00:21:02,080 -> 00:21:04,833
Lieutenant, you want to play pay?

235
00:21:04,960 -> 00:21:07,599
No. I keep the 60 bucks, thanks.

236
00:21:26,640 -> 00:21:29,438
Disorder?

237
00:21:29,560 -> 00:21:31,755
No.

238
00:21:31,880 -> 00:21:34,713
I think you might be interested.

239
00:21:39,680 -> 00:21:42,069
We needed a week ago.

240
00:21:43,560 -> 00:21:46,757
- Be ', who knew?
- Damn.

241
00:21:46,880 -> 00:21:48,836
They are still live.

242
00:21:48,960 -> 00:21:52,270
Want to talk about adrenaline? Fuck!

243
00:21:52,400 -> 00:21:54,197
Controlled.

244
00:21:54,320 -> 00:21:58,359
Yes, but I feel it inside me, boss.
I'm boiling inside.

245
00:21:58,480 -> 00:22:02,359
You do not need to bust it.

246
00:22:02,480 -> 00:22:04,596
Believe me.

247
00:22:05,720 -> 00:22:09,679
- The lesson is over?
- For now.

248
00:22:14,240 -> 00:22:18,119
We invade and talk about safety.

249
00:22:18,240 -> 00:22:21,869
You can not attack
our homes and talk about peace.

250
00:22:22,000 -> 00:22:26,755
Kill and talk of human rights.

251
00:22:26,880 -> 00:22:30,350
You use terrorism against civilians.

252
00:22:30,480 -> 00:22:34,314
If America kills our own,
we will kill the Americans.

253
00:22:34,440 -> 00:22:37,398
As with the bombing
Marine in "83?

254
00:22:37,520 -> 00:22:40,353
In retaliation for the destruction

255
00:22:40,480 -> 00:22:43,756
and the massacres committed
by American gunboats.

256
00:22:43,880 -> 00:22:45,518
Cute, huh?

257
00:22:45,640 -> 00:22:48,552
- What is your role?
- Shaheed?

258
00:22:48,680 -> 00:22:50,557
He became leader of a group.

259
00:22:50,680 -> 00:22:52,591
- Al Shuhada.
- Al-Shu hada.

260
00:22:52,720 -> 00:22:54,631
- The same.
- Who are they?

261
00:22:54,760 -> 00:22:56,637
They are new on the scene.

262
00:22:56,760 -> 00:23:00,514
We know nothing,
perhaps linked to Hezbollah.

263
00:23:00,640 -> 00:23:03,712
Jesus! Not much, eh?
Who is the reporter?

264
00:23:03,840 -> 00:23:06,274
- Claire Verens?
- How is it that knows so much?

265
00:23:06,400 -> 00:23:09,153
It is half Lebanese. He has contacts in place.

266
00:23:09,280 -> 00:23:11,635
It deals with the Middle East.

267
00:23:11,760 -> 00:23:14,593
It is a journalist. We do not say anything.

268
00:23:14,720 -> 00:23:18,554
Those are a perfect weapon.
Portable, easy to handle.

269
00:23:18,680 -> 00:23:20,113
What a brothel!

270
00:23:20,240 -> 00:23:24,153
These fanatics have the full deposit.

271
00:23:26,840 -> 00:23:29,638
Why you did not jump?

272
00:23:29,760 -> 00:23:32,115
They were attacking.

273
00:23:32,240 -> 00:23:35,676
- We support their decision.
- We pay to risk the SEALs.

274
00:23:35,800 -> 00:23:38,394
To be affected, and die if necessary.

275
00:23:38,520 -> 00:23:41,239
- I do not approve that decision.
- Come on, Warren.

276
00:23:41,360 -> 00:23:44,830
We do not think the past,
but what to do now.

277
00:23:50,760 -> 00:23:54,753
Let me, let us try again.

278
00:23:54,880 -> 00:23:57,713
Now I know this Shaheed ...

279
00:23:59,200 -> 00:24:00,918
The President will decide.

280
00:24:01,040 -> 00:24:04,237
Decide whether to give him another chance.

281
00:24:05,880 -> 00:24:08,314
No SEAL or blames you, Curran.

282
00:24:09,760 -> 00:24:14,629
I do not care. I just want to
resume those Stinger.

283
00:24:14,760 -> 00:24:17,479
We do not know where the hell they are.

284
00:24:17,600 -> 00:24:20,910
It is for intelligence to decide.

285
00:24:21,040 -> 00:24:23,838
- I do not agree.
- It does not matter.

286
00:24:23,960 -> 00:24:28,033
You will execute the orders, not from them. Used.

287
00:24:29,240 -> 00:24:32,391
I had it in hand. I had to catch it.

288
00:24:32,520 -> 00:24:34,476
And there you would have done?

289
00:24:34,600 -> 00:24:37,433
We have done away with.

290
00:24:37,560 -> 00:24:40,791
Well, 'as they say,
pay us for that.

291
00:24:42,440 -> 00:24:44,908
Take a break.

292
00:24:45,040 -> 00:24:48,794
Relax. Calm down.
Put things in perspective, okay?

293
00:24:50,640 -> 00:24:52,392
Lieutenant?

294
00:24:52,520 -> 00:24:54,476
Yes, sir.

295
00:25:31,880 -> 00:25:34,348
Head down, champ!

296
00:26:37,920 -> 00:26:39,876
- Dear Lieutenant.
- Champion.

297
00:26:40,920 -> 00:26:42,876
- To drink?
- Sure.

298
00:26:45,720 -> 00:26:48,996
Do you still think the enemy?

299
00:26:49,120 -> 00:26:51,998
- Exactly.
- Come on, is history.

300
00:26:52,120 -> 00:26:55,715
Come on, hit and forget.
What do you think, eh?

301
00:26:55,840 -> 00:26:57,876
Not only that.

302
00:26:58,000 -> 00:27:00,309
If you have a problem, face it.

303
00:27:00,440 -> 00:27:04,353
Pull it out, without fear,
and solve it. him think so.

304
00:27:04,480 -> 00:27:07,199
Take control of your emotions, son.

305
00:27:16,400 -> 00:27:18,277
TEARS OF RAGE

306
00:27:19,720 -> 00:27:21,995
I need to know if you truly want.

307
00:27:23,560 -> 00:27:25,835
Jo, I want it.

308
00:27:27,320 -> 00:27:29,834
I love you and want you to marry.

309
00:27:30,800 -> 00:27:32,756
But you know who I am.

310
00:27:32,880 -> 00:27:35,997
- And you have to understand ...
- I understand. And how.

311
00:27:36,120 -> 00:27:40,636
You can disappear at any time. I know.

312
00:27:40,760 -> 00:27:42,830
If anyone knows, I am.

313
00:27:42,960 -> 00:27:47,431
I got you so,
and want to be with you forever.

314
00:27:49,280 -> 00:27:51,236
I love you, Billy.

315
00:27:55,160 -> 00:27:58,072
Do play.
Quiet. Place $ 50.

316
00:28:01,960 -> 00:28:03,439
One moment.

317
00:28:03,560 -> 00:28:06,472
My car. The take away!

318
00:28:11,520 -> 00:28:14,432
So you learn to park on the field!

319
00:28:14,560 -> 00:28:16,516
Wait!

320
00:29:37,640 -> 00:29:40,359
Ok. Second attempt with missiles.

321
00:29:41,240 -> 00:29:42,878
Have been localized

322
00:29:43,000 -> 00:29:46,356
Latanya on board the freighter,
off the coast of Lebanon.

323
00:29:46,480 -> 00:29:50,712
The ship is full of
pilgrims and possible hostages.

324
00:29:50,840 -> 00:29:54,037
- How many terrorists?
- We do not know.

325
00:29:54,160 -> 00:29:56,549
And if they take hostages?

326
00:29:57,120 -> 00:29:59,350
lmpedirlo. At any cost.

327
00:29:59,480 -> 00:30:02,358
We do not want diplomatic incidents.

328
00:30:02,480 -> 00:30:04,630
Maybe there are mines disguised.

329
00:30:04,760 -> 00:30:07,194
Locate it and call the proper authorities.

330
00:30:07,320 -> 00:30:09,595
It sounds like a pleasure trip.

331
00:30:09,720 -> 00:30:14,236
Your base will be Nayak,
who is following the Latanya

332
00:30:14,360 -> 00:30:16,316
off the coast of Syria.

333
00:30:25,320 -> 00:30:28,312
- Captain.
- Here, gentlemen.

334
00:30:38,000 -> 00:30:41,788
All quiet. Let's take a dive.

335
00:30:43,960 -> 00:30:47,316
Ready for action!
Final check in 30 minutes!

336
00:30:47,440 -> 00:30:50,398
Have you heard? Come on.

337
00:30:53,760 -> 00:30:55,716
The sealed chamber is ok.

338
00:30:55,840 -> 00:30:57,796
Come on, Lieutenant.

339
00:30:57,920 -> 00:30:59,876
Up! Up!

340
00:31:01,040 -> 00:31:03,429
- Open.
- Valve fully open.

341
00:35:37,160 -> 00:35:39,879
Ask them where are the soldiers.

342 
00:35:41,440 -> 00:35:45,433 
- There are none. 
- The missiles then. 

343 
00:35:48,960 -> 00:35:50,951 
Nothing. 

344 
00:35:51,080 -> 00:35:53,036 
The little time is left. 

345 
00:35:53,160 -> 00:35:55,958 
What soldiers? What missiles? 

346 
00:35:56,080 -> 00:35:59,550 
This is a merchant ship. 
We deliver machines. 

347 
00:36:02,080 -> 00:36:04,514 
What the hell's going on? 

348 
00:36:05,640 -> 00:36:08,677 
We do not have the wrong ship. 

349 
00:36:29,720 -> 00:36:32,359 
- What? 
- Think about you! Rexer! 

350 
00:36:32,480 -> 00:36:34,357 
Stay here. 

351 
00:36:35,600 -> 00:36:39,513 
- Cape, there was an explosion. 
- What kind? 

352 
00:36:44,400 -> 00:36:46,470 
Hawkins, Where Art Thou? 

353 
00:36:46,600 -> 00:36:48,636 
- Hawkins, answer me! 
- Wait. 

354 
00:36:50,880 -> 00:36:53,997 
- What does it say? 
- Something about your mother. 

355 
00:36:58,360 -> 00:37:00,954 
Never speak ill of her mother. 

356 
00:37:03,120 -> 00:37:07,033 
- What? 
- It seems to me a dead terrorist. 

357 
00:37:07,160 -> 00:37:10,311 
- What 's happened? 
- Enemy killed in the hold. 

358 
00:37:10,440 -> 00:37:13,750 
- He fell into his trap. 
- Bring them together. 

359 
00:37:13,880 -> 00:37:15,996 
- Call the explosives team. 
- Sure. 

360 
00:37:47,440 -> 00:37:50,830 
There are nine boxes in the hold! 

361 
00:38:03,400 -> 00:38:06,039 
Lieutenant, I think you have screwed. 

362 
00:38:07,920 -> 00:38:09,751 
Holy shit. 

363 
00:38:14,600 -> 00:38:17,512 
The real lslam does not preach terrorism. 

364 
00:38:17,640 -> 00:38:21,189 
It is a tolerant religion, 

365 
00:38:21,320 -> 00:38:25,313 
with the same God as Christians and Jews. 

366 
00:38:26,360 -> 00:38:29,716 
The lslam preaches equality and justice. 

367 
00:38:29,840 -> 00:38:33,992 
Lebanese Shiites do not think so. 

368 
00:38:34,120 -> 00:38:37,635 
In the first four years of civil war, 

369 
00:38:37,760 -> 00:38:41,309 
fundamentalist groups were born 

370 
00:38:41,440 -> 00:38:46,070 
fighting for 
the survival of their faith. 

371 
00:38:46,200 -> 00:38:48,191 
The tolerance disappears, 

372 
00:38:49,000 -> 00:38:51,594 
faith becomes anger. 

373 
00:38:51,720 -> 00:38:55,793 
Al Shuhada is past violence. 

374 
00:38:55,920 -> 00:38:57,638 
Perfect. 

375 
00:38:57,760 -> 00:38:59,716 
Ok, finished. 

376 
00:39:01,680 -> 00:39:05,036 
I would like to ask you some questions. 
I'm interested in your work 

377 
00:39:05,160 -> 00:39:09,358 
and searches. 

378 
00:39:10,640 -> 00:39:13,598 
Who are you? Who represents? 

379 
00:39:15,040 -> 00:39:17,315 
My name is James Curran. 

380 
00:39:17,440 -> 00:39:20,876 
I do not represent anyone. 
I am in the Navy. 

381 
00:39:21,000 -> 00:39:22,956 
And what do you do for the navy? 

382 
00:39:24,320 -> 00:39:26,993 
Are in special units. 

383 
00:39:27,120 -> 00:39:30,271 
- A SEAL? 
- Exactly. 

384 
00:39:31,440 -> 00:39:33,396 
Ok, we have lunch together. 

385 
00:39:34,560 -> 00:39:37,632 
Why keep talking about Al Shuhada? 

386 
00:39:37,760 -> 00:39:40,433 
Any particular reason? 

387 
00:39:40,560 -> 00:39:42,232 
No. 

388 
00:39:42,360 -> 00:39:47,036 
We are not talking of 
Middle Eastern politics. 

389 
00:39:47,160 -> 00:39:49,754 
But missiles. 

390 
00:39:50,480 -> 00:39:52,436 
Missiles? 

391 
00:39:53,640 -> 00:39:55,756 
Why do you think is here? 

392 
00:39:55,880 -> 00:40:00,351 
Reliable sources inform me that the U.S. 
sent missiles in the area. 

393 
00:40:00,480 -> 00:40:03,950 
And now a SEAL Shaheed asks me. 

394 
00:40:05,040 -> 00:40:07,952 
American missiles do you think? 

395 
00:40:08,080 -> 00:40:09,195 
You told me yourself. 

396 
00:40:09,320 -> 00:40:11,914 
- I did not say anything. 
- Me neither. 

397 
00:40:14,280 -> 00:40:17,078 
Come on, Lieutenant. They plotted the SEALs? 

398 
00:40:18,000 -> 00:40:20,434 
Nothing special. Are trained. 

399 
00:40:21,320 -> 00:40:23,276 
I take a look? 

400 
00:40:25,000 -> 00:40:26,115 
Sure. 

401 
00:40:37,160 -> 00:40:41,950 
Only 10% make it. 
It is a question of resistance. 

402 
00:41:37,640 -> 00:41:39,995 
So boys and earn well right? 

403 
00:41:41,120 -> 00:41:43,111 
Little stuff. 

404 
00:41:43,240 -> 00:41:46,118 
- Do not do it for money. 
- What? 

405 
00:41:46,240 -> 00:41:49,312 
- Do not do it for money. 
- So why? 

406 
00:41:52,040 -> 00:41:54,793 
To prove something to themselves. 

407 
00:41:56,040 -> 00:41:57,996 
This is the diving tower. 

408 
00:41:58,760 -> 00:42:00,318 
What are they doing? 

409 
00:42:00,440 -> 00:42:03,557 
Simulate the explosion of a ship. 

410 
00:42:03,680 -> 00:42:06,797 
Do you really think 
the missiles are on a ship? 

411 
00:42:06,920 -> 00:42:08,956 
It is the normal training. 

412 
00:42:09,080 -> 00:42:12,675 
Phone call to Lt. Scott. 

413 
00:42:12,800 -> 00:42:15,553 
- Although this is normal? 
- No, not normal. 

414 
00:42:15,680 -> 00:42:19,673 
It is Hawkins. Half-fish. Better get out 

415 
00:42:19,800 -> 00:42:23,395 
before press 
something against the glass. 

416 
00:42:28,880 -> 00:42:31,348 
Have you ever been in the Middle East? 

417 
00:42:31,480 -> 00:42:33,755 
- Beirut. 
- When? 

418 
00:42:33,880 -> 00:42:36,189 
'83, '84. 

419 
00:42:36,320 -> 00:42:39,630 
When they bombed 
the field of marine? 

420 
00:42:39,760 -> 00:42:41,716 
Yes, I was there. 

421 
00:42:42,480 -> 00:42:44,835 
Two of my friends lost their lives. 

422 
00:42:47,120 -> 00:42:50,237 
Then tell me what you know about the missiles? 

423 
00:42:50,360 -> 00:42:53,716 
You do not understand. 
I am a journalist, not a spy. 

424 
00:42:55,080 -> 00:42:57,116 
What is the club of marine? 

425 
00:42:57,880 -> 00:43:01,190 
No. We call the factory. 

426 
00:43:03,160 -> 00:43:05,116 
We use it for CQB. 

427 
00:43:05,240 -> 00:43:07,310 
Close battles. 

428 
00:43:08,920 -> 00:43:10,876 
Sounds like fun. 

429 
00:43:11,920 -> 00:43:13,876 
It is. 

430 
00:43:23,040 -> 00:43:25,474 
- A place! 
- A place! 

431 
00:43:28,720 -> 00:43:29,835 
Thanks. 

432 
00:43:34,320 -> 00:43:36,914 
Is he not scared, right? 

433 
00:43:37,040 -> 00:43:38,632 
Carina! 

434 
00:43:46,160 -> 00:43:47,878 
What the fuck you think of? 

435 
00:43:48,000 -> 00:43:52,755 
It is the war we're in 
and there is nothing to do! 

436 
00:43:52,880 -> 00:43:54,836 
You know that the missiles. 

437 
00:43:54,960 -> 00:43:57,838 
I know myself. What do we do then? 

438 
00:43:57,960 -> 00:44:00,758 
- You take it? 
- If we find it. Where is it? 

439 
00:44:00,880 -> 00:44:02,632 
- I do not know. 
- Anyone know? 

440 
00:44:08,960 -> 00:44:12,032 
I do not know what to tell you. If you trust. 

441 
00:44:30,160 -> 00:44:31,912 
Good evening. 

442 
00:44:32,040 -> 00:44:34,679 
Welcome to "The Garden". 

443 
00:44:34,800 -> 00:44:36,756 
- Thank you. 
- Please. 

444 
00:44:36,880 -> 00:44:39,235 
Near the fireplace. This way. 

445 
00:44:40,120 -> 00:44:43,271 
- Hey Hawk. How are you? 
- Hello Ruth. How are you? 

446 
00:44:47,040 -> 00:44:49,235 
Just a quick phone call. 

447 
00:44:49,360 -> 00:44:51,920 
- Over here, please. 
- Excellent. Thanks. 

448 
00:44:54,560 -> 00:44:58,235 
I passed the officer on duty? Thanks. 

449
00:44:59,120 -> 00:45:01,076
Here Captain Dunne.

450
00:45:01,200 -> 00:45:03,555
Curran call the pager.

451
00:45:04,240 -> 00:45:06,196
Now.

452
00:45:09,120 -> 00:45:11,509
So the navy is now your home?

453
00:45:12,280 -> 00:45:14,714
Not necessarily. And you?

454
00:45:14,840 -> 00:45:17,479
Hello girls! How are you?

455
00:45:17,600 -> 00:45:19,556
- Hello.
- What a surprise.

456
00:45:19,680 -> 00:45:23,070
- I've already seen! They are Dale Hawkins.
- Pleasure.

457
00:45:23,200 -> 00:45:25,509
Meet Claire Verens. Journalist.

458
00:45:25,640 -> 00:45:28,757
- It deals with the Middle East.
- Especially Beirut.

459
00:45:28,880 -> 00:45:32,395
One of my favorite areas.
What a shitty place!

460
00:45:34,000 -> 00:45:35,433
Have you been there?

461
00:45:35,560 -> 00:45:39,348
Seriously? Where fez
s'ammazzano each other for sport.

462
00:45:39,480 -> 00:45:40,708
Fez?

463
00:45:41,440 -> 00:45:44,159
Fez heads. Arab.

464
00:45:44,280 -> 00:45:46,953
In my opinion, have only one neuron.

465
00:45:47,480 -> 00:45:51,678
I'm half Arab.
My mother is Lebanese.

466
00:45:52,160 -> 00:45:53,752
Really?

467
00:45:54,400 -> 00:45:57,278
Be ', I combined one of mine.

468
00:45:57,400 -> 00:46:00,278
- What's new?
- Sorry. I did not want.

469
00:46:00,400 -> 00:46:03,517
I was just ... myself, you know?

470
00:46:04,280 -> 00:46:05,235
What?

471
00:46:07,200 -> 00:46:09,430
I gotta go. Sorry.

472
00:46:09,560 -> 00:46:12,028
- I'll call you?
- Sure.

473
00:46:12,160 -> 00:46:14,799
- Okay.
- The can give a ride?

474
00:46:14,920 -> 00:46:16,273
Gladly.

475
00:46:17,360 -> 00:46:19,078
It's all ok.

476
00:46:21,920 -> 00:46:23,876
See you, boss.

477
00:46:25,800 -> 00:46:28,553
So ... said?

478
00:46:28,680 -> 00:46:32,355
Be ', the first insult your land
and now we have dinner together.

479
00:46:32,480 -> 00:46:34,072
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

480
00:46:39,880 -> 00:46:43,350
Then grow among the mestizos
Fresno was not so bad.

481
00:46:43,480 -> 00:46:45,516
- Age ...
- You mean Mexicans?

482
00:46:46,200 -> 00:46:49,078
.. Mestizos. Matter of point of view.

483
00:46:49,200 -> 00:46:51,634
With you I have to think before you speak, eh?

484
00:46:51,760 -> 00:46:53,637
It would be a start.

485
00:46:53,760 -> 00:46:56,957
My mother was a teacher and dad,

486
00:46:57,080 -> 00:47:00,038
where he worked, was the field.

487
00:47:00,160 -> 00:47:03,516
He could not walk because
the face of a mine already ...

488
00:47:05,040 -> 00:47:09,909
A Japanese ..
had blown up.

489
00:47:10,040 -> 00:47:14,272
A good man, but he thinks it is crazy
because I am a man frog.

490
00:47:30,960 -> 00:47:32,473
What do we do?

491
00:47:32,600 -> 00:47:36,115
One thing to two years if it
all according to plan.

492
00:47:40,160 -> 00:47:43,152
Do not you like?
Be ', even to me.

493
00:47:43,280 -> 00:47:45,999
Your favorite song?

494
00:47:46,120 -> 00:47:50,113
Yes, you know "Turn the machine
and bring back to the hotel?

495
00:47:50,240 -> 00:47:54,199
What? Look at the sea,
look at that moon,

496
00:47:54,320 -> 00:47:56,595
two people like each other.

497
00:47:56,720 -> 00:47:57,994
Two?

498
00:47:58,880 -> 00:48:01,110
Be ', a little over two you think?

499
00:48:03,520 -> 00:48:04,873
See ya.

500
00:48:05,000 -> 00:48:08,310
Wait. Claire. Dai. Hey!

501
00:48:09,280 -> 00:48:10,395
Wait.

502
00:48:10,520 -> 00:48:15,640
Look. You are vaguely
funny and not bad

503
00:48:15,760 -> 00:48:17,955
but I do not care one bit '.

504
00:48:18,080 -> 00:48:21,959
If you do not take me to the hotel, I'll walk.

505
00:48:22,080 -> 00:48:26,119
Then the weekend in Bora Bora is skipped?

506
00:48:29,320 -> 00:48:30,548
Dai.

507
00:48:55,440 -> 00:48:57,476
- Bella maneuver.
- What's the matter?

508
00:48:57,600 -> 00:49:01,479
What happens to you?
Love the game and everything is permitted.

509
00:49:01,600 -> 00:49:03,158
You are an idiot.

510
00:49:03,280 -> 00:49:06,317
As you put it?
Is there anything I should know?

511
00:49:06,440 -> 00:49:08,795
- Exactly.
- Why do not you tell?

512
00:49:11,360 -> 00:49:14,033
I told the Stinger.

513
00:49:14,160 -> 00:49:15,388
Shaheed.

514
00:49:16,800 -> 00:49:20,270
Excellent. Why the hell did you do that?

515
00:49:20,400 -> 00:49:21,799
Information.

516
00:49:21,920 -> 00:49:24,434
Who do you think you are? The CIA?

517
00:49:24,560 -> 00:49:26,755
The CIA does not give us anything.

518
00:49:26,880 -> 00:49:29,075
So was and so it will be.

519
00:49:32,920 -> 00:49:34,876
We only have her.

520
00:49:37,800 -> 00:49:40,075
We still, Hawkins?

521
00:49:41,560 -> 00:49:44,438
Oh, yes. It is nearby. Sure.

522
00:49:45,040 -> 00:49:47,679
Give me a hand.

523
00:49:47,800 -> 00:49:49,950
Ok. I'm with you.

524
00:49:50,800 -> 00:49:53,234
It was enough to tell me.

525
00:49:57,120 -> 00:50:00,954
A jet carrying Algerian negotiators

526
00:50:01,080 -> 00:50:04,231
was shot down at Madrid airport.

527
00:50:04,360 -> 00:50:06,476
the passengers and crew died.

528
00:50:06,600 -> 00:50:09,592
- What is it, captain?
- Look at this.

529
00:50:10,160 -> 00:50:12,674
According to rumors, the weapon used

530
00:50:12,800 -> 00:50:16,156
is American-made, the Stinger.

531
00:50:16,280 -> 00:50:18,874
the alleged perpetrators
they were caught.

532
00:50:19,000 -> 00:50:23,118
The Spanish have reason to
believe he strikes again.

533
00:50:31,200 -> 00:50:33,156
Did you hear?

534
00:50:33,280 -> 00:50:38,035
Your defenders of the faith
kill the peace negotiations.

535
00:50:38,160 -> 00:50:40,116
You see, too, Claire.

536
00:50:40,240 -> 00:50:44,392
Help! Tell us what you know.
Whatever!

537
00:50:44,520 -> 00:50:48,991
Do not you understand? I do not create news.
The mean. As a journalist.

538
00:50:49,120 -> 00:50:51,429
- We're in it!
- I will not be an accomplice.

539
00:50:51,560 -> 00:50:54,552
Who cover concealing what you know?

540
00:50:58,480 -> 00:51:00,118
Ok.

541
00:51:00,240 -> 00:51:03,755
Write a piece. And another.

542
00:51:03,880 -> 00:51:06,030
And next to the downed plane,

543
00:51:06,160 -> 00:51:09,152
well write the names of the victims.

544
00:51:13,560 -> 00:51:14,549
Ok.

545
00:51:16,600 -> 00:51:18,875
But I will not say anything spontaneously.

546
00:51:19,280 -> 00:51:23,239
Ask and tell you what I know.

547
00:51:24,680 -> 00:51:26,432
Well.

548
00:51:44,920 -> 00:51:46,399
I think I have something.

549
00:51:46,520 -> 00:51:49,796
Walid Fahladi.
One of the brokers Shaheed

550
00:51:49,920 -> 00:51:53,276
- At your meeting ...
- Balbeck. Right.

551
00:51:53,400 -> 00:51:57,951
- Good. Let us move forward.
- You left the stage six months ago.

552
00:51:58,080 -> 00:52:02,153
- What do you mean?
- Missing. Maybe a seizure.

553
00:52:04,960 -> 00:52:06,188
Perfect.

554
00:52:06,320 -> 00:52:10,677
Shit, that was the best idea today.

555
00:52:11,560 -> 00:52:13,676
- What?
- What you said.

556
00:52:14,280 -> 00:52:15,554
What did I say?

557
00:52:15,680 -> 00:52:19,070
Why do not we sing
softened one of these?

558
00:52:19,200 -> 00:52:20,952
That sounds good.

559
00:52:22,920 -> 00:52:26,356
- Do not take us seriously.
- What do you want?

560
00:52:26,480 -> 00:52:31,190
You do not understand the situation. They are fanatics.

561
00:52:31,320 -> 00:52:33,231
Do not ever work together.

562
00:52:33,360 -> 00:52:36,909
- You are dealing with extremists.
- And you have to do with SEAL.

563
00:52:37,040 -> 00:52:39,474
Ok.

564
00:52:44,440 -> 00:52:47,750
Well. I've heard enough.

565
00:52:47,880 -> 00:52:51,953
Do not ever seize a foreigner.

566
00:52:52,080 -> 00:52:55,072
- Warren, do it over.
- No. I appreciate the zeal,

567
00:52:55,200 -> 00:52:58,556
- But it is not conceivable.
- One second. We know who he is.

568
00:52:59,000 -> 00:53:01,389
- Do you know him?
- Yes, he is a collaborator.

569
00:53:01,520 -> 00:53:04,990
He has already worked for us.
I thought it was a small fish.

570
00:53:05,120 -> 00:53:07,634
So why not contact us?

571
00:53:07,760 -> 00:53:11,719
If makes him for sure.
But if we take it,

572
00:53:11,840 -> 00:53:16,152
faking a seizure, surely sings.

573
00:53:16,280 -> 00:53:20,398
- A kind of defection?
- Call immigration if you like.

574
00:53:20,520 -> 00:53:23,956
For money that comes to bed.

575
00:53:28,360 -> 00:53:29,839
Warren?

576
00:53:29,960 -> 00:53:32,713
We can proceed with the plan?

577
00:53:36,400 -> 00:53:39,039
Okay. Inform the President.

578
00:53:42,600 -> 00:53:47,833
Well. Another time.
It could be the last.

579
00:53:50,920 -> 00:53:53,115
- Ramos.
- South side.

580
00:53:53,240 -> 00:53:55,435
- Graham.
- North side.

581
00:53:55,560 -> 00:53:58,358
- Hawkins.
- Gate. First floor.

582
00:53:59,000 -> 00:54:01,833
- Dane.
- Sidewall. Cover the second.

583
00:54:03,200 -> 00:54:06,112
- Well, Rexer.
- On the back. Cover the courtyard.

584
00:54:06,240 -> 00:54:07,673
Those on the street,

585
00:54:07,800 -> 00:54:11,759
in case of trouble, converge
on the house. The others remain inside.

586
00:54:11,880 -> 00:54:16,078
- It only goes away together.
- Remember, there is only one obstacle,

587
00:54:16,200 -> 00:54:19,272
bodyguard,
thus not the place flipped.

588
00:54:19,400 -> 00:54:21,709
If you can not shoot shots.

589
00:54:22,160 -> 00:54:24,151
It would be better to watch.

590
00:54:25,280 -> 00:54:30,559
BASIS OF RAPID ACTION
NORTHERN CYPRUS

591
00:54:30,960 -> 00:54:34,077
- Stay with me.
- You'll be fine.

592
00:54:34,200 -> 00:54:37,670
You are now on the Syrian and Israeli radar.

593
00:54:37,800 -> 00:54:39,711
Use routes civil

594
00:54:39,840 -> 00:54:42,718
jump in and swim 12 miles from the coast.

595
00:54:43,480 -> 00:54:45,198
If all goes well,

596
00:54:45,320 -> 00:54:48,198
the only problem will return.

597
00:54:48,320 -> 00:54:52,836
For this you use a Ribex.
You'll see it on radar.

598
00:54:52,960 -> 00:54:55,633
You only get one chance.

599
00:54:55,760 -> 00:54:59,992
If you miss one second,
you do it on foot.

600
00:55:00,120 -> 00:55:01,553
We'll be there, captain!

601
00:55:02,800 -> 00:55:04,756
Do your duty!

602
00:55:26,040 -> 00:55:27,996
Less than two hours.

603
00:55:28,120 -> 00:55:31,112
45 minutes at the point of landing.

604
00:55:31,240 -> 00:55:34,118
If you do not see me, you guide them.

605
00:55:34,240 -> 00:55:36,879
With pleasure. It will be a walk.

606
00:55:37,000 -> 00:55:38,353
It is not true.

607
00:55:38,480 -> 00:55:42,837
We do not expect resistance
but do not take it lightly.

608
00:55:49,640 -> 00:55:51,073
How are you?

609
00:55:51,200 -> 00:55:54,033
I'm sorry to leave
a plane in perfect condition.

610
00:55:54,160 -> 00:55:56,879
You do not have to like it.
You just do it!

611
00:56:23,520 -> 00:56:25,317
Altitude?

612
00:56:25,440 -> 00:56:29,399
- At what altitude are we?
- Approximately 9,000 meters.

613
00:56:29,520 -> 00:56:31,476
You are crazy.

614
00:56:31,600 -> 00:56:34,273
It's true! And we are proud, beautiful!

615
00:56:36,560 -> 00:56:39,074
Zebra 23, six minutes per flight.

616
00:56:39,760 -> 00:56:41,159
Received Black Fire.

617
00:56:41,280 -> 00:56:43,840
Received. Six minutes.

618
00:56:46,040 -> 00:56:47,837
Six minutes!

619
00:56:59,360 -> 00:57:03,478
Hey buddy, what are you wearing glasses?
You seem to already under water.

620
00:57:03,600 -> 00:57:05,591
Fuck!

621
00:57:16,720 -> 00:57:20,076
Ok gentlemen, on the masks.
Begin to depressurize.

622
00:57:20,200 -> 00:57:22,077
Now.

623
00:57:32,120 -> 00:57:34,076
Come on!

624
00:58:04,080 -> 00:58:06,514
Christ, Dane!
Who the fuck you prepared?

625
00:58:06,640 -> 00:58:10,758
It does not seem right.
If I were you do not skip.

626
00:58:10,880 -> 00:58:12,871
Well gentlemen. Ready.

627
00:58:13,000 -> 00:58:14,513
On the green side!

628
00:58:16,160 -> 00:58:19,789
One last thing.
Take care, be careful!

629
00:58:19,920 -> 00:58:22,115
Yes, then did the Coast Guard.

630
00:58:22,240 -> 00:58:25,152
Five, four, three, two, one.

631
00:58:25,560 -> 00:58:26,709
Go! Go! Go!

632
00:59:18,720 -> 00:59:19,869
Oh shit!

633
00:59:21,120 -> 00:59:23,156
Shit! Graham falls!

634
00:59:23,840 -> 00:59:25,239
Graham! Open it!

635
00:59:25,360 -> 00:59:26,634
Graham Open it!

636
00:59:26,760 -> 00:59:28,671
Leave him!

637
00:59:28,800 -> 00:59:30,756
Let Graham!

638
00:59:31,520 -> 00:59:32,839
To reserve!

639
00:59:32,960 -> 00:59:34,837
The stick, Graham! Now!

640
00:59:34,960 -> 00:59:36,188
Now!

641
01:01:03,040 -> 01:01:04,917
Two bastards in front of us.

642
01:01:05,040 -> 01:01:06,996
Easy.

643
01:02:22,600 -> 01:02:24,556
Here it is.

644
01:02:30,120 -> 01:02:32,076
- Do not sleep.
- Quiet.

645
01:02:42,520 -> 01:02:44,988
Team Leader here. We are inside.

646
01:02:45,120 -> 01:02:49,272
- Leader, here God position.
- Five here. Everything is under control.

647
01:02:51,080 -> 01:02:53,548
Two, Leader here. Position?

648
01:02:54,760 -> 01:02:57,433
Leader, Two here. Are in place.

649
01:03:09,760 -> 01:03:11,796
Leader, Four here.

650
01:03:12,600 -> 01:03:16,115
Approaching a night owl.

651
01:03:16,240 -> 01:03:18,390
Possible problems?

652
01:03:20,280 -> 01:03:22,919
Four leaders here.
It can be a problem?

653
01:03:23,040 -> 01:03:25,554
Leader, Three here.

654
01:03:25,680 -> 01:03:28,353
Ramos does not want to be rude.

655
01:03:28,480 -> 01:03:31,756
The night owl is placed in front of him.

656
01:03:32,360 -> 01:03:35,033
Where is Four?

657
01:03:35,160 -> 01:03:37,879
A hair more and goes inside.

658
01:03:39,200 -> 01:03:43,671
We're calm.
We avoid direct confrontation.

659
01:03:43,800 -> 01:03:45,756
Quiet.

660
01:04:20,840 -> 01:04:24,310
Leader ... the company has expanded.

661
01:04:25,240 -> 01:04:27,356
It brought the barrels.

662
01:04:27,480 -> 01:04:30,711
Chief, if something happens to me,
commands you.

663
01:04:30,840 -> 01:04:33,115
Three, Two here. Want a hand?

664
01:04:33,240 -> 01:04:35,117
Two negative.

665
01:04:35,240 -> 01:04:39,074
- I arranged them. Do not move.
- Get down.

666
01:04:39,200 -> 01:04:42,988
- Hawkins, do not start.
- I'm already going.

667
01:04:53,160 -> 01:04:55,116
Ramos, we'll get it?

668
01:04:55,720 -> 01:04:57,073
A place.

669
01:04:57,760 -> 01:05:01,230
Ok, boss. Let's do some 'cleaning.

670
01:05:04,360 -> 01:05:06,590
Hey, boss.

671
01:05:30,560 -> 01:05:32,676
He's dead.

672
01:05:35,680 -> 01:05:38,478
I told you to sit still.

673
01:05:45,960 -> 01:05:48,349
Throw his ass out of here!

674
01:06:53,160 -> 01:06:55,116
My God!

675
01:06:57,160 -> 01:07:00,277
Christ! God!

676
01:07:02,000 -> 01:07:05,470
Ready, ready ... aim ... Fire!

677
01:07:07,880 -> 01:07:10,713
Aim ... Fire!

678
01:07:11,960 -> 01:07:13,916
Aim ... Fire!

679
01:07:14,480 -> 01:07:16,436
Presented arms!

680
01:08:22,240 -> 01:08:26,916
Across the homeland and the Navy
the present this flag

681
01:08:27,040 -> 01:08:30,953
to honor the services rendered by his son

682
01:08:31,080 -> 01:08:34,550
and his sacrifice for their country.

683
01:08:34,680 -> 01:08:36,636
Yes Thanks.

684
01:08:38,880 -> 01:08:40,996
Right!

685
01:08:41,120 -> 01:08:43,076
Next!

686
01:08:52,720 -> 01:08:55,280
I have a right to know, James.

687
01:08:57,360 -> 01:08:59,316
How dead?

688
01:09:02,520 -> 01:09:04,750
In training.

689
01:09:05,600 -> 01:09:07,556
Bullshit.

690
01:09:09,360 -> 01:09:12,955
- Lying.
- I can not tell you, Jo.

691
01:09:13,080 -> 01:09:17,790
Go to hell you, your secrets
and these commemorations false!

692
01:09:23,120 -> 01:09:25,076
Tell me, James.

693
01:09:28,720 -> 01:09:32,030
You may seem trivial

694
01:09:33,480 -> 01:09:35,755
but, if we were married,

695
01:09:37,600 -> 01:09:40,558
I had the flag?

696
01:09:42,880 -> 01:09:45,075
Yes

697
01:09:45,200 -> 01:09:47,555
You would date.

698
01:10:41,400 -> 01:10:46,428
- God! I can not.
- Another round! Go with someone else!

699
01:10:47,280 -> 01:10:49,953
Another here!

700
01:10:50,080 -> 01:10:52,640
- Put it on my account.
- Yes Graham?

701
01:10:52,760 -> 01:10:55,399
Billy Graham. Tonight I'll pay.

702
01:10:55,520 -> 01:10:57,476
- Pay, eh!
- Yeah.

703
01:10:57,600 -> 01:11:00,068
- What are we celebrating?
- The board.

704
01:11:00,200 -> 01:11:02,236
Hey! Where is mine?

705
01:11:03,520 -> 01:11:05,476
At the board!

706
01:11:05,600 -> 01:11:08,990
Hey, there's the game now?
Fuck. Turn!

707
01:11:10,400 -> 01:11:13,472
We are looking
the world of golf, right? Thanks.

708
01:11:13,600 -> 01:11:17,878
Is your bar, sucker?
If it is not yours, move your ass.

709
01:11:18,000 -> 01:11:20,639
I move my ass? Yeah, okay.

710
01:11:20,760 -> 01:11:23,433
The type wants a beer on your ass.

711
01:11:24,800 -> 01:11:27,553
Move your ass.

712
01:11:28,960 -> 01:11:32,919
- Move your ass to whom?
- Hey! Sorry.

713
01:11:33,040 -> 01:11:36,476
He died a friend of ours.
The one on television.

714
01:11:36,600 -> 01:11:38,431
It's our way of saying goodbye.

715
01:11:38,560 -> 01:11:40,516
Why do not you join us?

716
01:11:55,880 -> 01:11:57,233
That stoned!

717
01:11:58,720 -> 01:12:00,711
I love you.

718
01:12:07,600 -> 01:12:09,556
Toast!

719
01:12:10,200 -> 01:12:11,633
At the head!

720
01:12:11,760 -> 01:12:14,069
To our best friend.

721
01:12:39,120 -> 01:12:42,430
What is it?
You do not like my toast?

722
01:12:45,240 -> 01:12:47,708
I still do not understand?

723
01:12:47,840 -> 01:12:51,150
Can not you see that your fault?

724
01:12:54,320 -> 01:12:56,276
Why did you leave the entry?

725
01:13:00,120 -> 01:13:02,475
Want to fight?

726
01:13:04,040 -> 01:13:06,952
Want action? A little 'action?

727
01:13:07,680 -> 01:13:10,478
I hope you enjoyed it.

728
01:13:10,600 -> 01:13:13,194
Why toast the man who killed you.

729
01:13:15,080 -> 01:13:16,274
Okay!

730
01:13:16,400 -> 01:13:18,356
Okay, it's true! I Scazzi!

731
01:13:19,120 -> 01:13:21,076
I Scazzi and died!

732
01:13:21,200 -> 01:13:23,998
And I can not do shit!

733
01:13:24,120 -> 01:13:26,156
So what do you want from me? Eh?

734
01:14:02,120 -> 01:14:04,076
Sorry!

735
01:14:04,200 -> 01:14:06,953
The party is here. Come on, please!

736
01:14:07,080 -> 01:14:09,036
No? I tried.

737
01:14:16,200 -> 01:14:18,156
Is anybody there?

738
01:14:56,280 -> 01:14:58,236
All right?

739
01:15:14,760 -> 01:15:19,356
So if they find the missiles,
you start?

740
01:15:22,640 -> 01:15:24,596
Yes

741
01:15:25,880 -> 01:15:27,836
- You ...
- What?

742
01:15:31,720 -> 01:15:33,995
Nothing. You ...

743
01:16:21,240 -> 01:16:23,515
Found them.

744
01:16:55,200 -> 01:16:57,395
Then Mohammed sang?

745
01:16:57,520 -> 01:17:00,592
lndosso this uniform again, damn it!

746
01:17:05,400 -> 01:17:09,029
Get the equipment. We go to Beirut.

747
01:17:12,320 -> 01:17:15,756
the missiles are in a school
in the Shia area of Beirut.

748
01:17:15,880 -> 01:17:19,475
A guide will wait for you Amal.

749
01:17:19,600 -> 01:17:22,797
Fighting broke out,
not get involved.

750
01:17:22,920 -> 01:17:26,629
Just make the jump missiles.
Back by dawn.

751
01:17:26,760 -> 01:17:29,479
- See you on board.
- Be found.

752
01:19:06,480 -> 01:19:09,756
BEIRUT - LEBANON

753
01:19:10,920 -> 01:19:12,592
Mimetizziamole!

754
01:19:23,920 -> 01:19:27,037
Where the hell is the Guide? You're late.

755
01:19:33,960 -> 01:19:35,678
You are late.

756
01:19:35,800 -> 01:19:37,756
Amal Do you?

757
01:19:41,040 -> 01:19:42,996
Ali.

758
01:19:43,120 -> 01:19:45,076
Christ, he is a boy.

759
01:19:49,600 -> 01:19:52,592
Already in the boy scout.

760
01:20:25,400 -> 01:20:27,072
Attack us!

761
01:20:31,120 -> 01:20:33,031
Go!

762
01:20:33,160 -> 01:20:35,435
Up!

763
01:20:51,600 -> 01:20:53,670
The other side of the moon, lads.

764
01:20:53,800 -> 01:20:55,756
Green Line.

765
01:20:55,880 -> 01:20:59,555
Druze, Amal, Hezbollah, Al Shuhada.

766
01:21:01,080 -> 01:21:02,399
lsrael.

767
01:21:04,960 -> 01:21:06,916
The abject poverty.

768
01:21:52,520 -> 01:21:54,954
Our battle is more in there.

769
01:21:55,080 -> 01:21:57,036
Let's move.

770
01:22:27,400 -> 01:22:29,675
Stop it! We need it!

771
01:22:30,840 -> 01:22:32,956
- Protect my boy!
- Like my son.

772
01:22:40,520 -> 01:22:42,636
I'm going on a relief!

773
01:22:42,760 -> 01:22:44,352
Go!

774
01:22:44,480 -> 01:22:46,630
- Cover me!
- Go!

775
01:22:50,480 -> 01:22:51,674
Fuck!

776
01:23:10,720 -> 01:23:12,676
- Hawkins!
- Go!

777
01:23:21,600 -> 01:23:25,309
- The guy has put us in trouble!
- What had he said?

778
01:23:26,360 -> 01:23:28,271
Bad Karma, God here

779
01:23:28,400 -> 01:23:31,039
They are 100 meters
west of your position.

780
01:23:31,160 -> 01:23:33,515
Target sighted.

781
01:23:38,640 -> 01:23:40,870
God here Bad Karma. Answer.

782
01:23:41,560 -> 01:23:43,869
God here Bad Karma. Reply!

783
01:23:45,240 -> 01:23:48,312
- Ok. I'll check.
- Stay up to date.

784
01:24:18,480 -> 01:24:20,596
Guys, I have company here.

785
01:24:20,720 -> 01:24:22,711
Are you American?

786
01:24:23,360 -> 01:24:25,476
God God's answer.

787
01:24:25,600 -> 01:24:27,670
Your God can not help you now.

788
01:24:40,880 -> 01:24:42,313
Dane?

789
01:24:55,760 -> 01:24:57,318
Hello, lieutenant.

790
01:24:59,680 -> 01:25:02,797
- Are you okay?
- Oh yes.

791
01:25:02,920 -> 01:25:04,876
Yes, I'm fine.

792
01:25:44,640 -> 01:25:49,191
Two here. Dane is dead. I get off.

793
01:26:08,640 -> 01:26:11,029
- Take us out of here.
- Come.

794
01:26:40,480 -> 01:26:42,471
- There.
- Where?

795
01:26:42,600 -> 01:26:43,953
There.

796
01:26:45,960 -> 01:26:47,518
I'll go.

797
01:27:37,520 -> 01:27:42,196
There seems to be having a feast on the third floor.

798
01:27:45,920 -> 01:27:47,592
So it seems.

799
01:27:48,720 -> 01:27:50,278
All right.

800
01:27:50,400 -> 01:27:52,356
I broke.

801
01:27:52,840 -> 01:27:55,035
I want to go, Lieutenant.

802
01:27:55,160 -> 01:27:58,072
- Ok, let's go.
- This can serve you.

803
01:28:17,000 -> 01:28:19,195
Come on, guys.

804
01:28:45,280 -> 01:28:47,236
- A place.
- A place.

805
01:28:51,200 -> 01:28:53,714
- Tombola.
- Check.

806
01:29:10,920 -> 01:29:13,912
ROCKET PROJECTILES DIROMPENTl

807
01:29:14,040 -> 01:29:15,996
We hope for the best.

808
01:29:19,040 -> 01:29:20,996
Christ!

809
01:29:22,160 -> 01:29:24,116
At work.

810
01:29:36,080 -> 01:29:38,036
Easy easy.

811
01:29:43,960 -> 01:29:47,635
Christ, will be between 15 minutes daily.

812
01:29:47,760 -> 01:29:50,877
If they see the ship, we are in danger.

813
01:29:51,000 -> 01:29:55,710
Sorry. Between 20 minutes we set sail,
with or without a SEAL.

814
01:29:55,840 -> 01:29:58,752
Quiet. There will be.

815
01:30:07,640 -> 01:30:11,679
Leader, Two here. Here is a day off.

816
01:30:11,800 -> 01:30:16,112
- What the fuck are they doing?
- Perhaps breakfast.

817
01:30:20,800 -> 01:30:24,349
Beware. Movement on the second floor.

818
01:30:34,040 -> 01:30:37,555
Boring conversation.
Leader, we will have company.

819
01:30:37,960 -> 01:30:39,632
Rexer! Leary! Come on!

820
01:30:41,400 -> 01:30:43,118
Force.

821
01:31:00,720 -> 01:31:02,472
It hurt! Curran was injured.

822
01:31:09,520 -> 01:31:12,273
See you, scumbag!

823
01:31:29,360 -> 01:31:31,590
Hawkins! Foul blow!

824
01:31:31,720 -> 01:31:35,110
- Sorry boss. I can not.
- To me it looks like an order.

825
01:31:35,240 -> 01:31:37,800
- I do not care!
- Jump ball.

826
01:31:37,920 -> 01:31:41,595
Leary, keep them at gunpoint.
Do not let him raise his head.

827
01:31:41,720 -> 01:31:44,109
Ok, Hawkins. I go on.

828
01:31:45,480 -> 01:31:48,870
Rexer, get a balcony.
If you expose, do jump.

829
01:31:50,640 -> 01:31:53,837
Ramos, when I go out,
you pulverize the facade.

830
01:31:53,960 -> 01:31:56,599
Please. It might serve you.

831
01:32:21,840 -> 01:32:25,310
Two here. Are immobilized.

832
01:32:25,440 -> 01:32:27,795
Ramos, let them eat dust.

833
01:32:27,920 -> 01:32:29,876
Stay strong.

834
01:32:30,720 -> 01:32:33,359
Here come the reinforcements.

835
01:32:37,760 -> 01:32:39,990
Get this, Shaheed.

836
01:32:43,800 -> 01:32:45,552
SEAL. I'll go myself.

837
01:32:45,680 -> 01:32:48,274
- Oh, Christ!
- Su.

838
01:32:50,120 -> 01:32:52,270
Two here. We move.

839
01:33:00,120 -> 01:33:01,599
Foul jump, Ramos!

840
01:33:18,040 -> 01:33:20,474
- Are you okay?
- Never been better!

841
01:33:20,600 -> 01:33:23,433
Reinforcements are here!

842
01:33:29,560 -> 01:33:31,471
Go!

843
01:33:40,960 -> 01:33:43,758
- I ran out of ammunition.
- Do you have magazines?

844
01:33:46,440 -> 01:33:49,193
lniezione of morphine. Injection.

845
01:33:49,320 -> 01:33:52,790
- Two, abdomen and thigh.
- Curalo. Hurry.

846
01:33:54,920 -> 01:33:57,275
Ok, lets. Leave a snap.

847
01:33:58,000 -> 01:34:00,070
You'll like this.

848
01:34:01,840 -> 01:34:04,912
- Help, Rexer. Ramos, cover!
- There is only one magazine.

849
01:34:05,040 -> 01:34:07,759
Use it! Come on, throw it!
Near the beach!

850
01:34:37,360 -> 01:34:39,828
Up! Move your ass!

851
01:34:39,960 -> 01:34:42,315
Out! Out!

852
01:34:42,440 -> 01:34:45,989
- Out! Move!
- Go!

853
01:34:57,000 -> 01:34:58,228
Ok.

854
01:35:05,600 -> 01:35:06,749
Go!

855
01:35:09,280 -> 01:35:11,236
Your head down, damn it!

856
01:35:14,040 -> 01:35:15,678
- Turn here.
- Ok.

857
01:35:15,800 -> 01:35:17,950
Way!

858
01:35:19,640 -> 01:35:21,039
Shit!

859
01:35:34,640 -> 01:35:38,952
The ocean is to the west and go
to the east, where the hell are we?

860
01:35:39,080 -> 01:35:40,672
Lost.

861
01:35:41,360 -> 01:35:44,033
It always seems the same. Everything!

862
01:35:44,160 -> 01:35:45,639
Click on the left.

863
01:35:49,680 -> 01:35:52,433
They leave in five minutes.
Does not bode well.

864
01:35:53,880 -> 01:35:55,632
Even worse.

865
01:36:19,080 -> 01:36:21,310
We have sown.

866
01:36:24,000 -> 01:36:26,230
- Behind!
- Shit! My ass is on!

867
01:36:28,480 -> 01:36:32,792
- Get out of here!
- Stop! There can be caught!

868
01:36:33,600 -> 01:36:35,830
All right!

869
01:36:46,000 -> 01:36:48,389
You have the missile. Use it.

870
01:36:48,520 -> 01:36:52,115
- If only I knew how.
- The make or break.

871
01:36:52,240 -> 01:36:55,073
- What?
- If you fail, we die.

872
01:37:05,360 -> 01:37:08,352
- We have sown!
- Thank God!

873
01:37:08,840 -> 01:37:11,877
I hear the ocean.
We are neighbors. Bad.

874
01:37:14,600 -> 01:37:16,636
- Fuck!
- Down!

875
01:37:32,200 -> 01:37:34,395
Obliterate the bastard!

876
01:37:35,960 -> 01:37:37,188
Take that!

877
01:37:40,920 -> 01:37:43,115
Outstanding!

878
01:37:43,240 -> 01:37:45,674
- On!
- Rexer!

879
01:37:45,800 -> 01:37:47,358
Rexer.

880
01:37:47,480 -> 01:37:50,790
- Guys, the car is on fire.
- Get out of here!

881
01:37:50,920 -> 01:37:53,753
- E Rexer?
- Rexer is dead. Leave him there!

882
01:37:53,880 -> 01:37:56,348
Su Hawk! Take it!

883
01:38:05,360 -> 01:38:08,716
Turns 270 degrees to the straight.
Depth 90 meters.

884
01:38:09,480 -> 01:38:11,436
Full speed ahead.

885
01:38:12,240 -> 01:38:13,992
10 minutes. I only ask this.

886
01:38:14,120 -> 01:38:18,352
107 men on a jewel of the Navy.

887
01:38:18,480 -> 01:38:20,755
I do not put at risk.

888
01:38:20,880 -> 01:38:23,838
Full speed ahead. Depth, 90 meters.

889
01:39:12,320 -> 01:39:13,639
Su.

890
01:39:31,880 -> 01:39:33,916
Up! Come on!

891
01:39:34,040 -> 01:39:36,759
In the water stop! Up!

892
01:39:54,680 -> 01:39:56,432
Down!

893
01:40:05,400 -> 01:40:06,674
Down!

894
01:42:27,440 -> 01:42:29,078
A place!

895
01:42:38,360 -> 01:42:40,749
- Some signs of the ship?
- What do you say?

896
01:42:41,840 -> 01:42:43,796
Typical.

897
01:42:47,360 -> 01:42:49,316
Maybe they heard something.

898
01:42:50,400 -> 01:42:52,356
Maybe.

899
01:42:52,480 -> 01:42:55,392
Maybe they heard the explosion.

900
01:43:06,880 -> 01:43:09,917
What you guys want to wait?

901
01:48:28,480 -> 01:48:32,155
