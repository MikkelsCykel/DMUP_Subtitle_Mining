1
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,230
Andy, have you seen my new blue tie?

2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,650
Yeah, second cabinet, uh, top left drawer.

3
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,230
Great.

4
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,520
Uh, briefcase? Anywhere?

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,040
Front door!

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,030
Okay, I know I had a
few drinks last night,

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,150
but I could've sworn when I came
home, this place was full of boxes.

8
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,990
I know. I unpacked this
morning.Want a tour?

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,680
No, that's okay.

10
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,540
It'll just be like a scavenger
hunt every morning.It'll be great.

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,390
What's wrong?

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,550
I'm just scattered.I
got court this morning.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,460
What, you got butterflies, detective?

14
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,120
Yeah, a little, before I
testify.It's no big deal.

15
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,630
Well, you look great.

16
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,020
Yeah, so do you.

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,870
- You know what?
- What?

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,150
- I'm happy.
- I know. Me, too.

19
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,680
Ooh, I'm really hoping
those aren't Dov's hands.

20
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,580
You know what I'm hoping?

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,170
Yeah, I keep telling you, your
voice will drop once puberty hits.

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,260
Thanks, hon.

23
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,670
Actually, I was hoping to use
my bathroom, in my apartment,

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,480
because, you know, I pay rent here.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,390
Sorry.Sorry, bro.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,570
Six weeks off the job.

27
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,180
It feels great to be back in action.

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,950
So how long is Gail gonna be here, man?

29
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,860
'Cause I didn't sign
up for another roommate.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,320
What are you talking
about? She's not a roommate.

31
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,800
Sweetie, don't put your
brush in my drawer.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,960
Your hair gets in my
moisturizer, and it's nasty.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,550
Sorry, babe. What?

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,510
Nothing.Nothing.I'm just gonna
go take a pee... in your room.

35
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,760
What's that?

36
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,730
A little housewarming
card for your new place.

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,530
Apparently, that's you and Luke.

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,430
Leo is in his purple phase.

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,970
Very cute. Thank you.

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,760
So how's the move going? You settled?

41
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,080
Uh, yeah. It's great.I actually
have everything unpacked.

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,250
What?

43
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,730
You, the girl who took six months
to hang pictures in her last place?

44
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,880
I know. It's-it's different now.

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,250
It's like... it's like I
know where everything belongs.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,210
It's very good.

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,380
Is that... Boyd?

48
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,120
- Yeah.
- What is he doing here?

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,140
Trying to get Swarek back into guns
and gangs, some kinda task force.

50
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,450
McNally, Nash.

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,390
Sir.

52
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,620
Uh, I need you over at supernova.

53
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,920
There's a concert going on there.

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,400
1,000 wristbands went out, and
they only got room for 800.

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,370
You're in charge, McNally.Take
the other rookies.

56
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,420
Great.Who's playin'?

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,800
Just another day at the office.

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,450
I said, get down!

59
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,130
Oh, I was looking for my friends.

60
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,740
Yeah, you were standing
on top of my cruiser.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,130
I wasn't standing. I was dancing.

62
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,100
What are you on, genius?

63
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,220
Um, natural high.

64
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,750
Natural high, my ass.

65
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,360
Let's go. Let's go!

66
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,810
- Thank you.Thank you.
- Okay, okay. That's enough.

67
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,980
Hey, Andy, what do you want me to
do with the rest of the stragglers?

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,990
Uh, if they have
wristbands, get 'em in line.

69
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,350
If not, uh, put 'em on the sidewalk.

70
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,420
Okay.

71
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,020
Hey, so, uh, I was just wondering- and
it's totally cool with me either way...

72
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,840
But, uh, how long do you think you'll
be staying, you know, at the place?

73
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,710
Oh, you were wondering?

74
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,020
Come on, people.

75
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,750
If you're hiding any alcohol or
drugs, now's your chance to dump it.

76
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,070
Have your pockets and
purses ready to be searched.

77
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,850
Better be water in that bottle.

78
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,260
Officer Epstein.

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,770
Come on, people. Patience is a virtue.

80
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,510
- Dov? Dov Epstein?
- Mark? Mark Johnson.

81
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,590
- How are you?
- Great, man.

82
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,860
- Wow.Not in a million years.
- Dov.

83
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,600
- I haven't seen you since, uh...
- Your brother's birthday.

84
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,850
The big 2-5.

85
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,980
Where the-where
barbecue caught on fire.

86
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,630
Yeah, man.So how's he doing?

87
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,020
- How is Adam?
- Great.He's great.

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,320
Uh... actually, I-I don't
know why I just said that.

89
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,490
He died about four years ago, so
yeah... uh, anyway, great to see you, mark.

90
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,330
Let's go, people. Wait now, tweet later.

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,510
All right, they're letting
them in ten at a time.

92
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,700
We just need to keep
the rest of 'em calm.

93
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,790
This is what happens when you put the
word "free" in front of the word "concert."

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,400
See, I love it. That's free
music.That's culture to the masses.

95
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,290
Don't get any of your
culture on my car, buddy.

96
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,460
That's right.Take it over there.

97
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,550
What, are you practicing your "bad
cop" routine for guns and gangs?

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
I haven't decided yet.

99
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,350
What's holding you back?

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,310
You.

101
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,790
I love working with you, McNally.I
can't imagine my life without you in it.

102
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,700
Hey, you get to wear
all that hair gel again.

103
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,020
We got a problem at the door.

104
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm on it.

105
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,210
See you later.

106
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,900
What's up?

107
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,780
50 more-that's it. Then the
doors are shutting for good.

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,140
Great.The crowd's gonna go nuts.

109
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,430
Let's hope. Maybe the riot squad will
let me shoot someone with a water Cannon.

110
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,000
What's wrong with you?

111
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,680
I haven't driven over 60 on this job.

112
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,660
I need a little action.

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,170
Fine. Then go take the back of the
line. They're definitely not getting in.

114
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,960
All right, you guys, cool it.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,890
Any pushing or shoving, and
you're going home.

116
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,340
Sorry to bother you, officer, but security
told me that the line was over here,

117
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,630
and I was waiting over there, and I didn't
want to leave, just in case-I feel ridiculous.

118
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,400
My only job was to stand in
line and watch my friend's place,

119
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,200
and now I'm not even in that line.

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,860
Look, I'm watching my roommate's
spot. We have wristbands.

121
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,940
Where's your friend?

122
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,590
She's just around the corner.

123
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,210
There's nothing I can do. I
mean, we're closing it off.

124
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,420
Look, she went to go get hot
chocolate for me at Artie's.

125
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,080
I got confused. The guy said
that it was to the right, and...

126
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,670
You always do what
people tell you to do?

127
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,570
- Pretty much.
- Yeah, me, too.

128
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,400
Well, used to, anyway.

129
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,900
Artie's is really good, by
the way.It takes forever, but...

130
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,410
- You can't hurry love.
- That's true.

131
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,320
All right, I'll make
sure I get you guys in.

132
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,860
Thank you.Seriously, my roommate
has been dying to see this show.

133
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,820
Yeah, no problem.

134
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Hey, boss.

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm gonna keep things
moving, if, uh, that's okay with you.

136
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,800
Okay.

137
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,570
- Boyfriend?
- No.

138
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,960
He's my tr
well, was my training officer.

139
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,090
He's cute. I had a lab partner
like that. Acts all tough, but...

140
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,460
Oh, yeah?

141
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,450
Lie back!

142
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,260
1509.Shots fired.

143
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,590
Supernova, queens quay and Richardson.

144
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,680
Two people shot. Officer down.

145
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,940
Rush an ambulance right
away. Repeat-officer down.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,330
It's okay. It's all
right.Just let the air out.

147
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,550
McNally, you're gonna be fine, okay?

148
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,830
You gotta stay down. Don't
try to get up. All right?

149
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,780
Looks like the bullet just
got stuck in your vest.

150
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,310
Just stay put.Just try to breathe, okay?

151
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,360
Andy. Andy, you're
fine. You just got winded.

152
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,790
The bullet's stuck in your vest. Okay?

153
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll be back. I gotta
be the boss right now.

154
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,600
Nash, Diaz, get that thing.Move it
over there.Get it out of the way.

155
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,400
Right here.

156
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,970
Gunshot wound, the back of
the head-the red jacket.

157
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,450
Back of the head. That's all that
I can see.I got pressure on it.

158
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,810
I'm right here.

159
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,920
No, no, no, no, no, McNally.Mcnally, sit
back. Sit back, relax.It's okay, okay?

160
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,470
I need you to stay put for a
second. We gotta get you checked out.

161
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm good. I'm fine.

162
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,890
I know you are.But that blood, that bullet
you're evidence, okay?

163
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,840
Just breathe.

164
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,490
Hey, Epstein, you're
gonna stay with the girl.

165
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,130
Diaz, round up those people. Get 'em over
there.Don't let anybody go, all right?

166
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,470
Get 'em all over there.

167
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,430
Okay, everybody, I need
all of you to step back.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
What happened?!

169
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,510
Uh, j-you can't go. Just
calm down. Just calm down.

170
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,990
Kate!

171
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,310
Calm down. Just
just calm down.

172
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,410
Oh, my God!

173
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,080
All right, Epstein, you're gonna
stay with her until further notice.

174
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,890
Okay? Write everything down
time of arrival, time that she goes into surgery,

175
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,410
all of her doctors' names, time that she's declared
if she's declared.

176
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,650
Okay? Stay on your phone.I'm
gonna go find her family.

177
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,450
Wait. What's her name?

178
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,380
Kate.

179
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,460
I think her name is Kate.

180
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,090
I need you to bag her for me.

181
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,230
C.T.A.S.One.

182
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,960
I have a 22-year-old female
with a g.S.W.To the head.

183
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,530
G.C.S.Is a 3.E.T.A.5 minutes.

184
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,720
What's happening?

185
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,470
Anyone notifying her next of kin?

186
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,430
- Oliver's working on it.
- Good.

187
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,320
Shots came from over there.

188
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,280
We got 3 casings from
a.380.1 of them got trampled.

189
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,760
No sign of the weapon.

190
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,340
Peck and Diaz are rounding up witnesses.

191
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,470
The victim's roommate is
heading to the station.

192
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,870
Who's helping from homicide?

193
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,930
Oh, we're trying to reach
Callaghan, but he's in court all day.

194
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,280
He's got his phone off.Not
that this is a homicide.

195
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,760
Looks like it's gonna be.

196
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,730
Oh, and we are going to treat it as
such. Detective, thanks for coming.

197
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,630
Heard most of it on the
radio on my way over.

198
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,850
I'm glad to help. Got me out of a sewer.

199
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,110
Detective jo rosati. She was trained
at homicide. She works out at 27.

200
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,470
Sam Swarek.

201
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,720
Oliver Shaw. How are you?

202
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,140
Where's the rookie
the one who got hit?

203
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,090
Andy McNally.She's right over there.

204
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,690
Okay, then. Uh, I'm gonna start with her.

205
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,540
You guys look like you have
the rest of this under control.

206
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,250
- You did good, McNally.
- Frank.

207
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,150
Jo, good to see you.

208
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,880
McNally, this is, uh, detective rosati.

209
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,030
She's gonna ask you a few questions.

210
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,360
That hurt? You okay?

211
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,860
Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine.

212
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,990
Yeah, I bet.

213
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,340
First of all, we're gonna
need your vest, okay?

214
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,160
Okay.

215
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,710
Walter, right?

216
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,920
It's okay. Relax.Relax.

217
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,370
- Okay. Let's have a look.
- Sorry?

218
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,110
I'm serious.You're gonna
have to go to the hospital.

219
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,940
Let's see how soon.

220
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm fine, really.

221
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,360
How many times have you said that today?

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,190
A hundred.

223
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,120
Well, you're probably gonna have to say
it about a hundred more, but good on ya.

224
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,470
McNally, right?

225
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,090
Yeah.

226
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,340
You wanna tell me what happened?

227
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,170
- Yeah, I, uh...
- It's no rush, okay?

228
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,470
No big deal.

229
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,680
I got shot once. Vest, right up here.

230
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
Puked for three days.

231
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,640
Didn't go to work for a month.

232
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,730
I was
I was the painkiller queen.

233
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,060
I could tell you every
soap opera plot for 33 days.

234
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,010
She was really nice.

235
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,270
That girl was... very sweet.

236
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,130
Anyway, I-I let her
in, and, uh, I shouldn't have.

237
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,640
I- I could've made her go
home, but I-I let her in.

238
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,960
Sure. She was nice. Of
course you let her in.

239
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:49,170
So-so I did, and, um, we
were just talking.

240
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,770
She was behind me.

241
00:12:52,090 --> 00:13:02,700
We were talking about, um, hot-hot chocolate, and...
And then there was the sh- she-she got shot.

242
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,020
Oh, my God.

243
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,720
You're doing great.Okay?

244
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,120
Hey, how you feeling?

245
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,330
I'm fine.

246
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,720
Sam, that was really
scary, and that hurt so bad.

247
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,410
I'm all right.

248
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,780
It's just that I've already got
this bruise that's forming, and-what?

249
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,010
Sam.

250
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,400
You gotta be kidding me.

251
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,790
You gotta get behind that truck.

252
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,940
Police. Get your hands up. Hands up.

253
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,280
- All right.
- You got any weapons on you?

254
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,560
- No.
- Turn around. Get down on the ground.

255
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,620
Down on the ground.

256
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,110
You got a gun on you, so help me God.

257
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,760
Give me that.

258
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,740
This is Swarek. I got a male
party in possession of a.380.

259
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm in a lot behind the
communications truck.

260
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,070
Please. I'm telling you
the truth.It's not mine.

261
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,710
Someone must've left it there.

262
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,050
You should be looking
for them right now.

263
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,880
I was just minding my own business, going
for a walk, and I found it, okay?

264
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,950
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you?

265
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,620
It was there on the sidewalk.

266
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,510
I- I-I
picked it up!

267
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,510
That's probably enough
times.So you can shut up now.

268
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,400
- I was gonna turn it in to you guys. I swear.
- Is that him?

269
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,430
Oscar Benson-17,resides at 422 Beckett.

270
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,190
Good. Let's get started.

271
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,150
Ident's on the way over to check for
g.S.R., so don't let him wash his hands.

272
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,240
What the hell is g.S.R.?

273
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,690
'Cause whatever it is, I don't have it.

274
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,410
Oscar, it's okay. It's okay. This
is just standard procedure.

275
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,060
We're gonna have you
out in no time, all right?

276
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,340
But, uh, let's get you a place
to sit and, um, I'll find you, uh,

277
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,040
something to drink once we get in there.

278
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,200
Right this way.

279
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,390
She just bought you guys about 20
minutes...Before that kid starts thinking lawyer.

280
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,820
She's good.

281
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,140
Yeah, she is.

282
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,840
The hospital is five minutes from here.

283
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,700
Yeah, it's a very
it's a very quick trip.

284
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,930
You know that talk
you were gonna give me?

285
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,570
W
what talk?

286
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,730
My first day.

287
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,490
You said that we were gonna go and get a
coffee, and you were gonna give me the talk.

288
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,660
That's, uh, that's a long time ago.

289
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,210
Not really.

290
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,380
Okay.

291
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,370
Um... I'm Oliver.

292
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,160
Oliver Shaw. I'll be your training
officer, uh, until further notice.

293
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,550
You don't touch anything in
the car until, uh, I tell you to.

294
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,900
You don't write anything down in
your memo book until I tell you to.

295
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,070
You don't talk to oth-other
people. You look at me first.

296
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,890
You do as I say, not as, um, I do.

297
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,580
I know you probably think right now
I'm-I'm being a bit of a hard-ass,

298
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,580
but if it gets stressed out there, I will be, because my
my job is to keep you safe.

299
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,600
This crest, uh, on my shoulder
this represents, you, McNally, and we're...

300
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,690
We're both going home today.

301
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,200
That's a really good talk.

302
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,260
Andy? Andy.

303
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,920
- It's okay. It's not mine. It's fine.
- Where'd it get you?

304
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,470
It's just my ribs. It's
fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

305
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,710
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay. It's okay. Relax, okay? It's just sore.

306
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,050
McNally.S
sorry.

307
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:13,950
Uh, the roommate wants
detective Callaghan.

308
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,470
Jo, what are you doing here?

309
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,680
I'm just in to help.

310
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,600
The roommate wants to talk to you.She's
in the d's office. If you're up for it.

311
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,100
I hear we got the shooter.

312
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,060
Yeah, looks like. We found a kid with
a gun.We're just about to talk to him.

313
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,290
You don't have to do this. Just give
'em your statement.I'll drive you home.

314
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,930
Yeah, you know what? I
understand that. I'm fine, okay?

315
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,690
I want to be here. I need to be here.

316
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,560
We'd been in line for, like, an hour.

317
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,980
I mean, she was cold. She's always freezing. So
I went to get us some hot chocolate.

318
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,700
And I shouldn't have gone. I
shouldn't have waited for it.

319
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,160
I should've just come right back.

320
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,730
Miranda, I get what you're saying, but
it wouldn't have changed anything.

321
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,060
She didn't even want to come today.

322
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,550
Kate barely even listens to music.I
mean, she listens to classical.

323
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,580
But she says it helps her study.

324
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,150
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

325
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,790
Yeah, we're just talking about Kate.

326
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,610
Okay.

327
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,890
Oscar Benson-no priors, but
his brother's in a gang.

328
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,950
- Doesn't mean he is.
- Doesn't mean he isn't.

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,310
Think it's an initiation?

330
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,840
Yeah, targeting a cop
in certain circles, that might buy you some credibility.

331
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,490
Okay, Luke, we got it.

332
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,380
- What, are you serious?
- Yeah, I called her.

333
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,170
You were in court.I needed backup.

334
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,860
Yeah, but I'm here now, and
this guy shot a cop.

335
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,680
A cop who happens to be your girlfriend.

336
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,300
I mean, unless she's not, and
you just like to make out

337
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,960
with every cute officer
who takes a bullet.

338
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,610
Uh, I-it's a conflict.

339
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,980
Okay, you do live with her.

340
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,300
Congratulations.

341
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,960
Jerry, this is what I do, all right?

342
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,870
So I'm doing something.

343
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,310
All right, your name goes on nothing, and
you have to stay away from this guy.

344
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,480
- Fine.
- I'm gonna take first crack.

345
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,530
Uh, all right with you? I'm not
really up for playing good cop.

346
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,630
You guys used to partner together, right?

347
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,700
Yeah.

348
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,280
She ever play good cop?

349
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,360
- No.
- Right.

350
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,930
So the girl you shot's
in critical condition.

351
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,850
And guess what else.

352
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,730
You also shot a police officer, Oscar.

353
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,070
I didn't shoot anyone.

354
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,850
Can you just tell me who you were
aiming for, or should I ask your brother?

355
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,110
My brother has nothing to do with it.

356
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,420
So you did it all by yourself?

357
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,700
That's not what I meant.

358
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,470
I seriously doubt that you
were aiming for Kate novatski,

359
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,510
but I guess that's the problem
with shooting into a crowd.

360
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,850
I saw a gun on the
sidewalk. I picked it up.

361
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,390
Why didn't you come forward?

362
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,270
I wanted to sell it. I could
get 500 bucks for that thing.

363
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,260
You found it?

364
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah, that's right.

365
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,600
They took her into surgery at 14:43.

366
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,100
Doesn't look good.

367
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,190
What else can I do?

368
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,040
I'll call you back.

369
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,460
- Ms. novatski.
- Where's Katie? Is she okay?

370
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,150
She's in surgery right
now.I'll take you there.

371
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,240
- You were with her?
- I was in the ambulance.

372
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,690
Was she awake? Responsive? How
much blood did she lose?

373
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,040
Ma'am, a doctor will give you all that...

374
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,800
Okay, look, please. I'm a
nurse at oakville general.

375
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,330
I know how these things work.

376
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,890
They're gonna shove
me into a waiting room,

377
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,490
and they're not gonna tell me
anything until she's out of surgery,

378
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,760
so I need to know something.

379
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,210
She was outside at a concert
hall. There were shots fired.She got hit.

380
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,280
Where? Where was she hit?

381
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,150
It's a head injury.

382
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,990
Was there any brain activity?

383
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,620
Ms. novatski, you need
to talk to a doctor.

384
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,300
Katie-she wanted to
be a... an organ donor.

385
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,170
It was really important to her.

386
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:52,610
And she's young, and she's, uh...
She's healthy, so with a head wound,

387
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,220
she's a very good
candidate to be a donor.

388
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,820
So you need to help me.

389
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,550
Okay.

390
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,690
Somebody must've seen something.We
just gotta jog their brains a bit.

391
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,130
Charming.

392
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,670
- Don't judge me.
- Too late.

393
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,250
All right, everyone
take a seat, over there.

394
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,360
All right, since none of you
ran when the shots were fired,

395
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,550
and we didn't find any weapons on
you, right now you're not suspects.

396
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,840
But nobody is going home until
we know everything you know.

397
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,360
Yeah, every little detail, and we really
don't care if it takes all night.

398
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,540
I'll stay up all night with you.

399
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,620
You'll stay up all night washing
the pepper spray out of your eyes

400
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,000
if don't let go of me right now.

401
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,280
All right, who wants to go first?

402
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,790
How about who's had less
than six drinks today?

403
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,330
Lightweight, you're up.

404
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,410
I got something, but I don't
think you're gonna like it.

405
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,650
Try me.

406
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,280
2:33 P.M.- the exact time the gunshots
were fired- Oscar Benson was on his phone.

407
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,710
With his gangbanging brother?

408
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,310
No, with his God-fearing mother.

409
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,900
They were on from 2:26 to 2:37 P.M.

410
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,090
11 minutes on the phone with his mother.

411
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,610
That'd be a record for me. I'd
definitely shoot somebody.

412
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,890
I told you you weren't gonna like it.

413
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,790
I like anything that gets us answers.

414
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,050
So maybe he did find the gun.At
least we still got the weapon.

415
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,590
That was ballistics.

416
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,370
The gun was jammed, but the bullet we got
out of Andy's vest is a match to Oscar's gun.

417
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,550
The gun jammed?

418
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,290
Yeah, that means shot number four
never made it out of the barrel.

419
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,120
It's over. I just got back from the
hospital. Kate novatski's not gonna make it.

420
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,820
I need a minute of your time.

421
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,560
Kate novatski was pre-med.

422
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,560
She wrote her college admissions
essay on organ donation.

423
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,550
Donor card's complete. It's the
only thing her mother wants.

424
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,820
We gotta find a way.

425
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,280
Dov, as soon as they take her off
the respirator, it becomes a homicide.

426
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:54,080
Chain of evidence, forensics, autopsy
we need the body intact.

427
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,830
She got shot in the head. We know what
happened. What do her lungs have to do with it?

428
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,580
What the hell does her
heart have to do with it?

429
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,870
D
Dov.I get it.

430
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,740
You were there with the
mother. It's terrible.

431
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,510
Yeah, it's terrible, but it
doesn't have to be meaningless,

432
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,210
'cause right now that's
all it's ever gonna be.

433
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
But for this woman, for this family, we
have a chance to do something

434
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,820
that'll actually help 'em get
through this, so come on, please.

435
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,700
Fine. So we get a signed confession
today, before they take her off the respirator,

436
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,400
before they do the autopsy.

437
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll make a case to the
coroner, and we take it from there.

438
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,280
No, seriously, let's work it out.

439
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,220
Signed confession today, huh?

440
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,280
Yeah. It's always good to have a goal.

441
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,600
Roommate literally laughed when I asked
if Kate was involved in anything illicit.

442
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,910
Uh, she's an "a"
student, full scholarship.

443
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,380
No-no boyfriend, no enemies.

444
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,140
McNally, you gotta go home, okay?

445
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,670
No, I don't need to go home, okay? I don't
want to go home. What am I gonna do?

446
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,110
You want me to watch some tv?

447
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,390
You want me
you want me to take a nap?

448
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,140
Listen, if I'm gonna
figure this thing out,

449
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,870
then I need to understand why...

450
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,550
Understand? What are
you gonna understand?

451
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,210
Shots were fired.You were hit.She
was hit.She's on a respirator.

452
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,540
Kate. Kate's not a "she."

453
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,370
It's Kate, and she was
standing right next to me,

454
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,640
and-and I-I need
to know who she is.

455
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,640
Okay.

456
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,510
Take the roommate back to residence
and talk to her on the way.

457
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,690
Okay.

458
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,060
I don't understand.

459
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,080
If Kate's on a respirator, then
she's still alive.

460
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,700
Not exactly.

461
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,600
The machine's keeping her
breathing, but... I'm so sorry.

462
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,100
You know what? I can take you to the
hospital right now if you want to see her.

463
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,830
No, I don't want to go
there.Her mom is there.

464
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,170
I'm the reason her daughter's dead
or-or almost dead or, like, about to die.

465
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,710
I made her come with me.

466
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,670
I left her there, in line.

467
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,200
I let her in.

468
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,900
I thought I was being nice.

469
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,600
Listen, I-if Kate... is
really who you say she is,

470
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,620
then-then... this shot
wasn't meant for her.

471
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,920
It was an accident.

472
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,200
It wasn't your fault.

473
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,960
- Yes, it was.
- Right?

474
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,820
You sound like my philosophy t.A.Always
trying to make sense of everything

475
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,430
by saying,"nothing makes sense."

476
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,840
It doesn't change the fact that she
got shot and she's almost dead or...

477
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,700
All right, what about
him looked suspicious?

478
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,290
I didn't say he looked suspicious.

479
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,160
I said he was acting suspicious.

480
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,400
A person isn't
suspicious. Their behavior is.

481
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm doing my master's in criminology.

482
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,770
Well, good for you.

483
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,350
So what about his behavior
made him suspicious?

484
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,640
He was sober.

485
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,940
She was standing right in front of
me, and I saw the gun in her hand.

486
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,260
Or maybe it was a cell phone.

487
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,720
It was one of those
flip phones, you know,

488
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,510
so it kinda looked like
it could've been a gun.

489
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,200
Anyone cough up anything yet?

490
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,670
Uh, one guy threw up a corn dog.

491
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,550
We got the day to solve this.

492
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,410
- Okay.
- So let's solve it.

493
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,850
Okay.

494
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,090
If any of you tweeted, texted, blogged,

495
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,440
or uploaded any cell phone photos from
outside supernova, step forward now.

496
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,480
Larry, you're up.

497
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,920
Give me your phone.

498
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:38,010
It's a total violation
of the privacy act.

499
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,630
Listen, you grad school poser.

500
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,250
A 22-year-old girl was murdered today, so
if you have any photos of the crime scene,

501
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,410
you better show us, or I'll arrest
your ass for obstruction of justice.

502
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,750
That was so hot.

503
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,930
Let's see what you got.

504
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,130
You're still thinking gang, huh?

505
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,810
I guess you're not.

506
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,140
A gun like that is too valuable.

507
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,980
Gangbanger's not gonna get rid
of it just 'cause it jammed.

508
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,140
Well, it's not revenge.It's not
like the girl had any enemies.

509
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,220
Well, if it ain't revenge
and it ain't money...

510
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,750
It's love.

511
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,110
I don't know where it is.

512
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,090
I mean, I've seen her writing in a
journal, but I don't know where she keeps it.

513
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,160
Okay.

514
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,670
Is this her computer?

515
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,860
Yeah.

516
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:33,680
You know her password?

517
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,590
No, I would never
I wouldn't ask.

518
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,050
She was wearing that coat today.

519
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,790
It's mine. I gave it to her
when I left. She was freezing.

520
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,090
You wear that a lot? Every day.I mean...

521
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,090
Not now, I guess.

522
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,240
- We haven't talked about you.
- What about me?

523
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,660
Well, we talked about Kate.

524
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,550
We know that she doesn't have
any ex-boyfriends, enemies.

525
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,810
Well... unlike my perfect
roommate, there are probably

526
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,400
about a million people who hate my
guts- a few ex-boyfriends, a couple t.A.S,

527
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,360
but it's not them that I care about.

528
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,410
It's my friend.

529
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,090
Who was wearing your coat.

530
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,550
Are they printing?

531
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,190
Yeah, they're printing.

532
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,130
They're printing it right now.

533
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,900
Did you send me that one from
that, uh, the one kid's camera?

534
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,080
- You got it?
- I'm sending things over right now.

535
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,750
We worked from tweets, tweet pics, tweetdeck
hootsuite, Facebook, and cell phone photos.

536
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,410
Not a clue what you're talking about.

537
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,900
All these pictures were taken
moments before the shots were fired.

538
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,850
Now it's possible someone accidentally
took a picture of the shooter.

539
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,490
All right, bring 'em in.

540
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,850
All right, everybody, I want you to grab a
marker and take a look at these photographs.

541
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,240
If you've seen any of
these people with this girl...

542
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,890
The girl who got shot today
I want you to circle their face.

543
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,350
Now be sure. If you're
not sure, take a pass.

544
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,780
You got something, poindexter?

545
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,180
I know this guy from the student union.

546
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,540
So?

547
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,340
So I saw him today and I tried to
say hi, but he just kept walking.

548
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,230
You ever seen him with this girl?

549
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,320
No, I don't think so.

550
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,050
But I've seen him with-with her.

551
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,280
That's Kate's roommate.

552
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,870
- We should call Andy.
- I'm gonna grab detective rosati.

553
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
And the student becomes the master.

554
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,600
I wouldn't go that far.

555
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,950
Guy's name is Adrian sparks, 27,a
grad student philosophy t.A.,

556
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,410
lives at 1493 spadina, apartment 12.

557
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,650
Just hold on. It's
Andy. She's on the line.

558
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,120
McNally, can you ask Miranda
about a guy named Adrian sparks?

559
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,010
I'm not with Miranda right now.

560
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,410
Where are you?

561
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,410
I came to the student affairs office.

562
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,020
Miranda mentioned
filing some grievances.

563
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,100
I thought I'd check it out.

564
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,740
Hey,"Adrian sparks" ring a bell?

565
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,720
Yeah.

566
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,370
Miranda made a complaint against him..

567
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:18,020
Two complaints, actually.
It's not unusual.

568
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,650
Favoritism, harassment, stalking, ignoring, "he
loves me, he hates me."

569
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,300
Thank you.

570
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,440
Okay, Adrian sparks
was her philosophy t.A.

571
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,720
They had a relationship.

572
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,930
And she was the one to break it off.

573
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,040
Harassment, a couple of threats, and
she even had to get her locks changed.

574
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,110
We're working on that.

575
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,370
Adrian was up for assistant Professor.

576
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,280
We passed him over, pending
the investigation.

577
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.Good luck.

578
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,680
Thanks.

579
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,010
Okay, Kate was wearing Miranda's coat.

580
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,410
It's bright red, very distinctive.

581
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,740
Miranda says she wears it every day.

582
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,510
From a distance, the two
of them look very similar.

583
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,900
Okay, McNally, go and get Miranda.

584
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,170
We're gonna head over there, all right?

585
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,090
Sounds good.

586
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,040
All right, let's go.

587
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,280
Miranda?

588
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,550
Miranda, please open the door.

589
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,580
I just need to talk to you for a minute.

590
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,830
Miranda?

591
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,660
Hey!

592
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,950
Hey, get off of her!

593
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,680
You're Adrian.

594
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,420
It's okay. It's all right.
I'm a friend of Miranda's.

595
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,100
This is your ex-boyfriend, the
one you were telling me about.

596
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,290
- You told her about me?!
- I didn't say anything!

597
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:27,820
What did you tell her?!

598
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,940
Miranda, shut up!

599
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,790
Were you at the show today?

600
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,640
No.

601
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,380
No, you know what?

602
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,690
I don't have to do this.

603
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,490
Yes, you do.

604
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,670
So put your hands up and turn around.

605
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,440
Please help me!

606
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,500
He wants to kill me!

607
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,270
He's gonna kill me!

608
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,440
Please help me!

609
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,360
Stay here!

610
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,620
Adrian, stop!

611
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,980
Stop!

612
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,050
Don't move!

613
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,540
I said...Don't move.

614
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,430
Look around
you, Adrian, 'cause this is it.

615
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,510
Turn around.

616
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,380
Why?

617
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,490
I wanna talk.

618
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,060
What, you gonna talk
me down off the ledge?

619
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,930
I love it.

620
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,960
No.

621
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,080
I thought that was your job.

622
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,850
Not really, so if you
wanna jump, then do it.

623
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,050
So then why are you
pointing a gun at me?

624
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,080
I don't know.

625
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,110
Doesn't really make much sense, does it?

626
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,220
So now we can talk...Really talk.

627
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,670
Okay, fine. You go first.

628
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,590
Why are you doing this?

629
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,830
Why not?

630
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,890
It's what I wanted in the first place.

631
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,000
She'd be over.

632
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
I'd be over.

633
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,350
The whole thing would be over.

634
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,660
That didn't work out so well.

635
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,870
Miranda's still here.

636
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,220
So are you.

637
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,960
It's pathetic!

638
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,060
And now Kate novatski is...

639
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:18,010
Is dead because she was cold.

640
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:18,750
Yeah.

641
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,210
You're so naive.

642
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,490
You're just like... aah!

643
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,360
Uhh!

644
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,090
Aah!

645
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,090
Let go!

646
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,710
No! Don't!

647
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,370
I just wanted it to be done!

648
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,220
I just wanted to jump!

649
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,330
Yeah, I don't care.

650
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,220
Let go of me!

651
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,020
I just wanted it to be over!

652
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,790
He's up there.

653
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,990
Andy?

654
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,900
Suspect's secure on the
roof of the student dorm.

655
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,010
Pretty sure it's empty.

656
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,820
Uh, we got the guy...

657
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,240
Kate novatski's killer.

658
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,520
Luke's in with him right now,

659
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,100
so we probably have a
confession any minute.

660
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,840
I was in charge today.

661
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,350
I was in charge, and she got shot.

662
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,970
A girl got... shot.

663
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,140
So did you.

664
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,630
I thought if we caught the
guy, and maybe I could understand

665
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,730
why this happened, that
I would feel better.

666
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,440
I don't.

667
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,290
Well, that's 'cause there's
nothing left for you to do.

668
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,360
Everybody else
they're gonna live their lives,

669
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,810
eventually forget about
this, but... you can't.

670
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,290
Dov, that's the most
depressing pep talk ever.

671
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,770
Sorry.

672
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,420
Epstein.

673
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,400
Frank's waiting for you in his office.

674
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,580
I'm okay, really.

675
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,120
You will be.

676
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,230
I'm dealing with it now.

677
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing is the same now?

678
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,340
Thank you.

679
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,850
Peter mckee, 42 years old, 3 kids.

680
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,060
He's been waiting for a heart
transplant almost two years.

681
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,500
Ambulance needs police
escorts at St. pat's.

682
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,620
Epstein, don't, um...

683
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,660
Don't have an accident.

684
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,850
I didn't even know Dov had a brother.

685
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,630
Yeah. Adam.

686
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,530
He was a few years older.

687
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,630
Was he sick?

688
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,420
Uh...

689
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,740
Dov doesn't like to talk about it, so...

690
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,380
He killed himself.

691
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,540
You know, he... he hung himself.

692
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,880
After that, Dov's parents split for good.

693
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,100
Wow.

694
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,340
I... um...

695
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,250
Well, Chris, you
know, you're, um... you know,

696
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,850
you're back at work now,

697
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,240
and-and you don't need me
to take care of you anymore,

698
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,360
so I should probably
just move out, right?

699
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,070
No.

700
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,030
I like having you around.

701
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,900
Luke?

702
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,310
Hey, I think we did good.

703
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,080
From nothing to a signed
confession in six hours?

704
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,640
We've never done that before.

705
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,050
We did it on that
cardello chain saw thing.

706
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,010
I don't think that counts.

707
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,660
The chain saw was practically smoking.

708
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,820
Remember the, uh, Ivan Wallace fiasco?

709
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,330
Rebuilt the entire crime
scene in our apartment...

710
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,020
Felt like we'd shacked up
with two chalk outlines.

711
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,410
Well, we got the guy in the end.

712
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,070
No, I got the guy in the end.

713
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,160
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

714
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,590
Wait, do you remember it differently?

715
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,750
Yeah.

716
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,820
Is there something gross in there?

717
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,490
Oh. No.

718
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,910
I was just thinking about Andy.

719
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,420
You know, like, what if the
bullet hadn't hit her vest?

720
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,490
I mean, if it had
hit, like, 6 inches higher

721
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,900
but it didn't.

722
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,390
We can't think like that.

723
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,060
Anybody want a drink?

724
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,410
Apparently, I'm buying, so...

725
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,220
You were amazing today.

726
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,530
Thanks.

727
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,750
Doesn't mean I want you as a roommate.

728
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,850
Doesn't mean I care.

729
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,820
I'm not taking time off.

730
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,080
Come on. It's all signed,

731
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,810
sealed confession. That never happens.

732
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,870
Uh-huh. What about the cardello case?

733
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,470
I heard you guys talking.

734
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
That was a long time ago.

735
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,300
I know.

736
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,430
Jo and I were partners for three years.

737
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,580
How long did you live together?

738
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,230
Two and a half.

739
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,690
Any regrets?

740
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,970
Not one.

741
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,180
Good.

742
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,910
That's really funny.

743
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

744
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,740
How's the...

745
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,500
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

746
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,950
- Nice.
- Wow.

747
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,840
Anything broken?

748
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,950
That looks worse than...
You had us worried, McNally.

749
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,880
Nice working with you, detective.

750
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,520
Oh, thanks, you, too.

751
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,490
Looks like, uh, we might get
a chance to do it again.

752
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,450
Oh, yeah?

753
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,610
Always tricky switching teams
midseason, but, uh, duty calls.

754
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,390
You're gonna stay at 15,huh?

755
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,380
Well, you guys had an opening.I
put in for a transfer.

756
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,580
- Oh.
- Yeah.

757
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,740
What about you?

758
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,820
I heard you were headed
over to guns and gangs.

759
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,010
Uh, yeah.

760
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,110
I haven't decided yet.

761
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,620
Cheers.
