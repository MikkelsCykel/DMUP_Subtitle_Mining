<i>Liftoff. We have a liftoff.</i>

2
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,763
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

3
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,470
<i>... one giant leap for mankind.</i>

4
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,939
Good morning, Sunshine.

5
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,373
- Is your sister awake?
- I don't know where she is.

6
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,604
You look like you had a wild night.

7
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,447
- Well, good morning, Your Majesty.
- Good morning.

8
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,985
This time, no circles on my pancakes.

9
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,057
Here we go.
You guys are loopy in the morning.

10
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,386
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

11
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,722
I don't know about
all this free-range stuff.

12
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,263
I had a calf headed for California.

13
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,865
- There's circles on my pancake.
- Eat your breakfast, please.

14
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,937
- I don't like Jupiter.
- I'm sorry, honey.

15
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,370
It started out as Venus, and it grew.

16
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,903
- I'm not gonna eat it.
- I'm not gonna eat it.

17
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,939
Girls.

18
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,707
You see, the planets are just not aligned.

19
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,215
- Is Shepard up yet?
- No, I think he's still sleeping.

20
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,240
- Morning, sleepyhead.
- Dad.

21
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,316
You got an e-mail from
that weirdo at FuelFourU.

22
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,589
All right. I think we may have our fuel.

23
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,067
What do you think about this sweater
for my dad?

24
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,399
- I'd divorce you.
- Is it the color?

25
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,938
Why don't you buy him
a new arc welder?

26
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,534
You want me to wrap that up,
or should I just give it to you?

27
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,113
What makes you think your dad
would wear a pink turtleneck?

28
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,273
The color is salmon.

29
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,381
That's the color
on the inside of a salmon.

30
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,022
I don't even think a fish
would wear that color on the outside.

31
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,487
Arc welder.

32
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,224
Here we are.

33
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,994
So is my favorite customer coming in?

34
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,729
Well, you gonna loan me a cup of coffee?

35
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,041
Depends on how you're gonna
pay me back.

36
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,288
Oh, how's rocket man?

37
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,359
- He's fine, Frank. Fine.
- We're taking bets.

38
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,892
Really? What are the odds?

39
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,090
The bet is your husband
will never do it...

40
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,895
...or he's gonna blow himself up.

41
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,630
Nice.

42
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,305
Yeah, we're all gonna become rich
on Farmer's failure.

43
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,500
What bet do you wanna cover?

44
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,107
Why don't you cover this, Frank?

45
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,876
<i>This space suit will allow me to control...</i>

46
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,852
<i>... the climate and the pressure</i>
<i>that you need to be in space.</i>

47
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,418
It's kind of like having your own
personal weather inside here.

48
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,458
Because in space, it's very, very cold.

49
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,788
Is there any questions?

50
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:37,802
Why don't you just put your hands down,
and we'll just kind of wing it here.

51
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,564
- Start here in the front. You.
- Did you buy it at Target?

52
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,105
No, I didn't buy it at Target.

53
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,072
Where did you get it?

54
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:48,236
Actually, someone was throwing it away,
and I just picked it up.

55
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,076
Have you been to space?

56
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,144
No, not yet.

57
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:59,755
<i>Stanley has been telling everyone</i>
<i>about their daddy the astronaut.</i>

58
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:04,385
We need more parents
willing to play dress-up...

59
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:08,000
...to encourage the kids
to activate their imaginations.

60
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,156
Yes, ma'am.

61
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,271
So many parents just resort
to dressing up as clowns.

62
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,273
You've set a high standard
with this costume.

63
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,940
Well, I appreciate that.

64
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,740
You have a good day.

65
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,768
FuelFourU?

66
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,532
Apollo 13?

67
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,109
You never know
with these online screen names.

68
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,077
I really appreciate you coming out here.

69
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,413
Breakdown for you here.

70
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,088
Ten thousand pounds of fuel.
Is this correct?

71
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,486
Yeah.

72
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,390
- You planning on launching a rocket?
- Yeah.

73
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,794
- You're shitting me, right?
- No.

74
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,696
- Something the matter?
- Well...

75
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:24,973
...ten pounds, 20 pounds, maybe even
a hundred, that's not a problem.

76
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:29,171
Ten thousand pounds,
ten thousand problems.

77
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,518
- When do you need it?
- What's the damage?

78
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,415
Fifty grand.

79
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,587
Cash.

80
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,224
<i>You're delinquent</i>
<i>on six mortgage payments already?</i>

81
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:48,498
I don't know if you understand
how close you are to a foreclosure.

82
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,364
I don't think you understand
how close I am to launching.

83
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,562
Do you know how many times
I've heard that?

84
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,934
Arnie, it's an emergency, okay?

85
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,803
Oh, do I know it's an emergen--

86
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,878
We probably have 15 emergencies
written down right here.

87
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,373
Twenty. Twenty credit extensions.
Who on earth gets 20?

88
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,118
I assumed more than half that debt
from my dad.

89
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,052
And the bank assumes
that you're gonna pay it back.

90
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,557
Can I give you some advice?

91
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,287
I have no money to pay
for that advice, Arnie.

92
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,624
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your business.

93
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,199
- Well, then don't.
- But I have to...

94
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:26,737
...because I'm your friend first
and a banker second, all right?

95
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,474
Now, folks around here,
they think you're crazy.

96
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,337
I happen to think you're a genius.

97
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:36,073
You got bad credit,
but you got great character...

98
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,181
...and that rocket ship of yours
is amazing.

99
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,224
But as a friend, I have to
look you in the eye and say that...

100
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:49,088
...I think it's time you give it a rest.

101
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,861
Bye, Arnold.

102
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,640
I need a payment, Farmer!

103
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,287
Okay.

104
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

105
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,596
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing a balloon.

106
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,998
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing an oxygen tank.

107
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,870
- I believe you're going to the moon.
- I'm going to the moon...

108
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,774
...and I'm bringing Mr. Grump.
- No. But not on the table.

109
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,472
- You can't bring your hamster to the moon.
- Yes, I can.

110
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,777
Yes, she can.
I believe she's going to the moon.

111
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,312
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm gonna bring sugar.

112
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,956
Hey, sweetie, the objective is
to connect a common theme...

113
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,097
...based on what Daddy's bringing.

114
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,199
So I'm sorry, you can't go to the moon.

115
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,062
I never get to go.

116
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,160
Okay, my turn.

117
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:10,138
I'm going to the moon,
and I'm bringing Sunshine.

118
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:15,013
Well, since she holds air, I believe
we're all going to the moon.

119
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,778
- <i>What is that button for, Daddy?</i>
- <i>Oh, that button?</i>

120
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,476
<i>You girls better hang on.</i>
<i>It's gonna be a bumpy ride.</i>

121
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,986
<i>We're taking off! We're taking off!</i>

122
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,054
<i>Oh, here we are. We're in space.</i>

123
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,659
<i>Isn't it beautiful out there?</i>

124
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:30,853
Okay, what's that button for?

125
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,292
- That one?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,160
That's a very special button too.

127
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,524
That's the one that brings Daddy home.

128
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,433
We have to have that one,
because if Daddy didn't have that button...

129
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,133
...I'd be up there for a long, long time.

130
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,542
<i>Stanley, Sunshine, time for bed.</i>

131
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,675
- Give me a hug, my angels.
- Good night.

132
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,184
Good night. Good night, sweetheart.

133
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,288
See you in a little bit.

134
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,352
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

135
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,153
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

136
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,793
I just don't know if these gadgets
are gonna work until I launch, you know.

137
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,992
You don't believe I'm gonna launch it,
do you?

138
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,372
I always believe
you're gonna launch the rocket.

139
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,204
- Someday.
- Well, someday's coming fast.

140
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,197
- Charlie, it's so late.
- I've been working, baby.

141
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,412
Charles, you didn't even take a shower.
You smell like the rocket.

142
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,679
- You could've washed your hands.
- I did. I washed my hands.

143
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,253
Look at this.

144
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,123
Look at that.

145
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,683
Honey, where's your w--?

146
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,322
Where's your wedding ring?

147
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,265
It's in the capsule somewhere.

148
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,163
- Oh, man, in the capsule somewhere.
- Well, honey, l--

149
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,864
Well, it came off.
I'll get it. Don't worry about it.

150
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,207
No, that's not a star.
That's a shooting star.

151
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,910
How come you guys
only eat the marshmallows?

152
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,846
- You don't like the cereal?
- Tastes like wood.

153
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,054
Here, a whole spoonful of marshmallows.

154
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,851
Yeah, but one piece of a cereal.

155
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,017
One piece of a cereal.
Okay, we gotta get that. Oh, there we go.

156
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,958
You know what you guys started me on?

157
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,692
I don't put milk on my cereal anymore,
and it's your fault.

158
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,902
- I don't put milk on my cereal.
- Oh, hey, honey.

159
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,403
Hey. Look who's here.

160
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,869
Hey. Whoa, easy, easy.
Take it easy.

161
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,909
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Go ahead, sweetie.

162
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,843
- Go say hi.
- What are you feeding them?

163
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,315
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Girls. My little tiny people.

164
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,478
Hey, Hal. How you feeling?

165
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,419
I'm actually feeling fine.

166
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:17,358
- Come sit down, Hal. Come on.
- Here, Grandpa will walk you over, okay?

167
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,466
Boy, you've made real progress.

168
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,168
Yep.

169
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,840
It's gonna take a hell of a lot
more than gunpowder...

170
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,943
...to get this particular aircraft in the air.

171
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,578
Yep.

172
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,005
I never knew it was this big.

173
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:46,818
Well, you got yourself
some mighty pricey metal here, bud.

174
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,187
Yeah, well, you gotta
have the good stuff.

175
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,762
I'd have more than a carpet burn on my ass
if I didn't protect it.

176
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,529
Farmer?

177
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,062
Hey, Karl. How you doing, man?

178
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,436
I'm gonna need your autograph
for this letter.

179
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,409
Goddamn, it certainly gets my attention.

180
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,014
- Appreciate it. I'll see you later, buddy.
- See you.

181
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,439
What--?

182
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,038
- Farmer!
- You want my house...

183
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,478
...I'll give it to you brick by brick.
- It was procedure, Farmer.

184
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,446
I didn't have a choice.

185
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,588
The bank wouldn't stand for it
a day longer, and neither would I.

186
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,086
You're way too overextended.

187
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,851
You're just a banker.
A friend wouldn't do what you did.

188
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,359
If I didn't care about you, I wouldn't
have sent it in. You got 30 days.

189
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,930
Open your eyes. Look at this as
a wake-up call, because the dream is over.

190
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,432
It's gotta stop now,
before you lose everything.

191
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:04,962
Farmer.

192
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,038
What's up, Chopper? How's your daddy?

193
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,539
Waiting for you. Want a ride?

194
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,705
No, it's all right. Follow me.

195
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,877
What'd you do, Arnie?

196
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,184
<i>How much does he owe the bank,</i>
<i>Arnold?</i>

197
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,855
- Over 600,000 dollars.
- 600,000 dollars?

198
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,358
He's dangerous. He threw a brick at me.

199
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,020
That's enough, Arnold. That's enough.
Will the bank take an apology?

200
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,628
- Well?
- I guess... .

201
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,896
Farmer, give the bank an apology.

202
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,532
Say you're sorry.

203
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,007
- Arnold, I'm sorry.
- Great.

204
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:55,643
Now, Arnold, I'm going to administer
Farmer's spanking in private.

205
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,813
Chopper, could you
see Arnold out for me?

206
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,825
Assume the position.

207
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,229
You're not really gonna whack me
with that thing, are you?

208
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,870
Come on. I've known you all your life.

209
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:17,099
But I do see you putting your family
and yourself at serious risk.

210
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,042
One day it's a brick,
the next day it's a bullet.

211
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,573
Men have been known
to do desperate things...

212
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,478
...when they're losing their ranches.

213
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm gonna ask you to get...

214
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,085
...a psychiatric evaluation.

215
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:36,694
Before Arnold and me are comfortable
with you in society, you gotta see a shrink.

216
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,932
Go over to the school, see Nurse Goode
over there, and talk to her.

217
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,599
Bring it back to me.

218
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,475
What'd they get you for?

219
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,141
Sleeping in class.

220
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,211
How about you?

221
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,952
I broke a window.

222
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,086
So, what do you wanna be
when you get out of here?

223
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,489
I don't know.

224
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,426
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

225
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,491
Well, let me tell you something...

226
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,001
...you better know what you wanna do
before somebody knows it for you.

227
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,639
Trust me.

228
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,207
Farmer. Nurse Goode can see you now.

229
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,935
Okay.

230
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,673
Well, good luck.

231
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,855
Charlie Farmer.

232
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,355
Hey, Beth. I was supposed to
give you this, the judge said.

233
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,926
Thank you. Okay.

234
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:50,034
Don't you think that they're a little late
in labeling you crazy?

235
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,961
Jumping off a bridge is crazy.

236
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,664
- Oh, and building a rocket isn't.
- I threw a brick through a window.

237
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,103
That's why I'm here.

238
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,337
Well, how would you like it if we discussed
your desire to leave the planet?

239
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,947
- Not particularly.
- Oh, Charlie.

240
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:09,511
I don't expect you to open up
and start talking in our very first session.

241
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,282
Session? There's sessions?

242
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,722
We're all onions, Charlie.

243
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:20,263
We have many, many,
many layers to get through.

244
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,900
See what I'm saying? And, just like...

245
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,237
...well, when you peel an onion,
there may be tears as we come--

246
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,431
Beth, please stop it, okay?

247
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:34,272
Listen, my daddy never told me
that he loved me.

248
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,381
And, you know, I'm pretty sure
that your daddy never did either.

249
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,976
The resentment that you feel
towards your parents...

250
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,145
...is not going to fuel your rocket.

251
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,253
- Are you done?
- Well, you're not getting it.

252
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:54,297
The rocket is not going to bring you
a happy childhood.

253
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:59,927
We all just have to grow up
and just take responsibility.

254
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:04,064
Remember during our high school prom,
I asked you go to the moon with me?

255
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:15,042
Well, shoot, Charlie,
that was just about getting laid.

256
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,553
Well, I'm still going.

257
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,190
We're not done, Charlie.

258
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,125
Is this considered another session?

259
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,356
Have you ever thought
of going into teaching?

260
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,524
What the hell would I teach?
What not to do?

261
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,694
No. Charlie, you could inspire
some young kid to do what you can't.

262
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,033
But I can, and I will, Beth.

263
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,644
I hate to be the one breaking it to you,
but you are not an astronaut.

264
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,678
It didn't happen, and that's okay.

265
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,078
You know,
the military's not for everyone...

266
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,844
...but we all just still love you,
and you didn't fail...

267
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,454
...and don't look at it that way.
- Oh, I don't.

268
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,682
- Oh, my God, do you need help.
- Yes, you're right, I do need help.

269
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,658
I need to find Shepard
because I gotta launch in 30 days.

270
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,297
You have to find a way
to channel your anger...

271
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,730
...or else it will manifest itself
into something...

272
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,563
...like, you know, a rocket ship.

273
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,898
Charlie Farmer.

274
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,237
Ms. Graham, I'm here to inspire a kid.

275
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,344
I could use an engineer
such as yourself at the house.

276
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,573
Why don't you get your things,
and let's go.

277
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,785
Excuse me, but we're in the middle
of a history lesson.

278
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,390
I apologize, Ms. Graham, but you're
teaching him how to read history...

279
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,425
...and I'm gonna show him how to make it.
You have a good day, hon.

280
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,861
- Where are we going?
- Home.

281
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,624
Home? Do we see the--?

282
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,235
Where's the house?
I don't see it anywhere.

283
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,303
Well, it's a long ways to home.

284
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,300
Every one of you is now part
of the Farmer space program.

285
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,878
If anyone feels that he or she is not fit
to be in the Farmer space program...

286
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,344
...then you should say your piece now.

287
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,641
Does that mean we don't
have to go to school?

288
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:54,380
Correct.

289
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,646
But every morning,
we're gonna hold class...

290
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,756
...and study your regular subjects...

291
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,324
...so when you return to school,
you won't be behind.

292
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,519
- Yes, sir.
- Any questions?

293
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,629
- Is that all?
- No, honey, not yet.

294
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,298
How big is it?

295
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,906
- It's big.
- Big?

296
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,305
- So you've seen it?
- Of course I have.

297
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,776
And you think that he'll let me see it?

298
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,215
- Depends.
- Depends? On what?

299
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,048
It's not like I'm gonna go
running all over town, "I've seen it."

300
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,361
I'm telling. You told.

301
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,003
Hey. You and Phyllis been out playing?

302
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,210
What's going on?

303
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,516
Why aren't the children in school?

304
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,017
I'll address your issues after the briefing.
We're not quite finished.

305
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,951
Charles, you need to answer my question.
What's going on?

306
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,215
Oh, hey, Hal. You wanna
be part of the program?

307
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,520
- Sir?
- The space program.

308
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:16,427
- Charles. Bye, Phyllis.
- You guys are released, okay?

309
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,593
I want you here tomorrow morning
at 0500 sharp, okay?

310
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,137
Now, go back to the house. All right.

311
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,541
They're going back to school tomorrow.

312
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,873
It's five weeks maximum,
and they're back at school, I promise you.

313
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,379
You know that they're never gonna
get the kind of education at school...

314
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,744
...that they can get here.

315
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,779
They don't even teach science
in these schools anymore.

316
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,287
You know what Shepard's science teacher
said to him? I mean, get this.

317
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,790
She said, "Science isn't sexy."

318
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,494
I mean, do you want your girls to grow up
only knowing when Mercury's in retrograde?

319
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,958
- You know?
- What the hell happened to you?

320
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:54,094
It's five weeks maximum, and then
they're back in school, I promise. Okay?

321
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:09,976
<i>Unit 4-0 to Central.</i>

322
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,022
<i>Do we know how many entrances</i>
<i>there are to this property?</i>

323
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,319
<i>I believe there are four entrances</i>
<i>to the property. Four entrances.</i>

324
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,020
<i>I don't know if they're gated or not.</i>

325
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,130
<i>Suspect has been trying</i>
<i>to secure rocket fuel, over.</i>

326
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:28,261
<i>Roger, we copy.</i>
<i>Miller is about 100 yards out.</i>

327
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,341
<i>You should be able to see him.</i>
<i>He's coming down the hill, over.</i>

328
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,571
<i>Be aware there are seven suspects. We have</i>
<i>on visual suspect, one Jesus Garcia.</i>

329
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,771
<i>We copy that.</i>

330
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:46,381
<i>Killbourne, Mathis,</i>
<i>currently securing the barn.</i>

331
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,773
Can I help you?

332
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,411
- Charles Farmer?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,072
We're with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

334
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,048
Sir, we have been made aware,
through electronic documents...

335
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,486
...that you have been searching
for a high-grade fuel commonly used...

336
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,426
...to launch rockets.

337
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:26,223
Are you aware that you have an illegal
alien working on your premises?

338
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,561
Pepe Garcia. Jesus Garcia.

339
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,865
<i>If you cooperate, we could see to it...</i>

340
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,938
<i>... that Mr. Garcia</i>
<i>could stay here with your family.</i>

341
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,438
We're going to the moon.

342
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,703
- That's really rotten.
- It's rather generous of us.

343
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,710
And where is that man going?

344
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,417
<i>It's very simple, Mr. Farmer...</i>

345
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:51,078
<i>... it's illegal to try to obtain</i>
<i>such a high-grade fuel for private use.</i>

346
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,783
<i>Anyone trying to acquire this kind of fuel</i>
<i>has to be considered a threat.</i>

347
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,052
This is the real deal.

348
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,756
- Well, I'm no threat.
- Well, how do we know...

349
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,093
...you're not building a warhead?
- Because I'm not at war.

350
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,203
We just wanna let you know
your little rocket ain't gonna fly...

351
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,601
...as long as we're doing
this investigation.

352
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,263
Yeah.

353
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,755
<i>I filled out the FAA application,</i>
<i>sent it in over six months ago.</i>

354
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,828
Sent all my flight plans,
illustrations of the vessel...

355
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,659
...never heard anything back
saying I couldn't launch.

356
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,063
They didn't think you were serious.

357
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:41,296
- Well, how can they stop me now?
- Jeez, Farmer.

358
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:44,670
With this Patriot Act, the way
they've twisted the laws up so much...

359
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,640
...they can do whatever
they please...

360
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,303
...as long as they feel you're a threat
to homeland security.

361
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,245
What do you want me to do?

362
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,648
Well, twist it some more.
Isn't that what lawyers are good at?

363
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,747
All right. Did they say they were
gonna press any charges?

364
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,621
Well, no, not exactly.
They said I'm under investigation.

365
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,287
That means they're gonna
be watching your every move.

366
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,465
Yeah.

367
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,335
I got a buddy in Manhattan.

368
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:18,306
He's a partner in one of these big firms
that specializes in cases like this.

369
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,474
- Give it a try.
- Maybe he can...

370
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,841
...shed some light on the situation.

371
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,483
He owes me a favor.
It won't cost you a nickel.

372
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,218
Set it up. Grab the boom.

373
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,022
Going into space
doesn't take NASA anymore.

374
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,252
Friends, we are here at the entrance
of the space cowboy's ranch.

375
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,865
We are told that behind me,
in this barn, is a rocket...

376
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:45,833
...a rocket that Charles Farmer
wants to launch into outer space.

377
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,404
<i>After graduating</i>
<i>from Meriwether Lewis High School...</i>

378
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,269
<i>... he continued his education</i>
<i>at the University of Texas...</i>

379
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,640
<i>... where he received a degree</i>
<i>in aerospace engineering.</i>

380
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,873
<i>Soon after, Charles Farmer</i>
<i>enlisted in the Air Force...</i>

381
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:02,486
<i>... where he developed his skills as a pilot,</i>
<i>flying such planes as the F-4 Phantom.</i>

382
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:06,924
<i>The rocketeer Charles Farmer</i>
<i>was in fact training to be an astronaut...</i>

383
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,356
<i>... before he was discharged</i>
<i>from the military.</i>

384
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,892
- Hello.
- <i>Hey, what's up?</i>

385
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,758
Holy cow, Munchak.
You didn't tell me your friend was CNN.

386
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,560
<i>This is what he said.</i>
<i>He said embrace the media, Farmer.</i>

387
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,760
Invite them in.
They're for your protection.

388
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,866
<i>You want them on your side, Farmer.</i>

389
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,931
<i>All right.</i>

390
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,704
<i>He built the rocket.</i>
<i>I'm sure he built a retractable roof.</i>

391
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,971
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>I don't think he'd build a rocket...</i>

392
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,580
<i>... and forget about the roof.</i>

393
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,115
- Unless he never plans on launching it.
- Then why are we here?

394
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,450
Because if we aren't here,
and he launches...

395
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,219
...we're gonna look like asses.

396
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,528
And if he does, and we are here?

397
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,256
We still look like asses.

398
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,036
- There he is!
- Mr. Farmer!

399
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,605
Mr. Farmer, quick question.

400
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,279
Listen, if you guys settle down
and ask your questions one at a time...

401
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,748
...I'll answer them
to the best of my ability.

402
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,719
Is it important to you that people know
the importance of space travel?

403
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,189
I'll put it to you this way.
There are a lot of people in this world...

404
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,954
...that think Michael Jackson
had the first moonwalk.

405
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,597
Mr. Farmer, when do you plan
on launching your rocket?

406
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,165
- Soon.
- Mr. Farmer, why are you doing this?

407
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,126
<i>It's always been my dream.</i>

408
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,482
<i>The rocket is huge. It's really big.</i>

409
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,082
<i>He's more of an astro-nut.</i>

410
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,658
- Who was it?
- My wife.

411
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,619
She wants an autograph.

412
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:56,733
<i>You hear about this? There's a guy in Texas</i>
<i>building his own rocket in his back yard.</i>

413
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,496
<i>This guy is planning</i>
<i>on launching himself into orbit.</i>

414
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,208
<i>Here's my question.</i>
<i>Wouldn't it be easier just to say:</i>

415
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,071
<i>"Honey, I want a divorce"?</i>
<i>Okay, wouldn't that be- -?</i>

416
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,772
That's not very funny.

417
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,448
Looks like a really beautiful day today.

418
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,178
<i>Afternoon high of 65,</i>
<i>down to 35 tonight.</i>

419
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,820
- Morning, Hal.
- <i>And if you're launching a rocket...</i>

420
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,652
<i>... the weather looks really good</i>
<i>over most of the country.</i>

421
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,294
<i>This is what's known</i>
<i>as the rocket graveyard.</i>

422
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,295
<i>Farmer gathered most of what he needed</i>
<i>from places like this.</i>

423
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,559
<i>If you're looking to build a rocket,</i>
<i>this is the place to start.</i>

424
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,967
<i>Farmer's rocket is housed</i>
<i>in the barn that you're seeing below.</i>

425
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,579
<i>Due to the overwhelming interest,</i>
<i>he has opened his barn to the public...</i>

426
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,976
<i>... allowing them</i>
<i>to view the rocket themselves...</i>

427
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,549
<i>... only hoping to alleviate</i>
<i>some of this congestion.</i>

428
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,253
<i>Can he do it? Well, sure he can.</i>

429
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,753
<i>Now, will he do it? That's to be seen.</i>

430
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,121
<i>There are lots of FAA regulations...</i>

431
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,660
<i>... that keep people from turning</i>
<i>the sky into a playground.</i>

432
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,923
<i>But the astronaut's plans</i>
<i>for space travel...</i>

433
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,762
<i>... first have to be approved by the FAA.</i>
<i>A hearing has been scheduled.</i>

434
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,905
<i>How long will the government</i>
<i>not allow you to launch your rocket?</i>

435
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,869
- <i>They're not stopping me.</i>
- <i>Is it true...</i>

436
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,272
<i>... Elton John plans to re-release</i>
<i>"Rocket Man" to help raise money?</i>

437
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,938
This is exactly
what we didn't want to happen.

438
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,446
Let's get what we can on this guy.
Find something.

439
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,346
We gotta get this space cowboy's
head out of the clouds.

440
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,714
Pack up, boys. We're going to Texas.

441
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,855
Well, the man deserves a second chance.

442
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,588
All right, more presents.

443
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,254
That's the last of it.

444
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,757
Hey, Stanley.

445
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,897
Why don't you change your hamster cage?
Use paper--

446
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,473
Now, wait a minute. I'd like to see that.
Come on, let me have a look.

447
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,076
Don't believe everything you read,
honey. It just... .

448
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,577
- I wanna read it.
- I wish she had your paper, Pepe.

449
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,374
She can't read Spanish.

450
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,242
Your dad's right.

451
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,116
- Change your hamster cage.
- Okay.

452
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,722
They called us a cult. They said we were
like a branch of the Moonies or something.

453
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,056
They think our family's
a bunch of space cadets.

454
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,493
I know. I know.

455
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:10,293
- How can they do that?
- Because they can.

456
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:15,132
We are a normal family. We need
to go tell everyone that it isn't true.

457
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,332
Well, honey, we just need
to show them, okay?

458
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:36,824
We got a winner here. It's a winner!

459
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,929
Hey, here you go, bud.

460
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,460
That's what I get?

461
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,249
Don't you worry about them.

462
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,549
Just forget about them, Charles.

463
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,740
- Thank you.
- For what, baby?

464
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,373
For this.

465
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,594
Excuse me. I wanna talk to you
about the ride.

466
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,559
Two tickets.

467
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:31,698
No, sir. I mean, if I wanted to buy this ride
from you, how much would it cost me?

468
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,401
Well, you can rent it for 500 a week.

469
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,405
- Can we talk some business?
- Sure.

470
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,574
- Yeah?
- Absolutely. You gonna be around?

471
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,946
Yeah, I'll be here.

472
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,336
Colonel Masterson.

473
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,587
Up there in space, you get
a totally different perspective.

474
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,351
Different every time.

475
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,591
Different perspective of the Earth.
Different perspective of yourself.

476
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,760
Every time's completely different.

477
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,027
It's just... .

478
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,264
It's just beautiful, is what it is.

479
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,708
Beautiful.

480
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:44,046
You see the world, and you realize
how small we all are.

481
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:46,873
Life-changing.

482
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,680
Definitely life-changing.

483
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,213
This is good chicken, Audrey.

484
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,881
- Thank you.
- You're about to make me start crying.

485
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:02,358
My last mission was on the <i>Endeavor.</i>

486
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,001
I don't know who they are.

487
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,969
It's the name of the space shuttle
Colonel Masterson flew on.

488
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,032
We don't have a name for our rocket.

489
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,336
You don't?

490
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,676
You don't have a name
for your rocket, Farmer?

491
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,214
Well, we just hadn't got to that part yet.

492
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,851
We're gonna have to think of some
names, aren't we?

493
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,179
Sunshine?

494
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,915
- <i>Licorice.</i>
- <i>Licorice?</i>

495
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,924
Okay, who's for <i>Licorice?</i>

496
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:35,756
Okay.

497
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:40,563
Now, Stanley submitted the name
of the <i>Rockin' Rocket.</i>

498
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,169
- Who wants <i>Rockin' Rocket?</i>
- I like that.

499
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,544
Uncle Eddie has voted
for everything we've said so far.

500
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,545
- I'm taking this as seriously as you are.
- Okay.

501
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,413
Now, Shepard has decided,
as you told me before...

502
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,417
...you wanna change your name?
- Yeah, I'm changing my name.

503
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,919
I'll think about it more.
I'm not sure what I want.

504
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,921
Okay. Pepe.

505
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,467
What does that mean?

506
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,441
It ain't gonna be the name of the rocket,
so don't worry.

507
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,070
What does it mean, though?
Because if we're all going to vote on it--

508
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,547
It means "the other woman," honey.

509
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,586
No. You are not voting for that name.

510
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,250
I think we should go out
and see the other woman.

511
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,778
Son of a bitch, Farmer.

512
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,457
- You built this thing?
- Bolt by bolt.

513
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,395
That is some serious engineering.

514
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,368
You don't think they'd have
brought you down here...

515
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,528
...if it was a bottle rocket, do you?

516
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,833
Good grief.

517
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:29,344
- You're serious about this.
- Absolutely.

518
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,517
Lookie here, you.

519
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,930
What happens...

520
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:51,567
...if the rocket doesn't launch?

521
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,637
I know it's not the company line here.
I know.

522
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,243
But I'm a dad, baby.

523
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:07,613
Well, that's why he needs our support
regardless of the outcome.

524
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,689
It's not mandatory.

525
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,526
No, it's love.

526
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,876
What do you think?

527
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:49,089
I think that it is gonna be one sad-ass day
up here in Farmerville...

528
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,093
...when they haul all your hard work
off to the junkyard.

529
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:56,131
I think that. What do you think?

530
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:02,702
You think they're gonna let you
go up into outer space?

531
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,431
A civilian?

532
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,070
They don't let civilians
go up into outer space.

533
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,337
Astronauts go into outer space.

534
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,674
Professional astronauts
who have been trained...

535
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,511
...to withstand the pressures
and the strain...

536
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,883
...and the emotional stress
of leaving your family behind.

537
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,492
Ed, you know my dad died.
That's why I left.

538
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,057
- Of course I know your dad--
- My family needed me.

539
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,133
But if that was a test, you failed.

540
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,897
What do you think NASA was thinking?

541
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,802
This boy's gonna go into outer space.
His dad dies, and he wants to go home.

542
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:42,275
I thought there's one person on this earth
that might understand, and that's you.

543
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,374
I really-- I really didn't expect this.

544
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,056
What if I told you I could get you
a seat on the shuttle?

545
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,628
I'd say I don't wanna
hitch a ride on the bus.

546
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,492
Forget that. Forget about
hitching a ride on the bus, okay?

547
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,494
Forget the rocket. You forget the rocket
that you put a lot of hard work into.

548
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,503
You get these people off your back,
get these idiots with cameras out of here...

549
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:13,006
...then you go up into outer space
the right way.

550
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,042
The safe way.

551
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,382
- You don't think I can do it, do you?
- Forget that.

552
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,348
This is about money.
Not even millions of dollars anymore...

553
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,513
...billions of dollars. 16.2 billion dollars
in this year's budget alone.

554
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,453
- For what?
- Who cares for what.

555
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,218
For whatever they want.

556
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,591
They're not gonna let you go up
in your John Deere riding lawnmower...

557
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,130
...into outer space
and try and come back down...

558
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,963
...and make them look stupid.
Do you think that's really gonna happen?

559
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,841
Don't answer me now.
I don't want your answer right now.

560
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,440
But I want you to think about it.

561
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,576
Nice rocket, though.

562
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,654
<i>Will Charles Farmer be allowed</i>
<i>to launch his rocket?</i>

563
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:03,157
<i>That's why we're here today.</i>

564
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:07,661
<i>The FAA, FBI, CIA, the Department</i>
<i>of Energy, and members of the military.</i>

565
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,232
- <i>They're all here.</i>
- What do you think about all this?

566
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,631
Looks like we got home-field advantage,
don't it?

567
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,671
<i>They're not allowing cameras</i>
<i>or the media inside during the hearing.</i>

568
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,665
We are assembled here
to review an application...

569
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,400
...for the launching of a spacecraft.

570
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,307
We'll be asking a series of questions.
Answer to the best of your knowledge.

571
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,674
Yes, sir.

572
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,442
Let's begin with your flight plan
that you've submitted.

573
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,917
Your plan is to do one complete orbit
of the Earth.

574
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:08,787
Once completed, the capsule
will re-enter the atmosphere.

575
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:12,718
Sounds easy. Simple.

576
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,297
- Yes, sir.
- Well, it's not.

577
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,304
I would submit that's the gentleman's
opinion, not a statement of fact.

578
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,372
You are aware this is not a court of law.

579
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,941
I am, but I'm not gonna sit here
like a potted plant.

580
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,870
I hope not.

581
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,514
As head of the FAA, my opinion
might have some credence...

582
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,775
...on the subject of space flight.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,182
You based your design
on the Atlas rocket, yes?

584
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,088
- Yes, sir.
- Were you aware that the Atlas...

585
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,090
...comes from the design
of a ballistic missile?

586
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,989
- Yes, sir.
- So basically...

587
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,427
...you've built a missile in your barn.
- That's incorrect.

588
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,863
Will Beacon, Central Intelligence Agency.

589
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:55,595
How do we know
that you're not constructing a WMD?

590
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,776
Well, because if I was building
a weapon of mass destruction...

591
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,538
...you wouldn't be able to find it.

592
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,108
- Very funny, Mr. Farmer.
- That's just the truth.

593
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,424
Here we are. Thanks for waiting.

594
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,954
Hi, thanks for waiting.
Can I take your order?

595
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,861
- Audie Farmer? The astronaut's wife?
- Yes, ma'am. What can I get for you?

596
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,470
Gretchen Boyd
from Child Protective Services.

597
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,731
Would you please sit down?

598
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,542
- No, thank you.
- Mrs. Farmer...

599
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,869
...it has come to our attention...

600
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,745
...that your children, as well as yourself,
may be in harm's way.

601
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:44,743
How so?

602
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,484
Your husband has literally brainwashed
you and your children.

603
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,491
He's taken them out of school...

604
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:56,895
...and he has isolated his entire family
from any other outside influence.

605
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:06,165
It's time you took control of your family
before someone else does it for you.

606
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:13,706
- <i>Who's your personnel at Mission Control?</i>
- <i>Shepard Farmer, my son.</i>

607
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,012
- Does he have any experience?
- Sure does. Fifteen years.

608
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,018
Is this a joke to you, Mr. Farmer?

609
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,249
A 15-year-old will be the head
of your mission control?

610
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:25,122
He's perfectly capable
of launching his dad into space.

611
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:29,288
- Don't underestimate what my child can do.
- Come on. He's 15 years old.

612
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:34,028
We also have an evaluation that was
done recently by a Dr. Beth Goode.

613
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:35,735
Nurse Goode?

614
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,108
These are alarming comments
made by the doctor.

615
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,801
She said that Mr. Farmer is angry...

616
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,307
...unstable...

617
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,743
...delusional...

618
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:49,443
...and that his overall mental health
is in question.

619
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,057
Charlie, your father took his own life,
is that correct?

620
00:44:57,961 --> 00:45:00,054
Don't go there, colonel.

621
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,604
I can tell you right now,
what you have built here...

622
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,508
...is a one-way ticket to the afterlife.

623
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:20,707
A facility in which Mr. Farmer
could get himself into space.

624
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,318
The U.S. Government
has a space program, Mr. Farmer.

625
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,955
Why don't you just leave this
to the professionals?

626
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:29,752
In 1960 they started a space race.

627
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,261
By 1969 we were on the moon.

628
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,823
Now, in that short period of time,
look what we accomplished.

629
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,697
And in my opinion,
I believe that if some other country...

630
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,896
...wanted to go to the moon
and live there...

631
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:47,373
...we'd get in a war with them
because we think the moon is ours.

632
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,212
Well, it's not.

633
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:56,478
Just like it's not your right to tell me
whether or not I can launch into space.

634
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,216
Mr. Farmer, we have laws.

635
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,652
I know we have laws.
We got all kind of laws.

636
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,952
We got more laws to tell us
what we can't do than anything else.

637
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,063
We got laws to protect us
from other laws.

638
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,632
- Comments like that do not help.
- Listen, you've been talking all morning.

639
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,530
Let me talk for a minute.

640
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,127
Okay?

641
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,537
I won't take long.

642
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:24,178
When I was a kid, they used to tell me
that I could be anything I wanted to be.

643
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,911
No matter what.

644
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:35,382
And maybe I am insane, I don't know,
but I still believe that.

645
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,293
I believe it with all my heart.

646
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,523
Somewhere along the line...

647
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:48,326
...we stopped believing
that we could do anything.

648
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:55,210
And if we don't have our dreams,
we have nothing.

649
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,574
You'll be informed of our decision.

650
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,297
I'm gonna save your life.

651
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,025
I'm gonna tell you something
that no one else in there will tell you.

652
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,805
The U.S. Military has enough firepower
pointed at your ranch...

653
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,238
...that if you decide to launch...

654
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:31,143
...within seconds, your remains
will be spread over five states.

655
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,615
- Is that a threat?
- No.

656
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:40,654
You're the threat.

657
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,732
Don't believe a word he says, Farmer.

658
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,395
Nobody's gonna fire any missiles at you.

659
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,838
They have no law to stop you,
so they're just trying to intimidate you.

660
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,409
I don't know.

661
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,383
Actually, I think they're pretty good
at assassinating people who have dreams.

662
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,593
Where's your helmet?

663
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,532
Now, I think that's it, Mrs. Farmer.

664
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,038
Thank you.

665
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,216
- So is it true?
- What?

666
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:43,142
Got a million dollars for your story?

667
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,981
No, Vanessa, it's not true.

668
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,214
I won't tell anyone. I read about it in--

669
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,222
Vanessa, it's not true.

670
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:53,126
Your total is 86.05.

671
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:56,460
Sorry. Here.

672
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,876
Watch your fingers.

673
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:11,540
I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer,
but your card was declined.

674
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,278
Would you like to try another one?

675
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,646
Can you just keep all this here...

676
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:20,949
...and we'll come back
in a little while, okay?

677
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,024
Come on, girls. Come on.

678
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,547
I'm going to the moon...

679
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,589
...and I'm bringing this brick.

680
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,204
Kids, your mom and I
need a private moment.

681
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,499
No. This has been private long enough.

682
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,303
Now, you can lie to me as much as you
want, Charles, but don't lie to them.

683
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,313
Tell them.

684
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,615
Tell them we might not have a house
in a few weeks.

685
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,651
- Knock it off, Audie, okay, please?
- No, you knock it off.

686
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,947
- Please, knock it off.
- And what was your plan?

687
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,385
Blasting off this Earth...

688
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,890
...and leaving us here to deal with
the consequences? With no money...

689
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,996
...nothing, no money for food?
- Oh, really? Is that right?

690
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,699
I'm sorry.

691
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,069
So we don't have any food?
Is that what you think?

692
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,368
Kids, you don't have anything
to worry about...

693
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,773
...because we got plenty of food, okay?

694
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:49,934
Here's food.

695
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,577
You want macaroni and cheese?
You want salmon in white sauce?

696
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,513
- You want rice pilaf?
- Stop it!

697
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:59,849
- We got all kinds of food!
- Shepard, take the children out of here.

698
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:07,024
What, do you wanna throw that?
You gonna throw something at me, Audie?

699
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:11,861
- Is that what you wanna do? Go ahead!
- You wanna see flying saucers?

700
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,664
Don't you ever accuse me of that again
in front of the kids. You understand me?

701
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,501
You're not taking care of us
when we don't have a home!

702
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,041
You have to keep us safe!

703
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:25,170
And this dream that we all share
feeds one person, and that's you!

704
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,744
You're gonna lose everything, Charles,
including your family.

705
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,730
Now, I need to clean up this kitchen.

706
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,566
I'm sorry I did this.

707
00:51:55,566 --> 00:52:05,566
