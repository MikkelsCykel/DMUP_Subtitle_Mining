1
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:26,203
Would you like something sweet?

2
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,882
What do we got here, an antique show?

3
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,764
All right, boys, fan out!

4
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:48,883
What a wrinkle-fest this is.

5
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,842
Beat it, you broads! Come on!

6
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,397
All right, sit down and shut up!

7
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,957
We're the Red Eyes. Everybody, freeze!

8
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:05,517
Get their valuables, boys.
I want watches, wallets, jewelry.

9
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:08,758
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs and toupees.

10
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,802
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

11
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,115
-Rolex!
-No, it's mine!

12
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,004
Leave me alone! I'm a veteran!

13
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,726
No! Not that!

14
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:23,804
I love crashing parties!

15
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,400
Cake!

16
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,119
Pardon me, fatty.

17
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,317
If you're going to eat cake,
you ought to use a fork.

18
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,436
You might just as well shovel it in.

19
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:48,725
People who don't close their mouths
when they chew...

20
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:50,559
...make me furious.

21
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,156
One for you.

22
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:03,716
And for you!

23
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,760
Want a little whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

24
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,526
Get him!

25
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:18,719
Is that all you got?

26
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:28,524
-Throw it!
-Not today, my vermilion-eyed varlet.

27
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:32,323
Blast.

28
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,086
Out of the way!

29
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,518
Yes, this one should stick.

30
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,162
Oh, my!

31
00:03:52,007 --> 00:03:53,998
That's right up the Khyber!

32
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:13,926
It's Captain Amazing!

33
00:04:15,887 --> 00:04:17,798
It's Amazing! I'm out of here!

34
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:41,724
C.A., you were, if I may say, amazing.

35
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,835
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Let's go meet the press.

36
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:47,846
He is good.

37
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:49,886
He is rather ripping.

38
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,527
The spinning and the hurtling
and the kicking.

39
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,326
I guarantee he hogs the credit on this one.

40
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,366
I think we have to...

41
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,120
...at least concede him
the assist here, Roy.

42
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,880
No. That's exactly what's holding us back.

43
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,720
Don't put him on the pedestal.
Put us on the pedestal.

44
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,240
Here he comes.

45
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:11,515
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

46
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:14,201
No autographs till we finish with the press.

47
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,801
We're not.... Allow me to introduce myself.

48
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:20,516
Blue Raja, master of silverware,
forks a "speciality," at your service.

49
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,405
-My colleague, the Shoveler.
-Big fan of your work.

50
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:27,002
Standing rather painfully aside
is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

51
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:29,396
-How's it hanging?
-So you guys....

52
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,165
They're superheroes.

53
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,567
-We fight crime. Call it what you will.
-Quite right.

54
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,842
That's great. Just, you know...

55
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,164
...keep up the good work.

56
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,917
You as well, sir. You as well.

57
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,765
Did you see? Did you....

58
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:51,407
Did you hear that?
"Keep up the good work."

59
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,523
-The good work.
-He's making fun of us.

60
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,121
No, Roy. He saluted us. That was real.

61
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,084
-I thought he was sincere.
-What's up?

62
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,044
Hello. Nice to see you.

63
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,882
I saw the action out there tonight.

64
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,404
What you guys need is
a little bit of firepower.

65
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,484
I'm a weapons designer.

66
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:14,406
-I've got what you need.
-All right. We'll come back.

67
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:17,843
We'll visit all of you people later.
Thank you, sir.

68
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,959
I don't live here. I'm here for the ladies.

69
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:24,759
Here, take my card.

70
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,598
My name's Heller. Say it with me.

71
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:30,396
Heller.

72
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,876
All right. Thank you.

73
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,399
Why do you encourage those people?

74
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:40,445
-Those people look up to us.
-That's true.

75
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:45,323
-You know the drill.
-Please sign my hat, Captain Amazing.

76
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,804
Herman, give me a flash.

77
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,085
How are you tonight?

78
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:52,960
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

79
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,641
Becky, it's what I do.

80
00:06:55,727 --> 00:07:00,005
Thanks to you, the city's almost crime free.
What do you do with your free time?

81
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,959
I wish I had some free time.

82
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,483
People are saying you're so "amazing"
you'll put yourself out of a job.

83
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:09,196
-Have any comments on that?
-That's one problem I look forward to.

84
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,404
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

85
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,120
I hadn't heard that.

86
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,563
Thanks for your questions.

87
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,844
You have no comment
regarding your Pepsi situation?

88
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,085
Look who we got.

89
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,045
You again. Wanna-bes.

90
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,523
This city already has a superhero.

91
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,883
-Perhaps you've heard of Captain Amazing.
-Thank you.

92
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,683
Do yourself a favor, McGuire.

93
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,718
Don't flip my switch tonight.

94
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:48,362
He's a big baby.

95
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,961
And what exactly would that do?

96
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:54,081
Don't turn around, Roy. Don't do it.

97
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,683
-It's not worth it.
-Keep walking.

98
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,359
It's not worth it.

99
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,360
You know exactly what that would do...

100
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:06,201
...checkerhead.

101
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,276
What?

102
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,317
Don't mess with the volcano, my man.

103
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,921
'Cause I will go Pompeii on your butt.

104
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,563
My golly. Good grief.

105
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,477
You keep dreaming, Wanna-be.

106
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:32,201
Let's go.

107
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:34,080
Dream on, moron.

108
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:37,160
I will keep dreaming, my friend.

109
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,156
And when I wake up, you better hope...

110
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,437
...you better hope you're asleep.

111
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,365
-Don't re-engage him. He's a silly--
-Sweet dreams!

112
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,244
-He's immature.
-Lilac.

113
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,165
C.A., I'm doing my best.

114
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:56,124
Your best? Quick question:

115
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,200
Is this your best?

116
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:02,324
-I realize you're upset.
-Victor, I'm positioned.

117
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:06,366
Do you understand what that means,
on a very personal level here...

118
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,207
...to know the companies
that make these products...

119
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,437
...want me to be their spokesperson?

120
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:12,636
Their voice?

121
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:15,116
I think we should focus on the positive.

122
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,637
-Tonight was good.
-Yeah? You think so?

123
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:23,044
'Cause I was worried it was...pathetic!

124
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:26,962
"Amazing Triumphs At A Nursing Home!"
That's great copy, Vic.

125
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,958
I'm a publicist, not a magician.

126
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:31,356
You want big news?
You must have big fights.

127
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:35,156
A superhero needs a supervillain.
Thanks to you, we've got none left.

128
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:38,284
Then get the Death Man.

129
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,920
Death Man is dead.

130
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,482
-Father Doom.
-Life without parole.

131
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:45,765
Apocalypto's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

132
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,236
-Baron Von Chaos got the chair.
-Really?

133
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:52,400
-Casanova is locked up in a nuthouse.
-Casanova Frankenstein.

134
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,436
Now, there was a supervillain.

135
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,205
You know, he just....

136
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:00,563
He's got those eyes, you know?

137
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,639
I can't do it, but....

138
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,045
That voice. Such pure evil.

139
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:07,595
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

140
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,916
"Used to."

141
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:12,359
That's the problem, Captain. "Used to."

142
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,166
Let the records show...

143
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,159
...that this parole hearing
has officially begun.

144
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:09,246
We now commence the 17th parole hearing
of Casanova Frankenstein.

145
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,804
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

146
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:15,482
Thank you.

147
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:19,765
Gentlemen of the board,
the man who sits before you...

148
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:23,886
...the once infamous evil genius,
is entirely cured.

149
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,640
-What?
-I give you my word...

150
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,515
...that he's of no more danger to the city
than I am.

151
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,723
-This is outrageous.
-Yes.

152
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,563
Mr. Casanova Frankenstein...

153
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,480
...do you have anything to say
on your own behalf?

154
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:44,122
Blessed disciples of Hippocrates...

155
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,799
...my heart is split in two.

156
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,286
It brims...

157
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:57,802
...with such sorrow
for my abominable crimes.

158
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,001
And yet...

159
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:02,004
...it swells with love...

160
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,721
...for you...

161
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,601
...for this sanctuary...

162
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:11,078
...this place of healing.

163
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:14,564
Within my soul, I feel the choir singing...

164
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:18,235
...Beethoven's immortal Ode to Joy...

165
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,838
...where all men...

166
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,479
...become brothers.

167
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,363
Am I too late to cast my vote?

168
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:35,565
Not at all, Lance.
I was just about to remind the board...

169
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:39,875
...that Casanova once had our city
in a stranglehold of terror.

170
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:44,080
Parole is not an option for this man,
this monster.

171
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,997
We cannot risk the danger
of releasing him.

172
00:12:47,087 --> 00:12:49,965
-I could not agree with you more.
-Excellent.

173
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:55,443
However, I did just have dinner
with an old friend recently.

174
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,086
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

175
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:03,604
-Captain Amazing?
-He asked if I would read this.

176
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,245
"Dear members of the board:

177
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:12,605
"We all know that society cannot exist
without absolute justice...

178
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:18,237
"...but society is also built
upon compassion.

179
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,841
"Let us set the tone
for the new millennium...

180
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,316
"...by making a historic gesture
of forgiveness.

181
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,921
"Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you...

182
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:30,517
"...let us grant Casanova Frankenstein...

183
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,406
"...a second chance."

184
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:40,442
With Captain Amazing's recommendation
and protection...

185
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,915
...l suppose we could consider....

186
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,599
I pronounce you...

187
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:53,036
...cured.

188
00:13:57,847 --> 00:14:00,520
Hello, Champion City.

189
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:06,364
Daddy is home.

190
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:23,842
Hi, everybody.

191
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:26,646
Tooth decay and gingivitis can be a crime.

192
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,241
That's why I use
Mighty Whitey toothpaste.

193
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,125
Because I want my teeth to look amazing.

194
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,243
I'll bring this up again.
It's $150 apiece. We each chip in.

195
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,443
My cousin knows a guy
who knows a publicist.

196
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:44,315
What will we publicize?
The fact that we get our butts kicked a lot.

197
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,399
If you didn't smack me with a shovel
every time we went out...

198
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,239
...we'd have more wins to brag about.

199
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry. I just tend
to lose my concentration...

200
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,601
...when I've got a salad fork stuck
in my rear end.

201
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:57,201
I get it. Your shovel in his face is my fault.

202
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,482
You threw a spoon at the guy, Jeff.

203
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:03,037
-What was up with that?
-I thought it was a fork.

204
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,680
You're the master of cutlery.

205
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,884
You can't throw a knife
when someone's trying to kill me?

206
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:10,435
-You can't use a rake?
-No, I'm the Shoveler.

207
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:13,121
I'm the Blue Raja. I'm not Stab Man.

208
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,886
I'm not Knifey Boy. I'm the Blue Raja.

209
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:17,679
-That's another thing.
-What?

210
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,839
You could get a bit of blue
in the uniform somewhere.

211
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,765
You've got green.
There's a little flowery thing.

212
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,525
It doesn't make a lot of sense.

213
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:29,644
If we could stop being so literal
for just one moment.

214
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,803
Look what I'm doing. Look at that.

215
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,276
I'm putting $150 on the table.
Who's in with me?

216
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,720
I don't have $150.

217
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,685
If I did, I wouldn't have plundered
my mother's silverware.

218
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:39,995
It's a waste of money.

219
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:42,760
You know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

220
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,963
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

221
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:47,686
If we had a billionaire benefactor
like Lance Hunt...

222
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:51,282
-...we could spend $150.
-Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

223
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,797
Don't start that again.

224
00:15:54,647 --> 00:15:58,401
Lance Hunt wears glasses.
Captain Amazing doesn't wear glasses.

225
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,558
He takes them off when he transforms.

226
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:03,878
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

227
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:10,242
-Thanks for waiting.
-Thanks for dropping by.

228
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,399
Do you know what you want?

229
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:16,600
Allow me to begin, my dear. The Blue Raja
is quite partial to the salad niçoise.

230
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,161
My dressing of choice is Rancho Light...

231
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:22,045
...and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold the Baco-Bits.

232
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:25,756
Since it's your first night,
I suppose I'll "fork-give" you...

233
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,803
...if you "fork-get."

234
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:29,876
Who's next?

235
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:32,720
Can I get a meatball sandwich
on white with mayo?

236
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,685
I'll have a steak, very rare.
That means pink, not bloody.

237
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:37,200
And could I get some ice?

238
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,199
I had a little mishap defending justice
at the nursing home.

239
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:43,359
I thought I heard on TV that
that was Captain Amazing.

240
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:49,839
Let's all be good little automaton droids
and believe everything we hear on TV.

241
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:54,036
I'll just go place your order now.

242
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:59,644
A trifle strident with that crumpet,
weren't we, Furious?

243
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,036
I am a ticking time bomb of fury.

244
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,605
When we split the check three ways...

245
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:08,440
...the steak-eater picks the pocket
of the salad man.

246
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,246
-Just give me the money, Jeff.
-Yes, fine.

247
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:14,683
-Every time we split it three ways.
-It's flipping robbery.

248
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,803
Well, you should order more.

249
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,680
Do you see what I see?

250
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,122
It's Tony C.

251
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:28,483
And Tony P, leader of the Disco Boys.

252
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,325
But why would he be back in town?

253
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:45,646
Maybe it's time to do a little following
to find out.

254
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,524
No, it's already 10:30.

255
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,598
I'll get killed by my wife as it is.

256
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:53,282
Yes, and I've had quite enough excitement
for one night, thank you.

257
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,036
My mistake. I thought I was hanging out
with serious superheroes:

258
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:58,924
The Shoveler and the Blue Raja.

259
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:02,522
But, apparently,
I'm hanging out with Lazy Boy and....

260
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:04,765
-Good night, Roy.
-Yes, toodle-loo.

261
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:07,281
Hang on a second. Lazy Boy and the....

262
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,439
And the Recliner!

263
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,757
Yeah, Lazy Boy and the Recliner!

264
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:15,882
Guys, are you coming?

265
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,236
Okay, fine. I guess tonight...

266
00:18:23,447 --> 00:18:24,960
...the lone wolf...

267
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,398
...hunts alone.

268
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,759
Testicles rising.

269
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,996
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

270
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:25,558
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

271
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:30,165
Well, it's my vest too. I bought it for him.
The only thing I need--

272
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,162
Okay.

273
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,716
How long you gonna do this, Eddie?

274
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,446
-It's been 12 years.
-I know.

275
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,276
You got a family to look after, Eddie.

276
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,801
The kids are worried sick about you.

277
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:48,120
But still you go out, night after night,
running around the city. For what?

278
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:51,244
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

279
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,562
I shovel very well.

280
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:56,636
Baby.

281
00:19:57,727 --> 00:20:00,480
You shovel better
than any man I've ever known.

282
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:03,560
But that does not make you a superhero.

283
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:05,160
-All l--
-Oh, no.

284
00:20:06,447 --> 00:20:08,278
You're a good husband.

285
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:09,959
And a good father.

286
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:13,880
But that's all. Nothing more.

287
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:19,440
You're right.

288
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,799
I believe in you, Daddy.

289
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:26,321
Roland, do not encourage your father.

290
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:34,204
Well, if it isn't our old friends,
the Red Eyes.

291
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:38,886
Good evening. We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon....

292
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,324
Red Eyes, Red Eyes. What a treat.

293
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:49,003
We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon.

294
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:51,482
Jeffrey.

295
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:55,556
Mom, how many times have I asked you
not to barge in here?

296
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,843
-What's burning?
-Incense.

297
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,680
I can't even count
how many rules you're breaking.

298
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,804
One: Always knock.
Two: Don't sniff around outside my door.

299
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,798
Three: Do not interrogate me.

300
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,479
-Jeffrey.
-What?

301
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,078
Are you into marijuana?

302
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,239
You're cheesing me off so bad.

303
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:14,124
Just, please.... Good night.

304
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,516
I'm sorry. Jeffrey, please....

305
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:18,279
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

306
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,206
She's just so--

307
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,117
All right, let's see what's shaking...

308
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:02,801
...at the Chez Casa Casanova.

309
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,717
The old disco room.

310
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,442
Just as I left it.

311
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:06,198
You've been locked up for 20 years.
A lot of things have changed since then.

312
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:11,239
It must have been hard for you,
the way times and styles have changed...

313
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,925
...to hear the people saying
that disco is dead.

314
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:19,079
Disco is not dead! Disco is life!

315
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:22,239
Yes, Tony, that is the passion I remember.

316
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:29,882
Stick with me, Tony,
and you will dance again...

317
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:33,444
...when I rule this town.

318
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:41,003
Have you met my psychiatrist?

319
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:46,036
Come out, come out wherever you....

320
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:47,600
There we go.

321
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,204
We got a little terrace party.

322
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:53,359
I want you to spread the word
to all of my gangs.

323
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:57,045
Tell them that Casanova Frankenstein
is back...

324
00:23:57,447 --> 00:24:00,041
...and that Casanova
is planning something...

325
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,319
...a little bit different.

326
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,916
Kaboom.

327
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:14,641
Mama pajama!

328
00:24:18,087 --> 00:24:20,806
What kind of crazy man blows up
a crazy house?

329
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:24,038
And now, if you will excuse me,
I am expecting a visit...

330
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:25,958
...from a very old friend.

331
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:39,564
Look what we got.
A little booty call from Captain Amazing.

332
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:46,399
This is a fine, elegant Harvey Wallbanger.

333
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,007
Even when it's sucked by a scum like you?

334
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:55,001
Captain Amazing. What a surprise.

335
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:58,640
Really? I'm not so sure about that.

336
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:03,004
Your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

337
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:06,165
Interesting choice.
I knew you couldn't change.

338
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:08,317
-I knew you'd know that.
-I know that.

339
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,046
And I knew you'd know I'd know you knew.

340
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:14,996
But I didn't.
I only knew that you'd know that I knew.

341
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:17,960
Did you know that?

342
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:21,562
Of course.

343
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,366
-Please, won't you join me?
-With pleasure.

344
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:26,562
Quick thought.

345
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:29,320
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser...

346
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:32,001
...in the ring on the index finger
of your left hand?

347
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:33,322
Of course.

348
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:36,365
If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
go ahead and disengage...

349
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:40,042
...the psychotropic bacterium
dart launchers in your slippers.

350
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,276
Done.

351
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:46,283
The cold fusion ultrasonic neuro-stunner
in your drink stirrer. Turn it off.

352
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,915
We know each other so well,
don't we, Lance?

353
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,124
We've always been each other's
greatest "nemesises."

354
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:55,841
Nemesis....

355
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,998
What's the plural on that?

356
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,161
Nemeses.

357
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:02,115
Whatever.

358
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,801
You're going to prison
for life this time, Casanova.

359
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:06,400
Here in Champion City...

360
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:08,876
...we still do a fairly brisk trade...

361
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:11,235
...in justice.

362
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:15,206
I thought it was all about the publicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

363
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,596
It's that kind of cynicism that I truly feel...

364
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,882
...is starting to poison society.

365
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:21,956
Looky here.

366
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,956
A multi-frequency radio detonator.

367
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,279
You should be careful
when discarding incriminating evidence.

368
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:31,165
Oh, no. This is an amusing little gizmo.

369
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:33,199
It's really quite cool.

370
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:36,045
Yeah? What is it?

371
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:44,761
It's a chloroform-deploying
portable enticement snare.

372
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,196
Dang!

373
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:55,326
Lancie...

374
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:58,197
...you really are so predictable.

375
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,804
-'Morning, Sally.
-You're late!

376
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:17,721
Yes, I know. I was up all night,
defending the city from evil...

377
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:19,559
...but you don't care about that.

378
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:22,798
Work starts at 9:00! It's 9:25!

379
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:25,321
I guess all the junk's
probably ruined by now.

380
00:27:25,407 --> 00:27:28,717
When are you gonna tear down
that jeep like I told you to?

381
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:33,483
We went through this yesterday.
That jeep is an armored car of some type.

382
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:36,479
It can withstand bombs.
I can't rip it apart with a crowbar.

383
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:37,761
Just junk it.

384
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,598
-If you gave me the proper tools, I could--
-Junk it!

385
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:45,367
I'm willing to have this discussion
with you...

386
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:49,281
...but I think we should deal with it
like two people who respect--

387
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,285
I want it junked.

388
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:53,402
Okay.

389
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,481
Right now, I'm kind of like a powder keg...

390
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,285
...and you're the match.

391
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:01,122
If you tell me to junk it one more time--

392
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:02,606
Junk it now!

393
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,279
You got that?

394
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,641
That little sucker just saved your life.

395
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:26,566
Just junk it, you miserable cuss.

396
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,956
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

397
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:54,041
Champion City's best-known billionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.

398
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:57,119
Police hope Captain Amazing
will help in the search for Hunt...

399
00:28:57,207 --> 00:29:01,280
...but have, so far, failed to contact
the city's beloved superhero.

400
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:07,204
He makes a wonderful trophy,
don't you think?

401
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,756
I think we need to talk
about your plans here.

402
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:13,803
You know my plans, Lancie.

403
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:16,279
Tomorrow night...

404
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,125
...I'm going to kill you.

405
00:29:18,287 --> 00:29:20,847
That's the part
that really doesn't work for me.

406
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,202
When the clock strikes 12:00...

407
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,603
...cuckoo, cuckoo...

408
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,241
...you will be dead...

409
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:30,524
...and my city will be given
a new state of mind.

410
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,036
You must go with
what you're comfortable with...

411
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:35,766
...but, I just keep coming back
to this place.

412
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:39,163
I'm spitballing here,
but maybe we release...

413
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,715
...the Captain to the authorities.

414
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:46,403
I say you're completely reformed. Wink.
There's rejoicing in the streets.

415
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:50,878
Then, at that point, you do
the whole destruction-of-the-city thing.

416
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,117
I mean, is it a perfect plan?

417
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:54,956
No.

418
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,806
And I think that's what I like about it.

419
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:03,447
Okay, that's great. Turn off the lights now.

420
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:06,519
It was just an idea!
Wait, I got a better one.

421
00:30:06,647 --> 00:30:09,923
You let me live, I am your sidekick.

422
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:12,242
I'm like Amazing Boy or....

423
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:13,999
Casanova?

424
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:18,841
-Are you sure Captain Amazing is in there?
-Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.

425
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,445
Wait! Hear that?

426
00:30:57,207 --> 00:30:59,323
We must have hit a trip wire.

427
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,841
It could be a photon eviscerator
heating up.

428
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:05,158
It could be a cybernetic atom scrambler.
They target moving objects.

429
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:07,920
Sounds more like a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun.

430
00:31:08,007 --> 00:31:09,884
-Quickly, cover your mouth.
-Let's bolt!

431
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,036
-Don't move!
-Don't breathe!

432
00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:12,401
-Let's bolt!
-Don't move!

433
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:14,000
-Don't breathe!
-Let's bolt!

434
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,725
It's the sprinkler.

435
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:24,358
Isn't that just fabu? I'm positively soaked.

436
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:31,245
What do we got here?

437
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:34,319
I think they're supposed
to be jive superheroes.

438
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:37,604
They made a big mistake coming
to Casanova's place.

439
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:45,836
-What's so funny?
-That's your power? You have guns?

440
00:31:46,127 --> 00:31:48,482
Couldn't you be a little more creative
than that?

441
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,523
Do forgive the impertinence...

442
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,201
...but what does a pistol
have to do with disco?

443
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,845
-Weak.
-At best.

444
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:59,722
Check out the guy with the pipe.
Are you the disco plumber?

445
00:32:00,447 --> 00:32:02,244
There's no theme at all here, mates.

446
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:05,319
If you're gonna carry a chain,
make it a gold chain.

447
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:08,200
See what I'm saying?
That's just off the top of my head.

448
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:09,800
What's up, Tiger Lily?

449
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,843
The top of your head?

450
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:21,165
We'll never get in there.
There are too many Disco Boys.

451
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:23,966
Amazing's in there. I saw him go in.

452
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:26,038
There's never any evil trios, are there?

453
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:29,676
No, they've all got to travel in gangs
like little babies.

454
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,684
-Maybe it's time to level the playing field.
-How?

455
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,405
I'm talking about recruiting.

456
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:40,081
There are many guys who'd kill
to get in on our action.

457
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,284
-Plenty of poseurs, you mean.
-Yeah, maybe a few.

458
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:47,998
But there's got to be a couple of guys
out there, like Human Torch, before he hit.

459
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:51,961
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes.

460
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,805
Or something like that.

461
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,320
-Well, there's the Sphinx, of course.
-The what?

462
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,642
-The Sphinx.
-I know this guy.

463
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:03,998
Big crimefighter from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

464
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:07,079
-What's his power?
-He's terribly mysterious.

465
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:10,763
That's it? That's his power?
He's mysterious?

466
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:14,044
-Terribly mysterious.
-Plus, he can, like...

467
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,122
...cut guns in half with his mind.

468
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:20,126
Really? I hadn't heard that.

469
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,120
We'll track this Sphinx down.

470
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:25,517
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

471
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

472
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:31,797
Nothing I couldn't move around.

473
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:47,040
Listen, why don't you guys go on ahead?
I got to take care of something.

474
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,125
Oh, I see.

475
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,960
Good cause there,
saving homeless animals.

476
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:05,956
Hog queen?

477
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,717
-What?
-You're into motorcycles.

478
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:11,920
Not really.

479
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:15,718
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

480
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,125
Yeah, what kind?

481
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:20,158
-It's a Harley.
-A Harley?

482
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:25,160
Compatible. It's a Harley compatible.
Basically, the same engineering.

483
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:30,476
I hope we're cool about last night.

484
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:32,397
Last night?

485
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,684
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

486
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:40,322
Sometimes that comes off
as a little threatening or whatever.

487
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,238
I don't find you threatening...

488
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,966
You're very kind.

489
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,236
...at all.

490
00:34:48,447 --> 00:34:53,077
I still feel like I should make it up
to you somehow, just in some way.

491
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:57,440
I should take you out to dinner or
something to make up for being so scary....

492
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:59,040
I'm really busy.

493
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:04,962
Right.

494
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:08,277
Our little chess game continues.

495
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:11,996
Yeah?

496
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:15,523
We're looking for the one
they call "Invisible Boy."

497
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:21,044
All my life, I've been ignored by people.
Finally, after years of being overlooked...

498
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:24,244
...l found I have the power to disappear.

499
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:28,396
-It's real ironic how it happened 'cause--
-Can we come in?

500
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,043
-Yeah, sure. Come on.
-Thank you.

501
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:34,239
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

502
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:39,996
-And that's pretty much it.
-So, let me get this straight.

503
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:43,923
-You are capable of becoming invisible?
-Yes.

504
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:47,161
-But you can't give us a demonstration?
-No.

505
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:50,765
I can only become invisible
when no one's watching.

506
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:54,126
So, you're only invisible to yourself?

507
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:57,922
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

508
00:35:59,967 --> 00:36:04,597
So, you can only become invisible
when absolutely nobody is watching you?

509
00:36:06,527 --> 00:36:09,485
-Yes.
-Do forgive our incredulity...

510
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:14,358
...but I wonder how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency?

511
00:36:16,087 --> 00:36:18,043
When you go invisible...

512
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:20,925
...you can feel it.

513
00:36:22,327 --> 00:36:24,887
-I'm leaving.
-Thanks. It was nice to have met you.

514
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,879
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Where are you guys going?

515
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,286
Can I come?

516
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:32,720
Look, no offense, kid, but...

517
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:37,278
...we're going up against a really powerful
supervillain, Casanova Frankenstein.

518
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:40,121
That means we got to find a lot
of superheroes quickly.

519
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,482
We have no idea where to even start--

520
00:36:42,647 --> 00:36:44,683
I know tons of superheroes.

521
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:47,123
-I'm sure you know a lot--
-No, seriously.

522
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:50,483
I'm always at costume shops,
martial-arts stores...

523
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:52,717
...talking to guys, making connections.

524
00:36:52,807 --> 00:36:55,560
If you want to break in,
you got to network...

525
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,603
...and I know how to network.

526
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:00,436
-Sorry, kid.
-Come on.

527
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,596
Haven't you guys ever been a kid?

528
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:06,396
Haven't you guys ever had a dream?

529
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:18,047
Let me see, who else have I met?
There's the Pincher.

530
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,719
The Pickler.

531
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:20,876
Princess Headbutt.

532
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,561
White Flight and the Black Menace.
They work together.

533
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:25,126
Slow down, slow down.

534
00:37:25,207 --> 00:37:27,516
Then there's Professor Pink Belly...

535
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:30,121
...and Lucky Pierre and The French Tickler.

536
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:31,879
"French Tickler."

537
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:35,404
-You've got all their telephone numbers?
-Yeah, most of them.

538
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,718
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

539
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:41,761
-Some kind of a tryout.
-Yes, a tryout.

540
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:45,366
Throw in a barbecue and a few kegs,
they'll all show up.

541
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:47,483
The mooch factor is high with this crowd.

542
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,762
A barbecue. That's a good idea.

543
00:37:50,207 --> 00:37:53,597
What? Bugger all, it's the Spleen.
Play dead.

544
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:55,917
-Who's that?
-Turn your head. Don't say anything.

545
00:38:10,847 --> 00:38:11,916
Hi, fellas.

546
00:38:12,047 --> 00:38:15,278
Word on the street is
you're looking for superheroes.

547
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:17,557
-Not really.
-Actually, we're just leaving.

548
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,205
Rotten luck.

549
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:21,636
Here we go.

550
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:24,241
-Perfect timing.
-That's for you.

551
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:27,322
-Hamburger, right?
-Yes, thank you.

552
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:28,562
Enjoy.

553
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:32,325
Why are you guys always dissing me?
It hurts my feelings.

554
00:38:32,407 --> 00:38:34,762
I'm a superhero, too. I have powers.

555
00:38:34,847 --> 00:38:36,803
Really? Like what?

556
00:38:37,087 --> 00:38:38,486
So glad you asked.

557
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,166
-Oh, no.
-Excuse me.

558
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:41,680
Excuse me.

559
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,639
It all started
when I was just 13 years of age.

560
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:50,084
One day, while walking with friends...

561
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,556
...l accidentally cut the cheese.

562
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:55,083
In my adolescent awkwardness...

563
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:58,637
...l blamed it on an old gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

564
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,399
Big mistake!

565
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:03,966
The gypsy woman placed a curse
upon my head.

566
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:05,839
Because I'd smelt it...

567
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:10,284
...she decreed I would forevermore
be he who dealt it!

568
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:12,997
-Let me illustrate.
-No, you don't have to.

569
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:15,123
It's not necessary, really.

570
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,961
Let's see.

571
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:20,121
Distance:

572
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:22,440
Seven meters.

573
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,719
Air speed: normal.

574
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,722
Compensate for air conditioning.

575
00:39:29,407 --> 00:39:31,602
-Pull my fingers.
-Don't do it.

576
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:33,639
Oh, dear God.

577
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,881
S! B! D!

578
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:46,845
Silent, but deadly.

579
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,476
-That's good shooting.
-That was amazing!

580
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:52,035
It's disgusting. Don't encourage him.

581
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:56,085
You guys are recruiting for superheroes.

582
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:58,759
Where are the tryouts?

583
00:39:58,847 --> 00:40:02,396
We don't know yet.
Once we do, we'll contact you.

584
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:07,282
Bet we'd get a big turnout if we did it
somewhere with a swimming pool.

585
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,561
Oh, no.

586
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,519
Absolutely not. Nope.

587
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:21,440
I don't deserve this.

588
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:22,676
I know.

589
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:27,598
-A lot of other men I could have married.
-I understand.

590
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:31,441
If one person vomits in my pool,
I'll divorce you.

591
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:33,606
That's fair.

592
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:35,320
Come on, kids!

593
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,123
State your name and power.

594
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:45,640
I am the Waffler.

595
00:40:45,927 --> 00:40:48,805
With my griddle of justice,
I bash the enemy in the head...

596
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:50,843
...or I burn them like so.

597
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:53,120
Don't do that.

598
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:57,402
I also have my truth syrup,
which is low fat.

599
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:59,762
And I'm working on a theme song.

600
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:02,441
"Waffle Man, I am the Waffler

601
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,995
"Golden, crispy, bad guys are history"

602
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:09,357
And I'm running. Just think about it.

603
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,722
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

604
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:15,163
-Next.
-Hi. I am Pencilhead.

605
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,323
And I am Son of Pencilhead!

606
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:21,116
-We erase crime.
-Two generations of....

607
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:22,595
Yes, thank you.

608
00:41:22,687 --> 00:41:25,406
-Did I do all right?
-Yes, I think they liked us.

609
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:29,962
I'm the Ballerina Man.

610
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,158
I don't need to see that.

611
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:44,396
Thanks.

612
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:46,160
-I am--
-Hey!

613
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,484
-You copied me.
-You copied me.

614
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:49,795
-Did not!
-Liar!

615
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,077
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

616
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:05,600
I'd say there's potential...there.

617
00:42:05,727 --> 00:42:09,276
I be the Bullfighter. I fight the bull!

618
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,800
Greetings, fellow crime fighters.
I am Radio Man.

619
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:14,796
I am Squeegeeman.

620
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:16,718
-Do you sense its power?
-Yes.

621
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:21,279
P.M.S. Avenger. I work four days a month.
Is there a problem with that?

622
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:22,796
No.

623
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:24,923
-Whatever you say.
-We'll get back to you.

624
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:26,963
-Quite all right.
-Whatever.

625
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:28,726
Okay, that's it.

626
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,717
That was a complete waste of time.

627
00:42:41,847 --> 00:42:43,803
Like so many things we do.

628
00:42:45,807 --> 00:42:49,197
Hi. Am I too late to try out?

629
00:42:49,687 --> 00:42:51,962
-What time is it?
-I don't have a watch on.

630
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:55,244
Sorry. You'll have to pretend
to be a superhero somewhere else.

631
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:57,045
Really? I see.

632
00:42:58,287 --> 00:42:59,606
That's fine.

633
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:20,921
Look out!

634
00:43:34,807 --> 00:43:37,844
I guess I'll just have
to take my ball and go home.

635
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:40,122
-You can't go.
-Please.

636
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:42,198
-Where you going?
-That was cool.

637
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,515
-One second.
-Stop her.

638
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:44,756
-Hold on.
-Stop her.

639
00:43:44,847 --> 00:43:45,836
Settle down.

640
00:43:45,927 --> 00:43:47,121
That was great.

641
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,437
We could squeeze in one more interview.

642
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,041
Yes, seeing how you schlepped
your ball all this way.

643
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:54,721
-Appreciate that. Thanks.
-You're really good.

644
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:56,803
What's up? I'm the Spleen.

645
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:59,517
I'm the Bowler. How're you doing?

646
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:01,160
You're very attractive.

647
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:04,480
Why don't you...

648
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:07,320
...tell us about yourself.

649
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:09,443
Help us understand why
we should choose you...

650
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,563
...over all the other qualified applicants.

651
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,445
-What other qualified applicants?
-Eddie, please.

652
00:44:15,327 --> 00:44:18,160
Start at the top.
Where did you get your powers?

653
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,636
I got my powers from my father.

654
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:22,677
Who's he?

655
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:24,917
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

656
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:26,679
Have we ever heard....

657
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,885
Blimey, don't tell us
you're the Bowler's daughter.

658
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:33,159
I remember there being a little controversy
around his death.

659
00:44:33,247 --> 00:44:34,965
The police said it was an accident.

660
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,039
He came home late one night
and fell down an elevator shaft...

661
00:44:38,127 --> 00:44:39,719
...onto some bullets.

662
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:42,521
I've always suspected a bit of foul play.

663
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:43,796
As have l.

664
00:44:44,487 --> 00:44:46,364
Daddy's little girl is all grown up...

665
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:48,517
...looking for a little revenge?

666
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,361
Yeah, that is it.
Is there a problem with that?

667
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:53,604
-Why don't you tell me?
-You tell me.

668
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:56,281
-Why don't you tell me?
-Why don't you tell me?

669
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:59,845
-Why don't you tell me?
-Why don't you tell me?

670
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:05,397
All right, you've seen what I can do.

671
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:07,364
You want to use my talents or not?

672
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:09,756
If you don't, I seek another cabal.

673
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:12,840
-We definitely need you.
-Indeed.

674
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:14,925
Bowler. Evelyn.

675
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:16,560
-Carol.
-Carol.

676
00:45:17,127 --> 00:45:19,687
Will you join our little ragtag trio?

677
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:21,760
I think you mean quartet--

678
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:24,805
What are you talking about?
There's five of us.

679
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:28,803
Nobody's green lit any new memberships,
so just chill out.

680
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,397
You've got a good arm. I'll give you that.

681
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:34,955
-But we are the lead cadre--
-Cadre.

682
00:45:35,487 --> 00:45:37,000
-You're in.
-Welcome aboard.

683
00:45:37,087 --> 00:45:40,124
-Guys, what are--
-What? What's the problem?

684
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:42,116
Welcome.

685
00:45:42,847 --> 00:45:45,919
-What?
-Nothing. No problem. Welcome aboard.

686
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:57,003
Are Spleen and I on the team or not?

687
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,476
In my opinion,
which used to matter around here...

688
00:45:59,567 --> 00:46:01,558
...we shouldn't be flinging memberships...

689
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:04,400
...at every guy who puts together
matching gloves and boots.

690
00:46:04,487 --> 00:46:06,955
Just be sure to jump in
when the action starts.

691
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:09,845
-You do your share, we'll keep you around.
-Maybe.

692
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:12,641
You're a British man
who converted to Islam?

693
00:46:12,927 --> 00:46:18,206
No. Until the early part of this century,
India was part of the British Empire...

694
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:21,000
...whose government there was called
the British Raj...

695
00:46:21,087 --> 00:46:23,362
...after the Hindi word for "sovereignty."

696
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,915
-Furthermore--
-Wait. I'm sorry. What?

697
00:46:26,607 --> 00:46:27,642
Dad....

698
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,202
No, he's not a commie nor a fruit.

699
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:31,922
Sorry.

700
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:35,723
His ignorance embarrasses me.

701
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:39,365
Am I to understand you've inserted
your father's skull...

702
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:41,438
...inside of that ball for bowling?

703
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,916
No. The guy at the pro shop did it.

704
00:46:47,087 --> 00:46:48,440
That was Casanova's limo.

705
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:51,758
You bet your sweet bippy it was.
Let's turn this sucker around!

706
00:46:51,847 --> 00:46:54,042
He's probably got Amazing in there.

707
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:00,716
-Here we go.
-I feel car sick.

708
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:02,556
Great.

709
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:07,077
So tell me, who can we count on seeing
at my banquet tomorrow?

710
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,397
All the top gangs will be there, Cas.

711
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,916
They want to know
what you got up your sleeve.

712
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,006
Mr. Casanova...

713
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:19,563
...l think we're being followed.

714
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,125
Let us say hello.

715
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:46,797
-What's he doing?
-He's either very smart or very dumb.

716
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,762
Hello.

717
00:48:04,127 --> 00:48:06,846
I would like a double burger
with large fries.

718
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:09,481
Do you boys want something to drink?

719
00:48:11,047 --> 00:48:13,845
We think you did something bad
to Captain Amazing.

720
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:15,758
We'd like you to tell us where he is.

721
00:48:15,847 --> 00:48:19,203
Captain who?
This name does not ring any bells with me.

722
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:21,517
I don't like your tone, Frankenpuss.

723
00:48:22,087 --> 00:48:24,237
Do yourself a favor
and don't punch my clock.

724
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:26,602
I'm a Pantera's box
you do not want to open.

725
00:48:26,687 --> 00:48:28,166
It is Pandora.

726
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:31,717
Please don't correct me. It sickens me.

727
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,923
You guys never learn, do you?

728
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:36,403
Apparently we don't, ass.

729
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,082
-I know you.
-You don't know me.

730
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:42,205
-You knew my father.
-Sal.

731
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,481
Carmine.

732
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:46,486
Carmine? The Bowler?

733
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:48,798
-Yep.
-You're Baby Bowler?

734
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,083
-Is that a problem?
-Hello.

735
00:48:52,127 --> 00:48:54,960
I'm the guy that gave your daddy the shaft.

736
00:48:55,447 --> 00:48:59,963
This is the last time I'm going to ask you:
Where is Captain Amazing?

737
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:02,766
And a Diet Pepsi with a little bit of ice.

738
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:09,639
Hey, Shov!

739
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:17,806
Boys, let's go.

740
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:21,520
Fork yourself!

741
00:49:26,727 --> 00:49:28,206
Pull!

742
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:49,436
-Come on, Roy, let's get out of here.
-Come on, Furious! Let's go!

743
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:54,639
People who live in glass houses, shouldn't,
because this is what happens!

744
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:58,765
Come on! That's enough!
Come on. Get out of the way.

745
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:02,878
"The roof is on fire! The roof!

746
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,356
"The roof! The roof is on fire!

747
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:07,843
"We don't need no water!"

748
00:50:10,647 --> 00:50:12,205
Here comes Daddy.

749
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:26,196
Go, go!

750
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:49,035
I would like to make a toast
to our first straight-out victory.

751
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,640
The relationship you have with your
mother affects every dynamic in your life.

752
00:50:53,727 --> 00:50:56,002
-It's true, quite true.
-What? What?

753
00:50:56,647 --> 00:51:00,356
Yes, I know a father's role is vital
in a child's life as well.

754
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:02,278
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

755
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:06,565
You have to allow me
to have conversations in a bar...

756
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,444
...and talk to my new friends.

757
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,483
Anyway, I'm an adult now.

758
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:13,239
Do you want to go back in the bag?

759
00:51:13,327 --> 00:51:16,524
Is that how we're gonna do it now?
You make the rules.

760
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,359
If you don't zip it....

761
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:28,445
I was going to say that parents
can be quite problematic.

762
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:30,165
Tell me about it.

763
00:51:34,287 --> 00:51:37,802
There's not enough beer in the world.
I'm sorry.

764
00:51:38,247 --> 00:51:40,397
"I'm sorry."

765
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:42,438
You've got to live in truth.

766
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,438
The woman's a tiger.

767
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:52,324
Barkeep, another round...

768
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:55,126
...for my sweet team of superfriends.

769
00:51:56,407 --> 00:51:59,399
Barkeep, another round for the super...

770
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,085
...super-bellies.

771
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:05,358
That's what's so cool about this team.

772
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:09,360
Everyone has their own powers
for all these different situations.

773
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:10,966
Pull my finger.

774
00:52:17,007 --> 00:52:19,157
-What?
-I was just thinking.

775
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:23,404
I was wondering when
we might see your superpower.

776
00:52:25,807 --> 00:52:28,275
It'll happen, kid. Don't worry.

777
00:52:31,327 --> 00:52:33,045
-I say, "sabotage."
-"Sabotage"?

778
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,844
The Shoveler is hammered!

779
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:37,883
The Shoveler is hammered!

780
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:47,680
What's the name of this team?

781
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,200
How about the Super Squad?

782
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:52,199
How about the Six Dead Guys
in Their Stupid Costumes?

783
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:55,600
No. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

784
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:57,837
What about the Legendary Super Freaks?

785
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:00,521
Way too positive. They totaled our car.

786
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:11,718
-Ready?
-Ready!

787
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,206
-Aim.
-Aim!

788
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:18,282
I love you!

789
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:20,276
Fire!

790
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:32,039
Six Very Nearly Dead Guys
Who Had A Temporary Reprieve.

791
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:34,960
-That's it. That's your name.
-Six Jive Turkeys.

792
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:37,322
-Dig, man?
-Yeah! Dig, man!

793
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,241
That's your name.
Kill you later, Superlosers!

794
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:49,439
Criminy. You're the Sphinx.

795
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,519
And you are fools.

796
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:53,521
Tonight...

797
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:55,366
...you proved...

798
00:53:56,327 --> 00:53:57,919
...your inexperience.

799
00:53:58,607 --> 00:54:01,758
The wise man knows that he is weakest...

800
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:04,517
...when he thinks himself strong.

801
00:54:06,447 --> 00:54:08,244
Mysterious.

802
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:09,925
Terribly mysterious.

803
00:54:10,007 --> 00:54:11,918
Casanova Frankenstein...

804
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,878
...is no ordinary villain.

805
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,520
To fight him...

806
00:54:15,967 --> 00:54:18,925
...you must have extraordinary skill.

807
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:22,080
Thank you for that little piece
of information.

808
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,635
-I wouldn't have thought--
-Excuse me!

809
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:27,082
-Do you have any manners?
-I don't know. Do l?

810
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,680
-I don't know. Do you?
-Do l?

811
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:31,361
-Why don't you tell me?
-Why don't you tell me?

812
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:33,165
-I don't know.
-Do I mind what?

813
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:34,521
Silence!

814
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,445
We'll have to separate you two.

815
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:40,121
Is that what you want?
You want to be separated?

816
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:41,840
He started it.

817
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:46,197
You must be like the wolf pack...

818
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:49,802
...not like the six-pack.

819
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:51,600
Teamwork. Yes!

820
00:54:51,927 --> 00:54:55,237
You are not ready
to face so great an enemy.

821
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:59,602
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

822
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:01,556
Yes!

823
00:55:02,047 --> 00:55:03,526
It's cool, isn't it?

824
00:55:03,607 --> 00:55:07,600
It goes right up to the point of being,
like...confusing.

825
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,597
It's leadership.
It's what we've been missing.

826
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:13,845
Yes, I quite agree.

827
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,997
Sphinx, will you guide
our motley little gang of men-at-arms?

828
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,682
Wait a minute.

829
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:22,678
Are you serious? Come on.

830
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:24,844
Will you shape us, mold us?

831
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,236
Please unify us and make us whole.

832
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:29,604
To learn my teachings...

833
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,476
...l must first teach you...

834
00:55:33,407 --> 00:55:34,806
...how to learn.

835
00:55:45,527 --> 00:55:48,246
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent...

836
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:50,961
...and you'll more easily strike his hide.

837
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:03,244
-How many weapons do you wield?
-Just one, Sphinx.

838
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:06,524
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head!

839
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:10,476
You must lash out with every limb,
like the octopus who plays the drums.

840
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:17,485
Why am I doing this again?

841
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,876
When you can balance a tack hammer
on your head...

842
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,004
...you will head off your foes
with a balanced attack.

843
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:26,759
And why am I wearing
the watermelon on my feet?

844
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,446
I don't remember telling you to do that.

845
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:40,125
Wait a minute. Wait.

846
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:01,318
I believe in my powers.

847
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:03,763
"l believe in my powers."

848
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:07,239
I believe in the powers of my teammates.

849
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:10,166
"l believe in the powers of my teammates."

850
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:12,758
I trust in my powers.

851
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:14,998
"l trust in my powers."

852
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:17,641
I trust in the powers of my teammates.

853
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:20,760
"l trust in the powers of my teammates."

854
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,801
This team must learn to work together...

855
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,957
...or mark my words...

856
00:57:28,047 --> 00:57:29,924
...it will be torn apart!

857
00:57:31,527 --> 00:57:32,642
Now...

858
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:34,720
...gather round.

859
00:57:35,007 --> 00:57:37,282
Gather round. Embrace one another.

860
00:57:37,407 --> 00:57:40,240
Gather round.
Embrace one another quickly.

861
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:47,762
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

862
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:49,166
"Practice"?

863
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:52,002
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

864
00:57:52,087 --> 00:57:54,601
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

865
00:57:54,927 --> 00:57:58,920
He who questions training,
only trains himself at asking questions.

866
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:02,362
What?

867
00:58:08,247 --> 00:58:11,398
-Who was looking for the pinking shears?
-That was me.

868
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,716
Yes...

869
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:15,720
...work well on your new costumes.

870
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:19,407
For when you care for what is outside...

871
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:22,321
...what is inside cares for you.

872
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,446
The clock is ticking here.

873
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:27,917
Are we gonna sew dresses all day
or are we gonna rescue Amazing?

874
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:30,726
-I need a thimble. Does anybody--
-Patience, my son.

875
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,082
To summon your power
for the coming conflict...

876
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:36,284
...you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

877
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:39,916
Am I the only one who finds these sayings
just a little formulaic?

878
00:58:40,007 --> 00:58:42,521
"lf you wanna push it down,
you have to pull it up."

879
00:58:42,607 --> 00:58:44,563
"lf you want to go left, you must go right."

880
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:48,925
Your temper is very quick,
but until you learn to master your rage--

881
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:51,522
Your rage will become your master?

882
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,364
That's what you were gonna say, right?

883
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,517
-Right?
-Not necessarily.

884
00:58:57,527 --> 00:58:59,643
That's it. I'm out of here.

885
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:03,277
Thanks for the advice, Mr. Mysterioso,
but it's time to get busy.

886
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:05,437
-Come on, Eddie. Let's go.
-No, Roy.

887
00:59:05,527 --> 00:59:08,644
-He's getting results.
-The result is we're all out of here.

888
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:11,287
Come on, Jeff. Let's peel some lilies.

889
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,683
I don't want to leave the Sphinx.

890
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:16,564
How about the rest of you?

891
00:59:16,647 --> 00:59:20,879
Do you want to play Suzie Homemaker,
or do you want to be superheroes?

892
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:32,446
Okay, I don't need a compass to tell me
which way the wind shines.

893
00:59:33,207 --> 00:59:36,563
-Let's talk about this.
-No, let's not talk about it!

894
00:59:36,687 --> 00:59:39,155
Do you want to sit here
making Halloween outfits...

895
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:41,920
...or do you want to take care of business?

896
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:47,316
Well, I guess from now on
I ride in a wolf pack of one.

897
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,485
-We should go after him.
-He's okay.

898
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,116
-Just let him go. He's a baby.
-We've never gone into battle without him.

899
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:02,925
If you love him, why not marry him?

900
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:05,965
-Why don't you marry him?
-Why don't you?

901
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:07,646
Bowler, Shoveler, please!

902
01:00:08,247 --> 01:00:12,638
Sphinx, what wisdom can you give us
in our most clouded hour?

903
01:00:12,967 --> 01:00:14,639
Yeah, what do we do?

904
01:00:15,927 --> 01:00:20,398
The loss of manpower can be replaced
by the addition of firepower.

905
01:00:23,007 --> 01:00:25,805
Well, I won't use guns.
I've been clear about that.

906
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:27,240
He won't even use a knife.

907
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:29,841
You're not going to start
with that meshugas again?

908
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,918
Casanova will have many weapons.

909
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:36,086
To beat him, you will have to have
more than forks and flatulence.

910
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:41,836
Heller.

911
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:52,523
"Dr. A. Heller. Weapons designer...

912
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:55,521
"...innovator, inventor, world changer."

913
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,522
Why does he live
in a deserted amusement park?

914
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,677
Because he's an eccentric genius.

915
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,804
I'll take point. You two flank.
Let's triangulate.

916
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:26,395
-Equilateral or isosceles?
-Just go.

917
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,476
Who would want to rent a chicken?

918
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,200
It's weird in here. It's scary and weird.

919
01:02:00,487 --> 01:02:02,045
There's another chicken.

920
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:03,845
Crazy chicken world.

921
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:16,446
Dr. Heller?

922
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:19,805
We come in peace.

923
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:22,522
Shovel Head?

924
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:25,167
The Shoveler.
We met at the old folks' home.

925
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:26,566
Of course.

926
01:02:27,487 --> 01:02:28,681
Fork Man?

927
01:02:28,767 --> 01:02:31,759
No, I'm the Spleen. To see my power,
pull my finger.

928
01:02:31,847 --> 01:02:33,803
-Please, don't!
-No, sir, don't!

929
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:37,437
Dr. Heller, we're on a mission.
We've come for weapons.

930
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:40,805
Shouldn't we see a diploma
or something first?

931
01:02:40,967 --> 01:02:44,516
You came to the right place, baby.
Step into my office.

932
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,278
Where are your friends?

933
01:02:51,687 --> 01:02:53,120
What friends?

934
01:02:53,327 --> 01:02:54,806
Your friends.

935
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:57,606
I thought you guys
were in a club or something.

936
01:02:57,767 --> 01:03:00,759
-You mean a team? A Superteam?
-Yeah.

937
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:05,479
Apparently, it's now
the Super Sphinx Team or something.

938
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:08,481
-You had a falling out?
-Yeah, kind of.

939
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:13,438
Is it okay if I just have the coffee?

940
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:15,563
-I'm not very hungry.
-Sure.

941
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:23,877
What time do you get off work?

942
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,725
Half hour.

943
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:27,802
Why?

944
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:31,119
No reason.
I was just thinking maybe I could....

945
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,562
It might be a good idea
if I walked you home.

946
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:36,036
The city's been real, real dangerous...

947
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:38,197
...since Amazing went M.I.A.

948
01:03:41,407 --> 01:03:44,319
I've been working on
some jujitsu moves that....

949
01:03:44,447 --> 01:03:47,405
It'd probably be safer
on everybody's part if....

950
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:49,757
Also, it would be great to just...

951
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:52,686
...walk you home.

952
01:03:54,487 --> 01:03:55,602
Sure.

953
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,802
This will even things up a little bit.
What is it?

954
01:04:04,487 --> 01:04:07,365
-Look at this!
-Don't point at me.

955
01:04:08,167 --> 01:04:10,203
You're gonna kill somebody.

956
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,315
Listen, everything here is non-lethal.

957
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:16,599
"Non-lethal"? What?

958
01:04:17,367 --> 01:04:19,403
I don't make anything that's deadly.

959
01:04:19,487 --> 01:04:22,160
I see. How delightfully eccentric...

960
01:04:22,647 --> 01:04:25,036
...while simultaneously
being a waste of our time.

961
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:27,038
-No offense. Shall we?
-Thank you, Doctor.

962
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:29,197
-I said good day.
-See you, Doc.

963
01:04:29,327 --> 01:04:32,797
That is why, in general,
a mad scientist is less desirable...

964
01:04:32,887 --> 01:04:35,117
...than a garden-variety scientist.

965
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:39,441
Incoming!

966
01:04:44,207 --> 01:04:45,879
-Look out!
-Watch out!

967
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:09,885
Doc, you're a genius.

968
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:12,399
A canned tornado?

969
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:15,445
Totally non-lethal, but totally effective.

970
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:17,643
What is this thing
you were handling before?

971
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:18,921
That's a shrinker.

972
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:20,360
How do you know?

973
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:21,721
A manual. Cool.

974
01:05:22,207 --> 01:05:25,597
That's a high-temperature,
fabric-adhesive, liquid projector...

975
01:05:25,687 --> 01:05:28,326
...based on simple dry-cleaning technology.

976
01:05:29,607 --> 01:05:31,404
You aim that at a guy...

977
01:05:32,967 --> 01:05:35,879
...his clothes get so tight
he can't even breathe.

978
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:37,998
I can trick that out with a holster.

979
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:42,046
It comes with a leather carrying case.
It's got a wad cutter and a full warranty.

980
01:05:42,127 --> 01:05:43,242
Nicely done.

981
01:05:43,327 --> 01:05:46,478
-What do you call this?
-Careful, careful. That's a blame-thrower.

982
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,127
-"A blame-thrower"?
-I'm sorry.

983
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:51,158
Your bad attitude is hurting this team!

984
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:55,206
-Stop spitting! I already took a shower!
-You need another one, 'cause you stink!

985
01:05:55,287 --> 01:05:58,040
-Want me to pop that zit for you?
-I'm really shaking!

986
01:05:58,127 --> 01:06:01,119
-You're always spraying!
-I'm sorry if I spit all the time!

987
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:05,564
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

988
01:06:05,727 --> 01:06:06,842
No, no.

989
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:13,801
-Doctor, you are a genius.
-That's what the card says.

990
01:06:15,607 --> 01:06:18,724
I still want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

991
01:06:18,807 --> 01:06:20,684
So why don't you just go back?

992
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:22,917
No, I just left this morning.
That would be--

993
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:25,521
-This is my place.
-That would be ridiculous.

994
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:30,044
They're your friends. They'll understand.
It's clearly what you want to do.

995
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:32,198
That actually could work.

996
01:06:32,607 --> 01:06:36,236
I'm Mr. Furious, right?
I'm unpredictable. I'm a loose cannon.

997
01:06:36,327 --> 01:06:39,080
I go storming off.
Why can't I come storming back?

998
01:06:39,167 --> 01:06:42,557
-I mean, it's all in how you play it, right?
-Or don't play it.

999
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:46,799
Just go back, say you're sorry
and help them save Captain Amazing.

1000
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:50,404
You think there's a really angry way
I could say I'm sorry?

1001
01:06:50,487 --> 01:06:52,000
'Cause that's kind of my....

1002
01:06:52,087 --> 01:06:55,443
I gotta stick with the anger thing
'cause people like that.

1003
01:06:59,247 --> 01:07:01,920
Maybe people like you
for who you really are.

1004
01:07:02,447 --> 01:07:03,436
You know?

1005
01:07:05,607 --> 01:07:07,279
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1006
01:07:12,847 --> 01:07:15,077
You should go find your friends.

1007
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:28,122
Good.

1008
01:07:28,247 --> 01:07:31,876
Now, the three of you
will be like the eagle's claw.

1009
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:35,204
You will snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

1010
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:39,485
We three scouts are like the eagle's eye:
ever watchful for danger.

1011
01:07:41,287 --> 01:07:43,357
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

1012
01:07:43,447 --> 01:07:47,326
Then let operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged Eagle begin.

1013
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:53,397
Shotgun!

1014
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,318
I think not, my friend.

1015
01:08:03,487 --> 01:08:04,806
Silly twit.

1016
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,799
Give me a second.

1017
01:08:12,247 --> 01:08:13,805
-Hey.
-What's up?

1018
01:08:14,407 --> 01:08:16,557
Not a lot. What's up with you?

1019
01:08:17,007 --> 01:08:18,406
Nothing much.

1020
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:24,202
-Have you seen my address book?
-No. What did it look like?

1021
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:29,400
It's denim. It says "Hang loose" on it
with a picture of a kitten.

1022
01:08:30,687 --> 01:08:31,676
No.

1023
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:36,806
You should probably think
about where you saw it last.

1024
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:38,002
Right.

1025
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:47,119
I should probably....

1026
01:08:50,847 --> 01:08:53,964
Eddie, there's something I want to say.

1027
01:08:54,087 --> 01:08:57,557
I'm angry about being left out
of this mission...

1028
01:08:57,647 --> 01:09:00,764
...and about what's happening
with this team, but I'm....

1029
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:06,316
Oh, boy.

1030
01:09:09,327 --> 01:09:10,999
Temperature rising.

1031
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:13,885
Vision blurring.

1032
01:09:14,847 --> 01:09:17,042
Rage taking over.

1033
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:19,597
I got an idea.
Why don't you come with us?

1034
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:20,802
Okay.

1035
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:22,606
Rage subsiding.

1036
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:25,720
Pulse slowing.

1037
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:28,686
Anger fading.

1038
01:09:32,447 --> 01:09:34,756
That was quick thinking, Eddie.

1039
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:39,639
Well, I wouldn't want anyone to get hurt.

1040
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:09,284
Drink, drink!

1041
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:17,802
Right, then. I'll go and scout out a way in.

1042
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:20,640
-What should the signal be?
-"Caree, caroo."

1043
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:22,837
No, no, what about: "whippoorwill"?

1044
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,600
-No, "Caree, caroo."
-Yes, but isn't that better?

1045
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:28,565
-Not interested.
-Enough with the cuckoo!

1046
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,241
-We must find an open window.
-That's what I said.

1047
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,442
Go, go!

1048
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:40,399
Does everyone have a drink?

1049
01:10:40,927 --> 01:10:43,282
-Yes, we all do!
-You're all good?

1050
01:10:43,767 --> 01:10:46,759
Good. Well, it is wonderful in my heart...

1051
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,879
...to see so many familiar faces once again.

1052
01:10:51,287 --> 01:10:53,881
The Susies: assassins from the East.

1053
01:10:56,447 --> 01:11:00,076
The Suits: downsizing all those
who dare oppose them.

1054
01:11:00,447 --> 01:11:03,644
The Furriers: always dressed to kill.

1055
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:12,804
The Frat Boys: still on probation
for lethal hazing.

1056
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,396
Phi Zeta!

1057
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:17,724
Of course, the Not So Goody Mob:

1058
01:11:18,687 --> 01:11:20,837
Putting the rhyme into crime!

1059
01:11:20,927 --> 01:11:22,804
The pleasure's all mine, Frankenstein.

1060
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:25,879
We're about to perpetrate some evil
on the Champion City people.

1061
01:11:25,967 --> 01:11:27,719
Rappin', snappin', cappin'.

1062
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:32,719
Tonight, we are having quite a party.
A surprise party.

1063
01:11:33,927 --> 01:11:36,487
I have a little something up my sleeve...

1064
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:39,798
...and I'm not just talking
about the wart on my elbow.

1065
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:48,439
I have created a beautiful machine...

1066
01:11:49,127 --> 01:11:52,164
...that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens...

1067
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:54,763
...to share my vision...

1068
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:56,646
...of the world!

1069
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,526
Can you dig it?

1070
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:03,964
What about Captain Amazing?

1071
01:12:05,207 --> 01:12:08,279
That is an excellent question, Big Tobacco.

1072
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:13,683
What will we do about the greatest
superhero Champion City has ever known?

1073
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:17,886
For the answer,
I want you all to walk this way.

1074
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,483
Dude, can we bring the brewskis?

1075
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:24,719
Yes, of course.
You may absolutely bring the brewskis.

1076
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:35,482
Things look pretty quiet to me.

1077
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:41,598
Invisible Boy, did you just let one go?

1078
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:44,281
-No, that wasn't me.
-Well, it wasn't me.

1079
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:52,438
Don't run! He'll shoot!

1080
01:13:00,967 --> 01:13:03,481
Is he doing what I think he's doing?

1081
01:13:08,447 --> 01:13:09,960
Just go with it.

1082
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:22,722
-Can anybody see anything?
-Hey!

1083
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:24,439
-Who said "hey"?
-Not me.

1084
01:13:24,527 --> 01:13:27,200
Eddie, you don't have to say,
"Not me," okay?

1085
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:30,842
-If someone says, "Who?" and you say--
-Morons, over here.

1086
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:32,805
It's Captain Amazing!

1087
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:38,040
-We've been looking for you.
-Turn on the light switch behind you.

1088
01:13:42,847 --> 01:13:44,838
We meet again, Captain.

1089
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:47,356
-We're here to rescue you.
-Yeah.

1090
01:13:48,567 --> 01:13:51,286
I'm Blue Raja. Do you recall me?
Master of silverware?

1091
01:13:51,367 --> 01:13:54,279
You said to keep up the good work
after the Red Eye skirmish.

1092
01:13:54,367 --> 01:13:57,404
I meet so many people in this business,
but I think so.

1093
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:01,084
You two, locate the master
ignition switch on the main console.

1094
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:02,486
Could you open that up?

1095
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:04,762
You'll be out in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

1096
01:14:04,847 --> 01:14:06,519
-Frightfully uncomfortable.
-Great.

1097
01:14:06,607 --> 01:14:08,837
-How does this work?
-I've seen one of these.

1098
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:11,395
You've got to push this thing in
and twist it.

1099
01:14:11,487 --> 01:14:14,206
-Don't force it!
-She's right, my little friend.

1100
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:16,755
This contraption is a weapon
of mass destruction.

1101
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:19,919
Casanova plans to turn it
against the city tonight at midnight.

1102
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:21,645
Something's happening.

1103
01:14:21,727 --> 01:14:26,164
Very good. On the wall to your left
you should see two toggles side-by-side.

1104
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:29,723
"Toggles"? What do you mean?
You talking about switches?

1105
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:31,843
-I see them, Captain.
-Thank you.

1106
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:34,202
-Flip the first toggle.
-Flipping.

1107
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:40,283
-Excellent work. Now, flip the--
-Jolly good work, team!

1108
01:14:40,407 --> 01:14:43,001
Could you just stay over there, please?

1109
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:44,441
Of course.

1110
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:48,482
Sorry.

1111
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:52,204
-Now flip the second toggle.
-Do as he says.

1112
01:14:52,447 --> 01:14:54,642
The man knows what he's saying.

1113
01:14:54,727 --> 01:14:58,925
Captain, I'm just gonna ask you directly.
Do you know billionaire Lance Hunt?

1114
01:14:59,007 --> 01:14:59,996
It's me.

1115
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:03,802
No, I'm kidding.
I've always wanted to do that.

1116
01:15:03,887 --> 01:15:07,084
-What's next?
-I just told you, flip the second toggle.

1117
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,317
-Again?
-What do you mean?

1118
01:15:10,327 --> 01:15:12,557
-Flip the toggle twice?
-No, no.

1119
01:15:12,687 --> 01:15:15,997
Don't do that. Just flip it again now.
One time. Flip it.

1120
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:17,805
Does he understand what I'm asking?

1121
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:22,244
Hold on a second.
Exactly how many toggle flips in toto...

1122
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:24,164
...are involved in this procedure?

1123
01:15:24,247 --> 01:15:27,603
I just.... It's...seven!

1124
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:29,920
-Seven?
-Flip it!

1125
01:15:30,007 --> 01:15:32,760
-Seven?
-Everybody, hold the phone.

1126
01:15:32,847 --> 01:15:36,442
You phrased that incorrectly.
How many toggle flips are needed...

1127
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:39,758
...not counting the gratuitous toggle flip
you may have asked for...

1128
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:42,077
-...in a moment of panic.
-Flip it!

1129
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:45,762
Could we just start again?
Is there a reset button on this thing?

1130
01:15:45,847 --> 01:15:48,998
No, you freak, there's no reset button.
Flip the switch, lady.

1131
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:51,806
Don't stare at me.
Lift your left arm. Flip it, moron!

1132
01:15:51,887 --> 01:15:53,445
-You're a moron!
-I am not!

1133
01:15:53,527 --> 01:15:56,087
-Don't call her a moron. That's not cool.
-Thank you.

1134
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:59,443
-I will do it!
-Flip the switch.

1135
01:15:59,527 --> 01:16:00,960
It's this one, yes?

1136
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:04,206
Wrong switch.

1137
01:16:21,367 --> 01:16:23,927
Everybody heard me say,
"Reset button," right?

1138
01:16:24,007 --> 01:16:26,567
My God, we killed him.

1139
01:16:27,127 --> 01:16:29,766
What do you mean "we"? I was right here.

1140
01:16:43,367 --> 01:16:45,278
I'm gonna check his pulse.

1141
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,038
I don't think he'll pull through.

1142
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:55,800
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get out of here.

1143
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:59,044
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

1144
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:01,086
Go, go, go.

1145
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:10,206
God in heaven!

1146
01:17:16,127 --> 01:17:18,595
-This sucker's dead!
-What happened to him?

1147
01:17:20,327 --> 01:17:21,999
As you can see...

1148
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:24,635
...l have taken Captain Amazing...

1149
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,279
...out of the picture.

1150
01:17:28,007 --> 01:17:29,918
It's time for us to rule.

1151
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:36,282
Tonight at midnight,
I'm going to do to Champion City...

1152
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:39,165
...what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

1153
01:17:39,607 --> 01:17:43,122
There'll still be time to go up,
get down and boogie.

1154
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:48,040
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-Where's Captain Amazing?

1155
01:17:48,127 --> 01:17:50,721
-There's been a bit of a cock-up.
-Raja murdered him.

1156
01:17:50,807 --> 01:17:54,243
Guys, I think we got bigger fish
to fry right now.

1157
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:56,602
-What the hell was that machine?
-I don't know.

1158
01:17:56,687 --> 01:17:58,598
But I know where we can go to find out.

1159
01:18:04,887 --> 01:18:06,798
The vermin are back, Tony.

1160
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:11,406
Vermin should be exterminated, Casanova.

1161
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:16,716
A fish fork is no match for my machine!

1162
01:18:18,287 --> 01:18:21,199
But I think we should take out
some insurance.

1163
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:22,962
Don't you think?

1164
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:25,445
It's a psychofrakulator.

1165
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:29,156
It creates a cloud of radically fluctuating
free-deviant chaotrons...

1166
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:31,556
...which penetrate the synaptic relays.

1167
01:18:31,647 --> 01:18:35,083
It's concatenated with
a synchronous transport switch...

1168
01:18:35,247 --> 01:18:37,556
...that creates a virtual tributary.

1169
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,441
It's focused onto a biobolic reflector.

1170
01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:45,037
And what happens is
that hallucinations become reality...

1171
01:18:46,407 --> 01:18:48,716
...and the brain is literally fried
from within.

1172
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:52,561
-Where would you get it?
-I don't know, they said it couldn't be built.

1173
01:18:52,647 --> 01:18:56,196
The equations were so complex that
any of the scientists who worked on it...

1174
01:18:56,287 --> 01:18:57,686
...wound up in an insane asylum.

1175
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:00,998
Which is where Casanova's been
for the last 20 years.

1176
01:19:01,127 --> 01:19:03,561
If he uses it, it'll waste Champion City!

1177
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:05,917
-Not "if." "When."
-We need Captain Amazing.

1178
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,157
Unfortunately, we just killed him.

1179
01:19:08,407 --> 01:19:10,523
No, unfortunately, you killed him.

1180
01:19:11,007 --> 01:19:14,283
Because you have problems at home
doesn't mean you can kill people.

1181
01:19:14,367 --> 01:19:17,916
"Sorry. Mummy. I'm English.
I didn't mean it."

1182
01:19:18,047 --> 01:19:20,641
K-l-L-L-E-D. You killed him.

1183
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:23,236
You killed him. You hit the switch.

1184
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:26,160
It's the same difference. He's still dead.

1185
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:28,923
-You did kind of--
-Sphinx!

1186
01:19:30,127 --> 01:19:32,687
Sphinx, what in heaven's name do we do?

1187
01:19:34,047 --> 01:19:35,366
Sometimes...

1188
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:39,356
...the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

1189
01:19:40,087 --> 01:19:42,840
-I like the way this man thinks.
-Let's run.

1190
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:45,196
We can't run.

1191
01:19:45,607 --> 01:19:48,599
Yes. It's been established that we can run.

1192
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:54,357
This is egg salad loaded with cholesterol.
My wife won't even let me touch it.

1193
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:59,000
Hardly seems to matter now.
Chances are, we're already dead.

1194
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:01,406
Amazing is gone.

1195
01:20:01,487 --> 01:20:06,038
There's no use waiting for the cavalry,
because, as of now, the cavalry is us.

1196
01:20:06,127 --> 01:20:09,358
-Yeah, but I don't wanna get frakulated.
-Psychofrakulated.

1197
01:20:09,687 --> 01:20:13,680
-We still get frakulated.
-This is our fight, whether we like it or not.

1198
01:20:14,007 --> 01:20:16,396
We're not your classic superheroes.

1199
01:20:16,527 --> 01:20:19,485
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1200
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:22,116
We're the guys nobody ever bets on.

1201
01:20:24,007 --> 01:20:25,599
But I'll tell you what I think.

1202
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:29,202
You and that ball of yours
have an appointment you must keep.

1203
01:20:29,727 --> 01:20:32,685
Invisible Boy,
I think it's time you were seen.

1204
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:35,322
Sphinx, you have trained us well.

1205
01:20:35,607 --> 01:20:39,156
Dr. Heller, you might
just have given us the edge we need.

1206
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:42,445
Spleen, I don't want to stand behind you.

1207
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:45,441
But I'll fight beside you with pride.

1208
01:20:45,527 --> 01:20:48,325
Jeff, you've got a rare and beautiful gift.

1209
01:20:48,687 --> 01:20:51,201
The city needs you tonight. And, Roy...

1210
01:20:51,687 --> 01:20:55,805
...in all the years I've known you,
I've never seen you walk away from a fight.

1211
01:20:55,887 --> 01:20:57,957
You lifted a city bus once.

1212
01:20:58,047 --> 01:21:01,278
I think you've got what it takes
to handle Casanova.

1213
01:21:02,287 --> 01:21:04,847
We're all in over our heads,
and we know it.

1214
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:07,839
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it...

1215
01:21:07,927 --> 01:21:11,397
...will forever after show our scars
with pride and say:

1216
01:21:11,487 --> 01:21:15,036
"That's right. I was there.
I fought the good fight."

1217
01:21:15,887 --> 01:21:17,240
So, what do you say?

1218
01:21:17,327 --> 01:21:21,286
Do we all gather together
and go kick some Casanova butt...

1219
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:24,723
...or do I eat this sandwich?

1220
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,681
I say, what the fork. Let's do it.

1221
01:21:30,847 --> 01:21:34,044
If we're gonna bust into that mansion
you need more than your car.

1222
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:37,199
At the auto yard,
there's this old Herkimer battle jitney.

1223
01:21:37,287 --> 01:21:39,721
Wait. You have a Herkimer battle jitney?

1224
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:42,605
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

1225
01:21:42,687 --> 01:21:45,440
All right. We'll meet at the junkyard
and go from there.

1226
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:48,041
I shall need more forks, I'm afraid.

1227
01:21:48,127 --> 01:21:50,687
Those who have loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

1228
01:21:50,767 --> 01:21:52,758
You may not get another chance.

1229
01:21:58,527 --> 01:21:59,880
Zei gezunt.

1230
01:22:09,527 --> 01:22:10,755
Hey, Mom.

1231
01:22:11,807 --> 01:22:13,923
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1232
01:22:14,687 --> 01:22:16,245
I was just....

1233
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:25,398
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1234
01:22:25,767 --> 01:22:27,166
A superhero?

1235
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:29,602
An effete British superhero, to be precise.

1236
01:22:29,687 --> 01:22:32,724
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

1237
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:36,635
I hurl it with a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

1238
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:39,486
I don't wear much blue,
and I speak in a British accent.

1239
01:22:39,567 --> 01:22:41,603
If you know your history, it makes sense.

1240
01:22:41,687 --> 01:22:44,326
The point is, your boy's
a Limey fork-flinger, Mother.

1241
01:22:44,407 --> 01:22:47,285
Hard cheese to swallow, but there it is.

1242
01:22:47,847 --> 01:22:50,077
What will the bridge club think?

1243
01:22:53,967 --> 01:22:55,400
You need more forks?

1244
01:22:59,567 --> 01:23:02,525
These belonged to
your great-great-grandmother.

1245
01:23:02,807 --> 01:23:05,037
I was saving these for your wedding day.

1246
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:09,837
But, from the looks of it,
that day is probably a long way off.

1247
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,638
Mom, you're taking this incredibly well.

1248
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:16,643
I've always known you were special...

1249
01:23:16,727 --> 01:23:20,003
...but I just never realized how special.

1250
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,239
I'd better get going.

1251
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:29,200
I've got a city to save.

1252
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:30,800
-Jeffrey?
-Yeah?

1253
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:32,560
Do the accent.

1254
01:23:34,967 --> 01:23:38,357
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

1255
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:41,200
Our metropolis is
in the clutches of madmen.

1256
01:23:41,287 --> 01:23:42,561
Jeffrey?

1257
01:23:42,687 --> 01:23:44,803
-Cheerio.
-I really should get going.

1258
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:46,161
Okay.

1259
01:23:49,247 --> 01:23:50,566
Thanks, Ma.

1260
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:02,235
I said I'd leave you, Eddie. I meant it.

1261
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:07,921
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope they've got.

1262
01:24:08,687 --> 01:24:10,917
Eddie, please don't start.

1263
01:24:11,527 --> 01:24:13,483
I don't expect you to believe me.

1264
01:24:13,567 --> 01:24:15,478
I just came by to tell you...

1265
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:17,766
...that I love you.

1266
01:24:17,847 --> 01:24:19,758
Tell the kids I love them.

1267
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:21,166
And now...

1268
01:24:22,447 --> 01:24:25,166
-...good-bye.
-Good-bye, Eddie.

1269
01:24:26,447 --> 01:24:28,642
I won't be here when you come home.

1270
01:24:29,007 --> 01:24:31,077
That's a chance I'll have to take.

1271
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:34,364
Otherwise, there may not be a home
to come back to.

1272
01:24:44,327 --> 01:24:45,760
Wish me luck.

1273
01:24:56,087 --> 01:24:59,204
-You okay?
-I wanted to say I had a great time tonight.

1274
01:24:59,287 --> 01:25:01,198
And you were really nice to me.

1275
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:04,324
And I would love to ask you out sometime.

1276
01:25:04,647 --> 01:25:07,923
But if I don't call you,
I want you to know it's because I'm dead.

1277
01:25:08,007 --> 01:25:11,204
Me and my team are going
to take on Casanova Frankenstein.

1278
01:25:11,527 --> 01:25:13,643
It's pretty much a suicide mission.

1279
01:25:13,727 --> 01:25:17,561
So, if there is anything
that you want to say to me...

1280
01:25:18,207 --> 01:25:21,756
...now would probably be a good time
to say it, just 'cause....

1281
01:25:22,127 --> 01:25:24,880
-Yeah, I got a question for you.
-Cool. Kick it.

1282
01:25:24,967 --> 01:25:26,525
What's your name?

1283
01:25:26,687 --> 01:25:29,281
Do you mean my secret identity?
'Cause I couldn't....

1284
01:25:29,367 --> 01:25:31,835
No, I just mean your name.

1285
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:34,720
My name.

1286
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,962
It's Phoenix.

1287
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:45,280
Phoenix Dark.

1288
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:48,565
Dirk. Phoenix...

1289
01:25:50,527 --> 01:25:51,437
...Dark-Dirk.

1290
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:55,486
I was christened Dirk Steele,
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1291
01:25:55,967 --> 01:25:58,003
Forget about it. It's okay.

1292
01:26:04,607 --> 01:26:05,835
It's Roy.

1293
01:26:07,607 --> 01:26:09,643
That's my name. My name is....

1294
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,685
My real name is Roy.

1295
01:26:32,047 --> 01:26:34,038
Just be Roy.

1296
01:26:44,087 --> 01:26:46,362
Roy. I'm Roy.

1297
01:26:46,687 --> 01:26:47,756
Yes, I'm Roy.

1298
01:26:47,847 --> 01:26:51,283
-Roy. Who is Roy? Roy is who?
-He's freaking out, man.

1299
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:53,796
Where's the guy who pretends
not to be Roy?

1300
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:58,483
We've had quite enough of that. Stop it.
Just snap out of it. We're tired of it.

1301
01:26:58,567 --> 01:27:02,685
I'm a true wanna-be,
in the worst sense of the....

1302
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,162
You guys have to fight this battle
without me.

1303
01:27:05,247 --> 01:27:07,841
If you doubt your superpowers,
you are shafted.

1304
01:27:07,927 --> 01:27:11,283
If I had any superpowers to doubt,
I'd be in trouble, but I don't.

1305
01:27:11,367 --> 01:27:13,403
What do I do? All I do is go....

1306
01:27:13,487 --> 01:27:16,160
Roy, what are you talking about?
You lifted a bus once.

1307
01:27:16,247 --> 01:27:18,442
Precisely. That story's legendary.

1308
01:27:18,527 --> 01:27:21,963
It was really more of a push than a lift.

1309
01:27:22,047 --> 01:27:25,005
That still takes
incredible superhuman strength.

1310
01:27:25,127 --> 01:27:27,482
It does. To push an entire bus
out the way.

1311
01:27:27,567 --> 01:27:30,206
Actually, the driver had his foot
on the accelerator...

1312
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,437
...to get it going, then it actually was me.

1313
01:27:32,527 --> 01:27:34,040
But he kind of....

1314
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:38,241
Shit.

1315
01:27:42,607 --> 01:27:43,756
Excuse me.

1316
01:27:46,807 --> 01:27:50,482
It starts a process which results
in an accelerated flow of electrons...

1317
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:52,637
...that creates a powerful magnetic force.

1318
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:55,116
This is basically like a huge electromagnet.

1319
01:27:55,207 --> 01:27:58,199
Actually, it's an electro-nuclear-magnet.

1320
01:27:58,287 --> 01:27:59,879
It's the next inevitable phase.

1321
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:03,357
-Vis, can you close up those jockey boxes?
-Right on it.

1322
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:06,405
Let's get suited up.
We're out of here in five.

1323
01:28:10,887 --> 01:28:12,161
It's time.

1324
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:15,521
Let's go.

1325
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:08,240
-Shotgun!
-I already called it, didn't l?

1326
01:29:08,367 --> 01:29:10,642
-Have a seat, my friend.
-Everybody ready?

1327
01:29:11,487 --> 01:29:14,559
-We have lift-off.
-May the forks be with us.

1328
01:29:20,047 --> 01:29:23,278
-Sorry. Too much throttle.
-That's cool. I'm just gonna go.

1329
01:29:23,367 --> 01:29:26,325
-No, sit down!
-All right, here we go.

1330
01:29:39,327 --> 01:29:40,840
Vaya con Dios.

1331
01:29:45,207 --> 01:29:47,357
Somebody do something. We need him.

1332
01:29:47,487 --> 01:29:49,762
Let's do this. You're a very furious man.

1333
01:29:49,847 --> 01:29:51,644
-Do you understand that?
-No.

1334
01:29:51,727 --> 01:29:54,525
You got a lot to be furious about,
and I'll tell you why.

1335
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:58,122
You're not well-liked.
You're abrasive and off-putting.

1336
01:29:58,447 --> 01:30:01,007
You try to be pithy,
but your wit is a hindrance...

1337
01:30:01,087 --> 01:30:02,918
...therefore, nothing is provocative.

1338
01:30:03,007 --> 01:30:05,805
It's just mixed metaphors.
Doesn't that make you angry?

1339
01:30:05,887 --> 01:30:07,718
-Does it infuriate you?
-No.

1340
01:30:07,807 --> 01:30:10,765
It should. Are you angry? Come on, man!

1341
01:30:10,967 --> 01:30:14,801
-Your penmanship is atrocious.
-You dress like a male prostitute.

1342
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:22,684
Get real! I have no powers whatsoever.

1343
01:30:23,007 --> 01:30:25,521
If he has no powers,
maybe I've got no powers.

1344
01:30:25,607 --> 01:30:28,724
-Maybe I can't turn invisible at all.
-Do not go there, son!

1345
01:30:28,807 --> 01:30:31,958
When you doubt your powers,
you give power to your doubts.

1346
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:35,517
I don't mean to be an alarmist,
but it's 11:30 already.

1347
01:30:35,807 --> 01:30:38,196
Thirty minutes till Casanova
blows up the city.

1348
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:41,962
Listen. We've got a blind date
with destiny.

1349
01:30:43,607 --> 01:30:45,802
And it looks like she's ordered the lobster.

1350
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:48,516
Hang on!

1351
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:51,518
We're going to ram the gate!

1352
01:31:08,967 --> 01:31:12,596
What do you think?
Should we knock or just let ourselves in?

1353
01:31:27,967 --> 01:31:29,446
Hit the ground!

1354
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:47,120
They're shooting!

1355
01:32:03,447 --> 01:32:05,403
I hope this magnet thing works.

1356
01:32:19,607 --> 01:32:20,801
It's working.

1357
01:32:32,087 --> 01:32:33,315
Go! Go!

1358
01:32:35,487 --> 01:32:38,081
Quickly! Everybody into the disco room!

1359
01:32:42,207 --> 01:32:44,641
Everyone, through here. Keep moving.

1360
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:48,116
Focus, people. Focus. Let's go.

1361
01:32:54,247 --> 01:32:55,362
Hello?

1362
01:33:03,607 --> 01:33:04,642
Wait!

1363
01:33:13,007 --> 01:33:14,281
Laser eye.

1364
01:33:25,847 --> 01:33:28,042
I should have brought my large pie server.

1365
01:33:28,127 --> 01:33:31,358
If we can't get through that door,
this battle is over.

1366
01:33:34,927 --> 01:33:36,406
This is it.

1367
01:33:36,767 --> 01:33:38,758
My time has come.

1368
01:33:39,207 --> 01:33:41,198
What are you talking about?

1369
01:33:42,247 --> 01:33:44,556
-Wait. Invisible Boy.
-I wouldn't do that, if--

1370
01:33:44,647 --> 01:33:48,117
-Come back here. You'll be cremated.
-It's all about me now.

1371
01:33:48,287 --> 01:33:51,085
-I'm the only one that can save us.
-He's right.

1372
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:53,556
-Good luck, son.
-Nobody look at me.

1373
01:33:53,687 --> 01:33:57,123
-Don't look at him, or it won't work.
-I am transparent.

1374
01:33:58,207 --> 01:34:00,801
I am like the window. I am see-through.

1375
01:34:01,567 --> 01:34:03,285
I'm like Saran Wrap.

1376
01:34:13,007 --> 01:34:16,397
I did it! I'm invisible!
I really do have superpowers.

1377
01:34:16,487 --> 01:34:17,966
Can you see me?

1378
01:34:18,447 --> 01:34:19,482
Yes.

1379
01:34:21,607 --> 01:34:22,801
Two hands there, son.

1380
01:34:22,887 --> 01:34:27,039
Maybe you should put some shorts on
if you want to keep fighting evil.

1381
01:34:28,007 --> 01:34:30,726
Furriers, you will stay here
and delay the attackers.

1382
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:35,278
Not So Goody Mob, fight from behind.
The rest of you, into the atrium.

1383
01:34:35,687 --> 01:34:38,520
Spread yourselves out
for a second wave of attack.

1384
01:34:49,207 --> 01:34:50,765
The door. Door.

1385
01:34:51,647 --> 01:34:54,764
On three. One, two, three.

1386
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:10,561
Shrink 'em.

1387
01:35:22,647 --> 01:35:25,844
I say, they've gone from junior
to missy petite.

1388
01:35:27,407 --> 01:35:28,203
My dress!

1389
01:35:28,287 --> 01:35:30,801
Now that's a wedgie
she won't soon forget.

1390
01:35:31,607 --> 01:35:34,075
My pants feel like they're shrinking, too.

1391
01:35:40,887 --> 01:35:43,003
-Blame thrower!
-Look out!

1392
01:35:47,407 --> 01:35:49,079
I got a bone to pick with you!

1393
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:50,156
Hold it!

1394
01:35:50,927 --> 01:35:51,916
I'm boss!

1395
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:54,123
You know what? Y'all make me sick.

1396
01:36:03,407 --> 01:36:04,806
Give me that gun.

1397
01:36:09,247 --> 01:36:11,203
-I got 'em.
-Disco forever!

1398
01:36:11,967 --> 01:36:13,958
Invisible Boy, Spleen. Susies.

1399
01:37:03,047 --> 01:37:04,560
Dig this, Shovel Man.

1400
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:14,085
Duck! It's the Susies!

1401
01:37:14,167 --> 01:37:15,919
-Grab the gun.
-It's stuck.

1402
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:18,406
Coast clear?

1403
01:37:18,767 --> 01:37:20,166
Shoot anyway.

1404
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:25,356
-I'm scared.
-No, you're not scared. Be strong.

1405
01:37:25,447 --> 01:37:28,007
Say it with me,
"l ain't scared of no Susies."

1406
01:37:28,087 --> 01:37:30,442
-I am scared.
-Say "I'm not scared of no Susies."

1407
01:37:30,527 --> 01:37:32,199
Come on. You ready?

1408
01:37:32,687 --> 01:37:33,915
Let's go!

1409
01:37:42,087 --> 01:37:43,759
Dive!

1410
01:37:54,607 --> 01:37:55,801
I'm hit!

1411
01:37:56,247 --> 01:37:59,284
-Where?
-I'm hit! Medic! Man down!

1412
01:37:59,367 --> 01:38:01,483
-Man down! I can't feel my ass.
-What?

1413
01:38:01,567 --> 01:38:03,364
I can't feel my ass!

1414
01:38:03,607 --> 01:38:04,926
Your powers still work?

1415
01:38:05,007 --> 01:38:07,043
My powers? Weapons check.

1416
01:38:09,487 --> 01:38:11,603
Fire in the hole!

1417
01:38:15,927 --> 01:38:17,679
-It'll do.
-Spleen!

1418
01:38:17,807 --> 01:38:20,719
-Go check on Spleen, okay?
-Okay. All right.

1419
01:38:24,447 --> 01:38:25,926
You ought to run, Tony P.

1420
01:38:26,007 --> 01:38:28,202
You can't hurt me, Baby Bowler.

1421
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,318
'Cause I'm protected...

1422
01:38:32,927 --> 01:38:34,804
...by the god of hair care.

1423
01:38:37,327 --> 01:38:39,557
And it's time to send you
back to your daddy.

1424
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:43,242
-You killed my father.
-That's right. 'Cause I'm a killer.

1425
01:38:43,487 --> 01:38:46,160
And you're not. Let's face it, kid.

1426
01:38:46,607 --> 01:38:48,962
You don't have the guts to kill me.

1427
01:38:49,047 --> 01:38:52,119
You're right.
I don't have the guts to kill you.

1428
01:38:52,287 --> 01:38:55,199
Because I'm better than you.
Yeah, that's right.

1429
01:38:55,287 --> 01:38:56,686
A lot better.

1430
01:38:57,607 --> 01:39:00,519
I may even find the courage
to forgive you someday.

1431
01:39:09,887 --> 01:39:13,675
Carmine, on the other hand, feels
differently than I do about forgiveness.

1432
01:39:15,687 --> 01:39:18,724
Now I'm going back to graduate school.
That was the agreement.

1433
01:39:18,807 --> 01:39:21,685
We're doing it. We're winning.
We're gonna pull this off.

1434
01:39:21,767 --> 01:39:24,076
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1435
01:39:24,607 --> 01:39:28,282
Tell your funny-looking friends
to put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

1436
01:39:28,367 --> 01:39:30,722
Get out of here. He's crazy.
Save yourselves.

1437
01:39:30,807 --> 01:39:34,925
Put them down or I will slash
your girlfriend's pretty little throat.

1438
01:39:35,247 --> 01:39:37,363
Eddie, Jeff, do what he says.

1439
01:39:42,247 --> 01:39:43,521
Thank you.

1440
01:39:44,127 --> 01:39:47,961
It's so easy to get the best of people
when they care about each other.

1441
01:39:48,847 --> 01:39:51,315
Which is why evil will always
have the edge.

1442
01:39:51,767 --> 01:39:54,725
You good guys are always
so bound by the rules.

1443
01:40:01,887 --> 01:40:04,242
You see, I kill my own men.

1444
01:40:10,567 --> 01:40:11,966
Lucky me.

1445
01:40:12,927 --> 01:40:14,485
I get the girl.

1446
01:40:15,727 --> 01:40:16,716
No!

1447
01:40:43,407 --> 01:40:47,116
Don't worry.
It will all be over so very quickly.

1448
01:40:52,247 --> 01:40:53,396
What are you doing?

1449
01:40:53,487 --> 01:40:56,126
They ripped the "Q" section
out of my dictionary...

1450
01:40:56,207 --> 01:40:59,199
...'cause I don't know the meaning
of the word "quit."

1451
01:41:12,967 --> 01:41:15,401
You want a little fisticuffs? Okay.

1452
01:41:19,087 --> 01:41:20,236
Get him, Roy.

1453
01:41:25,847 --> 01:41:27,246
Come on, Roy!

1454
01:41:40,727 --> 01:41:42,399
It's the funkyskunkulator!

1455
01:41:42,487 --> 01:41:44,921
-We've got to stop it.
-Don't touch any toggles.

1456
01:41:46,727 --> 01:41:48,957
Rage taking over.

1457
01:41:49,327 --> 01:41:52,000
Ja. We've heard all that before.

1458
01:41:53,127 --> 01:41:54,480
No, no.

1459
01:41:54,807 --> 01:41:56,843
Rage really taking over.

1460
01:42:45,807 --> 01:42:48,196
Frak you later, Frankenpuss.

1461
01:42:55,927 --> 01:42:56,882
Yeah!

1462
01:43:14,807 --> 01:43:15,523
Get out of here.

1463
01:43:21,527 --> 01:43:22,676
Hit the deck.

1464
01:43:26,687 --> 01:43:28,757
How do we shut this thing down?

1465
01:43:29,807 --> 01:43:31,081
Group hug!

1466
01:43:31,407 --> 01:43:32,806
-Yeah!
-Okay!

1467
01:43:39,127 --> 01:43:41,641
-Hurry up!
-Get her closer to the hole!

1468
01:43:45,167 --> 01:43:47,476
Dad, this is the way it has to be.

1469
01:43:48,007 --> 01:43:51,397
The upshot is you won't be killed
because you're already dead.

1470
01:43:51,527 --> 01:43:53,324
No, I'm not going with you.

1471
01:43:53,407 --> 01:43:56,922
If there's a time for separation,
let me tell you something, this is it.

1472
01:43:57,007 --> 01:43:58,645
-Lift me up.
-Push her up.

1473
01:43:58,727 --> 01:44:00,683
Help me lift her up.

1474
01:44:02,047 --> 01:44:04,003
You can do it. Hold on.

1475
01:44:08,487 --> 01:44:11,285
-Do it!
-I love you, Dad!

1476
01:44:21,527 --> 01:44:24,485
-Run! Run!
-Let's get out of here!

1477
01:44:26,847 --> 01:44:28,485
Run for your lives!

1478
01:44:40,207 --> 01:44:41,003
Go!

1479
01:44:41,087 --> 01:44:42,156
Watch out!

1480
01:44:50,047 --> 01:44:51,162
Go!

1481
01:45:03,287 --> 01:45:06,040
No one could survive the chaos
we've just witnessed here.

1482
01:45:06,127 --> 01:45:10,086
But as the dust begins to settle over
the ruins of Casanova's mansion...

1483
01:45:10,167 --> 01:45:12,044
...the question remains:

1484
01:45:12,127 --> 01:45:16,166
Who were these brave heroes that
gave their lives to save our city tonight?

1485
01:45:16,287 --> 01:45:18,801
Did that frakulator work, or what?
What's the deal?

1486
01:45:18,887 --> 01:45:21,355
Something's moving.
People are coming out.

1487
01:45:21,447 --> 01:45:24,678
-Could you tell us what's going on?
-Hi. Excuse me.

1488
01:45:24,767 --> 01:45:27,998
Excuse me. Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1489
01:45:28,087 --> 01:45:29,202
We did it. We won.

1490
01:45:29,287 --> 01:45:30,879
Hey, that's my team.

1491
01:45:31,527 --> 01:45:34,200
We struck down evil
with the mighty sword of teamwork...

1492
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:37,085
-...and the hammer of not-bickering.
-We are number one.

1493
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:39,237
All others are number two or lower.

1494
01:45:39,327 --> 01:45:42,205
-Who are you guys?
-They call me the Shoveler.

1495
01:45:42,287 --> 01:45:43,515
That's my dad.

1496
01:45:45,527 --> 01:45:46,516
My hero.

1497
01:45:46,607 --> 01:45:48,404
I'm the Bowler. Hello.

1498
01:45:50,967 --> 01:45:53,640
Blue Raja, master of silverware. Hi, Mom.

1499
01:45:53,727 --> 01:45:55,922
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

1500
01:45:56,967 --> 01:45:58,719
Jeffrey.

1501
01:45:58,807 --> 01:46:01,526
And you, sir.
What's your name and your superpower?

1502
01:46:02,007 --> 01:46:03,406
My name's Roy.

1503
01:46:03,607 --> 01:46:06,326
I'm in a super amount of pain.
Could you leave me alone?

1504
01:46:06,407 --> 01:46:10,116
His name's Mr. Furious, and his power
comes from his boundless rage.

1505
01:46:10,767 --> 01:46:14,316
Excuse me. Could I say something?
I think we would all like this victory...

1506
01:46:14,407 --> 01:46:16,637
...to go out to all the other guys.

1507
01:46:16,727 --> 01:46:18,126
The people in this city...

1508
01:46:18,207 --> 01:46:21,085
...who are super good at their jobs
but never get credit...

1509
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:23,442
...like the lady in the D.M.V.
That's a rough job.

1510
01:46:23,527 --> 01:46:26,519
To the people that remember jingles
from old commercials.

1511
01:46:26,607 --> 01:46:29,360
People that support local music
and independent film.

1512
01:46:29,447 --> 01:46:32,359
The guy that drives the snowplow.
The school nurse--

1513
01:46:32,447 --> 01:46:34,199
Eddie, I think they got the point.

1514
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:35,925
What's the name of this group?

1515
01:46:36,007 --> 01:46:37,201
The Super Dudes.

1516
01:46:37,287 --> 01:46:38,561
No, not the Super Dudes.

1517
01:46:38,647 --> 01:46:42,083
We don't have a name yet,
but we're definitely not the Super Dudes.

1518
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:43,759
I gotta get home. It's late.

1519
01:46:43,847 --> 01:46:45,883
Picture, picture time.

1520
01:46:48,767 --> 01:46:51,406
Whatever you call them,
Champion City will forever...

1521
01:46:51,487 --> 01:46:54,240
...owe a debt of gratitude
to these mystery men.

1522
01:46:54,447 --> 01:46:56,244
Wait. That's it.

1523
01:46:56,327 --> 01:46:59,160
We are the Super Squad.

1524
01:46:59,607 --> 01:47:00,722
No!

1525
01:47:01,247 --> 01:47:04,000
Alliteration in these situations is corny.

1526
01:47:04,767 --> 01:47:05,916
What?

1527
01:47:06,047 --> 01:47:08,800
Yes, we're all very aware
that you saved the day...

1528
01:47:08,887 --> 01:47:11,196
...and I'm sure we'll be hearing about it
for the rest of our lives.

1529
