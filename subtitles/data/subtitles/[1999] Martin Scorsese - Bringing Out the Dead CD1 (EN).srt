The night started out with a bang.

12
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:26,605
A gunshot to the chest
on a drug deal gone bad.

I don't see why we should.

Correct me if I am wrong here,
if I'm mistaken.

Did we push it up your nose?

The dispatcher should've let you
know that. I cannot do it. No.

We picked him up at 49th and 10th.
You're the closest.

Where do you want me to put him?
You tell me.

123
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:48,245
He wanted to come here. He said
the nurses at Misery were the best.

Excuse me. You're a kind man,

poor, sick, dying, helpless man...

127
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,965
- a small cup of water.
- I have to stay with my patient.

00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,191
Will you shut the fuck up?

129
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:08,761
Goddamn it. What the hell are you doing
to me? We're all backed up in here.

130
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:12,205
Look at this guy. Looks like he needs
the works. What's wrong with him?

131
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:15,733
- You should know. You pronounced him.
- You told me he was dead.

132
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:17,746
- Flatline.
- He got better.

133
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:20,009
[Sighs] I hate pronouncing people
dead over the phone.

134
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:24,417
Yeah. Better, huh? They're fixed
and dilated. This guy's plant food.

135
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:28,116
We stole a stretcher from X ray, so
put him in three next to the overdose.

136
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,989
All right, look. He's our lowest
priority now. He shouldn't even be here.

137
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,358
All this technology. What a waste.

138
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,193
[Griss] Leave that dope alone.
The doc'll be out in a minute.

139
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:39,029
- Could find out what's going on?
- Please, folks, step back.

140
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:43,163
Please, folks, step back.
I've already told you two to step back.

141
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:46,231
- Mister...
- Don't make me take off my sunglasses.

142
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,507
First-time heart attack. He should've
gone to C.C.U. ten hours ago.

143
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,844
We got three bodies up there
just like the one you brought in.

144
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:56,351
Over there, two AIDS patients.
One is 12 and filling up with fluids.

145
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,444
Mother won't sign
the "Do Not Resuscitate."

146
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:01,251
"Mercy killing"doesn't
translate well in Spanish.

147
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,849
It's a sin to have to tube that kid.

148
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:07,054
We got three more O.D. s from this new
killerjunk they're calling Red Death.

149
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,428
What's in it?

150
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,933
It's a mix of heroin and I don't know
what else. An amino acid, maybe.

151
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,060
This stuff is so strong, they're
drinking it with grain alcohol.

152

299
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:19,737
He just needs a bath and some food.
Let's take him in back.

300
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:22,648
- Get a stretcher.
- She's nuts. That's why he comes here.

301
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:25,016
- She encourages him.
- Don't. This is not a homeless shelter.

302
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:27,521
- He's gonna have to wait in the lobby.
- No way, man.

303
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,956
Not even in the corner.
Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.

[Larry Groaning]

306
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:55,944
My first cigarette in over a year.

307
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,612
First is always the best.

308
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:05,520
The doctor doesn't think
my father will make it.

309
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:08,586
Said he was dead for too long.

310
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:11,326
After six minutes,
the brain starts to die...

311
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,233
and after that,

312
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:17,238
just close the door.

313
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:20,036
You never know.

314
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,636
You know, my father and I
haven't spoken in three years.

315
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:27,843
When my brother called me and said
that my father had a heart attack...

316
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:31,648
and that he locked himself
in the bathroom...

317
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:34,713
all the way going over there,
I was thinking of...

318
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,725
how I was gonna tell him
what a bastard he was.

319
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:42,992
When I got there
and we put him up on the bed...

320
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:48,469
and I thought of all the other things
that I wanted to say to him...

321
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:57,910
Well, right now I'm more worried
about my mother than anything.

322
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,916
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest.

323
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,750
- You're not gonna find anything out now.
- That's what I told her.

324
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:09,552
If she could just see him for a second,
then I know she'd let me take her home.

325
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,684
Thanks for the light.

326
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:14,662
Here's your dinner. I wheel, you heal.

333

[Frank Narrating]
The biggest problem with not driving...

334
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:41,650
is that whenever there's a patient
in the back, you're also in the back.

335
00:22:41,724 --> 00:22:45,251
- The door's closed. You're trapped.
- Let me breathe

336
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:50,264
5.00 or 6.00 in the morning is always
the worst time for me. Just before dawn.

337
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:52,266
Just when you've
been lulled into thinking...

338
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,792
it might be safe
to close your eyes for one minute.

339
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:58,396
That's when I first found Rose.

340
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:02,877
She was on the sidewalk, not breathing.

[Groans]
I'm not feeling very well, Larry.

342
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:11,477
Let's say we go back
to the hospital, call it a night.

343
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:15,957
You got no sick time, Frank. No time
of any kind. Everyone knows that.

344
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,823
Take me back.
Put me to bed. I surrender.

345
00:23:18,894 --> 00:23:20,828
We've done enough damage tonight.

346
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:23,387
You take things way
too seriously, Frank.

347
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,468
[Frank] You ever think
of doing anything else?

348
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,596
Sure.

Taking my captain's exam next year.

Once the kids are in school,
Louise can go back to the post office.

351
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:42,212
I thought, "What the hell?
I'll start my own medic service."

352
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:46,277
Out on the island, the volunteers
are becoming salaried municipal.

353

I'd always had nightmares.

That was my motto.

But I hadn't saved anyone in months.

361
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:30,631
It seemed all my patients
were dying on me.

362
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:33,532
I'd waited,
sure the sickness would break.

363
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:38,403
Maybe the next call, maybe tomorrow,
the feeling would drop away.

364
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:42,808
More than anything else,
I wanted to sleep like that.

00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:03,895
Okay, Frank, you take yours to heaven.
I'll take mine to hell. Let's go.

449
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,526
Get him on the board. Let's go.

450
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:12,999
You're gonna feel
a stick in your arm. Don't move.

451
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,737
Listen, I'm quitting, man.

452
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:18,473
I'm going in the army where it's safe.

453
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:20,913
[Grunting] I don't wanna die.

454
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:24,043
- No, I wanna die. I'm the one.
- You're not gonna die.

455
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,088
- What did you say?
- Shut up! You're going to die.

456
00:30:27,156 --> 00:30:30,887
- Hold my hand, man.
- I can't. I gotta do the other arm.

457
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,828
- Hold my hand, man.
- Hold this.

458
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:37,263
If you let go, I swear I won't kill you.

459
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,893
[Grunting]

460
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:49,640
[Frank] It's all right. We're here.

461
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:58,418
Fuck.

462
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:01,115
He's not breathing. Call a code.

463
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,556
Noel, let's go.

464
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:06,527
Let's go!

465
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:10,258
Fucking Christ.

466
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:17,098
[Man] So here I am. And this junkie
got something jammed in his teeth.

467
00:31:17,172 --> 00:31:20,437
Now, none of thesejunkies wanna give
mouth-to-mouth. It was a blow dryer.

468
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:23,876
So I pulls it out.
His body was cold except for his throat.

469
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:27,473
It had been blow-dried. Junkie had
second-degree burns of the tongue.

470
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,882
Did you ever give mouth-to-mouth?

471
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:32,716
A long time ago,
when I was your age, boy. Never again.

472
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:35,916
Chances are you end up
with a mouthful of puke. Junkie puke.

473
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:39,950
I'd do it if I had to.
It's part of the job.

474
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,259
- What about you?
- What?

475
00:31:42,331 --> 00:31:44,492
You ever do mouth-to-mouth before?

476
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,832
- Once. On a baby.
- [Griss] Oh, babies.

477
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:51,168
Now, babies are a whole
different thing entirely.

478
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,640
Did I ever tell you about the time
that white woman approached me?

479
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:57,372
I said, "Ma'am, I'm a true
cocksman, and I don't mix my seed."

480
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,540
Only time you see me with a white woman
when I'm holdin'her for the police."

481
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:03,176
That's the truth.

482
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:08,890
You shouldn't smoke.

483
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,186
It's okay. They're prescription.

484
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,891
Works better with a little whiskey.

485
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:21,661
Yeah, that's my brother's problem.
That's why he's passed out inside.

486
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:23,671
That's it!

487
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:27,573
I've had it! Can't take it anymore.

488
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,283
- You got... blood on...
- I know.

489
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:42,614
That boy you brought in,
he's, uh, shot, wasn't he?

490
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:44,625
Yeah.

491
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:48,288
He's dead, huh?

492
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:50,332
Yes.

493
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,528
I think this place stinks.

494
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:58,232
- Our Lady of Misery.
- It's crazy in there.

495
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:00,241
What's the matter with that doctor...

496
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,675
who keeps mumbling and poking himself
in the eye whenever he talks to me?

497
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,213
He's working a double shift.

498
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:10,244
Well, my father's in there.
He's in a coma.

499
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,152
My mother, she's... she's going crazy.

500
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:18,091
It's like, uh, she's in a trance.

501
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,220
She should go home.

502
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,754
Yeah, well, I'd take her,
but somebody's got to stay here.

503
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:29,326
- Did you see him?
- [Mrs. Burke] It wasn't him.

504
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:31,339
You saw him?

505
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:34,672
They showed me someone. It wasn't him.
It wasn't my husband.

506
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:37,769
Mrs. Burke, they'll take
care of him. You should go home now.

507
00:33:37,846 --> 00:33:39,780
I should know my own husband.

508
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:41,782
They wouldn't let me see him.

509
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,580
Larry and I'll drop her home.
Help me get her to the ambulance.

510
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:48,089
Mom, they're gonna give you
a ride home. Come on. This way.

511
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,723
You want some coffee?

512
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:55,286
I have applesauce cake too.

513
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:58,629
- Right here. Right there.
- Oh.

514
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:00,726
Thanks.

515
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:03,431
I'll call you if anything changes.

516
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,122
[Frank Narrating] Saving
someone's life is like falling in love.

517
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,327
The best drug in the world.

518
00:34:35,804 --> 00:34:38,637
For days, sometimes weeks afterwards...

519
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:42,803
you walk the street
making infinite whatever you see.

520
00:34:44,713 --> 00:34:48,877
Once, for a few weeks,
I couldn't feel the earth.

521
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,214
Everything I touched became lighter.

522
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:55,848
Horns played in my shoes.
Flowers fell from my pockets.

523
00:34:55,924 --> 00:34:58,552
You wonder if you've become immortal...

524
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:01,790
as if you've saved
your own life as well.

525
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:04,525
God has passed through you.

526
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,796
Why deny it that for a moment there...

527
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,533
Why deny for a moment there
God was you?

528
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:21,042
Taking credit when things
go right doesn't work the other way.

529
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:26,349
When things go wrong, spreading
the blame is an essential survival tool.

530
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:30,084
"The elevator broke down."
"The boyfriend was crazy."

531
00:35:30,158 --> 00:35:33,889
"I should've called in sick."
"The tube wouldn't go in."

532
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:38,899
"The God of Hellfire"
is not a role that anyone wants to play.

533
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:43,597
[Buzzing]

534
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,207
[Buzzing Stops]

535
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:08,521
- Good morning, Captain.
- What am I gonna do with this guy?

536
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:13,692
Pierce, I just got off
the phone with Borough Command.

537
00:36:13,768 --> 00:36:17,898
Out of 12 shifts this month,
you've been late for nine, sick four.

538
00:36:17,973 --> 00:36:20,567
That includes the shift where
you came in late, you went home early.

539
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:23,406
- I'm sick. I've been telling you.
- You're sick?

540
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:25,412
You're killing me, do you know that?

541
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,177
You've got no sick time left.
I mean, I was told to terminate.

542
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:33,244
It's okay. I'll just
get my things out of my locker.

543
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:37,417
Excuse me. It's not okay. l-l-I
never fired anybody in my life, man.

544
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:40,552
I'm sorry, Captain.
Don't take it too hard.

545
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,295
[Barking]

546
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:48,928
[Laughing]
Nobody tells me to fire anybody, ever.

547
00:36:49,004 --> 00:36:52,906
I told them, "Stick it right
up your big one." Pardon me.

548
00:36:52,974 --> 00:36:56,205
I said, "You wanna fire him?
Come on over and do it yourself."

549
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:59,270
You know they won't do it.
It's up to you. You've gotta be strong.

550
00:36:59,347 --> 00:37:03,306
- Be a man.
- You think they give these to sissies?

551
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:07,185
Come on, kid. This is a weekend
of full moons. Nobody wants to work.

552
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:09,314
I mean, your partner
Larry's called in sick.

553
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:12,485
Okay, Larry Veeber. Stupid Stanley too.

554
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:16,327
Come on. I need bodies out there.
I got buses that gotta run.

555
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:18,332
I had to put Marcus on 62-Young.

556
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,563
Hey. Hey. You know he's not
supposed to work two nights in a row.

557
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:24,503
- You know what we're in for with that?
- You swore you'd fire me...

558
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:26,803
if I came in late again.

559
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:29,469
- I'll fire you tomorrow.
- [Pounds Desk]

560
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:32,638
Even better than that,
what was I thinking about?

561
00:37:32,714 --> 00:37:35,842
I could forward you
some sick time. How about a week?

562
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:39,148
A week's not gonna do it.
A week's not gonna do it.

563
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:43,884
- Your saying no, it ain't gonna do it.
- [Pounds Desk]

564
00:37:47,095 --> 00:37:49,620
You're going out with Marcus. Okay?

565
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:51,632
Duty calls you, kid.
The city needs you. Please.

566
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,635
I'll front you sick time.
I'll make it up to you. Honest to God.

567
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:58,799
Look at me.
The next time I see you, I'll fire you.

568
00:37:58,873 --> 00:38:02,809
- I can bark too.
- Pierce, you can do it all.

569
00:38:02,877 --> 00:38:05,141
I never said
I could bark better than you.

570
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:08,307
Go and help... Go and help
the people of New York. Go ahead.

571
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:11,113
Get out there and mop them up
for me. Go ahead. Do yourjob.

572
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:14,644
- Do yourjob. You're the best.
- [Woman] Put down that crack stem.

573
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:17,883
Put down that crack stem
and drop your jug of sin...

574
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,360
your high-heeled skirts
and your stock dividends...

575
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,694
your patent leather underwear,
televised suicides...

576
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:28,497
lap dancers in leotards
in delicatessens.

577
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,234
And the Lord said, "If you can find
one that isn't a sinner... just one...

578
00:38:33,308 --> 00:38:36,709
- then I will spare the city."
- Lord, mother of man.

579
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:41,181
Boy, you look like hell.
What you drinking?

580
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:44,946
Captain almost
fired me tonight. I'm on my way out.

581
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,954
- [Chuckling]
- Anytime now.

582
00:38:47,022 --> 00:38:50,150
Nobody gets fired, son. Look at me.

583
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:53,490
The most they might do
is transfer you to the Bronx.

584
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:56,894
Boy, you look like you aged about
ten years since I rode with you last.

585
00:38:56,965 --> 00:38:59,433
I ain't feeling so hot.

586
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,900
I've been seeing the ghosts.

587
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:09,765
- You mean the people we lost?
- Yeah.

588
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:12,369
If they got to go,
got to go. God bless 'em.

589
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:18,010
You ever notice people
who see shit are always crazy? Mm-hmm.

590
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:20,020
Scientific fact.

591
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:23,285
- I think the worst is over.
- Oh, no, son.

592
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,317
It can always get worse.
See, you can't change what's out there.

593
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:29,329
Only where you're coming from.

594
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:31,991
So you got to let
the good Lord... Thank you, Jesus...

595
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,399
take over in here.

596
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:37,802
[Woman] 6-2 Young.
Let's go, 6-2 Young. Answer the radio.

597
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:40,807
Marcus, it's Love.
I haven't heard her in months.

598
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:44,436
Well, no, she only works when I'm on.

599
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,276
I makes her wait. Drives her crazy.

600
00:39:47,348 --> 00:39:50,545
- You and Love went on a blind date?
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:54,019
- She hit you with a bottle?
- Why you gotta bring that up?

602
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:56,148
She loves me the way no woman ever has.

603
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:58,419
6-2 Young, I don't
have time for your games.

604
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:01,121
Now, answer me or do
I have to come out there myself?

605
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:03,494
Oh, sookie, sookie. now. Rough.

606
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:06,557
Now, see, I usually
don't do calls before my coffee...

607
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:09,831
but I think this'll
be good for you, son.

608
00:40:09,904 --> 00:40:12,464
- 6-2 Young is here, baby.
- [Laughing]

609
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,974
And I'm a take care of you.

610
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:19,742
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

611
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:21,441
Come on, white boy.

612
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:26,249
'Cause Big Daddy Marcus
is alive and on arrival, baby.

613
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:29,154
I'm not your baby, Young.
I'm not your mother either.

614
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:33,684
You're going to a cardiac arrest.
30th and 11 th, northeast corner.

615
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:36,356
It's a club. Take the back entrance.

616
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,127
All right, 10-4, sweet mama.
You feeling better, Frank?

617
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,134
- I feel worse.
- Oh, that's good, boy.

618
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:44,603
- This here is for you.
- [Siren Wailing]

619
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:56,212
I hope we're not too late from you
folks holding us up here. Excuse me.

620
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,218
Right this way.

621
00:40:58,286 --> 00:41:01,722
[Alternative Rock]

622
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:23,142
Get the hell out of my way.

623
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:25,145
Okay, what happened?

624
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:28,671
- Tell me he's gonna be all right.
- No, he dead.

625
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,548
- We just signed our first record deal.
- Look, he dead, son.

626
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,644
Ain't nothing we can
do about it. Come on, Frank. That's it.

627
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:36,918
- [Woman] What do you mean he's dead?
- [Quietly] He's not dead.

628
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:39,551
It's a heroin overdose.
Let's break out the Narcan.

629
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:44,564
He's dead, unless you folks wanna stop
bullshitting me and tell it straight.

630
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:47,692
Then, the good Lord willing,
we'll try and bring him back.

631
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,904
He broke up with his old lady.

632
00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:53,770
- We were just seeing other people.
- Oh, she broke his heart.

633
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:57,073
- Shut up, asshole! Nobody asked you!
- Was I talking to you?

634
00:41:57,145 --> 00:41:59,547
Dick, shut up!

635
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,443
I'm still waiting
and this young man here is still dead.

636
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:05,281
- You wanna leave here in a body bag?
- You'll end up like him, dick!

637
00:42:05,352 --> 00:42:09,618
- Shut up!
- He's been snorting that Red Death.

638
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:12,921
It's been going on for,
like, four days now.

639
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:18,090
I rebuke the spirit of drugs
in the name of Jesus. What's his name?

640
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:20,258
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What you mean I.B. Bangin'?

641
00:42:20,334 --> 00:42:22,529
- I.B. Bangin'.
- What kind of name is I.B. Bangin'?

642
00:42:22,603 --> 00:42:24,628
- I don't know his real name.
- It's Frederick Smith.

643
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:26,639
- [Marcus] Okay, Freddy...
- It's Frederick.

644
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:30,074
Okay, I.B. Bangin', we're
gonna bring you back from the dead.

645
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:33,272
Now, I want everybody here to
grab the hand of the person next to you.

646
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:38,412
Come on now. We ain't got much time.

647
00:42:38,485 --> 00:42:40,885
And look up towards the heavens.

648
00:42:40,955 --> 00:42:45,016
Dear Lord, here I am again...

649
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:49,392
asking one more chance for a sinner.

650
00:42:49,463 --> 00:42:54,230
Please, Lord, bring back
I.B. Bangin', Lord.

651
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:58,101
You have the power, Jesus.
You have the might.

652
00:42:58,172 --> 00:43:02,131
You have the super light
to spare this worthless man.

653
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:06,244
- My God! Frederick!
- Rise up, I.B. Bangin'...

654
00:43:06,313 --> 00:43:08,975
and start your life anew!

655
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:10,983
Oh, thank you, Lord.

656
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:14,145
- What happened?
- You fucking died, you stupid bastard.

657
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:16,815
- I warned you.
- Damn, you guys are good.

658
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,520
The first step is Love.
The second is Mercy.

659
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:30,631
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.

660
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:33,730
Burke? You're not gonna believe it.
He's showing cognitive signs.

661
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:37,334
It started with spontaneous respiration.
Now he's fighting to pull out the tube.

662
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:40,505
He had to be sedated. He's in CAT scan.
There's no room in I.C.U.

663
00:43:40,581 --> 00:43:42,515
- What do you think?
- Who knows?

664
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:46,485
It's lower brain stem activity at this
point. The heart refuses to stabilize.

665
00:43:46,553 --> 00:43:50,546
You know, he coded
11 times since he got here.

666
00:43:50,624 --> 00:43:52,558
But the guy's a fighter.

667
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:54,594
Every time the Valium wears off,
he starts yanking on the restraints.

668
00:43:54,662 --> 00:43:56,527
The family know?

669
00:43:56,597 --> 00:43:58,861
I wanted to bring them in
to see if he'd respond to voices.

670
00:43:58,932 --> 00:44:00,866
But there was no one
in the waiting room.

671
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:02,868
This guy's daughter
was in my face all night.

672
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:04,870
Finally, I got something
positive to tell her, she's gone.

673
00:44:04,938 --> 00:44:08,840
You put poison in your veins,
and now that you're breathing again...

674
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:13,005
you can't wait to say "Thank you,"
and get back out to poison shopping.

675
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,810
Well, since we saved your life,
could you do us a favor...

676
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:17,817
and stop breathing
in another city next time?

677
00:44:17,885 --> 00:44:19,819
I ever tell you about
that time years ago...

678
00:44:19,887 --> 00:44:23,414
I was on this ledge uptown
trying to pull this damn psycho inside?

679
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,483
The guy jumped and you almost fell?
No, you never told me that story.

680
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:29,495
[Chuckling] No, you never listened.

681
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:34,762
I put everything I had into saving
this dumb-ass, low-life suicidal...

682
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:38,362
that when he went down,
it was like I wanted to go with him.

683
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:40,373
That happened once in Ireland.

684
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:44,605
This girl jumped off the cliffs
of Moher and the wind blew her back up.

685
00:44:44,678 --> 00:44:48,546
- The wind blew her back up?
- Yeah, the wind.

686
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:51,209
- No, that was Jesus, son.
- It was also the wind.

687
00:44:51,285 --> 00:44:53,651
The wind, my black ass. That was Jesus.

688
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:55,586
Don't tell me about the Good Book.

689
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:58,454
I'll preach heaven and beat the hell
out of you. Don't tell me that now.

690
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:00,516
I was going, son.

691
00:45:00,594 --> 00:45:05,463
But if someone up on high... Thank you,
Jesus... hadn't have pulled me in...

692
00:45:05,532 --> 00:45:07,625
Would you turn left here?
I wanna make a stop.

693
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:13,401
The point is, everybody go through
a stretch where folks gonna die on you.

694
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:15,772
Just don't meditate on it.

695
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:20,872
I say open up the window

696
00:45:20,948 --> 00:45:23,746
I'll be right back.

697
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:26,285
And let me breathe

698
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:32,349
I say open the window

699
00:45:35,462 --> 00:45:39,899
- And let me breathe
- It's Frank Pierce from the ambulance.

700
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,162
I brought your father into the hospital.

701
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:45,296
- I just learned some news.
- [Mary] I'll be right down.

702
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:48,703
I cried for ya

703
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:53,446
He's better, isn't he?

704
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:55,948
Well, the doctor says
he's showing some movement.

705
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:59,577
It's still early. It might mean nothing,
but I thought you'd wanna know.

706
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:04,352
- I cried for ya
- I sensed it when I heard your voice.

707
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:08,920
You-You look so different.

708
00:46:08,996 --> 00:46:11,464
Oh. [Laughing] It's awful, isn't it?

709
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:14,126
It's like Night
of the Living Cheerleaders.

710
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:17,637
No, I think it looks good.

711
00:46:17,704 --> 00:46:21,333
I was going nuts in that waiting room.
I came back to check on my mom.

712
00:46:21,408 --> 00:46:24,707
- How is she?
- She's sleeping.

713
00:46:24,778 --> 00:46:27,770
Sleeping.

714
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:35,616
I was just gonna get some food.
Pizza. I thought maybe we...

715
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:39,750
You can't kill my father that easy.
He's a real fighter, like with me.

716
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:42,694
He hasn't talked to me
in three years. But it's okay.

717
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:45,527
Sometimes you just have
to put things behind you.

718
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,625
I gotta be getting back. Hey. Hey!

719
00:46:48,702 --> 00:46:52,604
It'll be tough to get a taxi here.
We can give you a ride if you like.

720
00:46:52,673 --> 00:46:54,607
Okay.

721
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,411
Who that?

722
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:01,970
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest
I brought in last night.

723
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:05,917
I told her we'd give her a ride back.
Her father's showing signs of improving.

724
00:47:05,986 --> 00:47:10,423
Oh, Frank, you got it bad, son.
So much worse than what I thought.

725
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:13,584
- We gotta get something to eat.
- God, help us. He's hungry.

726
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:19,022
These are the days

727
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:22,933
You might fill with laughter

728
00:47:23,003 --> 00:47:25,972
Until you beg

729
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,602
These days you might feel
a shaft of light

730
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:36,115
Make its way across your face

731
00:47:36,183 --> 00:47:38,378
And when you do

732
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:41,421
You'll know how it was meant to be

733
00:47:41,488 --> 00:47:45,254
See the signs know their meaning

734
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:47,293
It's true

735
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:50,228
You'll know how it was meant to be

736
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:53,892
Hear the signs
and know they're speaking

737
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:55,958
To you

738
00:47:56,036 --> 00:47:58,027
To you

739
00:48:02,576 --> 00:48:04,942
Dad?

740
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:07,947
Can you hear me?

741
00:48:08,015 --> 00:48:09,983
It's Mary.

742
00:48:13,687 --> 00:48:16,986
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me, Dad.

I was gonna be a nun...

to a convent when I was 13.

You're going to 370 West 98th Street.

897
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:49,590
17-year-old female,
cardiac arrest. No further information.

898
00:56:49,669 --> 00:56:53,435
- 10-4, hon.
- Why is everything a cardiac arrest?

899
00:56:53,506 --> 00:56:58,273
What happened to chest pain,
difficulty breathing, fractured hands?

900
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:00,869
Come on, people!

901
00:57:02,348 --> 00:57:04,475
Lord Jesus,
help me get through the night.

902

- [Siren Wailing]
- I can't get over it

903
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,618
It's so wide I can't get around it

904
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:14,455
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

905
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:17,325
I hate this block.
Nothin' but crackheads.

906
00:57:17,396 --> 00:57:19,830
- I don't wanna go without the police.
- I'm goin'.

907
00:57:19,899 --> 00:57:21,833
It's easier than waitin'.

908
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:27,105
E.M.S.!

909
00:57:27,173 --> 00:57:30,404
- Ambulance!
- Oh, Jesus. My bad back.

910
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:34,013
My feet hurt. Damn crackheads.

911
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:37,877
- E.M.S.!
- Hello? E.M.S.

912
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:47,992
Hello?

913
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:54,930
Please, hurry.

914
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:59,630
Please hurry. Come this way, please.

915
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:03,163

[Both Speaking Spanish]

917
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:12,509
My, oh, my, a fat crackhead!
Now, that's a first.

918
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:17,681

919
00:58:17,756 --> 00:58:21,214
- I mean, she's pregnant.
- No, that's impossible. We're virgins.

920
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:24,319
Are you pregnant?
Estas embarazada?
