1
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,160
 Good evening, gentlemen.
 Can I check your hats, please?

2
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,680
 Gentlemen?

3
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,560
 Gentlemen.

4
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,880
 Got caught like a bear trap.

5
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,360
 You wanna play or do you wanna pay?
 I got a great girl.

6
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,240
 Jack Flynn?

7
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,120
 Here you go, buddy.
 Buy yourself a good time.

8
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,200
 - They'll let anybody in here.
 - Mr. Flynn, I'm Maxwell Hoover.

9
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,600
 I'm with the Los Angeles
 Police Department.

10
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
 That means I get change back.

11
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,600
 Are you still here?

12
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,440
 What is it gonna cost me?

13
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
 I came here to deliver a message.

14
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,200
 Your presence is required
 back in Chicago.

15
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,680
 It's cold in Chicago,
 which is why I came out here.

16
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,880
 Is Mr. Flynn being charged
 with a crime?

17
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
 What are you, his lawyer?

18
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,360
 No, but I'm represented by a good one.

19
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
 What's my friend being charged with?

20
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
 He did things in Chicago.

21
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
 I beat all that, pal.
 I beat those indictments.

22
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,280
 Jimmy, hit him in the nuts!

23
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
 Let's go.
 Get him outta here.

24
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,760
 You guys are making a big mistake.

25
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,040
 Where are we going?

26
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,480
 The airport.

27
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,360
 You're going to the airport, Jack.

28
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,240
 You gotta get back to Chicago
 as soon as possible.

29
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
 This ain't the way to the airport.

30
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,520
 This is it.

31
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,360
 Yeah. This is it.

32
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,800
 This is what?

33
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,480
 This is Mulholland Falls, Jack.

34
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,360
 Mulholland Falls?

35
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,240
 It's kinda like Niagara Falls.

36
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,760
 Come on!
 There ain't no falls in L.A.

37
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,880
 You guys can't do this.
 This is America.

38
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,600
 This isn't America, Jack.

39
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,520
 This is L.A.

40
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
 I thought we weren't
 gonna do this anymore.

41
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,680
 - Do what?
 - This.

42
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,560
 Come on, let's go.

43
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,200
 Jack?

44
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
 Maybe he's dead.

45
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,520
 He's not dead,
 he's looking right at us.

46
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,280
 Jack, are you dead?

47
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,640
 He's alive.

48
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,520
 Now, Jack, we don't have
 organized crime in L.A.,

49
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,560
 and frankly,
 we don't want organized crime.

50
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,000
 So here's what I want you to do.

51
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,480
 I want you to look around...

52
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,760
 ...and remember this...

53
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,640
 because this will always be
 your way back to Chicago.

54
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
 Mulholland Falls.

55
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,840
 Lee.

56
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,720
 Now, that's a thought.

57
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
 - Hey, Max.
 - Kate.

58
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,760
 - Lili.
 - Hi.

59
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,640
 We were just discussing husbands.

60
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,880
 I'm trying to find a new one for Lili.

61
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,480
 - Do you know any?
 - Jeez, Lili.

62
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
 Only guys I know
 are cops and bad guys.

63
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,960
 Thanks, Pete.

64
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,840
 And I don't know
 if I can recommend either one.

65
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,960
 How about Eddie Hall?

66
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,360
 - Eddie Hall?
 - Yeah.

67
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,440
 Eddie Hall. No.

68
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,480
 He's been married five times.

69
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,040
 - You see what I mean?
 - Yeah.

70
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,920
 I'm sorry I was late, Kate, but we had
 a little accident up in the hills.

71
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,120
 No, no, no, Kate.

72
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,560
 You know I got two flat feet.

73
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,400
 Come on.

74
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,280
 Excuse us, Lili.

75
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,240
 - I love you.
 - I love you, too.

76
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
 - You the foreman?
 - Yeah.

77
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
 Where are we out here?
 What is this?

78
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
 We're in a new housing subdivision.

79
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,560
 You ever think about who those people
 are that are gonna live way out here?

80
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,600
 No.

81
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,400
 Me, neither.

82
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,280
 All right, guys,
 I'll take it from here.

83
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,080
 - No pictures till I tell ya.
 - Whatever you say.

84
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,760
 Hey, Doc.

85
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,520
 Max, I should've stayed in bed.

86
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,480
 Are you in charge of this operation?

87
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,080
 Yeah, this part I am.

88
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,000
 You got any heavy equipment
 around here

89
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
 that could press a woman
 into the ground like that?

90
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,600
 A big roller maybe.

91
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
 Seems like that would've
 chewed her up more.

92
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,960
 - Is this the way you found her?
 - Yeah. We didn't touch it.

93
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,840
 Yeah, she was just like this.

94
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,720
 Why don't you step over there,
 an officer will take your full statement.

95
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,160
 Jesus, Milt.

96
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,000
 There's nothing to hold on to.

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,880
 Okay, roll her over
 and see what she looks like.

98
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,840
 Jesus.

99
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,240
 - You okay, Max?
 - Yeah.

100
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,400
 Step aside, boys.
 Let me get a couple.

101
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,000
 Jeez, what a mess.

102
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,760
 - Check under her fingernails.
 - Okay.

103
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,080
 How'd she die?

104
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,960
 It's like she jumped off a cliff.

105
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,360
 There's no cliff out there.

106
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,880
 Somebody moved her?

107
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
 She wasn't moved.

108
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,480
 She died just where you found her.

109
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,000
 Doc, did you see this?

110
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,680
 What is it?

111
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,560
 Looks like glass.

112
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 ''A Farewell to Arms.''

113
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,880
 ''By Ernest Hemingway.''

114
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,040
 You know the way this guy writes,
 he never talked to a woman in his life.

115
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
 When did you ever read Hemingway?

116
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,880
 He thinks they all
 wanna be called ''my darlin'.''

117
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
 And what they really want is?

118
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,720
 What they really want is a man...

119
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
 ...that'll listen to their stomachs.

120
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,280
 Max, don't drool on me.

121
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,160
 - Come on.
 - What's the matter?

122
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,280
 I'm sorry.

123
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,680
 What's wrong?

124
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,840
 Tell me.

125
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,720
 We found a dead girl in the Valley.

126
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,640
 She was broken into 30 pieces.

127
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,640
 Couldn't even pick her up.

128
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,120
 Who is she?

129
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
 Nobody.

130
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,400
 Just a girl.

131
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,400
 Just a girl.

132
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,680
 I'm sorry, Kate.

133
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,960
 Can you believe that?
 The D.A. won't indict Kroyle.

134
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560
 What's wrong with this country?

135
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,440
 A guy chops up his parents with an axe
 and doesn't get the gas chamber?

136
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,880
 How can you plea bargain
 something like that?

137
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,640
 His fingerprints are
 all over the murder weapon.

138
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,240
 That places him
 at the scene of the crime.

139
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,400
 They won't indict.
 It doesn't make any difference.

140
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,280
 I knew that D.A. when he was
 a bagman for Jack Draga.

141
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,760
 No kiddin'. How'd he become
 a D.A. then, for Christ' sake?

142
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,280
 D.A.'s an elected office.

143
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,160
 Any scumbag can get in
 if they got enough votes.

144
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,920
 Ellery, how come
 you got a hot dog in your mouth

145
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,600
 while you're threading a projector?

146
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,480
 Why do you eat while you're working?
 Why do you eat all the time?

147
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,840
 It's all psychological, Max.
 I eat so I don't think about food.

148
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 So you eat
 so you don't think about food?

149
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
 Yeah.

150
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
 Ellery, I don't wanna
 butt into your business,

151
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,440
 but this psychiatrist,
 the guy you're going to,

152
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,560
 I think he's in worse shape
 than you are.

153
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,440
 She, Max.
 It's a woman.

154
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,840
 Dammit, I can't get
 my finger in there! It won't fit!

155
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,680
 Try your dick.

156
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,080
 Esther, please.

157
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,960
 Here, try this.

158
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,360
 So you're going to her about food?

159
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,840
 Yeah.

160
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,720
 I thought you were going to her
 about the other thing.

161
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,040
 - My temper?
 - Yeah.

162
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,800
 It's all related, Max.

163
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
 The eating and the anger,
 they come from the same place.

164
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,240
 The food calms me down.

165
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,600
 Esther, don't you have
 something better to do?

166
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
 No. Not better than this.

167
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
 All right.

168
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,320
 - Ready?
 - Yeah. Turn it on.

169
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,400
 What is this,
 somebody's summer vacation?

170
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
 That's the girl we found
 in the Valley, Max.

171
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,440
 Max, I gotta talk to you about this D.A.

172
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,520
 He's a prick. Max?

173
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,200
 I have a claim ticket.
 I need to pick up some merchandise.

174
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,880
 Ma'am, you have to take that
 down to ground floor.

175
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
 - Thank you.
 - Property Division.

176
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,760
 Coolidge, do me a favor.

177
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
 You go get yourself something to eat.

178
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,240
 Go back to your desk.

179
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,480
 Max, if something is wrong...

180
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,360
 I mean, maybe it's best to talk it out,
 you know, and get it out in the open,

181
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,520
 if it's anything like that.

182
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
 No, nothing like that.

183
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,080
 But any problem could be solved, Max.

184
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,960
 All you have to do is break it down
 into parts, you see?

185
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,880
 It's just simple, it's right into parts--
 my psychiatrist told me--

186
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
 and you deal
 with each part individually.

187
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,160
 One part, and then you go
 to the next part.

188
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
 You just gotta break it down,
 but the first--

189
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,200
 Ellery.

190
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,080
 Do me that favor.

191
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,000
 Just do it.

192
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
 Hoover!

193
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,080
 You alone?

194
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,960
 Yeah.

195
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
 - I need protection.
 - From what?

196
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,400
 You look at the film I sent you?

197
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
 You know who the guy in it is?

198
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,640
 I don't even knowwho you are.

199
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,880
 I'm Jimmy Fields.

200
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
 Look, that guy in the movie,
 he killed her!

201
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,080
 Killed who?

202
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,600
 Spare me the crap,
 I don't have time for it!

203
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,720
 A mutual friend is dead,
 they killed her,

204
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,600
 and I'm going out the same way
 unless I can get some help.

205
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,800
 How do you know she's dead?

206
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,800
 Because she would've
 called me otherwise.

207
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,680
 Because she always called me,
 always, always.

208
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,920
 Because I was her best friend.

209
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
 That means I didn't fuck her.

210
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,640
 What did you do with her,
 share makeup tips?

211
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,720
 Do I make you nervous, Lieutenant?

212
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,520
 When was the last time you saw her?

213
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
 Saturday.

214
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,760
 In Vegas.

215
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
 She dropped my camera off
 Saturday morning,

216
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
 said she'd meet me back in L.A.,

217
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,320
 that her and the general
 were gonna go for a little ride.

218
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
 What general?

219
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
 Cops.

220
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,280
 Does Thomas Timms ring a bell?

221
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,160
 You go look it up.

222
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,440
 How many more films are there?

223
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,640
 Couple.

224
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,160
 Did she know?

225
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,320
 Maybe.

226
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,160
 I asked you a question.

227
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,040
 Did she know
 you were taking movies?

228
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,520
 No.

229
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,400
 I'd put that gun away.

230
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,040
 Help me, Hoover.
 You're supposed to be a cop!

231
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,560
 I thought you couldn't
 turn anybody down.

232
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,600
 Is that was she said?

233
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,600
 That's what she said.

234
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,120
 She was wrong.

235
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,160
 I had him by the neck
 when he swore at me.

236
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
 Here he comes.

237
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,360
 Where are we going, Max?

238
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,680
 Better not show up
 to the courtroom late!

239
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,560
 I got something to take care of.
 I'll be back later.

240
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,920
 We gotta ask you a question.

241
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,800
 The dead girl--she's the same one
 that's in the movie, isn't she?

242
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,240
 Coolidge tell you that?

243
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,640
 l've been worried, Max.

244
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,520
 Worried? You're worried?
 What the hell you worried about?

245
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,640
 We're partners here.

246
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,520
 Tell us, was something going on
 between you and that dead girl?

247
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,800
 Look, guys, I want you to cut me
 a little slack on this one.

248
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
 Just let me do what I gotta do.

249
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,520
 I thought you had
 grand jury testimony today.

250
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,480
 To hell with the grand jury, Max.

251
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,360
 So where are we going?

252
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,560
 You know, l've been thinking, why is it
 we always sit in the same places?

253
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,320
 And why is it you're always
 the one that drives, Max?

254
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,440
 I guess it's 'cause I got the keys.

255
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,320
 Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
 Why is it you always have the keys?

256
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
 There's reasons for everything, right?

257
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,600
 Ellery, I would never attempt to criticize

258
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,440
 the inner workings of the human mind.

259
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,320
 Are you still seeing that psychiatrist?

260
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
 There's nothing wrong
 with my psychiatrist.

261
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,920
 We just wanna know how much longer.

262
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,640
 I don't know, it's open-ended.

263
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,520
 Oh, Jesus, God.

264
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,720
 Why is it you have the keys, Max?

265
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,200
 - Max.
 - Yeah.

266
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,080
 Let Ellery drive.

267
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,040
 Are you happy, Coolidge?

268
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,560
 Yup.

269
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,440
 Take it out of low.

270
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,960
 Oh, jeez!

271
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,360
 Sorry, Max.

272
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
 That's why he usually has the keys.

273
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,040
 Relyea, go talk to the manager,
 tell him we're going through a room.

274
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
 Right.

275
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,680
 Manager says some guy in 23,
 a Jimmy Fields, is her best friend.

276
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
 Hasn't seen either one of them
 in over a week.

277
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,920
 He's not very neat, is he?

278
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,240
 Son of a bitch!

279
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
 Son of a bitch!

280
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,880
 - You all right, Max?
 - Yeah.

281
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,400
 For a minute there,
 I just couldn't breathe.

282
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,080
 I couldn't stay in there.

283
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,320
 - Want a cigarette?
 - Yeah.

284
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,880
 How long were you seeing her?

285
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,320
 Six months.

286
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,280
 Every chance I got.

287
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,840
 Here?

288
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,080
 Yeah, here.

289
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,480
 Jesus Christ.

290
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,360
 That guy's got film on you
 and everything, doesn't he?

291
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,280
 You remember Kenny Kamins?

292
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,960
 - Can I help you, gentlemen?
 - We're looking for Kenny Kamins.

293
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
 - Have you seen him?
 - Never heard of him.

294
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,400
 He never heard of him.

295
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,280
 You believe that, fellas?

296
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,240
 What are you guys doing here?
 You got a fucking warrant?

297
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,400
 You sound like you're from New York.

298
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,280
 - So what?
 - I'm from Jersey.

299
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,560
 What's going on?
 What do you think you're doing, Kenny?

300
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,400
 Relax, Allison.
 Jenny and I were just having a party.

301
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,800
 Go do something useful.
 Go powder your nose.

302
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,840
 You're sick, Kenny.
 This is sick!

303
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
 I'm not gonna let you do this to her.
 She's a child.

304
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,360
 So were you once, doll.

305
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,240
 Look at what a woman you became.

306
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,160
 No, Kenny.

307
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,040
 Are you nuts?

308
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,800
 Nice one.
 That was a good shot.

309
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,640
 Come here.

310
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,520
 You pull that shit again,
 and I'm gonna break your little neck.

311
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,880
 All right?

312
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,760
 Hello, Kenny.

313
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,280
 This is a private party, Hoover.

314
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,160
 - You got a warrant?
 - I got this.

315
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,280
 Remember this, Kenny?

316
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,280
 Kenny, Kenny,
 what are you doing?

317
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,560
 - Get her out of here.
 - Let's go.

318
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,440
 You broke my fingers!

319
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,440
 What do you say, Kenny,
 we have a little party?

320
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,400
 I don't do that stuff.

321
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,960
 - You don't wanna see this.
 - Yes, I do.

322
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,280
 Jesus Christ, Allison, call the cops!

323
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,160
 I am the cops, Kenny.

324
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,160
 Inventive way of dispensing justice.

325
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,160
 It's an integral part of the job.

326
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,920
 You were more effective than I was.

327
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,240
 So, who are you?

328
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,640
 You won't find out by killing me.

329
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,960
 Why did you fall for her, Max?

330
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,040
 What did Katherine say?
 You told her, didn't you?

331
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,640
 - The guy with the camera, he's a fruit?
 - Right.

332
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,840
 Not shaking you down, is he?

333
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,600
 Could be, he's running scared.

334
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,400
 Maybe we should pay him a visit.

335
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,280
 I thought we weren't gonna
 do that anymore. We agreed.

336
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,920
 Did you guys ever hear
 of a general named Thomas Timms?

337
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,400
 Yeah.

338
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,800
 He's one of the inventors
 of the A-bomb.

339
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,680
 They made him Chairman
 of the Atomic Energy Commission.

340
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,040
 I got seven minutes of film
 with him with Allison.

341
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,360
 You got trouble.

342
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,240
 Let's talk to the fruit.

343
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,240
 All right, let's go over it again.

344
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
 What did she say?

345
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,320
 She said that she was going
 for a ride with Timms.

346
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
 Out to where they test those things.

347
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,080
 And she wasn't scared?

348
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,040
 No, she wasn't scared.
 She was never scared.

349
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,760
 Except of being alone.

350
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,640
 Come on, Jimmy, sit down.

351
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,120
 What'd you make the films for, Jimmy?

352
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,760
 What'd you make the films for?

353
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,720
 Why were you in it?

354
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,600
 What was it? Blackmail?

355
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,000
 I thought about that.

356
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,000
 You know, for a rainy--

357
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,480
 Why'd you make 'em?

358
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,280
 - That was nice.
 - What's wrong with Max?

359
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,040
 - I don't know.
 - What's the matter with him?

360
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,920
 Why'd you make 'em, Jimmy?

361
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,920
 Because it made me feel a part of it.

362
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,000
 You know, watch the boys
 get impassioned.

363
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,640
 You made films of me, didn't you?

364
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,960
 Yes, I did.

365
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,640
 Where are those films?

366
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,520
 That's the question, isn't it?

367
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,840
 When she didn't show up,
 I went back to my apartment,

368
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,400
 but the place was torn apart.

369
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,680
 They'd taken them all.

370
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,440
 Except for the one I sent you.

371
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,320
 That was still at the lab.

372
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,720
 You know, Jimmy,
 none of that proves Timms' guilt.

373
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,440
 What, do you need a roadmap?

374
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,320
 Timms knew about the film.
 He's the last to see her alive.

375
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,800
 She's dead--
 they killed her up there.

376
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,240
 She didn't die in the desert,
 she died here.

377
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,840
 Right outside of L.A.

378
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,720
 You told me yourself that Allison
 didn't know about the films,

379
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,120
 so Timms couldn't have
 known about it either.

380
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
 Why would a guy kill his girl

381
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,520
 over a film he didn't even know existed?

382
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,960
 You were the last to see her alive.

383
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,840
 How do I know you didn't kill her?

384
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,440
 Because I loved her
 and she was my best friend.

385
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,200
 She nearly died when you left,
 did you know that?

386
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,000
 She loved you,
 and you just used her.

387
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,520
 How does that feel?

388
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,400
 You know, you sit there
 like you're protecting the innocent.

389
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,800
 All you really do
 is just beat up on the weak

390
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,680
 and disregard or destroy anybody
 or anything that stands in the way

391
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,440
 of you and your pathetic little sense
 of right or wrong or justice and power.

392
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,760
 If anybody is responsible
 for Allison's death...

393
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,080
 ...it's you.

394
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,880
 You son of a bitch!

395
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,160
 Shit! Come on, Eddie.

396
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,040
 Come on, he's gonna kill me!

397
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,320
 Come on!

398
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
 - Get him out of here!
 - It ain't worth it.

399
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,200
 You don't realize--
 Just get him out of here!

400
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,040
 Come on, Fields, let's go.
 Move it.

401
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,360
 Max, everybody has weak moments.

402
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
 You gotta get it out,
 you gotta tell Kathy.

403
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,480
 Shut up!

404
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,080
 Shut the hell up!

405
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,800
 Jesus Christ, is that what
 your psychiatrist told you?

406
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,280
 Let me tell you how it goes, Ellery.

407
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,160
 You meet somebody--
 Maybe they're a little off center,

408
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,240
 but they tell you the truth.

409
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,800
 And you like them for that,

410
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,400
 and one thing leads to another,
 and you end up in bed.

411
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,120
 - Now, that's weak.
 - Max--

412
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,880
 But, now, listen to me.
 Nobody gets hurt.

413
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,760
 You go home, and you see your wife,
 and you're feeling bad.

414
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,880
 You wanna unload it,
 you wanna get it off your chest.

415
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,920
 So you tell her, and now she's hurt.

416
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,200
 Now, that's weak, too, Ellery.

417
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,240
 But it's also cruel.

418
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,120
 It's just goddamn cruel.

419
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,360
 Here's something for you.

420
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,240
 Here's something that doesn't
 cost you 25 bucks an hour.

421
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,920
 You carry your own water, Ellery.

422
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,920
 You understand?

423
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,800
 Carry your own water.

424
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,200
 Max, I was just trying to help.
 I'm sorry.

425
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,120
 No, forget it.

426
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,000
 It's all right.

427
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,440
 We're still partners, right?

428
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,400
 Yeah. Partners.

429
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,320
 Thanks, Ell.

430
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,200
 Go help them, will you?

431
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,560
 - You okay, Max?
 - Yeah.

432
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,400
 Come here.

433
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,520
 I don't understand how
 anybody can live at the beach.

434
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,800
 Those waves crashing
 and flopping all the time...

435
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,880
 ...drive me crazy.

436
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,480
 I'm with you, Eddie. I like the sound
 of traffic when I'm sleeping.

437
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,360
 I find it very peaceful.

438
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,400
 Most people do.

439
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,280
 I guess cops are just different.

440
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,840
 Don't push your luck there, Fields.

441
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,400
 The only reason we're here
 is because of Max.

442
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,240
 If I had it my way,

443
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,640
 I'd rather dump you out
 of a speeding car.

444
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,520
 See if you'd bounce around a little.

445
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,040
 Hey, Earl!

446
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
 How's that chili comin'?

447
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,320
 It's done.

448
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,200
 As my Aunt Mabel used to say,
 presentation is everything.

449
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,680
 I think you and Coolidge
 ought to open up an automat.

450
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,600
 The look is connected
 to the way it tastes.

451
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,080
 Stay down!

452
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,720
 It stopped.

453
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,800
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.

454
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,120
 Where's Fields?

455
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,000
 - I'll get him back.
 - Right.

456
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,840
 Fields!

457
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,320
 Shit!

458
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,240
 That's it.

459
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

460
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,640
 You see 'em take Fields?

461
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,520
 I couldn't see shit, Max.

462
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,240
 They shot the hell out of this place.

463
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,120
 Must've had a heavy machine gun.

464
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,240
 Fruitcake disappeared.

465
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,480
 Lieutenant?
 They want you down at the beach.

466
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,800
 We see around the head there...

467
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,040
 - Jesus Christ.
 - How'd they kill him, Doc?

468
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,800
 What can I tell you?
 They stuck a gun in his mouth

469
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,920
 and blew the back of his head off.

470
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
 An execution?

471
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,760
 Not until they asked him
 some questions first.

472
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,800
 Contusions, abrasions,
 ecchymosis around the neck.

473
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,120
 Right.

474
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,720
 Come on, I wanna
 show you guys something.

475
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,200
 We took these x-rays of Allison Pond.

476
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,080
 Look what happened.

477
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,560
 Yeah, this foot's got a heel.

478
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,720
 This one doesn't.
 Why is it all blurry?

479
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,080
 Gamma rays fog the film.

480
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,960
 That glass in her foot, it's radioactive.

481
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,920
 Yes, sir?

482
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
 LAPD.
 I'm here to see General Timms.

483
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,040
 Hey, give me that.

484
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,320
 Five to one we don't get in.

485
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,640
 This is the Army.
 I say we try the back way.

486
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,280
 Five to one--l take those odds.

487
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,760
 - You'll take it?
 - Yeah.

488
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,800
 Five to one?

489
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,680
 - Here's my five.
 - Here, you hold the money.

490
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,520
 Make sure he knows that.

491
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,240
 Sorry, sir.
 No civilian admittance, no exceptions.

492
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,520
 - Did you talk to General Timms?
 - The General's unavailable, sir.

493
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,240
 Did you tell him it was police business?

494
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,120
 Yes, sir. They said no
 civilian admittance, no exceptions.

495
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,600
 You lose, Coolidge.

496
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,480
 You know, you could've
 talked to him a little more, Max.

497
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,520
 You owe me a buck.

498
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,200
 Wait, wait, wait.

499
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,520
 Amateur hour.

500
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,400
 Seen too many movies, Relyea.

501
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,200
 Shit.

502
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,080
 - Come on, it's hot.
 - I'll get it, I'll get it.

503
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,600
 Let me try.

504
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,480
 All right.

505
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,920
 You know, when I was a kid, I thought
 everybody in Hollywood had a horse.

506
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,640
 Because every movie I saw
 was a cowboy movie.

507
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,040
 You remember those movies, right?

508
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,800
 They would come galloping into town,

509
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,680
 the cowboys would get off the horse,
 dust all over the place.

510
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,640
 They get the reins
 and wrap it around the railing

511
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,960
 once, twice, three times,
 keep on wrapping it,

512
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,080
 but Gene Autry?
 Let me tell you something.

513
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,920
 Gene Autry would come into town,
 jump off the horse,

514
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,800
 and carefully wrap the reins
 around once, just once.

515
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,800
 Then he would go inside
 and see the sheriff.

516
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,760
 Boy, did I worry
 about that horse getting away.

517
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,600
 I did.

518
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,320
 What the hell is that?

519
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,960
 This place is weird.

520
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,600
 Jesus, what a big hole.

521
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,480
 We just dropped
 the damn thing right here?

522
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,360
 Yup. That's what happens
 when they set one off at ground level.

523
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,840
 What happened to all the dirt?

524
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,720
 Vaporized, along with everything else.

525
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,840
 We got company.

526
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,080
 - Guess it's time to go, huh?
 - Yeah.

527
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,160
 Step on it.

528
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,400
 Put your hands in the air
 or you will be shot!

529
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,720
 They're clean, sir.

530
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,840
 You men are in violation of federal law.

531
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,040
 I could have you all shot.

532
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,920
 Do you have some identification?

533
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,280
 There you go.

534
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,360
 Put your hands down, gentlemen.

535
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,040
 ''Lieutenant Hoover.''

536
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,560
 Los Angeles Police Department.

537
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,160
 We're investigating a homicide, sir.

538
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,040
 You're way out
 of your jurisdiction, Lieutenant.

539
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,880
 I'm going to assume
 that you are aware of the penalties

540
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,760
 for trespassing
 a federally restricted area.

541
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,720
 And for destruction
 of government property.

542
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,240
 We go where the case takes us.

543
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,120
 Not if it takes you here you don't.

544
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,680
 Out here it's military law.

545
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,560
 And I'm in charge of enforcing it.

546
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,920
 Captain?

547
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,440
 Escort these gentlemen back
 to the base and lock them up.

548
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,320
 - Yes, sir.
 - Colonel, sir?

549
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,080
 Yes, sir.

550
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,960
 On the perimeter, sir,
 but they'd violated security--

551
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,120
 I don't think that's a good idea, sir.

552
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,000
 Well, I don't think that's a good idea, sir.

553
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,320
 Yes, sir.

554
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,200
 Yes, sir.

555
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,320
 Put that one in the jeep.

556
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,840
 The rest of them can wait at the base.

557
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,640
 - Sergeant!
 - Miller, Resnick!

558
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,280
 - Sergeant?
 - Yes, sir.

559
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,800
 If I see this vehicle
 in a restricted area again,

560
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,680
 I'll burn it...and everyone in it.

561
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,320
 Lieutenant.

562
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,800
 Wait here.

563
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,920
 Hoover, Truman...

564
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,000
 Is that the general?

565
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,600
 All bombs.

566
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,560
 - What are those?
 - Ships.

567
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,040
 Lieutenant Hoover,
 I'm General Timms.

568
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,920
 What can I do for the Los Angeles
 Police Department today?

569
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,120
 I came to talk about Allison Pond.

570
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,000
 Yes, I know.
 Colonel Fitzgerald informed me.

571
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,360
 Did he also mention the condition
 in which Miss Pond was found?

572
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,000
 Yes, he did.

573
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,880
 Excuse me for not wanting to stand,
 but l've had a horse accident.

574
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,400
 I pinched a sciatic nerve.

575
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,960
 Have you ever had
 back troubles, Lieutenant?

576
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,840
 I got shot there once.

577
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,920
 I'm going to cut
 through formalities, Lieutenant.

578
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,800
 You are aware that Miss Pond and l
 had a certain relationship,

579
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,960
 and I believe you're also aware that she
 had similar relationships with other men.

580
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,880
 I believe Miss Pond
 was in your company

581
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,000
 from Friday through the weekend.

582
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,880
 That sounds about right.
 We went to Tahoe on Saturday.

583
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,520
 Senator Bolton has a house there

584
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,400
 that he lends us for the weekend
 from time to time.

585
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,440
 So you were in Tahoe, not here?

586
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,760
 Friday night here,
 then Tahoe on Saturday,

587
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,640
 and Sunday night, I flew to Washington.

588
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,360
 She wasn't out at the test site?

589
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,040
 That's restricted.

590
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,920
 But then you know that, don't you?

591
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,840
 She went down to Los Angeles
 Saturday, Lieutenant,

592
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,880
 and I went on for a meeting
 with the Secretary of Defense.

593
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,280
 Do you think much about
 national security, Lieutenant?

594
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,280
 Well, I got all the security I can handle
 right now in L.A., General.

595
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,760
 Do you know much about
 atomic energy, what it means?

596
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,040
 Ended the war.

597
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,200
 Did you know that the atom itself
 is mostly empty space?

598
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,720
 I never really thought about it, General.

599
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,600
 Almost completely empty,
 but with tiny fragments of matter.

600
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,080
 And since this entire universe
 is made up of atoms,

601
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,960
 everything that we see and touch--
 in fact, the very floor beneath us--

602
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,000
 is made up of almost
 completely empty space.

603
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,280
 The only reason we don't fall through it

604
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,160
 is because these tiny particles
 of matter are just whirling about

605
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,880
 at such speed that they give us
 the illusion of solidity.

606
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,680
 Actually, the floor is spinning
 right underneath our feet.

607
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,920
 Do you feel it, Lieutenant?

608
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,320
 Then we're just empty space ourselves.

609
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,560
 Exactly, exactly.

610
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,440
 And these--
 these tiny particles of matter,

611
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,560
 which are so small that
 no one's ever seen them--never--

612
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,720
 they contain enough energy
 to blow up this house,

613
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,080
 an entire city, every person on Earth.

614
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,240
 That is inconceivable.

615
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,200
 General, I really don't think
 much about those things.

616
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,960
 I'd probably see too much.

617
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,840
 What do you see?

618
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,840
 People dead before their time.

619
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,720
 That's the history
 of the world, Lieutenant.

620
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,400
 Some people die before their time
 so that others can live.

621
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,480
 It's the cornerstone of civilization.

622
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,920
 War, religion, democracy.

623
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,560
 A hundred die
 so that a thousand may live.

624
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,280
 Well, General, I take 'em one at a time.

625
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,160
 Right now I got Allison Pond.

626
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,280
 We're not so different,
 you and l, Lieutenant.

627
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,840
 You see, certain men--
 a doctor, a national leader,

628
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,480
 an officer of the law--give to society
 in ways that most people do not.

629
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,920
 In turn, society gives them
 certain considerations.

630
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,240
 Now, we don't teach this in school.

631
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,400
 We don't acknowledge it.

632
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,080
 But those who accept
 the burden of leadership

633
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,960
 understand they have
 these considerations.

634
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,120
 You've accepted the burden
 of leadership, haven't you, Lieutenant?

635
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,880
 In what sense, General?

636
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,760
 You protect society, the ordinary citizen.

637
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,920
 Now, in doing so,
 sometimes you may break the law.

638
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,840
 You may violate the Constitution,
 the Bill of Rights, Search and Seizure.

639
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,800
 In fact, it--it may even
 be known that you do so.

640
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,200
 And yet, nothing happens,

641
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,080
 because it is understood that
 that is part of the burden of leadership.

642
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,640
 And you accept it.

643
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,520
 You accept your sins.

644
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,920
 General, Allison Pond
 was out at your test site.

645
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,880
 We found this in her foot.

646
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,160
 I'm gonna need your calendar
 for the last month--

647
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,360
 where you were, who you saw.

648
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,080
 Of course you are.

649
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,960
 Colonel Fitzgerald will get you
 everything you need.

650
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,760
 Thank you, sir.

651
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,720
 Nice house.

652
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,920
 l've spoken to Los Angeles.

653
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,800
 We'll have the film within 24 hours.

654
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,520
 What'd Timms have to say?

655
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,560
 He said the cornerstone
 of civilization was human sacrifice.

656
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,240
 Lieutenant Hoover, sir.

657
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,400
 Maxwell.

658
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,280
 Maxwell Hoover, say hello
 to Special Agent Jeffrey McCafferty

659
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,280
 of the old FBl.

660
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,280
 Lieutenant.

661
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,160
 Special Agent McCafferty here seems
 to be interested in one of our cases.

662
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,480
 Allison Pond.

663
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,360
 Special Agent, that was her name,
 wasn't it? Allison Pond?

664
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,280
 Yes, sir.

665
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,160
 Bill, you mind if I inquire
 what business it is of the FBl's?

666
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,800
 If I may, Chief.

667
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,400
 Our role here is purely informational.

668
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,520
 We are aware of the fact

669
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,200
 that a man of fundamental importance
 to national security

670
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,880
 has somehow been brought
 into an investigation

671
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,760
 in reference to a young girl's death.

672
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,840
 In light of the damage that this could do
 to him both personally and in his work,

673
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,880
 the director felt that it was appropriate--

674
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,760
 without stepping
 on your jurisdiction, of course--

675
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,280
 for me to come down and share
 with you our knowledge of the situation.

676
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,760
 And what would that be?

677
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,680
 I'm prepared to give you
 the director's personal guarantee

678
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,760
 that General Timms had nothing
 to do with the death of Allison Pond.

679
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,160
 How would the director know
 something like that?

680
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,800
 I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
 to discuss that.

681
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
 That's it?

682
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,800
 That's it?

683
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,560
 If I call your boss in Washington,

684
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,440
 he'll vouch for this pile of crap
 you're handing us?

685
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,000
 The director specifically
 asked me to tell you

686
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,880
 that he appreciates your cooperation
 in this matter, Lieutenant Hoover.

687
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,480
 He also felt that you would understand
 the sensitive nature of the situation,

688
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,520
 being that you're
 a married man yourself.

689
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,560
 We are not
 within our resources, gentlemen.

690
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,280
 And we're more than willing
 to share them with you.

691
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,160
 Of course, if you were to come across
 anything in regard to evidence,

692
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,880
 the director would be grateful
 to see it himself.

693
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,480
 The director would be very grateful.

694
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,960
 Maxwell...

695
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,840
 Do you have the slightest idea
 how intensely I hate

696
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,160
 these pathetic little Ivy League cops
 being in my town?

697
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,440
 Let alone sitting in a chair
 in my office?

698
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,440
 Yes, sir, I sure do.
 Yes, sir.

699
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,640
 Have you got anything hard
 on this guy Timms?

700
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,840
 He's lying about Allison Pond.

701
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,160
 - Can you prove that?
 - No, sir, I can't prove it, but I will.

702
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,360
 But here's the deal, Bill.
 We had an informant.

703
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,240
 Now, he was killed at the beach
 by a heavy machine gun--

704
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,800
 heavy caliber machine gun.

705
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,600
 That's military, that's a connection.

706
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,480
 Wait a second, I know three guys
 a block from Lankershim Boulevard

707
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,880
 in North Hollywood alone who've got
 the same ordnance in their back rooms.

708
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,120
 Wake up.

709
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,000
 Bill, when we set this squad up,
 we answered to nobody but you.

710
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,720
 That was the deal--nobody but you.

711
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,600
 Four men, no politics, no favors.

712
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,520
 - We answered to nobody.
 - No.

713
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,280
 A warrant?

714
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,800
 You're looking for a film?

715
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,960
 What kind of film?

716
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,520
 Mike, check the bookcase, please.

717
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,400
 What kind of film?

718
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,880
 Esther, where's Max?

719
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,480
 Cut it.

720
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,360
 No!

721
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,240
 Find him!

722
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,440
 - Are you hurt?
 - No.

723
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,800
 What happened?

724
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,680
 The FBl was here with
 a search warrant, looking for a film.

725
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,280
 What's going on?

726
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,960
 Max, what is going on?

727
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,560
 The man in the film
 is named Thomas Timms.

728
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,640
 He's the head
 of the Atomic Energy Commission.

729
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,160
 And the girl is dead.

730
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,040
 - That's all?
 - That's all.

731
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,520
 You know why these guys
 are still L.A. cops?

732
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,160
 Because they couldn't cut the grade
 to make federal agents.

733
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,880
 Wire taps, warrants, subpoenas--

734
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,120
 You follow proper procedure,
 and it can't fail, boys.

735
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,760
 J. Edgar taught me that.

736
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,200
 This prick from the LAPD
 thinks he got over on me?

737
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,080
 I fixed his ass with a search
 warrant on his premises.

738
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,800
 What if Hoover comes here?

739
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,680
 I'll arrest him for trespassing.

740
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,160
 Jesus Christ!

741
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,760
 See? That's federal property.

742
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,640
 This isn't.
 This is L.A.

743
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,120
 This is my town.

744
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,960
 Out here you're a trespasser.

745
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,840
 Out here I could pick you up,
 burn your house,

746
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,400
 fuck your wife, and kill your dog.

747
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,280
 And the only thing that'll
 protect you is if I can't find you...

748
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,160
 ...and I already found you.

749
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,280
 How long?

750
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,080
 Six months.

751
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,640
 A little less.

752
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,080
 Did everybody know?

753
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,840
 No.

754
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,720
 No, nobody knew.

755
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,480
 It's been over--

756
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,720
 You pig!

757
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,240
 Hoover.

758
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,320
 Fitzgerald.

759
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,200
 You've got something of ours.

760
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,560
 I wanna see Timms.

761
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,200
 There's no reason
 to involve the General in this.

762
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,080
 It's a straight trade--yours for ours.

763
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,400
 What you got today was a copy.

764
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,200
 We will do whatever is necessary.

765
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,080
 No Timms, no deal.

766
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,520
 All right. 10:00 tomorrow
 at the military airfield west of the city.

767
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,320
 You bring everything,
 we bring everything--

768
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,480
 originals and any copies.

769
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,960
 This is where you bring people
 to get rid of them.

770
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,480
 isn't it?

771
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,200
 It's over, right?

772
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,480
 It's not like that, Allison.

773
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,320
 It's not just over.

774
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,120
 The thing is you think
 you can have it both ways,

775
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:24,600
 that you can make it work both ways.

776
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,920
 But I can't.

777
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,320
 I have different problems, Max.

778
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,240
 I never wanted it both ways.

779
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,040
 I thought you were asleep.

780
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,680
 What are you thinking about?

781
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,120
 I know what you think.

782
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,880
 I just don't know
 how you're thinking about it.

783
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,560
 It isn't good.

784
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,600
 Yeah.

785
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,400
 You want me to leave for a while?

786
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,120
 At least.

787
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,240
 - We got a serious problem, Max.
 - What's that?

788
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,440
 Hoover.
 Not you, the other Hoover.

789
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,960
 Called the chief from Washington
 5:00 this morning.

790
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,200
 The chief has been
 looking for you ever since.

791
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,040
 Kidnapping, assault, attempted murder.

792
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,920
 If I attempted to murder
 McCafferty, he'd be dead.

793
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,640
 Max, this is serious.
 The chief is pissed!

794
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,880
 So let him be pissed.

795
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,720
 Max, he wants to talk to you.

796
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,680
 - What the hell are you doing?
 - Coming along.

797
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,160
 I am not going back there
 telling the chief you wouldn't come.

798
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,640
 Hall's right about that psychiatrist.

799
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,720
 He's turning you into a piano teacher.

800
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,520
 She. lt's a woman, Max.

801
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,000
 Where are we going, Max?

802
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,880
 Max? Where are we going?

803
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,600
 This is about to turn bad, isn't it, Max?

804
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,080
 Yeah. Yeah, it is.

805
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,640
 Now, listen, Coolidge,
 you don't come with me.

806
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,880
 This is personal.

807
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,880
 Max, I'm coming.

808
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,680
 No, no, listen to me.

809
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,840
 This is something I gotta do.

810
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,680
 Max, we're partners.
 I'm coming.

811
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,280
 Right. Right, we're partners.

812
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,560
 Lieutenant,
 we only expected one visitor.

813
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,680
 He goes wherever I go.

814
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,280
 We're partners.

815
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,400
 Suit yourself.

816
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,280
 Sergeant, search 'em for weapons.

817
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,160
 - I don't carry a gun.
 - Raise your arms, sir.

818
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,240
 That's very impressive.

819
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:39,120
 Escort them
 to Colonel Fitzgerald's office.

820
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,120
 What's that?

821
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,880
 It's a restricted area, sir.

822
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,760
 - Restricted?
 - Yes, sir.

823
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,080
 - Can I see it?
 - Sir, that area is restricted.

824
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,960
 I cannot take you there.

825
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,480
 You know, Coolidge...

826
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,720
 Take this.

827
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,160
 Stash the car.
 I'll meet you later.

828
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,040
 - Be careful.
 - Yeah.

829
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,080
 It's locked?

830
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,960
 Locked.

831
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,160
 Wait here, I'll go around back.

832
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,640
 Lieutenant Hoover?

833
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,160
 What is it?

834
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:51,200
 Cancer.

835
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:54,200
 It's in my blood, my bones.

836
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,960
 Even now, they tell me, in my brain.

837
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,120
 You've never seen anyone
 with terminal cancer, have you?

838
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,240
 I saw a whole roomful
 of terminal cancer on my way in.

839
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,280
 The hundred who died
 so that the thousand might live.

840
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,120
 What were they, experiments?

841
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,280
 Think of them as soldiers.

842
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:31,000
 They didn't seem like soldiers to me.

843
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,880
 That's why you killed Allison.

844
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,320
 My God, Lieutenant.

845
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,200
 Why would I kill Allison?

846
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,520
 She showed me pleasures
 I never dreamed existed.

847
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,800
 It's all I think about these days.

848
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,600
 I'm sure you understand that.

849
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,520
 It was a mistake.

850
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,400
 What do you mean, it was a mistake?

851
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,440
 Her death.

852
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:11,600
 An error in judgment.

853
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,840
 An overzealous reaction...

854
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,880
 against a perceived threat
 to national security.

855
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,520
 She saw the cancer ward.

856
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,320
 She took pictures.

857
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,160
 You're much more intelligent
 than you appear to be, Lieutenant.

858
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,800
 Must be a big advantage in your field.

859
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,800
 In my field,
 everyone was always so desperate

860
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,680
 to seem cleverer than they were.

861
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,240
 - What is that?
 - Film.

862
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,480
 Of you and Allison.

863
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,600
 She was spectacular, wasn't she?

864
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,040
 Drop the gun, Lieutenant.

865
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:21,760
 What now, Colonel?

866
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,560
 Sir, they breached security,
 they intended to harm you.

867
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,440
 No, they brought me a film.

868
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,320
 Pardon me, sir,
 but they've compromised

869
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,160
 top secret scientific areas.

870
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,040
 We have a test scheduled in one hour.

871
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,920
 I understand that perfectly, Colonel.
 These men are not enemies.

872
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,480
 Perhaps you could see to it that
 they are taken back to Los Angeles.

873
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,800
 With all due respect, General,
 security for this particular installation--

874
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,960
 Colonel...

875
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,240
 Take them back now.

876
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,640
 All right.

877
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,480
 Sir.

878
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,840
 The captain and l
 have business in Los Angeles.

879
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,800
 We're gonna catch a ride down
 with you if you don't mind.

880
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,640
 It's your plane.

881
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,560
 - Let's take it up.
 - Roger.

882
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,440
 How come there's no door?
 It's very loud.

883
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,280
 This plane is rigged for jumping.
 You won't be uncomfortable.

884
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,960
 They're gonna throw us
 out of the plane,

885
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,800
 just like they did Allison Pond.

886
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,520
 You gave us the wrong film,
 Lieutenant.

887
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,680
 I'm not interested in police
 training films about the clap.

888
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,000
 Everything you have
 for everything we have--

889
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,760
 that was the understanding.

890
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,520
 But you see, there's a problem.

891
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,400
 - You sent the film to my house.
 - That was to get your attention.

892
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,000
 No copies were sent to the press
 or the Los Angeles Police Department.

893
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,560
 You see, the problem is you sent the
 film to my house addressed to my wife.

894
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,520
 And she watched it.

895
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:06,400
 I don't care who sees it now.

896
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,200
 See what I mean?

897
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,920
 I don't have anything to lose.

898
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,880
 Does Timms know about this?

899
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,320
 The general's no longer relevant.

900
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,720
 Who made the decision
 to throw her out of the plane?

901
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,240
 If such a thing had happened, the
 general wouldn't have been informed.

902
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,520
 He wouldn't have made that decision.

903
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,320
 Of course not.

904
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,200
 Would it have been you?

905
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,520
 That's right.

906
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,400
 If he couldn't intervene on her part,
 he can't intervene to save you.

907
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,600
 No one can intervene here, Lieutenant.

908
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,760
 They threw Allison out of the plane.

909
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,800
 - They threw her out of the plane, Max.
 - That's right.

910
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,120
 You threw that little girl out of a plane!

911
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,680
 You're pathetic, Hoover!

912
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,040
 I did my job!

913
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,920
 She died because she was in the way!

914
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:04,040
 She died for nothing, you son of a bitch!

915
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,680
 Hold on, Max.

916
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,640
 What the hell's going on in here?

917
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,360
 - What's happening?
 - Oh, my God.

918
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,440
 Is he all right?

919
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,280
 He's been shot, Max.

920
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,800
 Is he dead?

921
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,520
 Come on, get up!
 Come on!

922
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,400
 Get up! Wake up.
 He's alive!

923
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,280
 You fly this plane, or I'll fucking kill you
 right here, you hear me?!

924
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,240
 Stay awake. We gotta land
 this plane now, or he's gonna die on us.

925
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,040
 Come on.
 We need you to fly the plane.

926
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,440
 - You gotta fly this plane.
 - We need you to fly the plane!

927
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,080
 Stay awake.
 Come on, come on.

928
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,960
 That's it.

929
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:03,960
 Oh, Jesus!

930
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,800
 We made it, Max!

931
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,040
 - Are you all right?
 - Yeah.

932
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:42,920
 Yeah, I'm okay.
 You all right?

933
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,400
 I feel cold, Max.

934
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,160
 Jesus Christ, Ellery,
 how can you be cold?

935
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,040
 We're in the middle
 of a goddamn desert!

936
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,880
 Max, I gotta sit.

937
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,760
 All right, go ahead and sit down.

938
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:07,400
 Hey, Max?

939
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,720
 - What happened?
 - Max, I think I'm shot.

940
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,760
 Let me see.

941
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,640
 - I'm shot.
 - Oh, my God.

942
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,720
 My psychiatrist
 is not gonna like this, Max.

943
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,200
 I'm cold.

944
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,080
 You know, while it was
 all happening in there, Max...

945
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,800
 ...l felt good again.

946
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,560
 It was like it used to be.

947
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,480
 Ellery, don't talk, save your strength.

948
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,360
 - Save your strength.
 - Why?

949
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,840
 I like to talk, Max.
 You know me.

950
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,760
 You gotta get it out, right?

951
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,400
 Tell me the truth.

952
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,960
 Is there something wrong with me?

953
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:08,040
 Ellery, listen to me.
 Listen to me.

954
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,040
 There's nothing wrong with you.

955
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,240
 - You mean it?
 - Yeah. Listen to me.

956
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,280
 - You wouldn't lie to me, right, Max?
 - No, no, no.

957
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,240
 We're partners, right?
 We're partners.

958
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,320
 - Partners.
 - Yeah.

959
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:26,200
 - Right.
 - That's right.

960
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,560
 We're partners, Max.

961
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:31,440
 No, come on, Ellery.
 Come on, come on, stay awake.

962
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,840
 No, no.
 Come on, come on, come on.

963
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,760
 Stay awake.
 Come on, come on.

964
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:37,640
 Stay awake!
 Come on back!

965
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,520
 Ellery, come on!

966
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:59,000
 I hear they broke up the squad.

967
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:02,120
 I broke up the squad.

968
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:08,200
 There's no squad without Ellery.

969
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,360
 What are you gonna do?

970
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,000
 I don't know.

971
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,840
 I honestly don't know.

972
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,440
 Did you ever think
 about leaving me for her, Max?

973
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,280
 No, Kate. No.

974
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,480
 Why'd you stop seeing her?

975
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:48,160
 Kate, I love you.

976
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:51,000
 I have always loved you.

977
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:55,800
 When I realized
 what a mistake I had made,

978
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,840
 I just didn't want it between us.

979
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,400
 But it is.

980
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,760
 I guess it always will be.

981
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,840
 It'll never be the same, Max.

982
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,160
 - Let's go, Eddie.
 - Let's get out of here.

983
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,760
Kate

984
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:53,940
You broke my heart, Max.

985
01:37:54,940 --> 01:38:04,940
