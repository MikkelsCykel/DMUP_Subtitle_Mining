1
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,200
It's safer to teach you English!

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
I know English...

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,200
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How are things in Palermo?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,700
How are things in Palermo?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,200
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,600
times are changing for the worse.

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,300
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,200
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,300
What's wrong?

13
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,700
Bad news from America.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,900
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,300
Let's go... you promised.

16
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Fabrizio!

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,600
Get the car.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,100
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,800
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

20
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,800
Okay, anything you say.

21
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
Calo, where is Apollonia?

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,700
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,100
She'll make a good American wife.

24
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,100
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

25
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,500
Fabrizio!

26
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,300
Where are you going?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,900
No, Apollonia!

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,800
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

31
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

32
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,100
and from Brooklyn

33
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,800
Philip Tattaglia.

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,300
And from Staten Island

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,900
we have with us Victor Strachi.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,600
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

37
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,500
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

38
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,800
How did things ever get so far?

39
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
I don't know.

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,000
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

41
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,600
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,500
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

43
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,500
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,600
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

45
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,100
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

46
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,300
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

47
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,600
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

48
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,500
He refused to share them.

49
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,400
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

50
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,900
All of you know me.

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,900
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

52
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,500
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

53
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,800
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

54
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,800
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,700
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,000
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

57
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,200
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

58
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,500
Times have changed.

59
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,300
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

60
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,300
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

61
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,800
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

62
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,500
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,100
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

64
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,800
After all, we're not communists.

65
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,000
I also don't believe in drugs.

66
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,000
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

67
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,200
Somebody says to them
" I have powders. "

68
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,500
" If you put up
3-4,000 dollar investment,

69
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
we can make 50,000 distributing. "

70
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,700
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

71
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,600
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

72
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Thats an infÃ mia.

73
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,800
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,100
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

75
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,300
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

76
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,300
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

77
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,500
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

78
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,800
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

79
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,700
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

80
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,000
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

81
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,800
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

82
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,000
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

83
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,000
You talk about vengeance.

84
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,300
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

85
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,900
Or my boy to me?

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,900
But I have selfish reasons.

88
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,800
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

89
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,200
because of this Sollozzo business.

90
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,700
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

91
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,400
Cleared of all these false charges.

92
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
But I'm a superstitious man.

93
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,400
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

94
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,400
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

95
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,300
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

96
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,200
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

97
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,200
And that I do not forgive.

98
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,000
But, that aside

99
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,500
let me say that I swear

100
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,200
on the souls of my grandchildren,

101
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,700
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

102
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

103
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,800
Mention it. Don't insist.

104
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,800
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

105
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,300
Tattaglia's a pimp.

106
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,600
He could never have outfought Santino.

107
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,500
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

108
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
Come on, Nancy.

109
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,900
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

110
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,900
Okay, all right.

111
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,200
How long have you been back?

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
I've been back a year.

113
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Longer than that, I think.

114
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
It's good to see you, Kay.

115
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

116
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
He's been sick. Very sick.

117
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But you're not like him.

118
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,900
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

119
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,100
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

120
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,600
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

121
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,200
Like a senator or president.

122
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,800
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

123
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,700
They don't have men killed.

124
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Who's being naive, Kay?

125
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,600
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

126
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,600
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

127
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

128
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,900
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

129
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,100
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

130
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,700
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

131
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,600
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

132
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,900
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

133
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,500
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

134
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,400
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

136
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,500
That we have children. Our children.

137
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Kay, I need you.

138
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,700
And I love you.

139
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,600
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

140
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,400
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

141
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

142
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,800
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

143
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,400
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,300
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

145
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Don Corleone...

146
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,200
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

147
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

148
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,000
Michael is now head of the family.

149
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,400
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

150
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,800
After we make the move to Nevada

151
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,300
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

152
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,800
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

153
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,100
Forgive me, but with you gone,

154
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

155
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,800
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

156
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

157
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,800
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

158
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,100
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,400
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

160
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,800
That's all I can tell you now.

161
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

162
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,700
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

163
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

164
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,200
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

165
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,000
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,800
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

167
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,800
Mike... Why am I out?

168
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,100
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

169
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,600
Things may get rough with the move.

170
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,000
Tom.

171
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,300
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

172
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,500
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

174
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,200
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

175
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,300
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

176
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,700
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

177
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,400
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

178
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,700
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

179
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Let me open the door, all right?

180
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,700
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

181
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,400
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

182
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,400
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

183
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,100
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

184
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,000
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

185
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,200
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

186
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

187
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,100
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

188
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,300
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

189
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
Hey, come on! Scram!

190
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

191
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,800
Sorry.

192
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,300
I don't know. He's tired.

193
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,400
What happened to Moe Greene?

194
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,800
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

195
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,800
Well, give him a call.

196
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,300
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

197
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,600
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

198
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,300
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

199
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,600
Well, I owe it all to him.

200
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,400
He knows how grateful you are.

201
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,800
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

202
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Mike, what can I do?

203
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,400
We're thinking of giving up our interests

204
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,400
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

205
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,600
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

206
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,400
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

207
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

208
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,300
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

209
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
See, Johnny...

210
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,300
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

211
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,100
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

212
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,700
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

213
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,100
We're counting on you.

214
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,700
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

215
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,100
Good.

216
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,400
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

217
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,000
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

218
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,200
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

219
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,900
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

220
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,300
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

221
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
Buy me out?

222
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,600
The casino, the hotel.

223
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,600
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

224
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,100
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

225
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,600
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

226
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,500
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

227
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,700
You Guineas make me laugh.

228
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,500
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

229
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,300
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

230
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,600
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

231
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,400
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

232
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

233
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,500
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

234
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,500
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

235
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

236
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,200
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

237
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:18,100
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

238
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,400
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

239
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,300
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

240
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,200
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

241
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,100
You straightened my brother out?

242
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,700
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

243
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,700
What's wrong with you?

244
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,700
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

245
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,300
Son-of-a-bitch!

246
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

247
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,100
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

248
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,800
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

249
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:09,300
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

250
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,700
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

251
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,400
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

252
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
Fredo...

253
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
You're my older brother, and I love you.

254
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,800
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

255
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Ever.

256
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,600
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

257
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,300
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

258
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,700
Your sister wants to ask you something.

259
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,900
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

260
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,900
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

261
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,900
- We'll see.
- Will you?

262
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,300
Let me think about it. Come on.

263
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Barzini will move against you first.

264
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,500
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

265
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,700
Guaranteeing your safety.

266
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,000
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

267
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

268
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,600
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

269
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,200
I don't know.

270
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

271
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
- Very happy.
- That's good.

272
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,700
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

273
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,800
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

274
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

275
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

276
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,900
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

277
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,700
He looks more like you every day.

278
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,900
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

279
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,100
Read the funny papers.

280
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,900
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

281
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,300
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

282
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,100
What's the matter?

283
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,000
What's bothering you?

284
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,200
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

285
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,000
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

286
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,700
And Fredo...

287
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Fredo was, well...

288
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,100
But I never wanted this for you.

289
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,500
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

290
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,500
And I refused to be a fool,

291
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,700
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

292
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,200
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

293
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,000
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

294
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,500
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

295
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Another pezzonovante.

296
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,300
Well...

297
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,400
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

298
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,000
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

299
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,300
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

300
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,400
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

301
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,500
Can I hold it, please?

302
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,400
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

303
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,300
Over here, over here.

304
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,700
Be careful. You're spilling it.

305
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,800
Anthony!

306
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,600
Come here, come here.

307
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,400
That's it. We'll put it right there.

308
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll show you something. Come here.

309
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,200
Stand there.

310
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,700
Give me an orange!

311
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,800
That's a new trick.

312
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,100
You run in there. Run in there.

313
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Where are you?

314
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Mike, can I have a minute?

315
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,300
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

316
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,600
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

317
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,500
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

318
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,700
I can arrange security. On my territory.

319
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,200
- All right?
- All right.

320
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,700
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

321
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,900
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

322
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,900
Where I'll be safe.

323
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,700
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

324
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,600
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

325
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,100
But I'm going to wait.

326
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
After the baptism.

327
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,300
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

328
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,500
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

329
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,100
All the heads of the five families.

330
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

331
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,300
I do.

332
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,800
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

333
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
I do.

334
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,100
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

335
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,400
I do.

336
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,300
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

337
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I do renounce him.

338
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,900
And all his works?

339
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,900
I do renounce them.

340
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,900
Oh, God!

341
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,500
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

342
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,400
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

343
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,700
I will.

344
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,400
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

345
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,500
Kay!

346
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Kiss your godfather.

347
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

348
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,800
Everybody has to leave without us.

349
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,800
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

350
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,500
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

351
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,000
I'll only be a couple of days.

352
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,400
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

353
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,400
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

354
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:13,600
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

355
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,200
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

356
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,500
I can't go either, Sal.

357
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

358
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,900
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

359
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,300
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

360
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,700
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

361
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,900
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

362
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,700
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

363
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,700
That little farce
you played with my sister.

364
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,900
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

365
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,700
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

366
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,600
Don't do this to me, please.

367
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,600
Barzini is dead.

368
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,100
So is Philip Tattaglia.

369
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,800
Moe Greene.

370
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,600
Strachi. Cuneo.

371
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,800
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

372
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,600
Admit what you did.

373
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,200
Get him a drink.

374
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,800
Come on.

375
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,600
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

376
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,500
Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

377
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,400
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

378
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Go ahead, drink, drink.

379
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,000
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

380
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,000
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

381
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,700
Tom.

382
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,500
I want you to stay there. Understand?

383
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,100
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

384
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,600
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

385
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Who approached you?

386
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,400
Tattaglia or Barzini?

387
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,000
It was Barzini.

388
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,700
Good.

389
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

390
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,600
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

391
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,500
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

392
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,200
Hello, Carlo.

393
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,200
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

394
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,700
Michael!

395
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,800
- What is it?
- Where is he?

396
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,300
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

397
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,500
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

398
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,700
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

399
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,600
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

400
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,300
Connie.

401
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,200
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

402
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,100
He knew he was going to kill him.

403
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,600
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

404
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,700
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

405
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,600
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

406
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,500
No! No, no...

407
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,900
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

408
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,800
She's hysterical.

409
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,100
Hysterical.

410
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,800
Michael, is it true?

411
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,500
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

412
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,300
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

413
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,900
All right.

414
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,400
This one time.

415
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,700
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

416
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,300
Is it true?

417
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,800
Is it?

418
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,000
No.

419
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,900
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

420
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,900
Don Corleone.
