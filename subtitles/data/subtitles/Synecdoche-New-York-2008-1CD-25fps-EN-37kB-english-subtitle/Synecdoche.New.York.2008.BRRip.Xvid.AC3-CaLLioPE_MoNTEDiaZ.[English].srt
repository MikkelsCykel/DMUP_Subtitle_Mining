1
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,600
- 7:45 on this beautiful, almost balmy
22nd of September in Schenectady.

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,280
And it's the first day of fall.

3
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,080
So in honor of that fact,
we have Elke Putzkammer...

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
...professor of literature
at Union college...

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,560
...to talk about autumn in poetry
and literature.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
- Good morning, professor.
- Hi, Alex.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,040
So, what about it? Why do
so many people write about the fall?

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
Well, I think it's seen
as the beginning of the end, really.

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,400
If the year is a life, then September,
the beginning of fall...

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,680
...is when the bloom is off the rose
and things start to die.

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,600
It's a melancholy month and maybe
because of that, quite beautiful.

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,560
Is there something
you might read to us?

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,840
Oh, I'd love to.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,720
Whoever has no house now
Will never have one.

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,120
Whoever is alone will stay alone

16
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,640
Will sit, read, write long letters
Through the evening

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,160
And wander the boulevards
Up and down, restlessly

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,480
While the dry leaves are blowing

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,840
Goodness, that harsh, isn't it?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, perhaps. But truthful.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
Mommy, done.

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,320
Okay.

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,040
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
- I tried not to wake you.
- Well, thanks.

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,600
You didn't. I just...
You know, I couldn't get up.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,560
- Caden, can you get that?
- It's Maria, I don't want to.

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,720
- Caden... Oh, that's weird.
- Hey, it's me. How are you?

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
Mommy, is something wrong
with my poop?

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,800
No, honey, it's just green.
You probably ate something green.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,240
I didn't. What's wrong with me?

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,440
I have to get that, Olive.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,800
- But, Mommy...
- Yeah, I'll be right back, Olive.

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,480
Oh, nothing.
Just wiping Olive's ass. You?

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,040
- An earthquake in Kashmir...
- Oh, you're kidding. Holy fuck.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,120
...has killed an estimated 73,000...
- I don't feel well.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, my goodness.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,320
- March in Washington, D.c., today,
October 15th.

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
- Harold Pinter died.
- Well, he's old, right?

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,120
- No, wait. He won the Nobel Prize.
- Mom.

40
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,480
- What, honey?
- Do you need to look at my poop?

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,080
- You sure it's all right?
- It's fine, Olive. Just flush.

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,840
What if it's alive? What if I kill it?

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,120
- It's green like plants.
- It's not alive, honey.

44
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,880
Remember the production of
The Dumb Waiter I did at Albanyfest?

45
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,440
Have your oatmeal, honey.

46
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,080
- I want peanut butter and jelly.
- You said oatmeal.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,480
- This isn't a restaurant.
- I don't want oatmeal.

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
- Okay. Fine.
- Mommy, I'm sorry.

49
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,920
They found avian flu in Turkey.
In the country Turkey, not turkeys.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,720
- Can I watch TV till school?
- In some chickens. Yeah.

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,240
There is a secret something at play
under the surface...

52
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,160
...growing like an invisible virus
of thought.

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
But you're being changed by it...

54
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,120
- Milk's expired.
- Okay.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Jesus.

56
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
- You better eat this.
- I will.

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

58
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,360
How did I guess
you'd ask me that question?

59
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,960
Happy Halloween, Schenectady.

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,200
And how long have you been
in New York for?

61
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
The first black graduate
of the University of Alabama died.

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
Vivian Malone Jones.

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Stroke, 63.

64
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,440
Fuck!

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
God! Somebody! Adele, help!

66
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
- Jesus, Caden, what the fuck?
- I was shaving and the thing flew off!

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, my God!
Jesus, look at your head.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Oh, shit.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
Oh, God, I can't turn it.

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
Oh, wait.

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,640
- Mommy, Daddy has blood.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,320
- Will there be a scar?
- Probably. It looks like a mud flap.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,640
- I prefer there not to be a scar.
- Yeah.

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,520
That fellow is annoying.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,120
He's in here every week,
like clockwork.

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,800
There. I think that should...
Let's see.

77
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,480
- What?
- Change in bowel movements?

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,600
It's a little more yellow than usual.
Why?

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,320
Yeah, I'd like you to see
an ophthalmologist.

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,720
- A neurologist?
- What? No.

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,560
An ophthalmologist.
I said, ophthalmologist.

82
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,720
Do you hear that?

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,400
Yeah.

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,120
And today is Tuesday.
Mommy, is today Tuesday?

85
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,040
No, honey, today is Friday.
So, what exactly did he say?

86
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,120
That my pupils weren't properly
opening and closing.

87
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
Dilating.

88
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,920
- No.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,680
- I don't think that's what he said.
- Yes.

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,280
- That's not what he said.
- Is it the bump to your head?

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,000
He doesn't know. Maybe.

92
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,160
He said he doesn't think so,
but maybe. But he doesn't know.

93
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,680
- But maybe. Who knows?
- Okay, Jesus, Caden, I got it.

94
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,600
- He doesn't know...
- Sorry. I'm a little anxious.

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,120
- Did you have to get a shot, Daddy?
- No, honey.

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,040
- It's the start of something awful.
- Do I have to get a shot?

97
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,720
- Course not.
- Did you tell him I have green poo?

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,040
- It's fucked timing.
- Call the plumber. Hey.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
Sorry. I have rehearsal. Fuck.

100
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,200
- Hey, come on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. Everybody, sorry.

101
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
How many years
until I have to get more shots?

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,680
- Not for a really long time, babe.
- A million years?

103
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,480
- Remember what Dr. Woodman said...
- Dad, what's a plumber?

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,480
- He's a man...
- Or a woman, Dad.

105
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,000
Right. He's a man or a woman
who fixes sinks and toilets and...

106
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,120
- Do you know what pipes are?
- No.

107
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,600
- Hey, Jim. I had an accident.
- Like to smoke out of?

108
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,760
A different kind of pipe, honey.
All right, bye.

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Houses have pipes,
and they're made of...

110
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,520
They're like tubes,
and they're behind the walls...

111
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
...and they're under the floors
and everywhere.

112
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,240
- And...
- What's the matter?

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
- Every single where?
- It's okay, honey.

114
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,440
They just carry water
to and from sinks and toilets.

115
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,480
- It's like in your body. You have veins.
- Capillaries.

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
Capillaries filled with blood.

117
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,840
I have blood? I don't want blood.
I don't want blood.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
- What are you doing?
- Trying to explain plumbing.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,720
- Stop.
- I can't do this now.

120
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,360
- Don't worry, you don't have blood.
- Don't tell her she doesn't have blood.

121
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,240
- Caden, stop it.
- I don't want blood.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,360
Thanks for getting me in right away.

123
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
- Was it the bump to the head?
- No.

124
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,920
Could be, but I think we need
to get you to a neurologist.

125
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
- Neurologist?
- It's a brain expert.

126
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
I know what a neurologist is.

127
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
- I thought from the way you asked...
- I just thought you said "urologist."

128
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,240
- Why do I need to see a neurologist?
- Just for a look-see.

129
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,920
The eyes are part of the brain,
after all.

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,440
No, that's not true, is it?

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,680
- Why would I say it if it weren't true?
- It doesn't seem right.

132
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,960
Like morally correct,
or "right" as in accurate?

133
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,640
I don't know. Accurate, I guess?

134
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
Interesting.

135
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,960
Now, when you kick off, boy,
I want a 70-yard boot.

136
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,040
And get right down the field
under the ball.

137
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,960
And when you hit, hit low and hit hard,
because it's important, boy.

138
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
There's all kinds of important people
in the stands.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,000
And the first thing you know... Ben?

140
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Ben, where do I?

141
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,560
- Ben, how do I?
- Willy, you coming up?

142
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,080
Willy?

143
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,000
Willy, answer me.

144
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,080
Willy! No!

145
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,400
- Oh, Jesus, come on.
- Oh, crap.

146
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Claire, are you okay?
What's happening here?

147
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
It's too late in the game
to have these problems.

148
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,280
- I know, Caden. I'm sorry. We'll get it.
- Oh, my God.

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think the wig saved my life.

150
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,320
- Yeah.
- It's okay, honestly.

151
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,960
That was good, Tom.

152
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

153
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,440
I was trying something different.
I was crashing differently.

154
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,800
- Ambivalently.
- Yeah, I saw that. I liked it.

155
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
Try to keep in mind that
a young person playing Willy Loman...

156
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,480
...thinks he's only pretending
to be at the end of a life full of despair.

157
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,480
But the tragedy is that we know
that you, the young actor...

158
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
...will end up in this very place
of desolation.

159
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
Okay.

160
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,320
That's great.

161
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,640
- Let's try it again. How long, David?
- I think 15.

162
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,880
Anything?

163
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,480
So now what?

164
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

165
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,400
- In search of the elusive signal.
- The signal's good here, oddly.

166
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,480
- That is odd.
- I know. Cell phones, they're crazy.

167
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,960
- See you in a few.
- Yep.

168
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Yeah, Dr. Heshborg said
I should see a Dr. Scoriano.

169
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,520
My pupils don't work.

170
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,800
I think I have blood in my stool.

171
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,280
That stool in your office?

172
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,400
- When I was pregnant with Olive.
- What was it like?

173
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,880
I don't know. Hopeful or something.
Like something was gonna change.

174
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,000
- Yeah, something did. No?
- Yeah.

175
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,720
- Yeah, of course.
- I mean, bigtime.

176
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,600
I mean, maybe not as much
as I'd hoped.

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to say.

178
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,800
There are no terrible things to say
in here, only true and false.

179
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
- Can I say something awful?
- Yes, please do.

180
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
I've fantasized about Caden dying.

181
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,440
Being able to start again, guilt-free.

182
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,840
I know that's... That's bad.

183
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,400
- Caden, does that feel terrible?
- Yeah.

184
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,440
Okay, good.

185
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,680
It's a nightmare in there.

186
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,600
So, I'm reading The Trial.

188
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

189
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,480
- You like?
- Love.

190
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm such an idiot
for not knowing about this book.

191
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,960
- It's famous, as it turns out.
- Yeah.

192
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,640
You're not an idiot.

193
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,440
Then you say:

194
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,520
"In fact, Hazel, you're very bright,
and I love your eyes."

195
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,200
- In fact, Hazel, you're very bright.
- Oh, am I?

196
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,120
- And I love your eyes.
- Do you? Oh, you're a darling.

197
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Then what do I say?

198
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,840
- I can't say what then you say.
- Why?

199
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,560
Because it's dirty.

200
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,440
Could you step out for a second?

201
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,360
Go ahead. I've seen boy parts.

202
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,680
- Can I take a piss in your sink?
- Yeah, sure. I guess.

203
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,680
We're sold out.

204
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,560
Great.

205
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
Gorgeous.

206
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,720
Thanks.

207
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,360
- How was rehearsal?
- Awful.

208
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,120
We have 560 lighting cues.

209
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,120
- I don't why I make it so complicated.
- Because that's what you do.

210
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah.

211
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,480
We got through it though.
That's really pretty.

212
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,560
Caden, I'm sorry, I...

213
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,320
I can't come tonight. I'm sorry.

214
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,520
I have two canvasses I have
to get ready to ship for tomorrow.

215
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,440
- I know it sucks...
- It's opening night.

216
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,960
I know. I wish I could come.
I would if I could.

217
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,040
- I've gotta get ready.
- Tomorrow...

218
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,840
I have to get ready.
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

219
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,400
I have to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

220
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,160
Hey.

221
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,800
- Oh, boy, oh boy.
- Willy?

222
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,720
It's all right, I came back.

223
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,560
I hated myself tonight.

224
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,880
- Plus, I'm so... Excuse me.
- Hey, Tom.

225
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm so bloated and enormous.

226
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,000
No, you look good. You were great.
I was very pleased.

227
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,920
- You okay?
- Sorry. A little bit of a headache.

228
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
Willy Loman.

229
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,080
I just wanted to say thank you
for everything.

230
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,360
You've been absolutely brilliant.

231
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,400
It's gonna be miserable
going ahead without you.

232
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,920
- I'll be around. I'll check in.
- I'm such a baby.

233
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,440
Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk,
that's what.

234
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,640
Okay. Claire. Sweetheart.

235
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,240
- Good. Good job.
- Oh, don't worry, I'll get better.

236
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,880
- Good work.
- Don't worry, it'll get better.

237
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,760
Hey. I figured I'd better get in fast.

238
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,680
- Hey, you wanna sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

239
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,760
- Where's el wife-o?
- Had to work.

240
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,800
Her show in Berlin is in two weeks.

241
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,880
We're gonna go there
for like a month.

242
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,680
- Why do I like you so much?
- I couldn't begin to guess.

243
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,600
Me neither.

244
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,440
Do you get high, my friend?

245
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,640
You know, sometimes.

246
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,480
Do you want to now?
With me, in my car?

247
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,080
I get kind of...

248
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,000
...something when I'm stoned.

249
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,640
What does "something" mean?

250
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
You know...

251
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,360
...bothered.

252
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,400
- What does "bothered" mean?
- You know.

253
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,280
Bothered. Horny.

254
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,080
And me with a station wagon and all.
Could be dangerous.

255
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,480
- Yeah, could be.
- You're absolutely zero fun.

256
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,160
When are the reviews
gonna get here?

257
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,040
Don't know.

258
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,280
His best friends finger two babies...

259
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,720
One this big, one this big.
- And two kittens.

260
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,600
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden. How'd it go?

261
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

262
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,680
It's late.

263
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,480
Maria came over
to keep me company because...

264
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,680
And we just lost track.
I got everything done.

265
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,720
But I'm sorry I missed your play.
I'm sorry. But how'd it go?

266
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,360
Great. We're a hit.

267
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,960
Reviews are great.

268
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,440
Times said it was brilliant casting
young people as Willy and Linda.

269
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,440
- That's great, Caden. Good for you.
- Great.

270
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,040
I can't wait to see it tomorrow.
That's... Tonight.

271
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
That's great.

272
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,200
Wow, it's really late... Early.

273
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
Early.

274
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,760
It's late.
Hey, I would love to see it too.

275
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,320
- Can we get Maria a ticket?
- You're stoned.

276
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,440
I mean, a little. It's, you know...
I don't know.

277
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,320
But are you happy with it?

278
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,560
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love for you to see...
To know what you think.

279
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
It doesn't matter what I think.

280
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,040
Absolutely. It's all about
your artistic satisfaction, Caden.

281
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,880
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

282
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,480
- I've always loved this house.
- Yes, it's a wonderful place.

283
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
The truth is, I never really imagined
I could afford it.

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,920
Well, the sellers
are very motivated now.

285
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,760
It's a scary decision.
I never thought I'd buy a house alone.

286
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,600
But, you know, I'm 36,
and I wonder what it is I'm waiting for.

287
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,400
- Home buying is always scary.
- And with the fire and all especially.

288
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,720
Well, it's a good size though,
2200 square feet...

289
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,200
...not including
the partially finished basement.

290
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,400
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
- I'm thinking I should go.
- It's a perfect size for someone alone.

292
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,800
I like it, I do. I'm just really concerned
about dying in the fire.

293
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,280
It's a big decision
how one prefers to die.

294
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,240
Would you like to meet my son?
Derek.

295
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,800
Derek's living in the basement
since his divorce, if that's okay.

296
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,600
Hey, Mom.

297
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,840
- Let's go, Ma.
- I want just a minute.

298
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,720
I never...

299
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
Forgive me, dear. I can't cry.

300
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,320
I don't know what it is,
but I can't cry.

301
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,600
It seems to me
that you're just on another trip.

302
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,200
I keep expecting you.
Why did you do it?

303
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,200
I search and I search
and I can't understand it.

304
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,640
I made the last payment
on the house today.

305
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,320
We're free and clear.
We're free. We're free.

306
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,400
- Well done.
- Bravo.

307
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,960
- Well done. It was very successful.
- I thought it was wonderful.

308
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Why did the older people
look so young?

309
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,720
It was a choice, Dad.
I'll explain later.

310
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,920
I can't get excited about your restaging
someone else's old play, it just...

311
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,560
There's nothing personal in it.

312
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,040
People are coming out of the theater
crying.

313
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,520
Great. Be a fucking tool
of suburban, blue-haired...

314
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,360
...regional-theater subscribers.

315
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,240
- You didn't you think it was long?
- No.

316
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
But what are you leaving behind?

317
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,160
You act as if you have forever
to figure it out.

318
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,720
When you're dead, there's no time.
The world is...

319
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
I don't know.
I slept maybe three hours.

320
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,360
So we're both tired.

321
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
No, I cuddled with Olive all night.
It was great.

322
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,560
Morning. Morning.

323
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,760
- Morning, Caden.
- I think I might have arthritis.

324
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,400
Friends on fire.

325
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
I'm going to.

326
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,240
No, I know exactly.
Okay, I will. I'll call you later.

327
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,600
I know. You're right. Bye.

328
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
My joints are stiff.

329
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
Who was that?

330
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,480
- Maria.
- Right.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,560
Three hours since you spoke.

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,240
Caden, I think I wanna go to Berlin
with just Olive.

333
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,400
- I think it would be good for us.
- Oh, Christ.

334
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,400
Morning, kiddos.

335
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,560
Why don't you want me to go?

336
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,840
You know, I think it would be a good
thing for the two of us to do alone.

337
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,520
How do you think I'm supposed
to respond to something like that?

338
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
- Want me to zip your coat up?
- Yeah.

339
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,440
What's wrong with your face,
Daddy?

340
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,720
It's pustules.

341
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,800
It's called sycosis.

342
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,880
Spelled differently than "psychosis,"
but it sounds the same.

343
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,600
I don't know what that means.

344
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,240
Of course not.

345
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,280
Well, there are two kinds of psychosis.
They're spelled differently.

346
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,960
P-S-Y is like if you're crazy,
like Mama.

347
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,720
S-Y is like these ugly things
on my face.

348
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,560
- You could have both, though.
- I could, but I don't.

349
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,920
Can I ask you something, Ad?

350
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,480
Have I disappointed you somehow?

351
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,560
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're just spending a little time apart.

352
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,880
We'll talk when I get back, okay?

353
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
Everyone is disappointing.
The more you know someone, it just...

354
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,880
This whole romantic-love thing,
it's just a projection anyway, right?

355
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,320
I mean, I don't know.

356
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

357
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,960
I love you.

358
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,760
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know.

359
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,280
We'll talk when I get back.

360
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,480
Okay?

361
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,680
Flurostatin TR
allows you to live life...

362
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,600
...when it's your turn to face
the challenges of chemotherapy.

363
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,040
Ask your doctor
if Flurostatin TR is right for you.

364
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,480
- And I'm on the first train
out of Palookaville.

365
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
- The Miracle Brush
can scour everything from bottles...

366
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
- Rise and shine...
- Lift those legs...

367
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,080
- I'm lonely.
- Yes. Anything else?

368
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,680
- I'm hurt.
- Yes. And?

369
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
I think Adele's right.
I'm not doing anything real...

370
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,920
What would be real?

371
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

372
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,600
I don't know what's wrong with me.

373
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,080
I wanna do something important
while I'm still here.

374
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,440
That would be the time to do it. I have
a book that might help you get better.

375
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,280
- Better?
- It's called Getting Better.

376
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,400
- Who wrote it?
- I did. All of these.

377
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,800
- Wow, I never knew that.
- Yes. Well, wow, indeed.

378
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,800
In conclusion... Cats eat rats...

379
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Within his own plumbing...
Me who am as a raw nerve...

380
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,560
Synthetic vaginal juices...
Substantial crease...

381
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,320
That's $45.

382
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,120
Five. Five.

383
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,080
Five.

384
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,920
Some fives. That's not good.

385
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,920
Keep with the flossing.
We'll see you in three months.

386
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,080
Six. Six. Six.

387
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,800
I'm gonna recommend
you see a periodontist.

388
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,000
He'll probably recommend
gum surgery.

389
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,240
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm so glad I finally got you.

390
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,400
- Hello, who is this?
- It's Caden.

391
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,320
Ellen?

392
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,280
It's Caden. I can't wait to see you
and Olive on the 12th...

393
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,160
No, I have to go.
I'm sorry, there's a party. I'm famous.

394
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,640
Have fun...

395
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,440
911, state your emergency.

396
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,560
- I'm sick! I'm sick!
- Ma'am?

397
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280
Mr. Cotard?

398
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
Mr. Cotard.

399
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,520
You've had a seizure of sorts.

400
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
What does that mean?

401
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Seems to be some synaptic
degradation, fungal in origin.

402
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
Autonomic functions
are going haywire.

403
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,080
You'll lose your ability
to salivate, cry, et cetera.

404
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,320
- Is it serious?
- We don't know. But, yes.

405
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,200
We'll get you enrolled
in some biofeedback program.

406
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,160
Maybe you can learn
some sort of manual override.

407
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,720
We should get a drink.
It would be fun.

408
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,480
- It would be weird.
- I like weird. I like you. See?

409
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,440
Anyway, I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable, I...

410
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay, so I do
wanna make you uncomfortable.

411
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,800
And what do we do with all this?

412
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,920
You wanna come over to my place,
Cotard?

413
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,440
I won't let you off the hook this time
by saying, "Never mind."

414
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,040
Adele is only on vacation.

415
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,520
She hasn't called since she left.
It's been a year.

416
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,200
It's been a week.

417
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,440
I'm gonna buy you a calendar.

418
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,400
Okay.

419
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,840
Just for one drink.

420
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,280
Come on. Scraps for my scrapbook.

421
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,520
I can't... I really can't drink very much
because of my condition.

422
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,400
Did you put something in it?

423
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,640
If that's what it takes,
consider it done.

424
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,560
Love potion number 69.

425
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,880
- It's good.
- Does it make you wanna kiss me?

426
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,400
- Kind of.
- Tell me why.

427
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Because I feel a lot of longing.

428
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,600
Beg a girl, why don't you?

429
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,600
- Please, Hazel.
- On your knees.

430
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,760
What?

431
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,600
I want you to beg me
on your knees for a kiss.

432
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,280
Just for fun.

433
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
Why am I doing this?

434
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,560
For fun, baby.

435
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,840
Will you help me
forget my troubles?

436
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,120
Oh, kiddo.

437
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,240
You don't even know.

438
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,720
- What?
- I don't know.

439
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,960
- What is it?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

440
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm sorry.

441
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,000
- What?
- I don't know, I'm just...

442
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm just really confused.

443
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm sorry.

444
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,960
I...

445
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm really sick.

446
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
And I think I'm dying.

447
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,200
I have a kid, and I'm married.

448
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,800
I just thought
this might change things, you know?

449
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,480
I had a good time,
and I think you're a very nice person.

450
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,320
That is just the wrong thing
to say right now, Caden.

451
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,160
You should go.

452
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

453
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,760
Hi. You know,
I haven't heard from you in a while...

454
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,440
...and I just thought I'd call
and say hi.

455
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,360
Hi, Hazel.

456
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,840
Now. Now. Be here now.

457
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,080
Olive wanted me to ask you
not to read her diary.

458
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,680
She left it under her pillow
by mistake.

459
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,040
Dear Mr. Cotard,
it is my pleasure to inform you...

460
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,920
...that you have been named
a 2009 MacArthur Fellow.

461
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,240
It is our hope that you will use
your newly found financial freedom...

462
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,360
...to create something unflinchingly
true, profoundly beautiful...

463
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,280
...and of unremitting value
to your community and to the world.

464
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,200
- I got this MacArthur grant.
- Oh, Caden.

465
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,920
- Yeah, a lot of money.
- Know what you're gonna do with it?

466
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,280
Theater piece.
Something big and true and tough.

467
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,600
I'm gonna finally put my real self
into something.

468
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,840
What is your real self, do you think?

469
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,520
I don't know yet.

470
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,320
The MacArthur is called
"the genius grant"...

471
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,400
...and I wanna earn it.

472
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,080
That's wonderful. God bless.

473
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,440
I guess you'll have to discover
your real self, right?

474
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,080
Yeah.

475
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,040
I wanted to ask you, how old are kids
when they start to write?

476
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,960
There's an absolutely brilliant novel
written by a 4-year-old.

477
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,640
- Really?
- Little Winky by Horace Azpiazu.

478
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
- That's cute.
- Oh, hardly.

479
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,840
Little Winky
is a virulent anti-Semite.

480
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,080
The story follows his initiation
into the Klan...

481
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,040
...his immersion
in the pornographic snuff industry...

482
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,320
...and his ultimate degradation
at the hands of a black ex-convict...

483
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,040
...named Eric Washington Jackson
Jones Johnson...

484
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,080
- Written by a 4-year-old?
...Jefferson.

485
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,240
Written by a 4-year-old?

486
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,560
Well, Azpiazu killed himself
when he was 5.

487
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,560
- Why did he kill himself?
- I don't know. Why did you?

488
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,160
What?

489
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,080
I said, why would you?

490
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,320
Oh, I don't know.

491
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,600
Yeah, I wanna bring my production
to New York...

492
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,560
...to get it seen by people,
you know, who matter.

493
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,400
- The sooner the better.
- This theater, centrally located.

494
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,320
Heart of the theater district,
so, you know, great for plays.

495
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,680
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There it is.

496
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,640
- What was this used for?
- Plays.

497
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,000
- Like, theater plays?
- Shakespeare.

498
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,480
King Lear.

499
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,640
The storm.

500
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,360
You see, the idea
is to do a massive theater piece.

501
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,680
You know, uncompromising, honest.

502
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
Here's what I think theater is.
It's the beginning of thought.

503
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,920
It's the truth not yet spoken.

504
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,600
It's what a man feels like
after he's been clocked in the jaw.

505
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,040
It's love in all its messiness.

506
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,160
You know, and I want all of us,
players and patrons alike...

507
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,080
...to soak
in the communal bath of it...

508
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,920
...the mikvah, as the Jews call it.

509
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,360
Because we're all in the same water,
after all.

510
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,600
You know, soaking
in our very menstrual blood...

511
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,520
...and nocturnal emissions.

512
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,680
This is what I wanna try
to give people.

513
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,000
Okay, here you go.
Here's your salad.

514
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,520
- Here's your soup.
- Thanks.

515
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,760
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

516
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,240
- What are you doing?
- Salivating.

517
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,360
The biofeedback training.

518
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,960
- So I was wondering if you'd help.
- In your box office?

519
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,880
No, as my assistant.

520
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,640
I'm not sure I can work with you,
Caden.

521
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,240
I'm kind of angry.

522
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,200
I just wanna normalize it.

523
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,280
I think we'd have a lot of fun
together.

524
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,320
I miss you.

525
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,720
- Really disturbing.
- I know.

526
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,720
Dear diary, thank you
for being my new best friend.

527
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,480
My name is Olive Cotard,
and I'm 4 years old.

528
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,920
I like chocolate,
and my favorite color is pink.

529
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,240
This is pink.

530
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,800
Yeah, that's good.

531
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,800
- Next.
- Hi.

532
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,040
We'll start by talking honestly...

533
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,920
...and out of that,
a piece of theater will evolve.

534
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
I'll begin.

535
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,880
I've been thinking a lot
about dying lately.

536
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,920
- You're gonna be fine, sweetie.
- Well, I appreciate that, Claire, but...

537
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,120
You are, you poor thing.

538
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,600
Yeah, well, regardless of how
this particular thing works itself out...

539
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,720
...I will be dying.

540
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,080
And so will you.

541
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
And so will everyone here.

542
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,840
And that's what I wanna explore.

543
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,360
We're all hurtling towards death.

544
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,320
Yet here we are,
for the moment, alive...

545
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,120
...each of us knowing
we're gonna die...

546
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,640
...each of us
secretly believing we won't.

547
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,880
It's brilliant.

548
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,880
It's everything.

549
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
It's Karamazov.

550
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,280
- Stop.
- I'm just asking.

551
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,000
- You're so obnoxious.
- You're so obnoxious.

552
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,080
- You do not wanna cross me.
- Don't I?

553
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,080
Hi, Claire.

554
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,680
- Hi.
- Hazel.

555
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah. No, no. I know, I know. Hazel.
You're the box office.

556
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,120
- Yeah, I'm the box office.
- How are you?

557
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,440
Wonderful. You?

558
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,440
Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm fine.
Thank you.

559
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,360
Actually, I'm meeting Caden here.
You know Mr. Cotard, right?

560
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,160
Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard.

561
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,160
Yeah. I'm waiting...

562
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,080
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden.

563
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,040
- Hi, Caden.
- Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.

564
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,960
Hi.

565
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,920
- This is Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

566
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,720
- Hi, Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

567
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Hi.

568
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,920
Well, we'll leave you be.
It's nice to see you again.

569
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,720
- Take care.
- Why am I bowing? Okay, bye.

570
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,120
- That was awkward.
- Yeah, I guess.

571
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Do you like beaver...?

572
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,520
So could you tell me maybe
what it is that you want from me?

573
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,680
You know, like, from my character.

574
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,440
Well, we'll build it over time
together.

575
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,520
You know, try to find a real person,
maybe, to model it after.

576
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,920
That Hazel girl's
kind of interesting maybe.

577
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,720
- You know, like, why...?
- Although...

578
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,200
Why is she still working
at a box office at her age?

579
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,320
I don't know.
Probably not that interesting.

580
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,360
Maybe she wanted to be an actress,
but she lacked the confidence.

581
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,680
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.
- I'm so excited.

582
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,400
Really? Why?

583
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,480
Because I think that it's brave.

584
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,040
And I just feel like
I'm gonna be part of a revolution.

585
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
I keep thinking about Artaud,
Krapp's Last Tape...

586
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,360
...you know, and Grotowski,
for chrissake.

587
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,560
I don't know what I'm doing.

588
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,000
But that's what so refreshing.

589
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,320
Knowing that you don't know...

590
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,720
...is the first and the most essential
step to knowing, you know?

591
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,480
I don't know.

592
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,440
- Well, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

593
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,480
- Don't say that, not to me.
- Oh, sorry.

594
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,280
My mother died last night.

595
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:39,680
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
What are you doing out?

596
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,160
- This is me.
- Well...

597
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,080
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, God, did I just say "meeting"?

598
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,040
- I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.
- Slip of the tongue, is all.

599
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,840
Yeah, it's a Freudian slip, right?

600
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,840
I don't know how it's Freudian.

601
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,680
To meet, you know? Like, to meet.

602
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,400
There she met Ralph Keene.
They fell in love, married...

603
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,920
...and soon their first child,
Claire, was born.

604
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,120
I used to be a baby.

605
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,000
Claire Elizabeth Keene
was a joyous child...

606
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,760
- I'm sorry.
...the apple of her mother's eye.

607
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,280
She made her parents proud with her
politeness and gymnastic skills.

608
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,520
God, you're beautiful.

609
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,520
When she was 7, little Claire
was bitten by the acting bug.

610
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,320
She starred
in almost every school musical...

611
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,600
...playing Ado Annie in Oklahoma...

612
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,400
...Adelaide in Guys And Dolls,
and Maria in The Sound Of Music.

613
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,000
I have to fuck you. I have to.

614
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,920
There will be no other before you.

615
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,160
I'd like to buy a ticket, please.

616
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,680
- Okay. Hold it.
- That'll be $40.

617
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,520
We're not really...
We need to investigate.

618
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,280
You know, to really discover
the essence of each being.

619
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,000
You know, I think I need to work
with both of you separately.

620
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,240
Davis, I'll start with you.

621
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,920
I liked the beginning.
I don't wanna see a good scene...

622
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,680
"Davis, I'll start with you"?

623
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,040
There's a difference between favoring
me and pretending we've never met.

624
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,960
I mean, we've had Ariel.
I think people know that we've fucked.

625
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,560
We'll talk about your character
after we put Ariel to bed, okay?

626
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,320
Okay.

627
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,160
I think I made a breakthrough.

628
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,840
- This character is so beautiful...
- Yeah, I have to go find my daughter.

629
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,240
- Your daughter's right here.
- My real daughter.

630
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,040
- Excuse me?
- I mean, my first daughter, Olive.

631
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,080
- I have to go find her.
- Please don't do this to us.

632
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,480
She's tattooed. She's tattooed.

633
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,200
Oh, everyone is tattooed.

634
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,080
Oh, I've never seen that before.

635
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,120
- You have responsibilities.
- Yeah, I'll be quick. I'll do it quick.

636
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,120
Redundancy is fluid.
Life moves to the south.

637
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,760
There is only the now,
and I am always with you.

638
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,160
For example, look to your left.

639
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,200
Hi.

640
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,440
When you canceled, it freed me up,
so I'm traveling too.

641
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,200
You know,
I'm not sure I'm getting the book.

642
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,240
Oh, but it's getting you.
You're almost non-recognizable now.

643
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,960
Thank you.

644
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,080
I show you my leg. I stand close,
and you inhale my perfume.

645
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,760
I offer my ripe flower to you
and you deny it.

646
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,200
This book is over.

647
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,320
Hi.

648
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,080
I don't speak German.

649
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,400
Yeah, yeah. I may help you, mister?

650
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,840
I'm looking for Adele Cotard.
Adele Lack.

651
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,880
We must not give addresses
or other personal informations.

652
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,560
- I'm her husband.
- No, you are not her husbands...

653
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,920
...which is named Gunther
und Heinz.

654
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,480
I'm the father of her daughter, Olive.

655
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,680
I see. I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

656
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,560
Dear diary, Germany is wonderful.
So many friends here.

657
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,880
My new dads are great
and handsome...

658
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,200
...and brilliant directors of theater.

659
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,960
Hello.

660
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,400
You're here?

661
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,680
Yeah. I live with Adele and Olive
and Gunther and Heinz...

662
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,880
...and Uschi and Britt.
I'm everyone's nanny.

663
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,120
I wanna see my daughter.

664
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,680
- Yeah, they sent me.
- They?

665
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,760
Who are they?
Who the fuck are Uschi and Britt?

666
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,440
Yeah, they decided it's not time
to see you yet.

667
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,080
They decided? Who decided?
They had her tattooed.

668
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,520
Oh, I did that. Olive is my project...

669
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,880
She's a 4-year-old!

670
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,640
She's a fucking 4-year-old!

671
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,480
She's almost over 11 now.

672
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,960
She's my muse.

673
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,400
I love her.

674
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,120
You don't love her!

675
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,720
Where is she?

676
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,720
What did you do to my daughter?

677
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,360
Death comes faster than you think.

678
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,840
- That was your last patient for the day.
- Let's stop this charade.

679
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,040
I don't know
what you're talking about, doctor.

680
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,480
You're actually having an affair
off set.

681
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,280
- Palpable, huh?
- Oh, okay.

682
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,800
- Who told you?
- And it's not good.

683
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,360
- Not good, oh, okay.
- You're actors playing actors.

684
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,880
You're in this scene, you're not
just filming it. You're in this scene.

685
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,120
Just like that...

686
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,080
As you're telling him this,
you realize you're attracted to him.

687
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,640
How are you gonna let him know?

688
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,920
And the guilt you feel about telling him
about somebody else knowing.

689
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,920
Daddy, Daddy is mine.

690
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,320
Daddy can't play now, honey.

691
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,840
Daddy doesn't live with us anymore,
baby. He had to go find himself.

692
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,400
They still feel a little tight in the toe.

693
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,560
Have an argument.
You're having an argument. Have it.

694
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,520
- I don't buy it.
- You, sir, are a horse's ass.

695
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,080
What? Just get the fucking shoe.
You gave me two sizes too big.

696
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,920
Tom, don't turn into another person
just because I say change your action.

697
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,360
And this started just today?
It never happened before?

698
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
Okay. Good.

699
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,920
You can get dressed.

700
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,120
I mean, you're a doctor, right?
Am I dying? Can you tell me that?

701
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,800
- No.
- No, you can't tell me?

702
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,120
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me if you can't tell me?

703
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,000
- No.
- No, you can't tell me...

704
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,760
...because you're not allowed to?
- No.

705
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,440
- Caden.
- What are you doing here?

706
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,720
I was wondering
if I was gonna bump into you.

707
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,840
- You look great.
- Thanks.

708
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,360
- Is that a new haircut?
- Yeah. For a while now.

709
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,160
What are you doing in New York?

710
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,560
I'm here with Derek and the boys.
A mini vacation.

711
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,960
- The boys?
- Yeah. I thought you knew.

712
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,560
- How old?
- Five.

713
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,920
Twins. Robert and Daniel and Alan.

714
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,520
Yes.

715
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,320
They're nice names.
Where are they?

716
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,760
Derek took them to the Natural History
so I could shop.

717
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,920
It's so good to see you, Caden.
L... How are things?

718
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,360
You know, I was with Claire.

719
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,320
And we have a daughter.
But we're separated.

720
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,240
How about with you?

721
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,720
Good. I have a great job
at Lens Shapers.

722
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,640
Shapers. Great. You wear a lab coat.

723
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,480
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Hazel.

724
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,240
Hey! What are you doing?

725
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,640
- I got you.
- Let me go.

726
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,880
How I love Maria.

727
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,360
She is so much more of a father
than Caden ever was...

728
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,680
...with his drinking and unfortunate
body odor and rotting teeth.

729
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,640
I could only loathe him,
and perhaps pity him.

730
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,680
But Maria.

731
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,840
I wanna come back.

732
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,480
I wanna take care of you and Olive.
Ariel. Ariel. Fuck.

733
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,960
Ariel.

734
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,800
No, no, no, it's so late. Please.

735
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,120
No, no, no. Please.

736
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,240
Hello?

737
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,880
Okay.

738
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,160
My father died.

739
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,480
Oh, baby.

740
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,040
They said his body was riddled
with cancer and that he didn't know.

741
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,360
That he went in
because his finger hurt.

742
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,200
They said he suffered horribly.

743
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,680
And that he...

744
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,080
That he called out for me
before he died.

745
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,760
They said that he said
he regretted his life.

746
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,640
And they said he said a lot of things.

747
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,560
Too many to recount.

748
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,920
They said it was the longest...

749
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:40,120
...and saddest deathbed speech
any of them had ever heard.

750
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,080
There was so little left of him...

751
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,800
...they had to fill the coffin
with cotton balls...

752
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,320
...to keep him from rattling around.

753
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,280
I'm really sorry for your loss.

754
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,520
Thank you.
Can you excuse me a moment?

755
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,120
- Of course.
- I need to use the bathroom.

756
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,920
- All right.
- Okay.

757
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,520
God bless you and your family.

758
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,880
God bless you. Will you excuse me?

759
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,800
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

760
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,160
It's left five people dead.

761
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,880
Sorry.

762
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,360
- Caden?
- Hi, Derek.

763
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,720
Officials suspect arson.

764
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,360
In other news,
German pharmaceutical giant...

765
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,520
...has won its libel suit
against patients...

766
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,840
...claiming chromosomal damage
from use of the arthritis medication...

767
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,240
Will you just tell me what to do?

768
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,040
In Pakistan today, the government...

769
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,640
Caden, everyone has to figure out
their own life, you know.

770
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,520
I just want you to look at me
the way you used to.

771
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,960
Oh, honey, I can't anymore.

772
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,400
You know I'm sorry.

773
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,920
I screwed everything up,
and I don't have any courage.

774
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,520
- And I'm sorry.
- Caden.

775
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,520
- I'm okay.
- I don't want you to be okay.

776
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,400
I mean, I do, but it just...

777
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,840
It rips my guts out.

778
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,960
I'll help you through any way I can.

779
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,800
And I'll help you through too.

780
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,840
I'm fine.

781
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,080
I have Derek.

782
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,360
Okay, I'm going.

783
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,920
Honey, I'm coming.

784
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,000
Dear diary, today I felt a wetness
between my legs.

785
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,120
Maria explained to me
now I am a woman.

786
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,720
And being a woman is wonderful
with Maria to guide me.

787
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,120
Olive?

788
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,360
Olive.

789
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:21,840
Olive, it's Daddy.

790
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,120
Olive, it's Daddy! Olive, it's Daddy!

791
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,480
Don't fucking stare at me! Olive!

792
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,120
Get off! It's my daughter!
That's my daughter!

793
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,000
Get off! Get off!

794
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,200
I won't settle for anything less
than the brutal truth.

795
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,640
Brutal. Brutal.

796
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:56,240
Each day I'll hand you a paper. It'll tell
you what happened to you that day.

797
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,840
You felt a lump in your breast.

798
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,520
You looked at your wife
and saw a stranger, et cetera.

799
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,240
- Caden?
- What?

800
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,160
When are we gonna
get an audience in here?

801
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,800
It's been 17 years.

802
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,120
All right, I'm not excusing myself
from this either.

803
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,360
I will have someone play me...

804
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,080
...to delve into the murky,
cowardly depths...

805
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,240
...of my lonely, fucked-up being.

806
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,440
And he'll get notes too,
and those notes will correspond...

807
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,760
...to the notes I truly receive
every day from my god.

808
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,360
Get to work!

809
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,120
They fired me.

810
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,320
- I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis.
- Oh, God.

811
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,840
I didn't wash my hands.
I had pinkeye hands.

812
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,520
- Oh, God.
- I'm a stupid cow.

813
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,400
Fucking private Christian school
is killing us. You know, it's not cheap.

814
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,360
It's Derek's thing.
I don't believe in that shit, you know.

815
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,080
You try to be a good person.
I mean, that's all there is.

816
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,320
Do you have anything for me,
Caden?

817
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,440
I mean, I already have an assistant.

818
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,040
- I don't have a box office yet, but...
- Please, caden.

819
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,160
Please, Caden. I...

820
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,320
Please, Caden.

821
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,760
Sammy Barnathan?

822
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,120
Sit. Sammy Barnathan.

823
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,600
I don't have a rsum or a picture.

824
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,920
- I've never worked as an actor.
- Good. Tell me why you're here.

825
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,080
Well, I've been...

826
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,960
I've been following you for 20 years.

827
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,360
So I knew about this audition
because I follow you.

828
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,400
And I've learned everything about you
by following you.

829
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,800
So hire me,
and you'll see who you truly are.

830
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,800
Peekaboo.

831
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,000
Okay.

832
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,440
Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to
anyone else. This guy has me down.

833
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,560
I'm gonna cast him right now.
Then maybe you and I can get a drink.

834
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,040
And we can try to figure out
this thing between us...

835
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,000
...why I cried.

836
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:11,280
Because I've never felt about anybody
the way I feel about you.

837
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,080
And I wanna fuck you
until we merge into a chimera...

838
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,200
...a mythical beast with penis
and vagina eternally fused...

839
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,680
...two pairs of eyes
that look only at each other...

840
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,920
...and lips ever touching.

841
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,120
And one voice that whispers to itself.

842
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,840
Okay.

843
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,840
Yeah. You've got the part.

844
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,520
I've never seen your shit gray.

845
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,320
It's new.

846
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,840
That's a good boy.

847
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,440
- When is it opening?
- When it's ready.

848
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,480
- We need to get in. It's bad out here.
- Sorry.

849
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,360
You know, I was thinking
of calling it Simulacrum.

850
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,120
I don't even know what it means.

851
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,800
Can I have a nickel if I doesn't play
with my pee-pee no more?

852
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:53,000
Yeah.

853
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,680
How about
The Flawed Light of Love and Grief?

854
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,280
I'm not sure.

855
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,000
Claire, I want you to play yourself.

856
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,800
Sammy's gonna move
into your apartment set as me.

857
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,120
It would be my honor
to play your husband, Claire.

858
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,120
You're an amazing actress.

859
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,000
No, I saw you do Bernarda Alba
last year at the Roundabout.

860
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,040
Yeah?

861
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,120
That was a fun play.

862
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,040
Emotionally, it was tough,
but fucking fulfilling.

863
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,440
Plus, I loved working
with so many strong female actresses.

864
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,280
I'm gonna start thinking
about myself.

865
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,280
Start, huh?

866
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,400
Who is Claire Keen?
Claire Keen. Claire Keen.

867
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,400
- Why did we leave Adele, Caden?
- Claire Keen. Well...

868
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,240
She left us.

869
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,400
You know that better than anybody.

870
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,080
Except me.

871
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,280
An amazing artist though.
The best living artist.

872
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,960
I mean, there's no one who stares
the truth in the face like she does.

873
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,840
Sweet pussy too.

874
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,080
How do you know that?

875
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,520
I read it.

876
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,600
Anyway...

877
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,040
I mean, I don't know where she is.

878
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,760
Well, maybe she's got a sublet
in New York.

879
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Maybe she's got a retrospective
at the Met. Maybe, baby.

880
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,440
Why are you giving me this?

881
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,040
I wanna follow you there and see
how you lose even more of yourself.

882
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,920
Research.

883
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,920
You know, for the part.

884
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,400
Partner.

885
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,600
Hold it. Hold it, please.

886
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,560
Hold it, please.

887
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,040
I asked you to hold the door.

888
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,080
I'm sorry. I pressed the button,
but I think it was too late.

889
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,000
You didn't press it.

890
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,760
- Have a good night.
- Yeah, thanks.

891
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,120
- Are you Ellen? Ellen?
- What?

892
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,120
- Are you Ellen Bascomb?
- What?

893
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:23,600
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

894
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
Yes, I'm Ellen.

895
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,920
She said you should just go ahead
and get started.

896
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:32,240
- And don't forget to change the sheets.
- Okay, thanks.

897
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,400
Oh, sweetheart.

898
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:58,520
Adele?

899
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:07,920
Hi, Ellen. Be a doll and do the sheets
and whatever's in the hamper.

900
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,920
Your money's under the toaster.
Kisses, Adele.

901
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,800
P.S. Bag of stuff in bedroom closet
for Goodwill. Take what you want.

902
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,640
Went for a walk. I had to think.

903
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,920
All night?

904
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,520
You smell weird.
Are you wearing lipstick?

905
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,240
No.

906
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,040
What do I smell like?

907
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,960
Like bad? Like an old person?

908
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,120
I don't know.
Like mold and cleaning products.

909
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,120
Like you're menstruating.
I don't know.

910
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,840
Menstruating?

911
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,400
You tell me.

912
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,160
I don't menstruate. I don't know how
I could smell like I'm menstruating.

913
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,880
I wouldn't know.

914
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,760
I don't like the guy you got
to play you.

915
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,920
You don't like Sammy? Why?
I think he's good.

916
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,080
Fuck you. I'm 45 years old.
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.

917
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,160
He's the best thing in the play
except you.

918
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,040
He's coming on to me.
He's grabbing my ass in rehearsal.

919
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,760
- He's your husband.
- Good, Jimmy.

920
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,560
He's not my goddamn husband.
You are.

921
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,040
What the fuck is wrong with you?

922
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,760
- I'm going to rehearsal.
- It's about the play.

923
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,920
- We're getting at something real here.
- That's great, you guys.

924
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,840
Beautiful, Sammy.

925
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,040
- Caden? Time-out?
- Yeah.

926
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,720
What's up?

927
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,520
Well, I feel we need a Hazel in here.

928
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,240
I mean, there's a whole side of Caden
I can't explore without a Hazel.

929
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,680
- I guess, yeah.
- I get to be a character?

930
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,200
Yeah.

931
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,280
Hi, Ellen.
Crackerjack job last night.

932
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,640
Would you do sheets again?

933
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,840
We had quite a fuck,
and it's musky and gross. Kisses, A.

934
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,560
Hi, Adele. Relined the cabinets.

935
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,760
I just wanted to let you know
I won a MacArthur Grant.

936
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,600
And I'm mounting a play which
I think is gonna be pure and truthful.

937
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,640
Best, Ellen.

938
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,120
I went for a walk. I had to think.

939
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,760
Caden, what are you doing at night?

940
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,880
I have a right to fucking know.

941
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,960
I've been going to Adele's place.

942
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,560
And cleaning it.

943
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,480
Do you have any idea
what I've given up for you? For this?

944
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,200
For you? For you?
Could you please get that?

945
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,800
- This looks serious. Am I interrupting?
- What's going on, Hazel?

946
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,720
I just wanted you to know
that the actress playing me...

947
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,400
...is ready to start today.

948
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,600
That's great. That's all we need
around here, is two Hazels.

949
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,160
Okay, I'll take that as my cue.

950
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,000
- Maybe you could clean her toilet.
- Maybe I will.

951
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,840
This is over.

952
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,120
- No, Claire...
- I'm not talking to you.

953
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,240
I didn't say I was gonna
clean Hazel's toilet. He did.

954
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,040
- But you thought it!
- I thought it, but I didn't say it.

955
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,960
I got an offer to do
Needleman in a Haystack.

956
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,560
And I'm gonna take it.
I want you out of the apartment.

957
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,360
The real one. You can keep this one.

958
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,960
Claire.

959
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,960
Jesus. Claire.

960
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,560
Hi, yeah, we're gonna need
a Claire replacement.

961
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,000
Claire, I didn't say it.

962
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,400
I already put out a call
for a Claire replacement.

963
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,960
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

964
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,040
Just like that?
You don't give a guy even a chance?

965
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,560
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl, remember?

966
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,280
I try and be fun-loving, see?

967
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,160
Sorry.

968
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,040
My analyst says
you have complexes.

969
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,520
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

970
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,680
- That's before my analyst taught me...
- This is the last of my stuff.

971
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:58,920
- Bye.
- Bye. From the top?

972
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,320
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

973
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,920
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

974
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,240
I'm sorry. Okay.

975
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,640
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

976
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,440
But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to move on.

977
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,680
Just like that?
You don't give a guy a chance?

978
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,080
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl.

979
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,520
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

980
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,480
That's before my analyst taught me...

981
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,840
This is a lie.

982
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,040
Come here.
I try to be fun-loving, see?

983
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,600
- She told me your hatred of...
- Will.

984
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,640
Wall it up. All of it.

985
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,680
Claire.

986
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,640
Oh, Needleman.

987
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,040
All right.

988
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,560
Good for you with your grant.

989
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,680
Listen, I fixed up the walk-in
as a sort of bedroom if you want.

990
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,920
We'd love to have you...

991
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,760
...and you wouldn't have to schlep
all the way to Queens.

992
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:29,880
It's just a thought. Kisses, A.

993
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,480
Dear diary, I'm afraid I'm gravely ill.

994
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,760
It is perhaps times like these
that one reflects on things past.

995
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,360
An article of clothing
from when I was young.

996
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,880
A green jacket.
A walk with my father.

997
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,800
A game we once played.
Pretend we're fairies.

998
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,440
I'm a girl fairy,
and my name is Lauralee...

999
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,800
...and you're a boy fairy,
and your name is Teetery.

1000
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,080
Pretend when we're fairies,
we fight each other.

1001
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,520
And I say, "Stop hitting me or I'll die."
And you hit me again, and I say:

1002
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,240
"Now I have to die."
And you say, "But I'll miss you."

1003
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,840
And I say, "But I have to.

1004
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,200
And you'll have to wait a million years
to see me again.

1005
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:18,760
And I'll be put in a box...

1006
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,680
...and all I'll need
is a tiny glass of water...

1007
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,720
...and lots of tiny pieces of pizza.

1008
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,400
And the box will have wings
like an airplane."

1009
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,280
And you ask,
"Where will it take you?"

1010
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,360
"Home," I say.

1011
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,200
This is to hear.

1012
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:55,400
- So words... English here, yeah?
- Okay.

1013
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,120
I'm dying...

1014
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,760
...as I'm sure Maria told you.

1015
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,240
The flower tattoos have become
infected and they're dying.

1016
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:17,880
So I am as well. This is life.

1017
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,200
It's Maria. She did this.

1018
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,920
Maria gave me a reason to live
once you left.

1019
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:26,960
The flowers defined me.

1020
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,280
Your mother and Maria
took you away.

1021
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,480
I've tried for years to find you.
I didn't leave you.

1022
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,120
I want to talk to you
about your homosexuality.

1023
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,600
- I'm not a homosexual.
- Maria said you would deny it.

1024
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,960
Well, she's a liar. She's lying to you.

1025
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,480
I had the same struggle
when I first fell in love with Maria...

1026
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,000
...and we began to have dirty,
aching sex.

1027
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,320
Maria is your lover?

1028
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,800
Of course.
She introduced me to myself...

1029
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,160
...to my vagina and to hers.

1030
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:01,520
You have no idea how evil she is.

1031
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,080
I need to forgive you before I die...

1032
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,760
...but I can't forgive someone
who has not asked for forgiveness.

1033
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,360
- I just want...
- I have no time.

1034
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,040
I need you to ask for forgiveness.

1035
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,120
Can you ever forgive me?

1036
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
- For what?
- For abandoning you.

1037
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,280
For abandoning you
to have anal sex...

1038
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,240
...with my homosexual lover, Eric.

1039
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,120
I will, I'll say it.

1040
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,240
For abandoning you...

1041
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:45,960
...to have anal sex
with my homosexual lover, Eric.

1042
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,480
No.

1043
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,000
No, I'm sorry.

1044
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,120
I cannot.

1045
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,120
I hope you are happy, faggot.

1046
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:29,120
I'm not happy. I'm not happy.

1047
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,800
I've talked to you before. This is not
a play about dating. It's about death.

1048
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,040
Make it personal. Move along.

1049
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,560
He doesn't need to yell at them.

1050
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,120
It is a play about dating.
It's not a play just about death.

1051
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,200
It's about everything.

1052
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,640
Dating, birth, death, life, family...

1053
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,320
...all that.

1054
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,600
- This doesn't look real.
- What?

1055
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,120
- It's not real.
- I can't hear you.

1056
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,440
- Morning, Haze.
- Hi, Caden. How was your night?

1057
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,440
It was okay. Yours?

1058
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,560
Phillip was colicky.
I was up all night.

1059
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,360
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1060
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,000
- Everybody here?
- Sammy's not here.

1061
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:34,000
Jimmy called and said
there's some subway problem.

1062
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,560
Sorry. Sorry.

1063
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,480
- Hi, Hazel.
- Hi, Sammy.

1064
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,680
Sammy likes you.

1065
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,080
I need you to build this.
This is just the faade.

1066
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,240
It's Adele's place.
We'll be casting an Ellen.

1067
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,080
I can give you the interiors later.

1068
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,240
A few days?

1069
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,600
- Can I look again?
- A slight shift in perspective on this.

1070
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,960
Millicent Weems?

1071
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,320
- Caden, this is...
- Hazel, what do you think of this title?

1072
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,400
Unknown, Unkissed and Lost?

1073
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,600
Anyway, this is Millicent Weems.

1074
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,800
Have a seat.

1075
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,280
How are you at cleaning?

1076
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,160
- Very, very good at it.
- This part requires a lot of it.

1077
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,800
You'd be playing a cleaning lady.

1078
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,520
I played Egga, the cleaning lady,
in Hedda Gabler at the Roundabout.

1079
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,840
Great. Okay.

1080
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,480
And Mrs. Dobson in Scrub-A-Dub
at the Pantages.

1081
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:13,320
You're weirdly close
to what I visualize for this character.

1082
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,120
Glad to be weirdly close.

1083
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,280
Sorry, everybody.

1084
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,800
- Maurice, what's going on?
- I'm sorry.

1085
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,800
We have a couple of new guys on.
We're not in sync yet.

1086
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,320
- We good to go?
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,760
I'm sorry.

1088
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:42,880
Fuck.

1089
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,080
Are you Ellen?
Are you Ellen Bascomb?

1090
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,680
Shit.

1091
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,440
Line, please?

1092
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,440
Ellen..."What?"

1093
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,640
Right, right. What?

1094
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,080
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

1095
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,040
Yes, I'm Ellen.

1096
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,080
Oh, dear. It's the wrong key.

1097
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,600
I'll be in, in a second.

1098
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,360
- Did you hear that?
- What?

1099
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,240
- You're breaking the fourth wall.
- This is the wrong key.

1100
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,400
- I'm supposed to open the door.
- Hold on.

1101
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,640
- Are you in there?
- There's no one in there.

1102
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,800
- Adele?
- Caden.

1103
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,160
I don't think it's... It's not quite...

1104
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,480
I'm jumping in the shower.
I'll be out in a second.

1105
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,880
Do you want some coffee?
I can make a fresh pot.

1106
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:41,800
Did you look at the new painting
on my easel? What do you think?

1107
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,360
Hey, thanks for the fuck
this morning.

1108
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,960
- People don't walk like that.
- What? Is it too?

1109
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,480
No, just walk like yourself.

1110
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,080
Watch. Watch this.

1111
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,560
I gotta go.

1112
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,920
Watch this.

1113
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,400
Where's Hazel and Sammy?

1114
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:27,680
Sammy.

1115
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,600
Sammy. Sammy.

1116
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,600
- Hi, Caden.
- What are you doing?

1117
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,360
I was being you.

1118
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,040
You know, you like Hazel,
I like Hazel.

1119
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,600
This Hazel doesn't exist for you. If you
wanna like a Hazel, like that one.

1120
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,160
That's what I tried to tell him.

1121
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,840
No harm, no foul, Caden.
It's equity break anyway.

1122
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,120
Ten minutes, everybody!

1123
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,800
- Hazel.
- What?

1124
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,000
- You don't like him, do you?
- Yeah, he reminds me of you.

1125
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:01,720
I'm me. You don't need someone
to remind you of me.

1126
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,960
Oh, don't worry, Caden.
I like you more.

1127
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,240
I do. It's just, Sammy's fun.

1128
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,560
- I'm fun.
- Oh, sweetie, no, you're not.

1129
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:14,320
Hold on a sec. Yes?

1130
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,200
- Is this Caden cotard?
- Yes.

1131
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,560
This is Officer Melnin
of Schenectady P.D.

1132
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,000
I'm sorry to inform you your mother's
been the victim of a home invasion.

1133
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,880
- What does that mean?
- She is dead.

1134
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,360
Was my father standing with us?

1135
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,520
I don't know what he looks like.

1136
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,920
He's dead.

1137
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,640
- So he looks dead, I guess.
- Probably wasn't him, then.

1138
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,280
He was a big guy.

1139
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,480
Anyway...

1140
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:58,960
Thanks for coming with me.

1141
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,960
That's okay.

1142
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,840
I asked Hazel...

1143
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,240
...but she was busy tonight,
and you're the next best thing.

1144
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:14,600
I mean, it's not
that you're the next best thing...

1145
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,040
...but because you play her,
it feels comforting.

1146
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,200
Does that make sense?

1147
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,160
Although the thing is,
off-stage you're nothing like her.

1148
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:31,440
But you play her very well, though.

1149
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,200
Did Hazel mention
what she was doing tonight?

1150
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,280
Because I called her house
before we left...

1151
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,880
...and her husband told me
she wasn't gonna be back till late.

1152
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,640
And I just thought that was weird
because she said Phillip was sick.

1153
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,240
She's having dinner with Sammy.

1154
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,720
- That's interesting.
- He's supposed to like me.

1155
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,080
I'll have another talk with him.

1156
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,960
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to the bathroom.

1157
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,480
Don't forget your phone.

1158
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,480
Thanks, Yammy.

1159
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:27,080
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

1160
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,120
You can stay in my parents' room.

1161
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,680
I thought someone
would have cleaned it up.

1162
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,160
Who?

1163
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,560
I don't know. Someone.

1164
01:28:56,720 --> 01:29:00,120
This is my room.
You can sleep here.

1165
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,320
Where are you going to sleep?

1166
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:07,360
- The living-room couch.
- Don't you want to sleep with me?

1167
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,720
- It's just sex.
- Okay.

1168
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,960
If you think it's okay.

1169
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,680
- How can you be like that?
- I get undressed every day.

1170
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,720
In front of someone is different.

1171
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,360
I don't see why.

1172
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,440
Maybe because
you have a beautiful body.

1173
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,200
- Maybe that makes it easier.
- Yeah, I suppose it might.

1174
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,280
Do you want to fuck?

1175
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,440
I do. Do you?

1176
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,720
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm sorry.

1177
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,560
I'm very, very lonely.

1178
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,440
I don't...

1179
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,440
...know what's wrong. I just...

1180
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,200
I'm sorry.

1181
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,040
Do you understand?

1182
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,800
I mean,
can you understand loneliness?

1183
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,120
Yeah. I mean...

1184
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,960
I don't know, I feel okay, mostly.

1185
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,480
Fucking might help.

1186
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,520
I'm sorry.

1187
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,080
It's okay, I don't mind.
Take your clothes off.

1188
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,600
- You're very pretty.
- Thanks.

1189
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:37,240
Sometimes I wish
I could be pretty like that.

1190
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,400
What, you wish you were a girl?

1191
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,760
Sometimes I think
I might have been better at it.

1192
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,320
Interesting.
It's kind of a drag in a lot of ways.

1193
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,600
- Do you like guys?
- No. I only love women.

1194
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,800
Well, I'm getting cold.

1195
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,080
You're pretty, Caden.

1196
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,440
Thanks for saying that.

1197
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,800
Come to bed, pretty Caden.

1198
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:25,560
I shouldn't have drunk
so much fucking beer last night.

1199
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,120
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Get lunch. What are you going to do?

1200
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,840
- For chrissake.
- Good, Roland.

1201
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,320
Thanks, Caden.

1202
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,600
We need to fire him.

1203
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,280
We don't need to fire him.

1204
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,280
Jeremy's playing to us.

1205
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,880
Tell him to talk to Donna
and we'll hear what we hear.

1206
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,000
Sammy's explaining too much.
It feels expository.

1207
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,120
It needs to be shorthand, like,
"Jeremy, big."

1208
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,600
Caden, can we stop a second?

1209
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,560
Sure.

1210
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,960
If Hazel's in love with Sammy,
and Caden's in love with Hazel...

1211
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,280
...there would be a big confrontation
where Caden turns to me and says:

1212
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,760
"It's obvious he's a substitute
for me."

1213
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,760
Then I think Hazel would have
a good moment where she cries...

1214
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,440
...or gets angry, I'm not sure which yet,
but I think it's dramatically sound...

1215
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,080
- That didn't happen.
- I think Hazel would do that.

1216
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:22,160
- But Hazel hasn't done that, Tammy.
- Caden, what do you think?

1217
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,080
I feel like we could try it.

1218
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,920
- Great.
- Fuck.

1219
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,360
Let's try it. Maybe it could happen
at the director's table.

1220
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,160
Fuck.

1221
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,440
You know, Tammy's right.

1222
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,000
I don't understand
why you're with Sammy.

1223
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,520
He's nice, he's available,
he fucks me without crying.

1224
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,600
Since when are you available?

1225
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:07,200
Derek left because of you.

1226
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,280
When?
How come you never told me?

1227
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,640
I don't know, Caden.
How come a lot of things, huh?

1228
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,920
Fuck. I gotta let go of the actor
who played Derek. What's his name?

1229
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,760
What?
That is such a romantic response.

1230
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,560
- I am touched.
- It's not my response.

1231
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:26,800
Derek is played by...

1232
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,160
We have enormous
budgetary concerns here.

1233
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,560
...Joe.
- Stop. Okay? No, just stop.

1234
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:39,800
I do not like Tammy,
and she's nothing like me.

1235
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,280
- How can you like her, anyway?
- She looks like you.

1236
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,440
- Joe Abernathy. No, she does not.
- She offered to have sex with me.

1237
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,800
- Abernathy?
- Yeah.

1238
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,480
- Was it good?
- It was nice.

1239
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:54,320
I'm just being honest. It was nice.
It wasn't earth-shattering.

1240
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,160
- Did you cry?
- No.

1241
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,920
You're making progress.

1242
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,120
Okay, I cried a little before.

1243
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,840
Hazel, you've been a part of me
forever. Don't you know that?

1244
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,640
I breathe your name
in every exhalation.

1245
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:29,440
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

1246
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:52,960
Oh, this is the place
I stayed with Derek and the kids.

1247
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,520
- Yeah, we're almost...
- Caden.

1248
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,760
Caden.

1249
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:02,240
- Caden. Caden, look at me.
- What are you doing?

1250
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,440
Sammy, stay right where you are.
I'm coming up.

1251
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:07,280
There's nothing to talk about, Hazel.
It's not your fault.

1252
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,160
- What are you doing?
- I've watched you forever, Caden.

1253
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,480
But you've never really looked
at anyone other than yourself.

1254
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:14,960
So watch me.

1255
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,440
Watch my heart break.
Watch me jump.

1256
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,000
Watch me learn
that after death there's nothing.

1257
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:25,640
No more watching,
no more following, no love.

1258
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,600
Say goodbye to Hazel for me.
And say it for yourself too.

1259
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,800
- None of us has much time.
- Sammy! Come down!

1260
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:37,840
Hazel, I love you!

1261
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,680
Sammy!

1262
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,480
I didn't jump, Sammy.

1263
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,640
A man stopped me before I jumped.
Get up!

1264
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:49,680
I didn't jump.

1265
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,240
I know how to do it now.

1266
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,640
There are nearly 13 million people
in the world.

1267
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,600
I mean, can you imagine
that many people?

1268
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,800
And none of those people
is an extra.

1269
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:13,440
They're all leads in their own stories.
They have to be given their due.

1270
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,440
I know how to do it now.

1271
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,680
There are 13 million people
in this world.

1272
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,440
Can you imagine
how many people that is?

1273
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,480
None of those people are an extra.
They're all a lead in their own story.

1274
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,680
They have got to be given their due.

1275
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,120
Do you see what I'm saying?

1276
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,720
Come over tonight.

1277
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,560
Please.

1278
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,880
You know,
we could get a place together.

1279
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:44,560
- We could get a loft.
- God, Caden, that sounds nice.

1280
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,120
I miss my daughter.
Maybe she could come live with us.

1281
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,320
I miss Olive.

1282
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,440
And the other one.

1283
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,440
- I'm a bad person.
- Oh, no, you're not.

1284
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:58,160
I am. I should never have gone out
with Sammy.

1285
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,760
I was just trying to get to you.

1286
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,440
You can't cause someone
to kill himself.

1287
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,560
He was very troubled.

1288
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,720
God, Caden.

1289
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,360
I wish we had this
when we were young.

1290
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,280
And all those years in between.

1291
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,840
My heart aches so much for you.

1292
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,400
We're here, Caden.

1293
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:29,760
- I'm here.
- I'm aching for it being over.

1294
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,600
Yeah. The end is built
into the beginning.

1295
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
What can you do?

1296
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:42,160
- God, you're just perfect.
- I'm a mess.

1297
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:46,320
- But we fit, don't we?
- Yeah.

1298
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,160
It doesn't always happen
for me now...

1299
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,000
...because of the medication
and everything.

1300
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:04,760
- I take a lot of pills.
- It's okay.

1301
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:10,280
I'm embarrassed. I don't want you
to think it's about you or me.

1302
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,120
It's okay.

1303
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,880
I have a title.

1304
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:04,040
The Obscure Moon
Lighting an Obscure World.

1305
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:10,480
I think it might be too much.

1306
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,200
Yeah, probably.

1307
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,320
Sir, could you come up here,
please?

1308
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,040
Might be smoke inhalation.

1309
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,120
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

1310
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,000
I know how to do the play now.

1311
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,280
It'll all take place
over the course of one day...

1312
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,680
...and that day
will be the day before you died.

1313
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,880
It was the happiest day of my life.

1314
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,400
And I'll be able to relive it forever.

1315
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,680
See you soon.

1316
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:31,400
So have you got any thoughts
for today's rehearsal?

1317
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,560
I have a new title, maybe.

1318
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,600
Infectious Diseases in Cattle.

1319
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,320
The title means a lot of things.
You'll see, it means a lot.

1320
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,800
I need a Caden for my Hazel.

1321
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:01,800
I'd very much like to play Caden.

1322
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,960
I know that...

1323
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,640
I know that it would be
nontraditional casting...

1324
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,880
...but I think I could do it.
I think I understand him.

1325
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,600
I don't understand him.

1326
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:22,000
Well, Caden Cotard
is a man already dead.

1327
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:28,720
He lives in a half world
between stasis and antistasis...

1328
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,440
...and time is concentrated,
chronology confused.

1329
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:38,480
Yet up until recently,
he's strived valiantly...

1330
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,600
...to make sense of his situation.

1331
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:46,080
But now he's turned to stone.

1332
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,640
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Okay.

1333
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,160
- Thanks.
- She's right?

1334
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:58,080
I didn't see that at all.
I saw it as much more hopeful.

1335
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,680
None of those people is extras.

1336
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:05,200
They're all leads in their own stories.

1337
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,560
No, this is tedious. This is nothing.

1338
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,200
Hi, your scene's over.
Would you leave the stage?

1339
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:22,120
- What is she doing?
- He's directing.

1340
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:25,000
Can I get you down
at the coffin there?

1341
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,720
She not getting the feel of you,
Caden.

1342
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:31,440
You don't move around like that.
You don't talk to people.

1343
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:38,400
Sit on the ground there.
Okay, everybody, let's run it.

1344
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,120
Everything is more complicated
than you think.

1345
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,920
You only see a tenth of what is true.

1346
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:51,080
There are a million little strings
attached to every choice you make.

1347
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,760
You can destroy your life
every time you choose.

1348
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:57,200
But maybe you won't know
for 20 years...

1349
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,920
...and you may never, ever trace it
to its source.

1350
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,480
And you only get one chance
to play it out.

1351
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:05,360
Just try and figure out
your own divorce.

1352
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:11,080
And they say there is no fate,
but there is, it's what you create.

1353
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,360
And even though the world goes on
for eons and eons...

1354
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,880
...you are only here for a fraction
of a fraction of a second.

1355
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,120
Most of your time is spent being dead
or not yet born.

1356
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,600
But while alive, you wait in vain...

1357
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,520
...wasting years for a phone call
or a letter or a look...

1358
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,920
...from someone or something
to make it all right.

1359
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,360
And it never comes, or it seems to,
but it doesn't really.

1360
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,240
So you spend your time
in vague regret...

1361
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,920
...or vaguer hope
that something good will come along.

1362
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,720
Something
to make you feel connected.

1363
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,120
Something
to make you feel whole.

1364
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,160
Something
to make you feel loved.

1365
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:53,120
And the truth is...

1366
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:56,520
...I feel so angry.

1367
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,440
And the truth is...

1368
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:03,280
...I feel so fucking sad.

1369
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:09,920
And the truth is, I've felt
so fucking hurt for so fucking long.

1370
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,800
And for just as long,
I've been pretending I'm okay...

1371
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,280
...just to get along, just for...

1372
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,920
I don't know why.

1373
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:23,680
Maybe because no one wants to hear
about my misery...

1374
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,480
...because they have their own.

1375
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,440
Well, fuck everybody.

1376
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,760
- Amen.
- Amen.

1377
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,680
- Delightful.
- Thanks.

1378
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,920
I'm out of ideas.

1379
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,520
I'm dead.

1380
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:07,360
Well, I could take over as you for a bit
until you feel refreshed.

1381
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,240
I think you're tired, Caden.
All these years of creative work.

1382
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:17,800
I think you just need some time
to regroup.

1383
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:22,000
- I need to keep my hand in.
- Well, Ellen needs to be filled.

1384
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:25,080
- What do you mean?
- Her role. Just for a bit.

1385
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,440
It's a choice role.

1386
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,480
I do like to clean.

1387
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,280
Ellen?

1388
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:55,120
- Yes?
- Caden asked me to give you this.

1389
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:58,280
You're to keep it in all the time.

1390
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:07,760
So touched by the sadness
of Adele's neighbor so close to death.

1391
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,120
Say, "Thank you,"
to Adele's neighbor.

1392
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,840
Thank you.

1393
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,400
You're very welcome, young lady.

1394
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:18,800
- Now say, "Have a very good day."
- Have a very good day.

1395
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,200
I will indeed.

1396
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,440
Reach for the toilet paper.

1397
01:46:28,120 --> 01:46:30,760
Wrap some around your hand.

1398
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:33,120
Wipe yourself.

1399
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,240
There was supposed to be
something else.

1400
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:46,000
You were supposed
to have something, a calm.

1401
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,960
Love.

1402
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,920
Children.

1403
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,880
A child, at least.

1404
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,440
Children.

1405
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,120
Meaning.

1406
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,520
Everything okay, Eric?

1407
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:12,960
- Everything is everything.
- He hates me.

1408
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,280
I disappointed him,
and he hates me.

1409
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:23,560
Everyone is disappointing
when you know someone.

1410
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:33,280
I remember having that picnic
with my mother. Look at me.

1411
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,160
Ellen, what is it?

1412
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,360
I was so young.

1413
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,560
I'm going to remember this moment
for the rest of my life, Mama...

1414
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,800
...and in exactly 20 years,
come here with my daughter...

1415
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:46,640
...and have exactly the same picnic.

1416
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,840
There was so much hope.

1417
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,120
Baby, that the loveliest thing
I've ever heard.

1418
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:58,440
Oh, God. Sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry.

1419
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,280
Where is my little girl?

1420
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:23,640
Where is my little girl?
Where is my little girl?

1421
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,680
Look at the night table
for a note from Adele.

1422
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,800
Stare out the window.

1423
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:51,720
Remember the time she got you
to pose for one of her paintings?

1424
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:54,360
How she told you
how beautiful you were?

1425
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:58,320
How she made you feel pretty again
for a little while?

1426
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,720
Think how you'll miss her.

1427
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,160
Stand up.

1428
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,800
Now it is waiting, and nobody cares.

1429
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,960
And when your wait is over,
this room will still exist...

1430
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:23,480
...and it will continue to hold shoes
and dresses and boxes...

1431
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,720
...and maybe someday
another waiting person.

1432
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,720
And maybe not.

1433
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,480
The room doesn't care either.

1434
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,000
Hello?

1435
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:12,320
There's nobody running the elevator
anymore.

1436
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:49,760
What was once before you,
an exciting and mysterious future...

1437
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:54,800
...is now behind you,
lived, understood, disappointing.

1438
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,680
You realize you are not special.

1439
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,000
You have struggled into existence
and are now slipping silently out of it.

1440
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:07,080
This is everyone's experience.
Every single one.

1441
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:11,920
The specifics hardly matter.
Everyone is everyone.

1442
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,920
So you are Adele...

1443
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:18,360
...Hazel, claire, Olive.

1444
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:23,840
You are Ellen.
All her meager sadnesses are yours.

1445
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,360
All her loneliness.
The gray, straw-like hair.

1446
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:32,320
Her red, raw hands. It's yours.

1447
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,560
It is time for you to understand this.

1448
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,560
Walk.

1449
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,720
As the people who adore you
stop adoring you...

1450
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,760
...as they die, as they move on...

1451
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,240
...as you shed them, as you shed
your beauty, your youth...

1452
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,600
...as the world forgets you,
as you recognize your transience...

1453
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:11,960
...as you begin to lose
your characteristics one by one...

1454
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:14,240
...as you learn
there is no one watching you...

1455
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,200
...and there never was,
you think only about driving.

1456
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:22,320
Not coming from anyplace,
not arriving anyplace...

1457
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,200
...just driving, counting off time.

1458
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:29,680
Now you are here. It's 7:43.

1459
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,680
Now you are here. It's 7:44.

1460
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:36,040
Now you are gone.

1461
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:44,720
Where is everybody?

1462
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:50,800
Mostly dead. Some have left.

1463
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:02,880
Would you sit with me for a moment?
Because I'm very tired and lonely.

1464
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,080
I feel like I know you.

1465
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,960
Well, I was the mother
in Ellen's dream.

1466
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,560
Yes.

1467
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,080
You seem a bit older
than I remember.

1468
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,480
That dream was quite a while ago.

1469
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,440
Apologize.

1470
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,360
I didn't mean to say you looked old.

1471
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,160
There's everyone's dreams
in all those apartments.

1472
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:04,360
All those thoughts I'll never know.
That's the truth of it.

1473
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:13,200
I wanted to do that picnic
with my daughter.

1474
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:19,040
I feel like
I've disappointed you terribly.

1475
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:23,240
Oh, no. I am so proud of you.

1476
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,640
Ask her if you can put your head
on her shoulder.

1477
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,840
Can I lay my head
on your shoulder?

1478
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,560
Yes.

1479
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:42,520
I love you.

1480
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,600
I love you too.

1481
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:11,760
I know how to do this play now.

1482
01:55:13,680 --> 01:55:15,920
I have an idea.

1483
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,840
I think if everyone...

1484
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,400
Die.
