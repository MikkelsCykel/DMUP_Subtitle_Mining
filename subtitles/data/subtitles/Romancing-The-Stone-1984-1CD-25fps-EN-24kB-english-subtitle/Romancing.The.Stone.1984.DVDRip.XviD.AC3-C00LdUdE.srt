1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,620
What's it gonna be, Angelina?

2
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,220
It was Grogan...

3
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,050
the filthiest, dirtiest, dumbest excuse for a
man...

4
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,300
west of the Missouri River.

5
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,180
Now, you can die two ways, angel.

6
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,520
Quick like the tongue of a snake...

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,940
or slower than the molasses in January.

8
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,860
But it was October.

9
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,510
I'll kill you, God damn it, if it's the Fourth
of July!

10
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,460
Where is it?

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,730
Get over there.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,270
I told him to get out...

13
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,280
now that he had what he came for.

14
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,320
Not quite, Angel.

15
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,950
Take'em off.

16
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,640
Do it!

17
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,490
Come on!

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,760
Aah!

19
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,000
That was the end of Grogan...

20
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,450
the man who killed my father, raped and murdered
my sister...

21
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,940
burned my ranch, shot my dog, and stole my
Bible!

22
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,700
But if there was one law of the West...

23
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,660
bastards had brothers...

24
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,180
who seemed to ride forever.

25
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,640
But suddenly, there he was, my beloved Jesse.

26
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,870
He was the one man I trusted - the only man.

27
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,830
My heart leapt as I watched him ride near.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,510
I could barely wait to feel the warmth of his
touch.

29
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,620
At the moment his lips met mine...

30
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,590
I knew that we would never again be apart.

31
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,040
I knew then that we would spend...

32
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,640
the rest of our lives together.

33
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:49,310
Forever.

34
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,530
Oh, God, that's good.

35
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,110
The... End.

36
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,030
Oh.

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,570
Oh.

38
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,960
I finished, sweetheart. You want to celebrate?

39
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,730
So do I.

40
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,260
Romeo, Romeo, where art thou, Romeo?

41
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,670
There. Hey, it's Bumble Bee, kiddo.

42
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,540
Just so you know, I spare no expense when I
celebrate.

43
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
Here's looking at you, Jesse.

44
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,900
Whoever you are.

45
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,810
Are you finished?

46
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,920
Thank you.

47
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,360
Oh, come here, Romeo.

48
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,560
Yeah. Yeah.

49
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Hello?

50
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,070
Hello?

51
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh, my God, Romeo, is that the time?
Gloria! I'm going to be late.

52
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,990
Oh!

53
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,220
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, pumpkin.

54
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,540
Mrs. Irwin, why won't you take the
elevator?

55
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,560
MRS. Irwin: Pumpkin, I never get in an elevator
alone.

56
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,600
You know... rapists. Where are you
running off to?

57
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,380
Oh... I've got to get to my publisher's.

58
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,490
MRS. Irwin: By the way, pumpkin...

59
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,040
the mailman couldn't fit this into your box...
So I told him I'd give it to you

60
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,060
That's some love letter.

61
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,920
Mrs. Irwin, you're a tease.

62
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,180
I know, but I keep hoping for you, pumpkin.

63
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,790
Lady, how about a monkey for your little
nephew?

64
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,980
I'll give it to you for ten dollars.

65
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,670
Really great deal. Come on, lady.
No. I don't -

66
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,630
Your boyfriend will love it.

67
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,570
It's kind of kinky, you know what I mean?

68
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,840
Nine dollars - eight dollars, bottom line.

69
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,800
Thank you, but I really don't need a
monkey.

70
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,840
Oh, but, lady, this is kinda cute.

71
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,270
Hey. That's Miss Wilder's apartment.

72
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,270
Can I help you?

73
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,520
Excuse me...
Get away from that door.

74
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,070
What's this?

75
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,180
Uhh!

76
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,230
Wimp. Wimp.

77
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,930
Loser.

78
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,850
Loser.

79
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,790
Major loser.

80
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,220
Too angry. Too vague.

81
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,580
Too desperate.

82
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,190
God, too happy.

83
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,460
Oh. Look at this guy, Mr. Mondo-dizmo.

84
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,490
I actually used to date him. Total sleaze-
bucket.

85
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,980
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold everything.

86
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,510
Get a load of this character. Now, what about
him?

87
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,810
No, he's - he's just not -

88
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,900
Who? Jesse?

89
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,970
Maybe it's silly, but I know...

90
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,560
that there is somebody out there for me.

91
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,460
Oh, yeah? Where?

92
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,100
Certainly not here.

93
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,150
Gloria, why do we always have to have this same
conversation?

94
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,990
Because I like you, and I hate to see you all
alone...

95
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,720
waiting for somebody who's not gonna show up.
OK, Gloria.

96
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,280
Here it is.

97
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,500
Mmm.

98
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,850
Read it and weep. I always do.

99
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,540
I'll call you, OK?

100
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,820
Come on, don't leave. Have another
grasshopper.

101
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,610
- I can't.
- Come on, stay.

102
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,040
I'm your publisher. I'm ordering you to.

103
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,550
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I even dragged you to this
place.

104
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,460
I just wanted you to get out.
I know how hard you've been working.

105
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,260
I know you're upset about your sister.

106
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,160
Come on, how is she? Have you heard from her?

107
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,920
Elaine? I spoke to her last week.

108
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,700
She's still in Colombia.

109
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,970
Have they found her husband's body yet?

110
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,870
Just the one piece.

111
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,430
You know what's really creepy?

112
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,680
I got this package from Eduardo from Colombia.

113
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,650
Must have been mailed just before he...

114
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,570
God!

115
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,960
Can you imagine how awful, having your husband
murdered?

116
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,580
How is she holding up?

117
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,910
Oh, she'll be fine. Elaine always... manages.

118
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,320
Uhh!

119
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,670
Hey, Ira.

120
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,340
The kid's here with the broad. They're taking
her to the boat.

121
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,480
Look at these snappers, will you?

122
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,350
We should have just rifled her room.

123
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,750
Ralph, how many times do I have to tell
you?

124
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,160
It's not in the country.

125
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,330
This kidnapping stuff makes me real
nervous.

126
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,870
It's a piss-poor idea. It's nothing but trouble.

127
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,100
Look, we've stolen enough of these antique
trinkets...

128
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,760
to keep us living comfortably for the rest of
our lives.

129
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,090
Let's kiss off this Third World toilet.

130
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,030
One last big one. Trust me, Ralph.

131
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,720
Whoa! Did you see that, Ralph?

132
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:31,800
That ugly striped son of a bitch down there? Somebody's gonna
get killed... and you're farting around with prehistoric animals.

133
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,660
Come on, Ira! Let's forget this one.

134
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,450
I got a real bad feeling about it.

135
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,160
Will you stop worrying? Have I ever hurt you?

136
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,240
I will never hurt you. I can't hurt you.

137
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,030
We got the same blood.

138
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,230
We're not two people. We are one person.
Would I hurt me?

139
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,610
Look at those snappers, Ralph.

140
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,230
Oh! Oh, Romeo!

141
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,890
Oh, baby! Oh!

142
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,820
Aah!

143
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:37,970
Hello?

144
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,940
Hello, Joan. Joan, can you hear me?

145
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,890
Elaine, I can't talk right now.

146
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,780
Listen to me. Listen very carefully.
I'm in trouble.

147
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,020
Elaine, please...

148
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,980
Joanie, I am in real trouble.

149
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,940
What's the matter?

150
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,710
Has any mail been forwarded to you...

151
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,700
with Eduardo's handwriting on it? Any big envelope?

152
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,730
Yes.

153
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,950
Oh, honey. See if there's some kind of
treasure map inside.

154
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,690
It says El Corazon.

155
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,920
I need you to bring that map to me in Colombia.

156
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,220
Colombia?

157
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,810
My God, what kind of trouble are you in?

158
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,740
Joanie, please.

159
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,900
Get to the Hotel Cartagena in Cartagena.

160
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,300
When you arrive, call this number: 64-58-24.

161
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,790
- Are you writing this down?
- Yes!

162
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,760
And remember, you mustn't tell anybody.

163
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,320
Elaine, I can't go to Colombia.

164
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,520
Aah... Joanie...

165
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,850
they'll cut me. They'll hurt me.

166
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,570
Colombia?

167
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:02,450
Do you have any idea what it's like in Colombia? I do. Your books do
very well in these macho countries. They have jungles there, Joanie...

168
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,470
insects the size of sanitation trucks...
revolutionaries.

169
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,050
- Have you had your shots?
- Shots? What shots?

170
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,260
You see. You're completely unprepared.
Wait a minute. Just hold on.

171
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,890
Would you tell me what's going on?

172
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,720
Why are you doing this?

173
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,370
Elaine is in some trouble.

174
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,280
She has a little domestic problem.

175
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,350
Domestic problem?

176
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,650
Elaine's last domestic problem...

177
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,950
was finding her husband cut into small pieces.

178
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,450
I'm not gonna let you do this. You cannot go!

179
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,950
Here's Romeo.

180
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Now, I want you to promise me to feed him...

181
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,430
and hold him at least once a day.

182
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,450
You're gonna need something stronger
than that.

183
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,050
Listen to me.

184
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,970
You get bus-sick, sea-sick, plane-sick, train-
sick.

185
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,000
You practically puke on the escalator at
Bloomingdale's, for God's sake!

186
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,940
A lot of people get sick in department
stores.

187
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,880
Joanie, please, don't go.

188
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,500
You're not up to this, Joan, and you know it.
I know, but she's my sister.

189
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,580
I'll feed him, but I'm not picking him up.

190
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,100
Crazy!

191
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,920
The plane from New York, has it arrived
yet?

192
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,210
- The areo arrivo aqui?.
- No comprendo.

193
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,480
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

194
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,790
- .Que?
- Oh.

195
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,200
.Es este el autobus a Carta-?

196
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,380
Cartagena.

197
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,310
Oh, you speak English. Good!

198
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,950
Can you tell me, is this bus going to Cartagena?

199
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,570
Yes, Cartagena.
Great. Thank you.

200
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,390
OK.

201
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,140
Oh, thank you.

202
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,290
Hey, you're on the wrong bus!

203
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,810
Miss Wilder! She got on the wrong bus.

204
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,700
This is terrible!

205
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,940
Oh-

206
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,120
My God.

207
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,670
Excuse me.

208
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,990
Uh...

209
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,870
Excuse - excuse me.

210
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,410
I'm - I'm very sorry.

211
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm really sorry.

212
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,830
.Estupida!

213
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,450
Ahem. I'm sorry to bother you.

214
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,370
Can you tell me what time we get to Cartagena?

215
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,310
.Que?

216
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,960
Is this the bus to Cartagena?

217
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,060
I need to get to Cartagena - Aah!

218
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,010
Shit!

219
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,310
What are we gonna do now?

220
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,240
Where's my suitcase?

221
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,400
You don't have to walk. Another bus will
come along.

222
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,370
They know nothing. They are peasants.

223
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,080
Another bus? Really?

224
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,390
Of course.

225
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,500
There are schedules to be maintained...

226
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,630
even in Colombia.

227
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,120
What?

228
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,740
- The purse.
- What are you-

229
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,810
.La bolsa!

230
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,930
.Alto!

231
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,370
Aah!

232
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,240
.Fuera!

233
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,890
Oh, my God!

234
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,250
What the hell?

235
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,160
Jesus Christ!

236
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,360
What the hell happened to my birds?!

237
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,390
Son of a bitch!

238
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,890
Hi.

239
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,380
I demand this car in the name of the law.

240
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,420
Uh...

241
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,530
Turn this car around.

242
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, no. Talk about breaks.

243
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,410
Don't I know you?

244
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,330
No comprendo.

245
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,610
You are American.

246
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,710
I hate Americanos.

247
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,260
I spit on 'em.

248
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,530
Ptew! I hate Americanos!

249
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,090
They're scumo! Scum!

250
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,830
Are you French?

251
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,710
Well, honey, looks like we're gonna
have to wait... just a little longer.

252
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,870
Shit.

253
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,010
Excuse me.

254
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,110
Could you please tell me how to get to a
telephone?

255
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,060
No, lady, I don't have any idea. I'm sorry.

256
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,130
It's very important that I get one.

257
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,140
We've all got our problems today,
don't we?

258
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,790
Can you tell me where the nearest town is?

259
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,810
- How about Miami?
- Will there be another bus?

260
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,890
This is it. You got rush hour.

261
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,680
I have to get to Cartagena.

262
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,030
Cartagena?

263
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,040
Angel, you are hell and gone from Cartagena.

264
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,700
Cartagena's over there on the coast.

265
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,060
- But they told me this bus.
- Who told you that?

266
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,830
That man that-

267
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:48,050
That nice man who pulled a gun on you?
Uh-huh.

268
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,880
What else did he tell you?

269
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
Please, I need your help.

270
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,360
I guess that's my new career.

271
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,830
It's very-

272
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,200
Lady, half a year's work just flew south for the
winter.

273
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,510
My Jeep is totaled.

274
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,260
In five minutes, everything I own is gonna
be wet...

275
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,500
so could you lighten up? I don't have the time.
I'll pay you.

276
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,400
You don't understand. It's a matter of life and
death.

277
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,890
- If I don't get-
- How much?

278
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,260
Fifty dollars?

279
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,010
Oh, shit.

280
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,120
You said you just lost everything you owned.

281
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,280
Not my sense of humor.
I'll pay you a hundred dollars!

282
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,600
Two hundred dollars!

283
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,230
I'll do it.

284
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,910
For five.

285
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,500
What?!

286
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I'll pay you two hundred and fifty dollars.

287
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,420
Now, I ain't cheap, but I can be had.

288
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,930
My minimum price for taking a stranded woman...

289
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,030
to a telephone is four hundred dollars.

290
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,480
Will you take three hundred seventy-five

291
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,330
in traveler's checks?

292
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,000
- American Express?
- Of course.

293
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,720
You have got a deal.

294
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,350
Good.

295
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,460
.Senor Zolo!

296
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,040
You got any valuables in that suitcase?

297
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,760
No. Yes! All my clothes and things.

298
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,740
You got an umbrella?

299
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,950
No.

300
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:32,980
You got a good pair of walking shoes?
They're all like these.

301
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,960
Uh-huh.

302
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,570
OK, let's make some time.

303
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,760
You b-Aah!

304
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,320
Aw, shit!

305
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,150
Whoa-ho-ho!

306
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,560
Aaah!

307
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,630
Whoa!

308
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,680
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

309
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,090
Oh, God damn it! What a ride, huh?

310
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:44,985
Whoo! Ha ha!

311
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,870
I'm telling you...

312
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,160
this is turning out to be one hell of a morning.

313
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,350
You OK?

314
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,680
I said, are you hurt?

315
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,850
What's the matter? You paralyzed from the
neck up?

316
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,170
Are you hurt?

317
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,890
- No!
- Good!

318
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,480
What's your name?

319
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm Joan Wilder.

320
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,930
Joan Wilder?

321
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,620
Welcome to Colombia!

322
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,350
Diga.

323
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,440
Ira, I-

324
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,990
Hi, Ma. It's me, Irving.

325
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,010
Ralph, you little twerp, where are you?

326
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,060
Calm down, Ma. Who says I never call?

327
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,240
For Christ's sake, tell me the story.

328
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,160
All right, cousin.

329
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,080
As usual, you got us in some serious shit here.

330
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,470
First of all, the stupid dame got on the wrong
bus.

331
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,370
Now I'm stuck in some kind of spico military
compound.

332
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,060
They're mobilizing for Iwo Jima here.

333
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,070
Do they know who you are?

334
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,390
What do you think, I'm introducing
myself to every cop in the pueblo?

335
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,740
And another little tidbit, cousin.

336
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,220
Guess who else is here?

337
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,130
Zolo!

338
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,920
Oh, well, give the man a cigar!

339
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,280
You're goddamn right, Zolo. He got in my car.

340
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,110
Not only are we kidnappers...

341
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:10,070
but I'm about to have a close encounter with a
cattle prod.

342
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,670
Has he got his boys with him?

343
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,060
No. He's making do with the local yo-yos.

344
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,330
Oh, no.

345
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,990
Aw! Look!

346
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,210
God damn it, Ralph, get that map!

347
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,120
Don't yell at me, Ira!

348
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,100
Look, you want to kill me?

349
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,940
Don't let me die in a jungle like a goddamn
snake.

350
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,810
Ralph, God damn it, I don't care what you
got to do.

351
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,160
Just get me that map!

352
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,750
Little sister took the wrong road.

353
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:46,900
And that third party I told you about...
he's tagging along.

354
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,550
The man who killed my husband?

355
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,110
The butcher who killed your husband.

356
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,860
A very powerful man with his own private army to
back him up.

357
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,740
And whether he calls himself...

358
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,330
Dr. Zolo, Minister of Antiquities...

359
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,980
Deputy Commander of the Secret Police...

360
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,670
he's still just a butcher.

361
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,250
Look at those snappers, will you?

362
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,030
What's the matter? You sick?

363
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,490
Oh, no. I lost my button.

364
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,630
You lost what?

365
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,770
I lost my button. My button.

366
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,490
You're gonna lose a lot more than that.

367
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,150
These were Italian.

368
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,340
Now they're practical.

369
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,390
Is nothing that I own sacred to you?

370
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,640
Only your three hundred and seventy-five
dollars.

371
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,940
Aah!

372
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,010
Cops!

373
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,370
What the hell do they want?

374
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,320
I haven't done anything lately.

375
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,030
I'm shooting at a cop!

376
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,260
Wait a minute. He's after you!

377
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Who the hell are you?

378
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,280
Well, I'm a romance novelist.

379
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,790
You're what?

380
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,750
What are you doing here?

381
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,490
I told you. My sister's life
depends on me.

382
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,760
Don't give me that shit.

383
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,740
I thought you were donating a kidney or
something.

384
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,950
Christ, here they come.

385
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,930
This may be a good time to try on those shoes.

386
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,840
- Wait!
- Deal's off, lady!

387
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,860
Lady, you are bad news.

388
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,900
What'd you do, wake up this morning and
say...

389
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,440
"Today I'm gonna ruin a man's life"?

390
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,860
Do you know where you're going?
Looks like a some kind of trail.

391
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,030
This is a trail?

392
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,170
Aah!

393
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,400
Aah!

394
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,190
Lady, you are a jinx!

395
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,720
What about the bridge?

396
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:06,560
That ain't a bridge. Goddamn pre-Colombian
art.

397
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,930
We can't get across that.

398
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,300
Aw, shit. All right.

399
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,090
We're gonna hold them off right from here.

400
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,450
You just stay right behind me.

401
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,330
God damn it! I knew I should've
listened to my mother. Faster, faster.

402
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,420
I could've been a cosmetic surgeon.

403
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,450
Five hundred thou a year, up to my neck in tits
and ass.

404
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,570
Lady, I hope you're taking notes...

405
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,670
'cause you got a real live death scene going on
right here.

406
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,500
Aah!

407
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,850
Romantic novelist, my ass.

408
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,650
Aah!

409
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,520
Holy shit!

410
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,180
Unh!

411
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,470
Joan!

412
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,450
We can't cross.

413
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,690
What the hell are you doing?

414
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,510
Drinking?

415
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,840
I could've been killed, and you're drinking!

416
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,660
Wait!
I will catch up to them.

417
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,600
.Vamos!.Vamos!

418
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,530
Are we stopping?

419
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,040
Be my guest.

420
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,000
Aah!

421
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,340
You OK?

422
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,410
Come on.

423
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,810
Is anybody else in there?

424
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:17,230
No.
No, it's a cargo plane.

425
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,660
What is all this?

426
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,690
All this? Five-to-life in the States.

427
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,100
Couple of centuries down here.

428
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,530
Oh, marijuana.

429
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,170
Oh, you smoke it?

430
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,820
I went to college.

431
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,280
All right! OK.

432
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,220
Oh, God, do I love those fly-boys.

433
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,700
What?

434
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,220
This is Elaine's favorite drink.

435
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,810
Oh!

436
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,580
You gonna tell me about that sister of yours?

437
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,990
I already did.

438
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,290
Her husband died and...

439
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,160
and I've come down here to comfort her.

440
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,820
- Uh-huh.
- It's the truth.

441
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,080
Right. Yeah, it's the truth.

442
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,430
All right, I'm gonna make afire.

443
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,750
You got any dry matches in here?

444
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,580
Well, looky here.

445
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,000
Huh? Oh, no, don't!

446
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,310
I think you and I ought to have a talk.

447
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,210
All right.

448
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,790
Yeah, that's what I call a campfire.

449
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,610
Ooh!

450
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,550
So they're ransoming your sister for this El
Corazon.

451
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,800
That's Spanish for "The Heart. "

452
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,170
This map here leads to The Heart.

453
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,830
But the heart of what?

454
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:38,510
I don't care.

455
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,340
You see here where it says this El Corazon...

456
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,350
is hidden in Cordoba province?

457
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,440
Mm-hmm.

458
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:56,270
So we're sitting right in the middle of it. All I
care about is my sister, and that map is her life.

459
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,310
Like hell it is.

460
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,930
Whatever's at the end of this map is your
sister's life.

461
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,310
Now, we get our hands on this El Corazon...

462
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,230
then you got something to bargain with.

463
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,490
I knew it would happen.

464
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,100
You knew what would happen?

465
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,730
All you care about is yourself, isn't it?

466
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,840
I knew that from the first moment I laid eyes
on you.

467
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,720
Was that the first moment when I saved your ass?

468
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,440
You see? There you go.

469
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,190
You have no finesse. No style.

470
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,700
A real man doesn't have to draw attention to his
actions.

471
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,730
You're just...

472
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,850
You're a mondo-dizmo.

473
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,190
I'm-What am I?

474
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:38,520
You're a man who takes money from stranded
women.

475
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,910
A real man is-is honest...

476
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:46,230
and forthright and trustworthy.

477
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:50,270
Would you please do me the courtesy...

478
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,990
of looking at me when I'm speaking to you?

479
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,730
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

480
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,730
If you had any kind of manners-

481
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,510
Aah!

482
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,890
Goddamn bushmaster.

483
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,570
Is it poisonous?

484
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,170
Yeah...

485
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,740
but very tasty.

486
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,360
Uniforme.

487
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,200
See, you got to figure sulfur-crested
cockatoos...

488
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,890
they go for about eight hundred a shot.

489
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,600
Then you got gentle red-tails...

490
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,380
they're close to two thousand each.

491
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,690
Shit, I lost close to 15,000 bucks in that bus
crash.

492
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,895
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,500
Do you want to know something crazy?

494
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,320
What?

495
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,460
I don't even know your name.

496
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,780
Well, you never asked me.

497
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,990
Excuse me. I'd really like to know-

498
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:53,300
Colton. Jack T. Colton.

499
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:55,510
What does the "T" stand for?

500
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,940
Aw, God damn it, man! The Doobie Brothers
broke up.

501
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:01,690
Shit. When did that happen?

502
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,930
How long have you been down here?
Aw, man.

503
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,390
Forever. I don't know.

504
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,000
- Were you always into birds?
- Mm-mmm.

505
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,400
No, no. I, uh...

506
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,490
No, I was...

507
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,310
I was into shortcuts.

508
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,100
Birds seemed to be a fast way to get what I
wanted...

509
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,430
and a hell of a lot healthier than dealing in
this crap.

510
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,930
What is it you want?

511
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,430
I think I'm gonna throw another key on the fire.

512
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,660
No, please. I'm getting dizzy.

513
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,360
What do you want? Seriously.

514
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,700
I'd really like to know.

515
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,500
Came down here on a coffee boat...

516
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,350
about a year and a half ago, right?

517
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,560
Christ, what a job that was.

518
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,920
But I couldn't get over that ocean, though, you
know?

519
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:09,330
Yeah. I love the ocean. You just kind
of get out there all by yourself...

520
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,400
nobody else around.
It's beautiful.

521
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,320
So that's what I want.

522
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,660
Try to get enough money together...

523
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,810
buy a boat, sail around the world.

524
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,140
So you're just gonna sail away all by yourself?

525
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:33,520
Yeah.

526
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,530
Sounds lonely, Jack T. Colton.

527
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,240
Well...

528
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:54,450
what does the "T" stand for?

529
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,460
Trustworthy.

530
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,100
Mmm.

531
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:21,080
Aw, man, I tell you, one hell of a
morning. It's turned into a bitch of a day.

532
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,890
"Tenedor del Diablo. "

533
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,790
The Devil's Fork.

534
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,700
Zolo!

535
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,370
They are crossing the cemetery.

536
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,640
Friendly, aren't they?

537
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,010
Drug runners. Just try to look mean.

538
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,000
Buenos dias.

539
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,030
Aw, shit.

540
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,720
- What's the matter?
- Nothing yet.

541
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,900
Hey, hombre.

542
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:09,980
Hey, hombre!

543
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,000
- OK, here we go.
- What?

544
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,020
I just knew I should have listened to my
mother.

545
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,990
Hey, hombre.

546
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,310
You ready?

547
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,880
Ah... excuse me.

548
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,120
Gentlemen, we are in need of a car.

549
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,150
Can any of you lovely gentlemen tell me where...

550
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,170
Only one car in village.

551
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:44,510
Juan, the bell maker.

552
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,120
The bell maker.

553
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,190
Thank you.

554
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,650
Bell maker, my ass.

555
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,380
You know that fuselage we slept in last night?

556
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,760
It's probably one of old Juan's lost shipments.

557
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,450
You mean he's a drug-

558
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:07,640
Shh! Just don't say a word out loud,
OK? - A dope- - Come on, let's go.

559
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,650
All right. Now, you hold back.

560
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,440
This one I'll handle.

561
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,620
Senor, buenos dias.

562
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,080
What do you want, gringo?

563
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,940
You speak English. That's great.

564
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:48,980
We understand that you have a car...

565
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,100
and we would like to rent it or buy it.

566
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,570
We have to get to a town.

567
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,800
What do you call this I'm living in, a
pigsty?

568
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,450
No. This is lovely.

569
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,170
Hit the road.

570
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:04,920
- You don't understand.
- Hit the road!

571
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,610
Senor, I'd-

572
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,600
Vaya con dios, gringo.
It's cool.

573
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,360
It's cool. It's no problem.

574
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,300
Vaya con dios.

575
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,370
Oh.

576
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:28,440
OK, Joan Wilder, write us out of this one.

577
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,030
Joan Wilder?

578
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,150
Joan Wilder?

579
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,090
The Joan Wilder?

580
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,660
You are Joan Wilder, the novelist?

581
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,530
Yes, I am.

582
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,210
I read your books. I read all your books.

583
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,580
Come in. This is Juanita Wilder!

584
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,560
The one who writes the books that I read to you
on Saturdays.

585
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,700
Juanita.

586
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,940
.Juanita!.Es Juanita!

587
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,960
- Come in.
- Adios, amiga.

588
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,840
I can't believe you're here. Joan Wilder.

589
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,560
I've been reading your books all these years.

590
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,040
I'm so honored to have you here. I can't
believe it.

591
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,730
Welcome to my humble house.

592
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:12,570
Joan Wilder. Ha! I'm sorry.

593
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,260
I haven't introduced myself. I'm Juan.

594
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:19,200
I live here.. Que paso? Ha ha!

595
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,690
The greatest novelist. Get the door, please.

596
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,900
Buenos dias.

597
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,460
.Gringos?

598
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,830
.Americanos?

599
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:01,750
- .Gringos?
- No.

600
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,030
- .Americanos?
- No.

601
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,690
Come in. Make yourself at home.

602
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,700
Ever read "The Return of Angelina"?

603
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,210
No.

604
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:26,030
Oh, that woman makes me hungry.
How about "Love's Wicked Kiss?"

605
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,780
Really? Take it. I have many copies.
I have here "The Ravagers,"

606
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:32,670
and I'm waiting for "Angelina's Savage Secret. "

607
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,130
I'm so glad you're here in Colombia.

608
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,840
I want to show you all around my beautiful
village.

609
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,250
We have colorful tile roofs, typical cobblestone
streets...

610
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,290
and very rich fields.

611
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,440
I was born here, and so was my poor family.

612
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,680
What I would really like would be a phone.

613
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,210
No phones, no phones. I hate phones.

614
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,070
I don't have a phone.

615
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,600
But have a drink. Let's hang out.

616
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:57,430
Look. Like it? I can be in one of your books.

617
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,580
Oh, your drink.

618
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:03,060
I got Southern Comfort or Michelob...

619
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,370
Kirin, Becks, Dos Equis...
Perrier, Anchor Steam, Doctor Brown...

620
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,170
How about a Xerox machine?

621
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,900
Yes, but she's broke.

622
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,130
- Where is the nearest phone?
- Many miles from here.

623
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,950
Can we get there in your car?

624
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,190
Who told you I had a car?

625
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,700
The men in the village.

626
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:28,340
They told you I had a car? They are such
comedians.

627
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,090
They meant my Little Mule, Pepe.

628
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,310
Not bad for a Little Mule, eh?

629
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,910
Now Pepe's warming up.

630
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,680
What are we stopping for?

631
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,650
I can't hurt my favorite pig.

632
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:12,790
Look out! Watch it!

633
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,100
- Oh!
- Ha ha!

634
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:24,260
See over there by the fence? That's where my
mother was born.

635
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,680
And see that tree, the third tree up the ridge?

636
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,570
My brother planted that tree.

637
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,070
OK, Pepe, let's lose them.

638
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,920
- This guy's crazier than I am.
- Gracias. Yeah!

639
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,380
What the hell you doing? That field was
cover!

640
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,330
I wanted to show you this other field.

641
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:26,300
This guy who's following you, he's very
persistent.

642
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,565
No problem.

643
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,320
My Little Mule is fireproof.

644
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,360
- See that river?
- The one without the bridge?

645
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:00,000
This is the main water supply for many villages.

646
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,260
What do you mean, the one without the
bridge?

647
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:05,180
The one without the bridge!

648
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,910
Where the hell are you going?

649
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,220
To Lupe's Escape. I used it many times in the
past.

650
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,940
Whoo-hoo!

651
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,880
.Deja de disparar!

652
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,260
You're OK now.

653
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,310
You need Little Mule to use Lupe's Escape.

654
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:56,180
You know, that river, it's impossible to
cross...

655
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,100
for two hundred miles in either direction.

656
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,210
In fact, over that mountain...

657
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,540
the river becomes wild, muy peligroso-

658
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,640
waterfalls, rapids.

659
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,290
Angelina country. Right, Joan?

660
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,160
What ever happened to Lupe?

661
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,080
Ay-yi-yi!

662
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,100
Terrible disappointment to family.

663
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,150
I can imagine.

664
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,760
He entered the priesthood, so I took over
the business.

665
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,880
Is for the best. I'm not so reckless.

666
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,630
He might have ended up hanging from El Tenedor
del Diablo.

667
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,610
It used to happen to bandidos.

668
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,570
El Tenedor del Diablo?

669
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,520
OK, let's hit it. We're on a roll.

670
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,670
I'm sorry I cannot take you all the way to
Cartagena.

671
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:39,040
Beyond this town, I am a wanted man.

672
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,980
But in the morning, there's always a bus.

673
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,880
It will take you.

674
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:54,540
Of all the things you can say to me right now...

675
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,380
"I've lost her, Ralph... "

676
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,650
is gonna get the most teeth broken in your
mouth.

677
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,810
Bullet head, if they're hiking through the
jungle...

678
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,610
there's nothing I can do about it.

679
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,770
I have a car. I am not Tarzan.

680
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,700
I have been through every one-horse shithole...

681
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,660
for a two-hundred-mile radius.

682
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,490
You should've seen the river I had to traverse
this morning.

683
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,110
So don't give me any of your crap, you gutless
wonder.

684
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:20,150
You have been an embarrassment to me and the
whole family...

685
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,200
ever since you were born. And one more thing-

686
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:24,120
Joan.

687
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,230
Yeah?

688
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,870
You are the luckiest son of a bitch...

689
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:30,520
that ever walked the earth! She's here!
She's there?

690
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,790
She's right here.

691
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:36,210
She's coming right toward the phone booth.

692
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,230
She's with some guy.

693
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:43,310
I don't know why, she likes guys...
So do you, maricon.

694
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,990
.Tiene cuarto para una noche con bano?

695
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:57,950
All the rooms have baths.

696
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:01,650
That's great. You speak English, too.

697
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,040
That's great.

698
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,070
Listen, you wouldn't have a Xerox machine around
here?

699
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,890
Yeah. We have one in the back.

700
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:15,070
It's big enough to take, like, map-size?

701
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,050
Yeah, complete.

702
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:20,440
Yes, I understand. I'll do that.

703
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,480
Well, I talked to Elaine. She's all right.

704
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,660
They're gonna wait for me to take the bus in the
morning.

705
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,460
That's great. You're covered.

706
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,550
I don't know. He sounded so smug.

707
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,180
- Who? - That bastard that's got Elaine. Sure he is. You're
bringing him what he wants- you're bringing him the map.

708
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,790
Yeah.

709
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,910
Well...

710
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,050
I guess this is it.

711
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:52,440
I guess so.

712
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,700
Oh.

713
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,450
Three-seventy-five. That was the contract,
right?

714
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,270
Yep. That was it.

715
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:08,380
The least I can do is buy you some dinner.

716
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,970
Looks like it's gonna be a hell of a party.

717
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,440
I'd like that.
I'll tell you what. I got a room in the hotel.

718
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,240
Why don't you go get cleaned up? I'll buy us
some new rags.

719
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:19,260
Number seven.

720
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,530
- Seven?
- Yeah.

721
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,260
That's my lucky number.

722
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,140
Mine, too.

723
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,390
It's just beautiful.

724
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,040
Thank you, Jack.

725
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,250
I think your writing's hot. It's great.

726
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,120
I mean it. I'm telling you, I'm impressed. I am.

727
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:31,030
You've never even read the book.
I know. I know.

728
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:38,520
I suppose it's my way of living in another age.

729
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:41,940
If you did that, I never would have met you.

730
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,500
I got you something.

731
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,160
El Corazon?

732
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,030
Let's dance.

733
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,230
- Oh, no, I can't.
- I'll show you.

734
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,210
- I - No.
- Come on. Trust me.

735
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,000
I lost my langostino.

736
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,150
No, lady! No! Lady!

737
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,880
Calm down, lady!

738
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:56,950
.Senora! Aah!

739
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,180
Someday, if I had the money...

740
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,575
I'd take you.

741
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:54,330
I'd sail away.
Just the two of us.

742
01:09:57,530 --> 01:09:59,250
Around the world and back again.

743
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:07,310
I promise you. I promise you we'd do that.

744
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,500
Why haven't you taken the map away
from me?

745
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,060
What are you talking about?

746
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:26,230
I saw that tree today, The Devil's Fork.

747
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,400
It's on the map.

748
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,740
You know how close we are?
Sure I do, but what has that got to do with it?

749
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:34,810
I was thinking about something you said-

750
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,090
about having more to bargain with.

751
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:39,480
The best way to help your sister is to get that
treasure...

752
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,970
and then you can waltz into Cartagena.
You're holding all the cards.

753
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,710
I'd love to see you on that boat.

754
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:53,340
But, Jack, if we have to give it up to save
Elaine...

755
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,900
Then we give it up. It's your sister.

756
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:56,920
Of course we give it up, but that's the point.

757
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:00,130
At least we got the leverage to do it.

758
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,450
OK.

759
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,890
Let's go for it.

760
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:56,850
Shh, shh.

761
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,250
Inspect, soldiers. That woman has to be here.

762
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,430
He just won't quit.

763
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,160
- What are you doing?
- Hot-wiring the car.

764
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,260
Try the key.

765
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,110
There it is. That's the shrine.

766
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,460
Yep.

767
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,090
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

768
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,680
They are on the virgin road.

769
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:28,410
Well, this can't be all.

770
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:29,970
There's gotta be another clue here.

771
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:31,070
Landmarks change, things grow...

772
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:34,040
all that stuff, you know?

773
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,090
Oh.

774
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,410
Hey, you hear that?

775
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,850
- Waterfall.
- Look, Jack.

776
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,080
All right, Joan!

777
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,870
Whoo!

778
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,940
Are you all right?
Yeah.

779
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,410
Oh! This has got to be it.

780
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:22,070
Hey. What does "Leche de la Madre" mean?

781
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,800
"Leche de la Madre"?
Yeah. It's on the map.

782
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,160
It means Mother's Milk.

783
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,080
- Mother's Milk?
- Yeah.

784
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,600
I'll be goddamned.

785
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:52,720
Mama, I'm home.

786
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,720
I can't believe I'm doing this.

787
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,360
What?

788
01:15:01,950 --> 01:15:08,090
Digging for treasure with you.
Jack?

789
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,090
Yeah?

790
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,810
You're the best time I've ever had.

791
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:19,920
Never been anybody's best time before.

792
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,290
It's a priceless statue.

793
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,740
Somebody out there's got a really sick
sense of humor.

794
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:06,480
Wait a minute.

795
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,140
My first book, "Treasures of Lust"...

796
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,700
I hid the treasure inside the statue.

797
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:27,030
Oh...

798
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,020
Jesus Christ, we're in a lot of trouble.

799
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,180
Understatement of the year, asshole.

800
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:45,210
Is there anybody who isn't following you?

801
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,530
Put the goods in the bag.

802
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,130
Come on.

803
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,510
Come on.

804
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,480
Now move it, before Batman comes home.

805
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:58,200
It's time I had a chauffeur, Miss Wilder.

806
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,140
Hey, back off me, creep!

807
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,240
Oh, I'm the creep, huh?

808
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:07,380
Well, at least I'm honest. I'm stealing this
stone.

809
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,080
I'm not trying to romance it out from under her.

810
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,630
Wait a minute. Going for the stone was my
idea.

811
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,240
That's what the good con artists want you
to think.

812
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:19,220
He made you think you needed it, you sap!

813
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:22,900
Get in and drive! Come on! Move it!

814
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,600
Move it!

815
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:30,490
See how you like being stuck-

816
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:32,220
Holy shit!

817
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,890
Aah!

818
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:36,890
Get in!

819
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,930
Which way do we go?
Follow that stone!

820
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,060
Mounties!

821
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,880
Hit it!

822
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:23,740
.Vamos!.Tras ellos!.Vamos!

823
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:36,240
Where the hell you going?

824
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:38,610
Where am I going?

825
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,380
How about Lupe's Escape?

826
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,630
Where you going? Quit steering. You're not going
anywhere.

827
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:11,790
Oh, no!

828
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,300
What are we gonna do now?

829
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:19,000
Jump!

830
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:50,640
Hey!

831
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,520
Joan Wilder! Hey! What a comeback!

832
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:55,950
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

833
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,840
Yeah.

834
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:01,430
- Man, I thought you drowned!
- I did!

835
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:03,350
You OK?

836
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,270
Oh, sure. I'm great.

837
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:11,480
I'm fine! Only you're on that side!

838
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:13,080
There's no way across this sucker!

839
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,040
You did this on purpose!

840
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:18,160
What are you talking about? We just went over a
waterfall!

841
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,410
Admit it! You planned this all along!

842
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:23,990
I knew I couldn't depend on you! I knew it!

843
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,880
What's the name of that hotel in Cartagena?

844
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,110
Hotel Cartagena! What do you care?

845
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,800
All right. You just head towards the sunset...

846
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,810
and you'll make it! And I'll be there!

847
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:40,950
Oh, yeah, sure. With El Corazon in your pocket.

848
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:42,220
What about my sister?

849
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,210
They don't have to know about this. You got the
map!

850
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:51,030
- Well, you've got the stone!
- Yeah, but-

851
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:58,520
I'll meet you there! Trust me!

852
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,720
- What?
- I'll be there!

853
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,230
So you made it finally.

854
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,380
Got the map?

855
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,750
Yes, I brought it. I want to talk to Elaine.

856
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:49,300
No. You can't talk to her till I get it.

857
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:51,410
All right, now look out your window.

858
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,280
See the fort across the bay? The tower?

859
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,020
Yes.

860
01:21:56,190 --> 01:22:01,420
You take a water taxi right outside your hotel.
You meet me there in two hours-

861
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,010
all by yourself.

862
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,140
Hello?

863
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:26,360
Has Jack Colton checked in?
In the last two minutes, no.

864
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:45,950
Over here.

865
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:58,400
Stop right there.

866
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:02,450
Let me see the map.

867
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:06,360
Where are you?
Let me see the map.

868
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,050
Let me see Elaine.

869
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:10,970
Joanie?

870
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:23,000
Drop the map and back off.

871
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,810
If this isn't genuine...

872
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,400
If you've pulled a fast one...

873
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:59,060
Joan Wilder, you...

874
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:02,800
and your sister...

875
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:05,170
can go!

876
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,800
Hey.

877
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,490
It's OK. It's all right.

878
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:14,900
Let's go home tonight.

879
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,700
I missed you at the hotel.

880
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,400
We all did.

881
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:46,070
You brainless broad, you let him follow you
here.

882
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,090
Come on.

883
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:53,490
This map is nothing.

884
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,380
They already have the stone.

885
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,280
Aah!

886
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:07,910
I had it in my hands, Ira. These hands that
are gonna break every bone in your body.

887
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,810
Later.

888
01:26:24,340 --> 01:26:26,320
Where is it?

889
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,030
I don't know.

890
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:30,930
Where is the stone?

891
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,210
We dug. We didn't find anything.

892
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,610
.Traigala!

893
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,970
Crocodiles shed tears while they eat their
prey.

894
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:15,860
You have heard of these tears, I am sure.

895
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:19,260
But have you seen them?

896
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:20,210
- Aah!
- Stop it!

897
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,390
Oh, no! No!

898
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:41,270
Look at those snappers.

899
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:45,750
You can forego this agony.

900
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,700
Simply tell me, where is El Corazon?

901
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:48,880
Where is the heart?

902
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,380
Where is the stone?

903
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,960
All right! Just let her go, will you?

904
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,780
She doesn't know where it is. I've got it.

905
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,160
Where is it?

906
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:03,800
It's in a safe place.

907
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,090
Where is it?

908
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:54,110
Choke on it.

909
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:06,420
Thank you.

910
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,240
Get down!

911
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,080
All right, honey. Come on.

912
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,130
Hurry. Hurry.

913
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,990
Boys!.Muchachos!

914
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:10,260
Bring the boat around! Hold them down!

915
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,910
Let me get to the boat!

916
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,750
Just a little more. Come on.

917
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,470
.Muchachos!
.Andale!

918
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,440
.Vamonos!

919
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:09,370
Ira!

920
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,060
Ira!

921
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:14,160
Come back here, Ira!

922
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:16,120
Jump, Ralph, jump!

923
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,810
I can't swim. You know that, Ira.

924
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:20,180
- I'll come back for you!
- You promise?

925
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,060
I'll send the boat back for you, Ralph!

926
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:25,710
- When?
- Soon!

927
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,190
- How soon?
- Very soon!

928
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:35,250
No.

929
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,310
No! No!

930
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:43,130
Where do you think you're going, huh, pal?

931
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,880
Come on, cough it up.

932
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,700
Wait, wait!

933
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,100
Joanie?

934
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:00,310
How will you die, Joan Wilder?

935
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,050
Slow like a snail...

936
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,150
or fast like a shooting star?

937
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:12,850
Oh, my.

938
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,510
Jack!

939
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,900
Jack!

940
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,600
Jack!

941
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,720
Come on, you bastard. Give me a break.

942
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:11,520
Damn it!

943
01:33:59,870 --> 01:34:01,690
Aah!

944
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:05,980
Aah!

945
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,480
Oh, Jack.

946
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:33,680
It's OK. It's OK.

947
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:35,280
Come on back, Ira!

948
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:37,560
You're my cousin, Ira! Don't you remember?

949
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:39,260
Your mother, my mother!

950
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:42,540
That way!

951
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:44,240
That way! He's getting away!

952
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,710
He's got it all! Go that way!

953
01:34:46,745 --> 01:34:49,240
Joanie?

954
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:50,800
OK. All right. Here's what we got to do.

955
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:53,390
Get to the American Consulate. Just tell them
everything.

956
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,510
Where are you going?

957
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:57,910
They might believe you, but just one thing:
don't mention my name.

958
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,860
Cartagena cops and I go way back.

959
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,740
Elaine, it's been a pleasure.

960
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,030
You're leaving?

961
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,910
You're leaving me?

962
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:20,750
You're gonna be all right, Joan Wilder.

963
01:35:21,310 --> 01:35:22,970
Yeah.

964
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,300
Jack Colton!

965
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:59,250
Damn.

966
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:14,130
Oh.

967
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:23,870
Well, that is far and away your best book.

968
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,240
I can't believe how fast you cranked this out.

969
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,250
So, you really like it?

970
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:31,640
Like it? Look at me. I'm a mess. It made
me cry.

971
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:34,220
You tell anybody, I'll cut your heart out.

972
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,810
I love the end where he dives off the wall and
swims away.

973
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,740
Then he meets her at the airport.

974
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,520
They sail off around the world together.

975
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:44,950
God, I can't believe how this got to me.

976
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,190
Well...

977
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:48,780
I was, uh, inspired.

978
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,530
Joanie, you are now a world-class
hopeless romantic.

979
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:56,310
No. Hopeful.

980
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:00,380
Hopeful romantic.

981
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:10,090
No, thank you. Nope.
Name-brand. Name-brand.

982
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:12,500
Never wear 'em.

983
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:15,150
You can wear it right now. Five dollars.

01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:36,250
Hey!

985
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,280
I like your boots.

986
01:38:00,410 --> 01:38:03,260
Yep. That poor old yellow-tailed guy...

987
01:38:03,420 --> 01:38:06,830
developed a fatal case of indigestion.
He died right on my arms.

988
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:09,460
I can't blame him.

989
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:10,490
If I were to die...

990
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:12,020
there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be.

991
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:16,590
I couldn't stop thinking about you.
I even read one of your books.

992
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:19,090
Then you know how they all end

993
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:20,240
Yeah.

994
01:38:20,630 --> 01:38:21,390
Hi.

995
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:22,160
Hi.
