00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,354
Ten hut!

2
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:02,871
<i>At ease.</i>

3
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:06,946
<i>I'm often asked, "What makes a hero?"</i>

4
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:10,274
<i>Courage, selflessness, sacrifice.</i>

5
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,581
<i>From Bunker Hill to the Alamo,</i>

6
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:15,119
<i>Gettysburg to Normandy,</i>

7
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,951
<i>Korea to Khe Sanh,
the American fighting man</i>

8
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:21,015
<i>has always answered the call of duty.</i>

9
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,219
<i>These are dangerous times, gentlemen.</i>

10
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:28,024
<i>Once more, America is in need
of its best and brightest.</i>

11
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:31,431
<i>One wonders if there are still heroes.</i>

12
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:33,832
Somebody say "hero"?

13
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,230
Hi.

14
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:38,469
Two Deadwood meatball subs

15
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:39,943
with extra tumbleweeds.

16
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:44,347
Ah, don't worry about that hair,
I'm using a new conditioner.

17
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:47,953
Sugar britches!

18
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:51,991
- Larry, we need to talk.
- Talk?

19
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,491
What is that, some kind of code
for a lunchtime quickie?

20
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:57,218
- Diaper table, ladies room.
- No, Larry...

21
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,763
I'm pregnant.

22
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,532
Pregnant. That's great news!

23
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:05,828
I just got promoted!
Now we can move in together!

24
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,997
- I got an idea, come here!
- No, Larry!

25
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:09,597
- Just a second...
- Let me...

26
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,370
I gotta do this.

27
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:13,377
<i>Hey, everybody? Folks,</i>

28
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,811
<i>my name's Larry, and I'm your server.</i>

29
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:20,051
<i>And this precious little lady right here
is my girlfriend, Karen.</i>

30
00:02:20,153 --> 00:02:21,120
Hi.

31
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,348
<i>And I'm happy to say
she's having my baby.</i>

32
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,890
Oh!

33
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:29,817
<i>So, on this special occasion just for today,</i>

34
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:33,922
<i>the salad bar will be free for an hour
with all the fixings you can handle.</i>

35
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:36,535
<i>Hold on. Before you all get up there</i>

36
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:38,627
<i>to get your bacon bits and your chick peas,</i>

37
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:40,739
<i>there's one more thing I need to do.</i>

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,501
No, Larry. Larry, please.

39
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:45,475
<i>No, honey, I want to say this
in front of God and everybody.</i>

40
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:47,569
<i>Larry, please! Larry, I...</i>

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,874
<i>Karen,</i>

42
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,274
<i>I love you with all my heart,</i>

43
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:56,446
<i>and you would make me
the happiest man in the world if</i>

44
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:58,648
<i>you'd be my wife.</i>

45
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,753
Oh!

46
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:03,617
I...

47
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,030
<i>No, say it in here. I want the whole world
to share in this special moment.</i>

48
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:15,401
<i>It's not your baby.</i>

49
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:24,407
<i>I don't understand.</i>

50
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:27,884
It means she's got a bun in her oven
that ain't your recipe.

51
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:30,649
Now, is the salad bar still free, though?

52
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:32,088
<i>Why would you care?</i>

53
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,718
<i>Doesn't look like you've had a salad
in your whole life.</i>

54
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:46,262
I'm not telling you again. Now, get in here!

55
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:52,734
- Die, paleface!
- You little bastards!

56
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:56,143
Hey! Hey, now! Hey, now! Hey!

57
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,718
Hey! Knock that shit off!

58
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,087
Those are my good golf clubs!

59
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:04,486
My little Rusty. He's a dickens, isn't he?

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,683
He's got a nice backswing.

61
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:11,855
- So, how's Connie?
- Oh, she's great.

62
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:14,364
Damn it, Bill!
You better control these kids of yours!

63
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,526
They tore up the backyard!

64
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,966
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

65
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,199
Turn the garden hose on them!
I'm busy out here.

66
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,735
I guess this is the kind
of marital bliss I'm missing out on.

67
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:28,609
Oh, marriage is a wonderful institution.

68
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,478
Of course, 50% of all marriages
end in divorce.

69
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,154
That is, if you're lucky enough
to get a divorce.

70
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:42,951
That becomes impossible when your wife's
got incriminating photos of you

71
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:47,522
simply having coffee with a young dancer
'cause she was a great listener.

72
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,802
Now, your life is just one series
of endless humiliations.

73
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:56,196
You lie awake and dream
of the sweet release

74
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,641
a murderlsuicide could bring.

75
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:02,377
But it's good, though. Really good.

76
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:03,812
<i>Nice move by Orton!</i>

77
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,644
Well, normally, I don't gotta pay for it,
but life is full of sad stories.

78
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:14,986
Oh, my God.

79
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:16,961
Hey, Victor.

80
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:20,098
What is this?

81
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,667
When I hired you as a security guard,

82
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:25,828
I didn't think you was going
to be living here.

83
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:28,930
This is a storage unit, not an apartment.

84
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:31,235
As a former law enforcement officer, it...

85
00:05:31,344 --> 00:05:33,141
Law enforcement?

86
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:36,212
You were a cop for, what, only four days

87
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:39,011
before you drive your car
right through the beauty parlor?

88
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:41,951
- It was a nail salon.
- What the hell's the difference?

89
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,214
Just...

90
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:45,153
Clean this shit up!

91
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,183
Oh,

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,850
and keep your eyes open.

93
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,260
Some drunk has been exposing himself

94
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:54,458
to the waitresses
at the Denny's across the street.

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,434
The last time, the crazy bastard
was carrying a samurai sword.

96
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,807
There's a lot of deviants out there,
ain't they, Victor?

97
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,900
But don't you worry.

98
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,640
I'm gonna keep a eye out
when I'm on my next patrol.

99
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:11,876
I gotta get going.
I've got a big weekend planned.

100
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:14,953
Look, man, you're better off
without Karen or that crummy job.

101
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:16,180
Am I?

102
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:20,615
Larry, listen to me, it's always darkest
right before the dawn, all right?

103
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,819
Now, you remember when I had shingles?

104
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:25,189
Did I give up? Nope.

105
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:27,994
I put my nose to the grindstone.
All my hard work paid off.

106
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,397
Hard work?

107
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,297
Are you kidding me?

108
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:33,200
You tripped at the Wal-Mart!

109
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,968
And every day I thank God
for that spill on aisle 6.

110
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:40,636
Because of that settlement,
I don't gotta work for another 11 months.

111
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:42,236
All right, look. Here's Everett.

112
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,509
Now, come on. It's our Reserve weekend.

113
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,518
We're gonna have a great time.
We always do.

114
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,481
Thanks for showing up, Everett.
We've only been waiting an hour.

115
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,354
Anybody ever tell you that loitering
is a class D misdemeanor

116
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,520
punishable by a $50 fine
and 10 hours of community service?

117
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,929
Hey, what's the penalty
for vehicular homicide of a beauty parlor?

118
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:02,762
It was a nail salon.

119
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:07,864
Well, what a great way
to chase away the break-up blues,

120
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:09,999
spending the weekend with two retards.

121
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:18,212
Nice shooting! Man.

122
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:19,341
What's next?

123
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,885
That bathroom scale.

124
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:23,979
I'm gonna blow up every nice thing
I ever got that woman.

125
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,582
I got her that on Valentine's Day.

126
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,650
I'm a romantic.

127
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,024
Pull!

128
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,327
Everett!

129
00:07:37,903 --> 00:07:39,894
What are y'all doing?

130
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,998
- Shooting shit.
- Grief counseling.

131
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,937
Copy that. Going on a beer run.

132
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,246
Nice!

133
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,682
- I know. I feel better already.
- Good.

134
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:56,084
Kind of hungry though.
What do you say we hit the mess hall?

135
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:57,849
Hooters?

136
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,191
Left! Left!

137
00:07:59,191 --> 00:07:59,748
Left! Left!

138
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,884
Left, right, left.

139
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:07,155
Sir, we just received another
manpower request from Washington.

140
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,063
There's increased fighting
outside of Fallujah.

141
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,192
What?

142
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:13,499
Don't those Pentagon pencil-pushers know
we're stretched to the limit down here?

143
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:14,937
What about those men down
at Chattahoochee?

144
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,669
I don't think they all reported in.

145
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:24,849
They drill at the Reserve Center
down on Highway 8.

146
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,317
Perhaps you should send Sergeant Kilgore
down there to see what we have.

147
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,615
Kilgore?

148
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,585
He scares the shit out of me.

149
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:38,327
All I'm saying is some of them girls hadn't
ought to be wearing little shorty-shorts.

150
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:39,398
That's all I'm saying.

151
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:40,760
Well, what's Crystal supposed to do?

152
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,664
You know Hooters
don't got a maternity leave.

153
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,101
Hey. Who's the new guy?

154
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:48,901
How you doing, GI Joe? Can I help you?

155
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,076
Sergeant Kilgore.

156
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,839
I'm looking for the men
that didn't mobilize with this unit.

157
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:02,483
- I ain't seen them.
- I think they went over to...

158
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:03,885
Who's in charge here, soldier?

159
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:05,547
- I am.
- I am.

160
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,287
This is

161
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:10,921
quite a setup you got here.

162
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,019
Oh, yeah, it's nice.

163
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:13,860
We're like a water-head
at the theme park in here.

164
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:14,990
It's real comfortable.

165
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,899
We're about to watch the game.
You can join us if you want. Grab a chair.

166
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:22,099
I tell you what, son. You know, I like you.

167
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:24,970
Why don't I grab a chair,

168
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,036
and shove it up your ass!

169
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:31,109
Now, stand at attention,
you miserable pissants!

170
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:34,983
From now on,
you will address me as Sergeant Kilgore!

171
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,055
The honeymoon's over, numb nuts!

172
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:38,748
I am a warrior,

173
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,485
a killing machine,

174
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,594
and your mama's not
here to wet-nurse you.

175
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,723
Larry's mom passed away
about four years ago.

176
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,822
Yeah, that's true.

177
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,265
She went squirrel hunting
with my Uncle Lester...

178
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:51,563
Shut up!

179
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,473
I don't know what kind
of horseshit monkey business

180
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:58,009
has been going on down here,
but that's all about to end, ladies.

181
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,702
This is the Army.

182
00:10:00,412 --> 00:10:03,006
We're just state military reserves.

183
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:04,746
Yeah. Smurfs.

184
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,715
And I'm a leprechaun.

185
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,048
Now, pack your gear.

186
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:12,054
But we're just weekend warriors.

187
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,987
Well, I'll tell you what, fat body,

188
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:18,393
this weekend,

189
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:19,987
I own your ass!

190
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,823
Son of a bitch.

191
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:28,465
If there was ever a worse
excuse for a soldier,

192
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,371
I'd like to meet him.

193
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,807
Hey, y'all.

194
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:35,606
<i>I got Funyuns, beer, and Barely Legal.
Who wants what?</i>

195
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,351
Well, hey, there, Sarge.
Snap into a Slim Jim.

196
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:44,413
Well, this looks like a little slice of heaven.
Can they do this to us?

197
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,887
It's the army, man.
They can do whatever they want.

198
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:49,426
Welcome to Fort Davis, ladies.

199
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,495
I want another one! Come on! One more!

200
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,660
Up, up, up! Down, up!

201
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,261
All right, you're all mine now.
You ready, Freddy?

202
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:01,566
Oh, there you go. How about that? Huh?

203
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,141
You like that?

204
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,456
- Get back here!
- What are you doing?

205
00:11:18,757 --> 00:11:20,520
Watch out! Watch out!

206
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,887
Get up there!

207
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,532
Take it like a man!

208
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,042
Get out of here!

209
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,815
You gotta stay clear...

210
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:54,354
- Come on, Everett. Let me hold it.
- No, no. It's mine.

211
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:57,127
Look out!

212
00:11:58,764 --> 00:11:59,822
Yeah!

213
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:09,370
This is a little harder than I thought.

214
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:13,172
But I guess it's the price you pay
to be a trained government killer.

215
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,613
I didn't think they could activate us.

216
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:20,879
I mean, if I wanted to get my ass kicked,
I'd have stayed home with Connie.

217
00:12:20,986 --> 00:12:24,752
I guess it easier for
a samurai-type like myself.

218
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,415
Accept the pain.

219
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,593
It's cleansing.

220
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:33,326
Plus, the weekend's almost over.
One more day and we're gone.

221
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,564
Besides, how much worse could it get?

222
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:48,337
Rise and shine, ladies!

223
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,316
Where the hell is that other fat turd?

224
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:53,646
Hey, speaking of turds,

225
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:56,220
<i>I just left one in there
for the Guinness Book.</i>

226
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,654
Stand at attention, soldier!

227
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,116
Congratulations, gentlemen.

228
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,262
We just got our orders.

229
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:06,297
We're going to paradise,

230
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,999
the land of sand and sun.

231
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:12,036
- Daytona Beach?
- Fallujah, Iraq, numb nuts!

232
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:15,004
Sarge, excuse me.

233
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,338
Far be it for me to stand in the way
of the war on terror,

234
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:22,039
but we're supposed to go home tomorrow.

235
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,575
I mean, seriously, we only do this
one weekend a month.

236
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:28,915
- Yeah, and on Mondays, I cut the grass.
- Wrong, sunshine!

237
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:30,613
You will be the tip of the spear

238
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:33,988
Uncle Sam uses to shove
up some insurgent's ass!

239
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:36,789
Sarge, now that's downright unsanitary.

240
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,921
You know, I read somewhere that them
carpet-fliers don't even use toilet paper.

241
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,590
Can it, dipshit!

242
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:45,864
And don't worry,
you won't be in the rear with the gear.

243
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:50,408
I plan on volunteering us
for every dangerous assignment there is!

244
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,906
Now, I want every one of you
to look to the man on your right!

245
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,480
Now, look to the man on your left,

246
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:59,713
'cause your life is in his hands.

247
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,046
Shit!

248
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,518
Fallujah. No, it's not in Louisiana.

249
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,153
<i>- It's in Iraq.
- Why are they sending you to Iraq?</i>

250
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:12,628
<i>- 'Cause I'm going to war!
- War?</i>

251
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:14,790
<i>- Well, I can't help it.
- Who's gonna mow the grass?</i>

252
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,561
Well, I don't know who's
gonna mow the grass.

253
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:17,692
<i>God damn it, Bill!</i>

254
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:19,600
Five hundred dollars?

255
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:22,002
Damn. Does she have four tits?

256
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,637
Well, how about a military discount?

257
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,371
Hello? Hello?

258
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,881
- Hey, what unit you with?
- 101st Airborne.

259
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,955
Screaming Eagles. You?

260
00:14:37,356 --> 00:14:40,655
37th Georgia. The Sleeping Marmots.

261
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,888
What's up, y'all? How'd Connie take it?

262
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:46,260
Let me just put it this way.
I'll be safer in Iraq.

263
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:47,662
Ten hut!

264
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:51,228
All right, you maggots,

265
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,605
we got a long road ahead of us,

266
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:55,468
and it won't be easy.

267
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:59,110
But it's my job as your
sergeant to lead the way.

268
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:00,178
Gee, thanks, Sarge.

269
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,247
I know I'll feel safer standing
directly behind you

270
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:04,008
when the bullets start flying.

271
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,659
Can that shit!

272
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,992
Now, Larry,
I'm appointing you acting squad leader.

273
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:26,832
Don't get too excited.

274
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,203
You beat out a mongoloid and a candy-ass.

275
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:31,037
He called you a candy-ass.

276
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:34,135
Gee, thanks, Sarge.
You know, I learned a lot about leadership

277
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:37,340
when I was secretary
of the Midgeville Gun Club.

278
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,445
And don't you worry about it.

279
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,576
Both those shootings
were ruled accidental.

280
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,382
Keep your hands to yourself!

281
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,787
It's don't ask and don't tell
in this man's army.

282
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:48,587
Now, get your candy-asses on that plane.

283
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:55,298
Did you hear what I said?
I gave you an order.

284
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,494
You said candy-asses. I'm a mongoloid, sir!

285
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,731
Get your ass on that plane!

286
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,737
Candy-ass.

287
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,205
Oh, sure.

288
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,547
Killing a man
with your bare hands is real easy.

289
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:17,144
Aside from the assorted
choke holds and head yanks,

290
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,554
you deliver a hand-spear to a man's temple,

291
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:23,788
Adam's apple, kidneys, armpits,
solar plexus, testicles,

292
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,626
or coccyx, that's the little
bone down by your back...

293
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,324
That's real informative, Everett,

294
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,731
but come on, I'm trying
to get some sleep here.

295
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,862
Of course, all that pales in comparison
to the heart-punch.

296
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:38,602
It's a strong man's attack,
a sharp blow delivered right to the heart.

297
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,235
<i>Chuck Norris used it once
on the set of Walker, Texas Ranger</i>

298
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:43,644
to kill some smart-ass intern.

299
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,210
Talk about your hush-money.

300
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:48,411
All right.

301
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,613
All right. That's it.

302
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,421
Let's hit it.

303
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:07,767
I don't think the flight attendant
turned off the fasten seatbelt sign.

304
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:11,206
Look, y'all, if I'm gonna die tomorrow,
I want to get a good night's sleep.

305
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,939
My Uncle Dave died in his sleep.
That's a peaceful way to go.

306
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:17,743
Of course, all his friends died
screaming from the back seat

307
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,680
trying to wake him up.

308
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,252
It was a mess.

309
00:17:21,486 --> 00:17:23,044
Good night, Everett!

310
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:25,885
- Good night, Larry.
- Good night, Larry.

311
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,659
Who farted?

312
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,560
<i>Severe weather alert until 0600 hours.</i>

313
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:41,036
<i>With a possible...</i>

314
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:45,576
I'm losing all pressure
in engines three and four!

315
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:48,737
Hydraulic pressure down
in the rear stabilizer.

316
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,110
Damn it!

317
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,165
- Oh, this is bad.
- Losing altitude.

318
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:19,243
We're overloaded.
Get ready to dump the gear.

319
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:22,874
What the...

320
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,185
Hey! Wait a minute!

321
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,063
Come on!

322
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,163
Hey! Wait a minute!

323
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:48,461
No!

324
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,651
I'm gonna kill you miserable pissants!

325
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,249
Did you hear something?

326
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:09,119
That was weird.

327
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:11,127
For a minute there,
I thought we were goners.

328
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:12,890
What are we gonna do
about the gear we dumped?

329
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:16,058
You fill out the paperwork,
and then it's the Army's problem.

330
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:19,797
Hey, you like meatloaf?
They got a killer meatloaf in Ramstein.

331
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,372
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

332
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,781
Where the hell?

333
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:39,751
Oh, son of a bitch.

334
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,024
So, this is it, Iraq,

335
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:48,261
jewel of the Middle East,

336
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,231
land of the Hammurabis.

337
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,533
Iraq? Oh, damn!

338
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:55,667
Damn! Hey, we're in... Hey!

339
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:58,004
We're in Iraq! Damn!

340
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,475
Get up! Hey!

341
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,673
Bill, we're in...

342
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,812
What in the name of Siegfried and Roy
are you fellas doing?

343
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,386
Don't ask.

344
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:10,819
Don't tell.

345
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,154
We're in Iraq!

346
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,725
We're in Iraq!

347
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,820
- All right, now, Larry, calm down.
- Be careful, Everett.

348
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,396
There's a lot of gear scattered around.

349
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,695
Now, listen to me, Larry.
Pull yourself together.

350
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:25,002
Now, we're in a hot zone.

351
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,401
It's time to take it up a notch.

352
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:40,181
Shot.

353
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,321
Leave it to Everett
to break the only working radio we got.

354
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,456
They drop us in Iraq,
they don't even wake us up.

355
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,018
What the hell are we supposed to do now?
I guarantee you this was Kilgore's idea.

356
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,325
All right, let's calm down.

357
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,931
Let's just regroup while we're here.
Last thing we need to do is panic.

358
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,231
Man down! Man down!

359
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:03,739
Man down! There's a man down!

360
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:15,912
Sarge?

361
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:20,056
I think he's dead, y'all.

362
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:22,319
K.I.A., man! K.I.A.!

363
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,123
Oh, man.

364
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:28,457
This is gonna be a lawsuit.

365
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:37,398
Well,

366
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:39,875
I guess we ought to say a few words.

367
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:41,036
Bill?

368
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:43,740
Me? You were closer to him than I was.

369
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:45,342
Well,

370
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,217
all right.

371
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:51,448
Lord,

372
00:21:52,057 --> 00:21:55,288
we ask that you be with Sergeant Kilgore.

373
00:21:56,127 --> 00:22:00,393
Sure, he was a mean bastard, incapable
of establishing normal relationships

374
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:02,363
with any other human being, and...

375
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:03,934
Larry.

376
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:07,464
But, Lord...

377
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:11,942
- Everett!
- Everett!

378
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:13,010
What the hell are you doing?

379
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,773
When we run out of water,
we're gonna have to drink our own urine.

380
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,509
Desert warfare 101, man!

381
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:21,984
Everett, now's not the time
to be talking about bodily functions.

382
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,954
We're talking to the Lord here!

383
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,224
- You want to say a few words?
- Yeah.

384
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:31,852
Dear Lord,

385
00:22:31,963 --> 00:22:34,193
I ask you to take this man,

386
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,028
for richer or for poorer,

387
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:39,763
as he walks through the valley
of the shadow of death.

388
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:41,463
And also, dear Lord,

389
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:43,700
the Powerball's up to 90 million.

390
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:46,470
So, if you could help me out,
I sure would appreciate it.

391
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:47,909
Amen!

392
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,637
- That was just great, Everett.
- Yeah, real touching.

393
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,914
Powerball!

394
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,785
Come on! Get some!

395
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:39,124
Get some!

396
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,164
All right, ladies,

397
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:48,363
let's git-r-done.

398
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,340
Operation shock and awe!

399
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:55,003
Here we go!

400
00:23:55,113 --> 00:23:56,876
Kill, kill, kill!

401
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,879
All right, y'all, let's fan out.

402
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:43,059
I'll secure the perimeter.
That Charlie's a real sneaky bastard!

403
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:44,150
Charlie?

404
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,287
You think Everett's mom drank
during pregnancy?

405
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:49,265
Yeah, and I'm guessing
she sniffed paint thinner, too.

406
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:01,678
Well, what do we have here?

407
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:04,948
Damn!

408
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,319
You know who that is?
That's the Butcher of Baghdad, buddy.

409
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,388
That's Saddam Hussein.

410
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:12,149
He's an ugly son of a bitch, isn't he?

411
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:14,418
Kind of looks like that fellow
that works the register

412
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:15,993
down there at the Circle K.

413
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:17,959
You know, Rugburn.

414
00:25:18,063 --> 00:25:19,530
You mean Raji?

415
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:22,696
Yeah, that little Indian fella.

416
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:25,531
He's a red-dot Indian though,
not a tomahawk Indian.

417
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:28,105
You're crazy.
That don't look nothing like him.

418
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,504
Only an idiot would think that.

419
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:34,410
Oh, look! It's Raji from Circle K!

420
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:35,945
Y'all hungry?

421
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,746
What's wrong with it?
Why aren't you eating?

422
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:44,845
I got spaghetti and meat sauce.

423
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:45,945
So?

424
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:48,685
It gives me bad gas.

425
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,188
Fine. Take my beef stew.

426
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:55,956
Larry, what the hell is that?

427
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,864
I needed a spit cup.

428
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:01,698
Just eat around it.

429
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:04,798
That's gross. Come on.
We gotta get on the road.

430
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:29,961
Why don't you just admit it? We're lost!

431
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,626
He thinks you're lost!

432
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:34,500
There's a town right over this next ridge!

433
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:38,576
Wait a minute.

434
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:40,235
Nope.

435
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:42,677
We're lost.

436
00:26:43,281 --> 00:26:45,476
Nothing to report from my patrols.

437
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,245
Damn it, I thought
we was gonna be in the shit.

438
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:49,820
When am I gonna get to shoot somebody?

439
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:52,481
Everett, there are specific
rules of engagement.

440
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,148
There are friendlies around.

441
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,489
You can't just run around shooting people.

442
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:58,619
You got your Geneva Convention
to think about.

443
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,358
Rule is you don't fire
unless you're fired upon.

444
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:03,457
- You understand?
- Yep.

445
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,736
One shot, one kill! Get some!

446
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:19,874
Damn it, Everett!
What the hell are you doing?

447
00:27:19,984 --> 00:27:21,246
Nice shooting!

448
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:24,378
Down on your knees,
hands behind your head!

449
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:31,587
<i>Easy, man! This ain't Cops.</i>

450
00:27:31,696 --> 00:27:34,859
<i>- I was on Cops once. Remember?
- Who could forget?</i>

451
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:38,402
High speed pursuit
followed by indecent exposure.

452
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:41,165
That was the best Thanksgiving ever.

453
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,608
All right, assume the position.

454
00:27:47,145 --> 00:27:49,545
Well, congratulations, Everett!

455
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:52,013
You just killed yourself a donkey.

456
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:54,774
We don't even know
if they have a donkey season.

457
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:55,978
What do we do now?

458
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:08,230
- Come on. Let me blow them both away.
- Calm down, Everett.

459
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,566
I guess since I'm squad leader,
I ought to do the interrogating.

460
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:14,329
Besides that, everybody knows
I'm a skilled communicator.

461
00:28:16,674 --> 00:28:18,505
Who are you?

462
00:28:20,511 --> 00:28:22,945
Are you Republican Guard?

463
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:25,840
Larry,

464
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,316
they're not deaf, they're Iraqi.

465
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,850
What we need to do is find out
whether they're Turds or Shitites.

466
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:35,983
I think you mean Kurds or Shiites.

467
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,097
Hi.

468
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,038
My name's Larry.

469
00:28:52,143 --> 00:28:54,543
We're here to liberate your people.

470
00:28:55,813 --> 00:28:58,475
We bring gifts of freedom and democracy.

471
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,344
Oh, sorry about your donkey.

472
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:13,863
Freedoms?

473
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:17,523
Freedom. Yeah, right.
We're here to liberate you.

474
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:20,137
- Freedoms!
- Freedoms!

475
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,637
- Freedoms!
- Freedoms!

476
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:23,138
Freedom, yeah!

477
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:24,708
- Freedoms.
- Freedoms.

478
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,606
Freedoms! Freedoms!

479
00:29:26,711 --> 00:29:27,905
Shut up!

480
00:29:29,647 --> 00:29:33,515
Your village?
Is your village named Baslamabad?

481
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,011
Freedoms!

482
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:41,853
- Yeah, freedoms.
- This is it, fellas. This is our objective.

483
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,051
Get ready to be heroes.

484
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:48,323
I wish Sarge was here right now.
He'd be so dag-gum proud of us.

485
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:51,935
It's alive!

486
00:29:58,343 --> 00:29:59,503
Iraq,

487
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:02,345
it's a land of miracles.

488
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:18,624
Where the hell am I?

489
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,134
You gotta be shitting me!

490
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:44,082
Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna kill those miserable pissants!

491
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:53,391
What do you see?

492
00:30:54,565 --> 00:30:57,625
Not much. I forgot to take off the lens caps.

493
00:30:58,102 --> 00:31:00,969
- And he's in charge.
- I know.

494
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,034
Well?

495
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:07,842
Iraqi insurgents. Four of them.

496
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:09,776
Freedoms. Freedoms.

497
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:12,441
Just hold on, Saddam.

498
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:16,510
Look, this is what I think we should do.

499
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,885
We just sit tight
until reinforcements get here.

500
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,753
The 101st Airborne is
gonna be here any minute.

501
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:23,656
These people are in trouble.
I think we're dealing with Fedayin.

502
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:25,023
Damn right they're in trouble.

503
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:28,292
I had some of that Fedayin
at the Parthenon Cafe.

504
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,594
Greek food goes right through me.

505
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:34,694
Irritable bowel syndrome.

506
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:42,569
It looks like she needs our help.

507
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,704
She?

508
00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:46,349
I mean "they."

509
00:31:48,886 --> 00:31:51,480
They appear to be C-cups.

510
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,224
All right, listen. Our orders are clear.

511
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:56,953
We have to engage the enemy.

512
00:31:57,061 --> 00:31:58,358
Gentlemen,

513
00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:01,097
<i>you know what they say
in the Army, Semper fi.</i>

514
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:03,631
That would be the Marines.

515
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,428
Stay here.

516
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,904
Don't worry about anything.
The cavalry is on the way.

517
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,032
They are? Oh, thank God.

518
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:17,144
I thought for a second you wanted us
to go down there by ourselves.

519
00:32:20,985 --> 00:32:23,783
When this is over, I am so gonna sue you.

520
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,860
What we need is some fighting music.

521
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,699
What the hell's that?

522
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:39,129
Hold on.

523
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,868
Here we go.

524
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:49,606
God bless America!

525
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,593
- Should I shoot?
- Hold your fire!

526
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:05,821
- Did you say fire?
- I said hold your fire!

527
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,921
All right, I'm gonna fire!

528
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,631
It's Rambo! Let's get out of here!

529
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:14,170
I'm going in!

530
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:43,732
On the ground, now!

531
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:45,802
I'm a trained killing machine!

532
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,370
Everett!

533
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,570
I think you got her, Everett!

534
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:54,033
Oh.

535
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,812
Where the hell's Larry?

536
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:01,817
I guess that coward run off, huh?

537
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,717
Not everybody's cut out
for the rigors of combat.

538
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,684
The other three got away,
but I got this guy.

539
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:10,556
Oh, hey there, Larry.

540
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:12,256
Thank you for the help, Everett.

541
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:15,560
I was just telling Bill here,
what a good job you done.

542
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:22,672
That Iraqi is a pretty language, ain't it?

543
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:24,866
Think they're friendly?

544
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,739
It's a very delicate situation

545
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:29,836
that calls for the soft touch
of a diplomat, so...

546
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:31,938
I am your king!

547
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:33,744
Bow down before me!

548
00:34:39,156 --> 00:34:41,249
Everett, get down from there!

549
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:49,332
Not just a job, it's an adventure.

550
00:34:49,433 --> 00:34:52,766
Yeah. That's the Navy,
but I know what you're saying.

551
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:08,217
Wish the Sarge was here to see this.

552
00:35:21,632 --> 00:35:24,658
At least those idiots left me
something to eat.

553
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,241
Oh, Christ!

554
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:41,982
Oh, I'll be damned! Hey! Hey!

555
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,151
Hey, am I glad to see you!

556
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:46,553
Hey...

557
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,524
<i>I don't parla any Espanola,</i>

558
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:51,618
<i>but either of you two amigos
habla Inglese?</i>

559
00:35:57,935 --> 00:35:59,800
I need a ride to the next town.

560
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:04,266
El ride-o in el car-o to el town-o.

561
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:08,238
Hey, tequila, eh?

562
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:10,279
<i>Sí. Tequila!</i>

563
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,246
Hey, hey. All right. Okay.

564
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:17,621
Yeah, well...

565
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,713
You two pissants gonna give me a ride
to the next town?

566
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:33,461
Oh, good!

567
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,297
Yeah!

568
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:38,802
<i>You're all right, amigo!</i>

569
00:36:39,243 --> 00:36:40,369
Right on!

570
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:43,574
Right on!

571
00:36:50,421 --> 00:36:53,515
Hey, Everett, why don't you
go guard the prisoner?

572
00:36:53,624 --> 00:36:55,114
Oh, hell, yeah!

573
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,160
Should we be worried
he's too excited about this?

574
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,426
Probably.

575
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:06,034
Hey, man,

576
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,627
radio's had it.

577
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:10,965
And I did a house to house search,
and there ain't nothing close to a phone

578
00:37:11,075 --> 00:37:12,975
in this little podunk town.

579
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:15,170
- So, what now?
- Well,

580
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:18,474
reckon we ought to maintain
a defensive posture,

581
00:37:18,582 --> 00:37:21,107
and then hold our position here
in case there's a counterattack.

582
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:24,585
And then, we'll link up with
some reinforcements.

583
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:26,353
I don't even know what that means.

584
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,549
I bought it.

585
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:29,649
You know, I gotta say,

586
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,091
feeling pretty good.

587
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:32,729
A couple days ago,

588
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,298
I had more problems
than a Cub Scout at the Neverland Ranch,

589
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:37,390
but now I think I've found my true calling.

590
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,196
Yeah? And what might that be?

591
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:40,292
Well, think about it.

592
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:41,735
We're in Iraq,

593
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,205
the most dangerous place in the world,

594
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:47,175
well, except for maybe Detroit,

595
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:50,304
but the point is, I've been tested
in the crucible of battle,

596
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:54,646
and my troops seized their objective
and didn't even get a scratch.

597
00:37:56,587 --> 00:38:00,284
I think I'm cut out
for this military stuff after all.

598
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:06,894
All right, Akmed.
Don't get your burka in a wad.

599
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:08,089
Jesus.

600
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:10,800
I thought maybe we'd see
more turbans around here.

601
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:11,959
Yeah.

602
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,330
Hey!

603
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:24,413
Boy, them Iraqis really know
how to throw a good party.

604
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:25,482
How are you?

605
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,312
Thank you for saving our village.

606
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:29,010
Hold on, Abdul! You speak English?

607
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,213
Of course! Many of us do!
You're country is very close to ours.

608
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,052
That's right! Our people are friends

609
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:36,023
in freedom and democracy.

610
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:40,085
Oh, right.
We're also very close together literally.

611
00:38:41,498 --> 00:38:44,058
- Somebody ought to get this guy a map.
- Yeah.

612
00:38:44,168 --> 00:38:45,760
Hey, how are you?

613
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:54,100
Man, that smells delicious!

614
00:38:54,578 --> 00:38:56,876
What do you call this local delicacy?

615
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:59,108
- Tacos.
- Tacos?

616
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:01,241
<i>- Sí, sí. Tacos.
- You got tacos here?</i>

617
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:02,649
This is...

618
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:04,084
Who would have thought
they'd have tacos here?

619
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:07,952
Tell you what, if they got pork rinds,
I'm never leaving.

620
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:11,528
That's delicious!

621
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:13,995
You do realize
that's probably a camel ass taco.

622
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:18,532
I wish my wife could
cook camel ass this good.

623
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:28,604
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself.

624
00:39:28,712 --> 00:39:30,441
My name is Maria Garcia,

625
00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:34,574
and this is my father, Antonio Garcia,
the mayor of La Miranda.

626
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:36,679
We owe you our lives.

627
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:39,551
Thank you for freeing us
from under the thumb of these bandits.

628
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:40,954
It's been far too long.

629
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:42,582
Oh, it's our pleasure, Mayor.

630
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:44,422
Bill Little, U.S. Army.

631
00:39:45,596 --> 00:39:49,032
It's my honor to introduce you
to General Eisenhower.

632
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:52,459
He's currently the ranking officer
in this theater of operations.

633
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,863
You can just call me Larry.

634
00:39:58,108 --> 00:40:02,568
You answered our prayers today, General,
and you were very brave.

635
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,444
Oh, shoot. It's just part of the job.

636
00:40:05,549 --> 00:40:08,347
This evening is yours.
Our town is your town.

637
00:40:08,452 --> 00:40:10,852
Please, please, enjoy yourselves.

638
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:22,627
A general?
What the hell did you say that for?

639
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:26,191
Well, what did you want me to say?
Hey, Maria, meet my buddy, Larry.

640
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:27,861
He just got fired from Cowboy Franks,

641
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:30,304
and his girlfriend is carrying
a parolee's baby.

642
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:31,806
Funny.

643
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:35,407
I tell you what, though, she is a looker.

644
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,675
You play your cards right,
and you could end up with a war bride.

645
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:40,977
- War bride?
- Yeah.

646
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:45,379
It's the right of every American fighting
man to take a wife in a combat zone.

647
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:48,617
My Uncle Charlie came home
from Korea with one.

648
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:50,626
Boy, Aunt Rose was pissed.

649
00:40:51,195 --> 00:40:52,856
- Hey, let's have a toast.
- A toast.

650
00:40:52,963 --> 00:40:54,294
The Army...

651
00:40:55,399 --> 00:40:58,334
- Leave the driving to us.
- Good God, man.

652
00:40:58,435 --> 00:41:00,027
That's Greyhound.

653
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:04,501
Might as well fess up, Haji,

654
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:09,443
'cause I'm gonna break you down
till I get the truth out of your ass.

655
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:12,077
I don't know what you want.

656
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:13,979
I'm just a poor Mexican.

657
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:16,814
Oh. A foreign fighter, huh?

658
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,445
Well, that's even worse in my book.

659
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:23,151
I should just ship you off
to Guantanamera Bay right now.

660
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:26,886
Don't you mean Guantanamo Bay?

661
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,062
Guantanamo, Gorgonzola!
They're all hell-holes, man!

662
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,765
Hey, Everett, I think we ought to...

663
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:38,637
What the hell are you wearing?

664
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,141
This is my sniper suit.

665
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:42,576
I'm doing some serious Psyop
shit here, man.

666
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:45,978
- We weren't issued any sniper gear.
- I brought it from home.

667
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,677
Well, you look like a retard Chewbacca.

668
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,083
How's it going with this guy?

669
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:52,553
Oh, he's a tough nut to crack,
but I'm gonna bust...

670
00:41:52,656 --> 00:41:53,816
Let me handle it!

671
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:55,892
I don't know nothing.

672
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:58,689
Where are the weapons
of mass destruction?

673
00:42:01,231 --> 00:42:04,723
Are you Republican Guard or Al-Qaeda?

674
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:08,467
Are you a Turd or a Shitite?

675
00:42:08,572 --> 00:42:10,733
Wait a minute. What...

676
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:13,207
Weapons of mass destruction?

677
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:19,338
You guys actually think that you're in...

678
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,415
Hey, what's so funny?

679
00:42:25,556 --> 00:42:27,990
You're not in Iraq, gringo.

680
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:31,721
Gringo.

681
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:34,554
That's what you say in...

682
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:36,997
Oh, my God!

683
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,293
What?

684
00:42:40,637 --> 00:42:42,127
Are we in France?

685
00:42:53,717 --> 00:42:55,048
Hey, buddy!

686
00:42:55,652 --> 00:42:59,554
This is gonna sound crazy,
but we might be in Mexico!

687
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:08,053
Oh.

688
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:10,493
Well, this is bad.

689
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,529
Really bad.

690
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:15,264
Slow down. It's not that big a deal.

691
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:17,772
We invaded Mexico.

692
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:19,203
And we're AWOL.

693
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:22,506
I mean, that alone is 10 years
in Leavenworth.

694
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:24,504
I can't do time.

695
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,876
Prison's full of chubby-chasers.

696
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:30,215
Hope you got smokes.
Cigarettes is currency in the joint, man.

697
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,346
You can't buy a prison bitch or a shank
for anything less than a carton of Kools.

698
00:43:33,457 --> 00:43:36,824
Everett, don't you have something else
to be doing?

699
00:43:36,927 --> 00:43:39,418
Yep. I'll go question the villagers.

700
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,226
See if there's been
any bin Laden sightings.

701
00:43:42,332 --> 00:43:44,095
We're in Mexico!

702
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:45,532
Roger that.

703
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,464
I'm a screw-up.

704
00:43:48,572 --> 00:43:53,600
I finally found something I was good at,
and what I do, invade a friendly nation.

705
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,270
We were asleep during the drop.

706
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,575
Who's to say the Army
doesn't want us to be here?

707
00:43:58,682 --> 00:44:01,708
Why would they want us here?
This is Mexico.

708
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:05,988
We committed an act of war
inside a sovereign nation.

709
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,323
This is an international incident
just waiting to happen.

710
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:12,054
One man's international incident
is another man's preemptive strike

711
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:13,595
in the war on terror.

712
00:44:13,697 --> 00:44:16,063
Those men weren't terrorists.

713
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,665
Hang on. Tell him, Everett.

714
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:23,371
The U.S. Government defines terrorism
as the unlawful use or threatened use

715
00:44:23,473 --> 00:44:27,375
of force or violence to intimidate
or coerce governments or societies,

716
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:30,537
often for ideological or political reasons.

717
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:34,773
Now, I don't know about you,

718
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:37,652
but those fellows sound
like terrorists to me.

719
00:44:37,754 --> 00:44:39,585
Hell, my wife could be a terrorist.

720
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:42,488
Look, man, these people
think we're heroes,

721
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,561
and there's nothing we can do
about it right now.

722
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:46,720
Eventually, somebody's gonna
come get us.

723
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,695
So, I say we just enjoy ourselves.

724
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:50,289
<i>Senor Bill?</i>

725
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,130
<i>We have more tacos and cervezas for you.</i>

726
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:56,529
You see?
If we leave now, the terrorists win.

727
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:04,310
Everett, where did you get that cannon?

728
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:07,406
This is an 1875 Napoleon 12-pounder.

729
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:10,281
Only an amateur like yourself
would call it a cannon.

730
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:12,912
I found it out behind a barn.

731
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:15,719
I thought that court order said you
wasn't supposed to be around cannons.

732
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:16,952
Only in the state of Georgia.

733
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,960
General Eisenhower,

734
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:21,053
how come you're not at the party?

735
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:25,893
Oh, I'm just strategizing my next
counteroffensive against the insurgents.

736
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:28,535
Or something like that.

737
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,707
So, you thought this was Iraq.

738
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:34,870
How can that happen? This is Mexico.

739
00:45:34,978 --> 00:45:38,641
Well, we kind of confused our latitudes
with our longitudes,

740
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:41,718
and our stalagmites with our stalactites.

741
00:45:42,352 --> 00:45:44,820
- It's a long story.
- Well, I don't care.

742
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:47,014
You saved our village from those animals.

743
00:45:47,124 --> 00:45:49,319
Yeah, who were those guys?

744
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:51,359
<i>They are vicious bandidos.</i>

745
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:56,129
Their leader is a cruel man,
nothing more than a common criminal.

746
00:45:56,366 --> 00:45:58,857
He's preyed upon our village for years,

747
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:01,961
stealing our crops
and what little else we have.

748
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:03,699
You think they might be back?

749
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:06,774
No. They are cowards.

750
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:11,245
And now we have a brave general here
to protect us.

751
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:13,916
Well, about that, I'm...

752
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:16,619
I'm not actually a general.

753
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,713
I am a squad leader though,
and that's pretty high up there.

754
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:25,019
One day, I hope to travel
across those mountains to the ocean.

755
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:29,155
And I will open a cantina
on a beautiful beach far away from here.

756
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:33,031
Well, if you need an assistant manager,
I got some experience.

757
00:46:34,738 --> 00:46:36,228
Maria!

758
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:39,201
That's my father. I must go.

759
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:43,506
But perhaps you will allow me the honor
to cook dinner for you some night?

760
00:46:44,748 --> 00:46:47,182
The honor would be all mine.

761
00:46:47,784 --> 00:46:49,843
- Good night.
- Good night.

762
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:51,415
Oh...

763
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:53,420
What was the name of that bandit leader?

764
00:46:55,792 --> 00:46:58,761
His name is one that strikes fear

765
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:01,524
into the hearts
of decent people everywhere.

766
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:05,598
The bastard's name is Carlos Santana.

767
00:47:18,048 --> 00:47:19,845
Let's get this party started!

768
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:22,316
Okay, so where's the entertainment?

769
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:24,516
Bring out the gringo!

770
00:47:25,555 --> 00:47:28,683
<i>El Jefe, I think you're really
going to like this act, Jefe.</i>

771
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:31,224
We kidnapped him from a hotel in Cancún.

772
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:35,426
<i>So, without further ado,
por favor, please welcome</i>

773
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:38,194
the Amazing Ken and Rufus!

774
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,367
Thank you. Quite a crowd.
What do you think, Rufus?

775
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:46,936
Lots of Mexicans tonight.

776
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:51,002
Feels like I'm standing
in front of the Home Depot.

777
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:55,449
Be nice, Rufus. How about a joke?

778
00:47:55,552 --> 00:47:56,541
Okay.

779
00:47:56,653 --> 00:48:02,250
Do you know why there were only
3,000 Mexicans at the Battle of the Alamo?

780
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:05,351
- No. Why?
- They only had four trucks.

781
00:48:06,363 --> 00:48:07,523
Boo! Boo!

782
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:08,791
That's not funny!

783
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:13,095
Relax, sweetheart.
I did not know this was a gay bar.

784
00:48:14,671 --> 00:48:16,605
He's just kidding.

785
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,570
What is your name, sir?

786
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:21,439
I am Carlos Santana.

787
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:23,945
Holy shit! The singer?

788
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:27,945
No, not the singer!
I'm the real Carlos Santana!

789
00:48:28,051 --> 00:48:31,612
Man of courage, honor. The leader of men!

790
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,920
That other guy, he is just a guitar player.

791
00:48:35,025 --> 00:48:37,391
Yeah, well, I think you both suck.

792
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,391
You shot Rufus!

793
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,394
I was aiming for the Amazing Ken.

794
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:57,642
Luis, you are back.
How did the pillaging go?

795
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:01,143
<i>Not so good, Jefe.</i>

796
00:49:01,284 --> 00:49:03,013
What do you mean, not so good?

797
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,711
There was a problem.

798
00:49:04,821 --> 00:49:06,254
And we could not get your tribute.

799
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:07,323
What?

800
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:10,825
<i>Jefe, you don't understand!
There's nothing we could do.</i>

801
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:13,156
The American Army show up.

802
00:49:14,664 --> 00:49:17,030
There were hundreds of them.

803
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:21,035
<i>They captured Ricardo.
Jefe, we barely escaped with our lives.</i>

804
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:24,396
Gringo soldiers in La Miranda.

805
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,300
It was good you brought me this news.

806
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:29,503
Since they shut off the cable,
I can't get CNN.

807
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:30,807
Hard to stay current.

808
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:35,115
I thought you were going to kill me.

809
00:49:35,418 --> 00:49:37,545
Kill you?

810
00:49:37,654 --> 00:49:40,179
We have shared
many a great adventure together.

811
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:45,720
I would never kill you.

812
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:51,724
Paco and Hector are going to kill you.

813
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:55,698
<i>Jefe, please don't kill me! Jefe! Jefe, no!</i>

814
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:58,467
<i>Jefe! Are we going to destroy La Miranda?</i>

815
00:50:00,143 --> 00:50:02,634
No, I don't like to work on the weekends.

816
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:05,374
Tonight, it's karaoke!

817
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:34,476
What did you guys do last night?

818
00:50:34,578 --> 00:50:36,876
You missed a hell of a party.

819
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,277
You were partying?

820
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:40,406
It's part of the hero business, man.

821
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:43,917
For us not to partake in the celebration
would have just been rude.

822
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:44,987
Relax.

823
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:48,621
We're goodwill ambassadors
winning over hearts and minds.

824
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:52,217
Everett, that's exactly why
you shouldn't drink tequila.

825
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:53,387
Damn.

826
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:57,099
This always happens when I eat the worm.

827
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,690
Where were you?

828
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,305
You went and saw
that little girl, didn't you?

829
00:51:04,274 --> 00:51:05,605
Did y'all do the chimichanga?

830
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:08,143
Oh, come on, Bill. Don't be crude, man.

831
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:10,712
Larry's a gentleman, and Maria's a lady.

832
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:12,406
Did you bang her?

833
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:17,213
All right, listen, I was up all night thinking
about our situation.

834
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,812
We just can't be running around
a country we're not supposed to be in.

835
00:51:20,924 --> 00:51:24,325
So, I think we ought to just stay right here
and wait for the Army to pick us up.

836
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:26,224
- So, we're staying?
- Relax.

837
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:28,194
This ain't the infield at Talladega.

838
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,856
Since we're stuck here,

839
00:51:29,966 --> 00:51:32,696
I figure we ought to do
what we're supposed to do.

840
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:34,770
And these folks have
been pretty hospitable.

841
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:39,837
I think it's time we return the favor.
So, come on, let's get to it.

842
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:46,848
<i>- You want to change there, senorita?
- Oh, I forgot I had this on.</i>

843
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,508
It really breathes.

844
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:52,752
Iraq? You guys may want to buy a map, eh?

845
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:55,256
But what my father means to say

846
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:57,121
is that we are really appreciative

847
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:59,354
for what you have done
for our poor village.

848
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:01,191
We know we messed up,

849
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:04,623
and kind of hoping
we can keep this our little secret.

850
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:06,961
We'd like to stick around
and provide perimeter security

851
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,332
and help restore your infrastructure.

852
00:52:08,438 --> 00:52:10,668
Infrastructure? Okay!

853
00:52:10,774 --> 00:52:13,140
First place you can start is this well.

854
00:52:13,243 --> 00:52:14,870
It's been dry for years.

855
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:18,072
We're forced to carry water from the river.

856
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:19,739
Yeah. No problem.

857
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:22,113
Thank you for your generosity.

858
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,846
My pleasure, ma'am.

859
00:52:24,954 --> 00:52:27,479
Here's the problem with the well.

860
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:30,253
It's dry.

861
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:57,876
That's right, boys! Can't hate number 8!

862
00:53:14,304 --> 00:53:15,737
They love it!

863
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:31,217
Hey, where'd you get all those extra nails?

864
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:33,983
I just pulled them out of that old shed.

865
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:39,221
Everett!

866
00:53:51,608 --> 00:53:53,576
You know, we're doing a lot of good.

867
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:55,735
They could really use
these medical supplies.

868
00:53:55,845 --> 00:53:57,278
Copy that.

869
00:54:00,483 --> 00:54:03,452
Oh, man. Guys, you gotta see this.

870
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:10,926
What do you think happened?

871
00:54:11,027 --> 00:54:12,460
I don't know.

872
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:15,021
Maybe some wild critters dug him up.

873
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:17,622
I think it's a more logical explanation.

874
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:20,065
The Chupacabra.

875
00:54:20,236 --> 00:54:21,999
- What?
- The Chupacabra.

876
00:54:22,105 --> 00:54:23,970
It's a mythical hairless dog-like creature

877
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,472
that sucks the blood out
of both man and beast.

878
00:54:26,576 --> 00:54:29,136
It's been terrorizing these parts for years.

879
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,473
Either that, or it's grave robbers.

880
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,811
I mean, you can get top dollar
for a testicle on eBay these days.

881
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:38,482
Poor bastard. Couldn't even rest in peace.

882
00:54:55,972 --> 00:54:58,463
I am gonna kill you deviant bastards!

883
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:25,391
<i>What are you doing, Senor Bill?</i>

884
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:29,904
Trying to get this dang radio working.
I need to talk to my superior.

885
00:55:30,006 --> 00:55:32,873
Well, why don't you just use a telephone?

886
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:35,067
You got a phone?

887
00:55:35,178 --> 00:55:39,171
Well, not here in town,
but I can show you where.

888
00:55:42,218 --> 00:55:44,118
Now, we need to keep this
between you and I.

889
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,314
See, it's a covert op, and we don't want
General Larry interfering.

890
00:55:47,423 --> 00:55:50,824
Why wouldn't you want him to know?
I thought you had to call your superior.

891
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:53,122
I do. My wife.

892
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,063
<i>Oh, sí, Senor Bill.</i>

893
00:55:55,698 --> 00:55:57,290
It will be our secret.

894
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,799
Good. Now, where the hell is this phone?

895
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,070
<i>Shut up in there! Hello?</i>

896
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:06,835
Hey, sweetie! It's me!

897
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:09,377
<i>Why haven't you called? Are you in Iraq?</i>

898
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:12,175
No. No, we had a little change of plans.

899
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:13,306
<i>This better be good.</i>

900
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:15,611
Yeah, it's actually a pretty funny story.

901
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:17,208
<i>Quiet in there! I'm talking to your dad!</i>

902
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,878
We're in Mexico.

903
00:56:19,155 --> 00:56:21,316
<i>Mexico? You better get
your ass right back here...</i>

904
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:23,415
<i>- Senor Bill?
- Hang on a second.</i>

905
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:24,959
<i>A two-way whore in a rowdy...</i>

906
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:27,791
No, no, no, no.
Now, you hold on a second, honey.

907
00:56:27,897 --> 00:56:30,832
It's not like that at all.
I'm not on vacation down here.

908
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:33,198
<i>Damn right you're not on vacation.
What are you doing down there?</i>

909
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,600
I'm working!

910
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:37,434
Hey, this is part
of a government sanctioned incursion

911
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:40,168
into a sovereign nation
as part of Operation Sombrero.

912
00:56:40,276 --> 00:56:41,300
<i>You're a part of a government operation?</i>

913
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:44,005
Yeah. Yeah, so, tell the boys,
their daddy is a hero.

914
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:45,740
<i>Senor Bill?</i>

915
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:46,906
Hang on a second!

916
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:48,210
<i>Are you coming home or not?</i>

917
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:50,912
No. I don't know when I'm gonna be home.

918
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:52,578
Well, I don't know. Hell.

919
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:54,384
<i>- Wrong!
- Hello?</i>

920
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,821
Connie?

921
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:56,983
Hello.

922
00:56:58,194 --> 00:57:01,254
<i>- Hey, what is...
- Oh, I'm sorry, senor.</i>

923
00:57:01,364 --> 00:57:03,127
Did I cut you off?

924
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:12,201
Shit.

925
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:13,775
Okay, gringo,

926
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:16,344
how many more men you
got back in La Miranda?

927
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:19,938
All I gotta tell you
is my name, rank, and favorite cereal.

928
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:22,415
And that's all you're getting.

929
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,918
I think Ruben likes you.

930
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:31,823
It just seems odd that a man of your stature

931
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:35,091
would embrace alternative lifestyles
amongst his men.

932
00:57:35,198 --> 00:57:37,689
You can't fire someone
because they're gay!

933
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,768
That's discrimination!

934
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:41,496
You can get sued for that, eh?

935
00:57:41,604 --> 00:57:43,731
Besides, he's my nephew.

936
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,104
<i>You can't choose your familia.</i>

937
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:49,678
So, he's here, he's queer. Get used to it.

938
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:52,873
I'm still not telling you anything.

939
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:56,349
Start talking or I'll tell Ruben
he can marry you.

940
00:57:56,452 --> 00:57:58,010
He wants a wife.

941
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:01,813
Well, there's just three of us.

942
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:04,188
We don't have an idea what we're doing.
We thought this was Iraq.

943
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:05,453
Can you believe that? Iraq.

944
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:08,086
Who would make that stupid mistake?

945
00:58:08,898 --> 00:58:11,093
You and you men
have really done some good here.

946
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:14,533
Oh, well, just goes to show you
what a little hard work

947
00:58:14,637 --> 00:58:16,366
and ingenuity can do.

948
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:18,733
You must have learned
so much in the Army.

949
00:58:19,142 --> 00:58:22,703
Oh, shoot, yeah.
We're all highly-trained individuals.

950
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:26,676
Hey, Larry! Help me out with this thing!

951
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:28,717
Well, most of us, anyway.

952
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:31,616
- I better handle this. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

953
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:42,697
I think I got it now.

954
00:58:48,004 --> 00:58:49,972
Look out, you idiot! Not at the village!

955
00:58:50,073 --> 00:58:52,268
- Oh, yeah.
- Turn it!

956
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,041
Stand back!

957
00:58:58,681 --> 00:59:01,411
Damn it! That's been happening all day!

958
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,212
I don't get it.

959
00:59:04,954 --> 00:59:08,014
I'm gonna get this thing working
if it kills me.

960
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:14,153
- Damn it. Come on, Everett!
- I'm right behind you, buddy!

961
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:16,358
Damn!

962
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:27,104
People of La Miranda,

963
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:31,441
<i>you have disobeyed your Jefe
by not paying my tribute.</i>

964
00:59:31,547 --> 00:59:34,448
Now, come out and take your punishment!

965
00:59:35,017 --> 00:59:36,882
Hold it right there!

966
00:59:36,986 --> 00:59:40,046
You're in a lot of trouble, gringo!
This is not Iraq!

967
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:41,487
I am the law here!

968
00:59:41,591 --> 00:59:43,684
I am Carlos Santana!

969
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:46,759
The singer?

970
00:59:46,863 --> 00:59:49,229
Definitely not the singer.

971
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,659
We caught your friend here
trying to call his wife.

972
00:59:53,769 --> 00:59:55,100
What?

973
00:59:55,204 --> 00:59:57,672
You found a phone,
and the one person you call is your wife?

974
00:59:57,773 --> 00:59:59,798
She gets moody if I don't check in.

975
00:59:59,909 --> 01:00:01,968
<i>She sounds like a real bitch, senor.</i>

976
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:04,444
You have to set some boundaries.

977
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:07,507
All right, turn him loose!

978
01:00:07,617 --> 01:00:10,347
Turn him loose?
We have you outnumbered.

979
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:14,150
What are you gonna do,
kill us all by yourself?

980
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:16,349
Nope.

981
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:20,659
I'm just gonna kill you.

982
01:00:22,598 --> 01:00:23,587
Oh.

983
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:25,964
I hadn't thought of that.

984
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:30,269
Well, looks like we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff.

985
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:35,104
<i>Actually, senor,
down here, we just call it a standoff.</i>

986
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:36,439
Yeah, okay.

987
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:38,570
Tell your people to stand back.

988
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:39,773
This is my town!

989
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:42,146
You don't give the orders here, I do!

990
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:47,880
In just a few minutes,
the entire 101st Airborne

991
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,457
is gonna come down that road.

992
01:00:50,126 --> 01:00:51,354
They are?

993
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:53,985
Just go with me on this.

994
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,059
<i>Senor, I think you're bluffing!</i>

995
01:01:09,445 --> 01:01:11,675
Iraq, it's a land of miracles.

996
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:13,675
Sarge? You're alive?

997
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:15,683
Shut up, numb nuts.

998
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,052
Surprised to see me, maggots?

999
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:23,190
Can we sort this out later, Sarge?

1000
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:27,156
- Little bit of a situation on our hands.
- You bet your ass we got a situation.

1001
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:29,527
You assholes are A-W-O-L!

1002
01:01:31,867 --> 01:01:32,925
What?

1003
01:01:33,035 --> 01:01:36,596
I was just telling these armed men,
the rest of our highly-trained

1004
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:40,540
firepower-out-the-ass 101st Airborne
was coming up right behind you.

1005
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:42,110
Are you nuts?

1006
01:01:42,778 --> 01:01:44,006
We're not even in Iraq.

1007
01:01:44,313 --> 01:01:46,611
There's no one here! We're alone.

1008
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:48,616
Now give me that weapon.

1009
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:52,280
This shit-hole of a country is Mexico.

1010
01:01:52,388 --> 01:01:53,377
Hey!

1011
01:01:53,489 --> 01:01:56,890
You're not exactly a box of chocolates,
eh, sweetheart?

1012
01:01:56,993 --> 01:01:58,722
Mind your own business, Pedro.

1013
01:01:58,828 --> 01:02:02,161
<i>Actually, senor, this is my business.</i>

1014
01:02:06,035 --> 01:02:07,263
Oh, shit.

1015
01:02:15,378 --> 01:02:17,312
Put your hands in the air now!

1016
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:18,903
You have the right to remain silent!

1017
01:02:19,015 --> 01:02:20,312
You have the right to an attorney!

1018
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:22,043
What the hell is that?

1019
01:02:22,151 --> 01:02:26,110
This is a Mark 153 shoulder-launch
multipurpose assault weapon.

1020
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:30,216
Who wants to ride the pain train?

1021
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:36,990
Well, boys, looks like we got ourselves
a Mexican standoff.

1022
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:42,329
Hey, Sarge. You still got your testicles?

1023
01:02:42,438 --> 01:02:44,167
Everett? Everett, hand that thing over.

1024
01:02:44,273 --> 01:02:45,240
- No, I can do it.
- Hand it over.

1025
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:46,330
I'm a trained law enforcement officer.

1026
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:47,466
You're gonna hurt somebody.

1027
01:02:47,576 --> 01:02:48,736
Watch and learn!

1028
01:02:48,844 --> 01:02:50,209
Everett, no!

1029
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:55,912
Incoming!

1030
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,781
Hell, yeah!

1031
01:03:42,198 --> 01:03:44,359
That's what I'm talking about!

1032
01:03:50,272 --> 01:03:54,834
Not only have you saved us again,
but you've given us the miracle of water.

1033
01:03:56,245 --> 01:03:58,839
- Nice shooting, Everett.
- I know.

1034
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:03,044
You know what they say?
The Army, toughest job you'll ever love.

1035
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,449
No, that's the Peace Corps.

1036
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,917
Hey!

1037
01:04:08,023 --> 01:04:08,785
Where's Sarge?

1038
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:10,757
God damn it, Everett!

1039
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,522
I'm gonna tear off your head
and shit down your...

1040
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:16,462
Say hello to my nephew Ruben.

1041
01:04:20,636 --> 01:04:21,694
Shit.

1042
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,507
Do you really think this is a good idea?

1043
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:29,771
I mean, we've already buried Sarge once,

1044
01:04:30,112 --> 01:04:33,411
and I don't know
if I can go through this again,

1045
01:04:33,549 --> 01:04:35,278
emotionally speaking.

1046
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:38,910
Look, he may be an asshole,
but he's our asshole.

1047
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:43,424
Everett, what are you doing?

1048
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:47,286
I'm changing the terror level
from orange to red pinata.

1049
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:49,023
Everett, get down!

1050
01:04:51,267 --> 01:04:54,862
Are you sure you must do this?
This is not your fight.

1051
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:58,428
Look, once they messed with Sarge,
it became our fight.

1052
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:07,742
Bin Laden, here we come!

1053
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,148
Shut up, Everett.

1054
01:05:13,556 --> 01:05:14,682
Lock up the prisoner!

1055
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,155
<i>Jefe, are we going
to burn down La Miranda?</i>

1056
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,955
Tonight it's wrestling!

1057
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:23,656
Yeah!

1058
01:05:24,867 --> 01:05:26,164
<i>El Javalina!</i>

1059
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,565
<i>Who's he fighting, Jefe?</i>

1060
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:31,663
You and Hector.

1061
01:05:31,774 --> 01:05:33,435
<i>But, Jefe...</i>

1062
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,339
I would love to.

1063
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,911
All right. Does everybody know the plan?

1064
01:05:44,019 --> 01:05:45,077
Yeah.

1065
01:05:45,554 --> 01:05:46,680
Affirmative.

1066
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:48,984
Crack skulls and kick ass!

1067
01:05:53,629 --> 01:05:57,087
Well, we may never see him again.

1068
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,100
I'm gonna miss that little mongoloid.

1069
01:06:00,202 --> 01:06:03,729
You disable the vehicles.
I'm gonna get Sarge.

1070
01:06:07,576 --> 01:06:09,510
Boy, am I glad to see a friendly face.

1071
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:14,614
I have had the darnedest time
ever since I left the interstate.

1072
01:06:14,717 --> 01:06:18,016
<i>I think we took a wrong
turn at buenas noches.</i>

1073
01:06:19,221 --> 01:06:20,745
What you have to do is...

1074
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:23,518
That's what I need to do right there.

1075
01:06:41,744 --> 01:06:44,110
I'm getting too fat for this shit.

1076
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:11,067
Electric shock, huh?

1077
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,642
Well, in the Mekong Delta,

1078
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:17,371
the Vietcong stuck bamboo shoots
under my fingernails.

1079
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:20,414
It'll take a lot more than that to break me.

1080
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:23,113
What the hell is this?

1081
01:07:29,124 --> 01:07:30,489
It's a duet!

1082
01:08:02,391 --> 01:08:04,325
Hey, hey, hey!

1083
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:37,317
Who else is man enough
to step into the ring?

1084
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:39,322
<i>Right here, amigo!</i>

1085
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:41,051
<i>Who is this maricón?</i>

1086
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:42,562
I don't know,

1087
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:44,321
but I like him.

1088
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:55,536
He's got style!

1089
01:08:56,211 --> 01:09:00,238
<i>Muchachos, a masked challenger
is gonna take on El Javalina.</i>

1090
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,820
Hold on, Sarge. I'm coming.

1091
01:09:15,931 --> 01:09:18,627
Come on, Tijuana! You want some?

1092
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:20,167
You gonna get some!

1093
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:22,328
Hey, don't you worry about anything, man.
I'm a pro.

1094
01:09:22,438 --> 01:09:23,598
I'm a card-carrying member

1095
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:26,197
of the Georgia
Independent Wrestling Alliance.

1096
01:09:26,308 --> 01:09:28,868
Just take a lookout for my trick knee.

1097
01:09:51,366 --> 01:09:53,857
Man, look at the size of that son of a bitch.

1098
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:56,767
- He'd have ripped you a...
- Get me loose!

1099
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:00,942
I hate Sonny and Cher.

1100
01:10:01,043 --> 01:10:03,273
Hey, Bill's down by the gate.
I'm gonna go get Everett.

1101
01:10:03,512 --> 01:10:04,501
Okay.

1102
01:10:09,618 --> 01:10:11,051
What are you doing?

1103
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:12,484
Hey, Sarge.

1104
01:10:13,188 --> 01:10:16,885
You're wearing the enemy's uniform.
I should have known you'd be a traitor.

1105
01:10:16,992 --> 01:10:18,516
No, I'm undercover.

1106
01:10:19,128 --> 01:10:22,120
I'm wrecking the vehicles. Here's the plan.

1107
01:10:22,364 --> 01:10:24,855
I'm putting sugar in their gas tanks.

1108
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:28,600
I got a better idea.

1109
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:30,330
Okay.

1110
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:54,384
Oh!

1111
01:10:54,563 --> 01:10:57,589
I see we're playing
by Panamanian prison rules.

1112
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:08,776
<i>Yeah, take some of this, amigo!</i>

1113
01:11:22,724 --> 01:11:25,659
You just bought yourself
a six pack of pain, buddy!

1114
01:11:25,794 --> 01:11:27,659
Come get some!

1115
01:11:34,436 --> 01:11:37,132
I'm the king! I'm the king!

1116
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:49,613
Get set for the full force of the U.S. Military!

1117
01:11:49,718 --> 01:11:51,481
Get them, guys!

1118
01:11:53,822 --> 01:11:54,880
Guys?

1119
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:56,488
I know you!

1120
01:11:56,658 --> 01:11:59,525
You're that retarded guy with the bazooka!

1121
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:01,027
It was a rocket-launcher.

1122
01:12:01,129 --> 01:12:02,721
<i>Kill this cabrón!</i>

1123
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:06,760
Hold it right there!

1124
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,133
You gotta be kidding me!

1125
01:12:09,438 --> 01:12:12,271
You gringos are like
a bad case of the crabs.

1126
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:13,739
I can't get rid of you!

1127
01:12:13,842 --> 01:12:15,833
Everett, get over here.

1128
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:22,674
<i>You, senor, are either very brave
or very stupid.</i>

1129
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:25,275
Either way, you can't kill all of us.

1130
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:27,321
Probably not.

1131
01:12:28,156 --> 01:12:30,249
I'll just kill you.

1132
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:32,983
Damn! I keep doing that.

1133
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:34,960
Good job, Larry.

1134
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:37,156
I'm out of here. You disarm them,

1135
01:12:37,266 --> 01:12:38,961
and I'll meet you back
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1136
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:43,269
All right, come on! Let's get out of here!

1137
01:12:55,183 --> 01:12:57,083
Let's go! Shotgun!

1138
01:12:57,185 --> 01:12:59,016
Damn you, Everett!

1139
01:13:09,831 --> 01:13:11,526
They're over there!

1140
01:13:16,705 --> 01:13:19,196
<i>Look at our cars, Jefe.</i>

1141
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:21,208
Who would do such a thing?

1142
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:23,038
That's vandalism!

1143
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:25,477
Saddle up the horses
and bring out Big Bertha!

1144
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:27,581
Come on! Move, move, move!

1145
01:13:27,683 --> 01:13:28,809
Come on! Let's go!

1146
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:30,077
Go! Go!

1147
01:13:30,185 --> 01:13:32,779
This is the end of La Miranda.

1148
01:13:42,731 --> 01:13:43,823
You made it back.

1149
01:13:43,932 --> 01:13:45,832
I'm so glad. I was very worried.

1150
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:48,664
<i>There's still a certain senorita
I gotta take out on the town.</i>

1151
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,466
Or make sweet, sweet love to her
under the stars

1152
01:13:51,573 --> 01:13:56,533
as a mariachi bands serenades you
with a song of romance and desire.

1153
01:13:56,645 --> 01:13:59,409
You saved our village
by killing Carlos Santana.

1154
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:01,675
Well, not quite.

1155
01:14:01,783 --> 01:14:03,683
Son, make it quick. We gotta get going.

1156
01:14:03,785 --> 01:14:06,276
What? We can't leave.

1157
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:09,054
Santana might be
on his way down here right now,

1158
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:11,022
and this village is defenseless.

1159
01:14:11,126 --> 01:14:15,392
Son, you showed me something
by coming to save me, you really did.

1160
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:18,226
But this is out of my hands.
We have to leave.

1161
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,891
- Bill?
- This isn't Iraq.

1162
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,470
It's Mexico.

1163
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:25,404
We did what we could do,
but this isn't our fight.

1164
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:26,804
Sorry, son.

1165
01:14:27,409 --> 01:14:28,376
I'm not leaving.

1166
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:29,569
Oh, Larry, come on!

1167
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:32,044
Private, I'm giving you an order.

1168
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:35,483
I think you guys forgot what our orders are.

1169
01:14:35,584 --> 01:14:37,381
We're supposed to bring
freedom and democracy

1170
01:14:37,486 --> 01:14:39,351
to people that need it.

1171
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:42,346
I think these people need it.

1172
01:14:43,058 --> 01:14:44,423
I'm staying.

1173
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,726
I'm staying to finish the job.
I'm staying to do what's right.

1174
01:14:53,402 --> 01:14:57,429
Anybody that's with me can cross this line.

1175
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:00,999
Oh, come on, guys!

1176
01:15:02,077 --> 01:15:06,343
Sarge, look at these people.
They're honest, hardworking.

1177
01:15:07,616 --> 01:15:10,016
They got hopes, dreams.

1178
01:15:11,019 --> 01:15:13,214
Ain't you ever had a dream?

1179
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:14,549
Shit.

1180
01:15:15,357 --> 01:15:16,949
Hell, you got me.

1181
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:22,462
I always wanted to be
an aerobics instructor.

1182
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:23,887
Okay.

1183
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:30,969
Don't look at me, man.
I got a wife and kids to think about.

1184
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:34,509
And what would you do if Connie
and the boys lived in a town like this?

1185
01:15:34,609 --> 01:15:36,577
Would you leave them then?

1186
01:15:38,313 --> 01:15:39,302
No.

1187
01:15:40,282 --> 01:15:41,476
Damn it.

1188
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,582
All right.

1189
01:15:44,953 --> 01:15:48,753
Like they say in the Army,
be all you can be.

1190
01:15:49,658 --> 01:15:51,455
You got it right!

1191
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:55,755
Who am I kidding?
I live in a storage locker.

1192
01:15:55,864 --> 01:15:57,627
I'm not going anywhere.

1193
01:15:57,732 --> 01:16:01,168
All right, then.
We got all day to figure out a plan.

1194
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,635
Come on, we're the Sleeping Marmots!

1195
01:16:03,738 --> 01:16:06,002
What else can Santana do to us?

1196
01:16:06,808 --> 01:16:10,175
<i>Senor! Senor!
I think you better take a look at this.</i>

1197
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,717
A tank?

1198
01:16:25,827 --> 01:16:27,021
Where'd they get that?

1199
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:31,226
That's a Sherman tank, U.S. Army surplus!

1200
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,463
Back in the '80s, the Mexicans traded
15,000 cases of Chiclets for them.

1201
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,094
You're kidding!

1202
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:38,567
Incoming!

1203
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,668
Down!

1204
01:16:51,386 --> 01:16:52,353
Get everybody in the church!

1205
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:54,285
- But what about...
- Now!

1206
01:17:03,298 --> 01:17:04,560
We gotta take that tank out.

1207
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:05,963
Get the rocket-launcher!

1208
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:08,729
I got it, Sarge! It's in the bunkhouse!

1209
01:17:09,137 --> 01:17:10,604
Cover him.

1210
01:17:21,816 --> 01:17:24,114
If I die, Connie's gonna kill me!

1211
01:17:24,219 --> 01:17:26,153
We gotta take that tank out!

1212
01:17:26,254 --> 01:17:29,280
Don't we have anything
in this town we can use?

1213
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:32,184
Cover me!

1214
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:34,387
Cover me!

1215
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:36,896
You heard the man! Cover him!

1216
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:41,092
I said cover me!

1217
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:45,063
Bitch!

1218
01:18:06,294 --> 01:18:07,488
Come on!

1219
01:18:09,364 --> 01:18:10,592
Come on!

1220
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,430
Damn it! Come on!

1221
01:18:22,477 --> 01:18:25,037
Shit. That'll work.

1222
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:39,519
It is time for us to stand up to Santana
once and for all!

1223
01:18:47,802 --> 01:18:49,667
Come on! Let's get them!

1224
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,096
Remember the Alamo!

1225
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,607
<i>That is a sore subject around here, senor.</i>

1226
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:20,261
We did it. We ran them off!

1227
01:19:20,735 --> 01:19:24,569
<i>- Where's Maria?
- Oh, General, Santana has taken her.</i>

1228
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:28,704
You have any more daughters?

1229
01:19:29,377 --> 01:19:30,537
Lupita.

1230
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:33,708
I'll go find Maria.

1231
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,540
Stupid gringos.

1232
01:19:36,918 --> 01:19:38,545
They may have won this battle,

1233
01:19:38,653 --> 01:19:42,111
but as usual,
Carlos Santana will win the war.

1234
01:19:42,223 --> 01:19:43,554
Far enough!

1235
01:19:44,025 --> 01:19:45,515
Now let her go!

1236
01:19:46,961 --> 01:19:49,122
What do you see in this fat redneck?

1237
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:51,198
Fat redneck?

1238
01:19:51,299 --> 01:19:54,462
I swear, on Monday,
I'm starting a low-carb diet.

1239
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:58,468
Now I'll have to kill both of you.

1240
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:06,978
It will take more than one helicopter
to defeat Carlos Santana!

1241
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:11,447
This is not good.

1242
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:43,284
Thank you.

1243
01:20:44,753 --> 01:20:46,914
Papa! Oh, thank God!

1244
01:20:47,288 --> 01:20:49,153
Look forward and come this way, please!

1245
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:50,518
Hey, everybody okay?

1246
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:52,159
Oh, sure. Everybody's fine.

1247
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,725
Couldn't be better.

1248
01:20:53,828 --> 01:20:54,817
Bill got shot.

1249
01:20:54,929 --> 01:20:56,760
Bill got... What?

1250
01:20:59,734 --> 01:21:01,964
Bill! You all right?

1251
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:06,066
They got me!
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1252
01:21:06,307 --> 01:21:07,501
Larry...

1253
01:21:08,643 --> 01:21:10,804
You tell them my story.

1254
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:17,111
He was shot in the ass. He'll be fine.

1255
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:21,012
- Sir.
- Colonel Dalton, Delta Force.

1256
01:21:21,122 --> 01:21:23,090
Is there a Bill Little here?

1257
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:24,351
Yeah. That's me.

1258
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:26,290
Your wife's a real pain in the ass.

1259
01:21:26,394 --> 01:21:29,261
When she found out you were in Mexico,
she started calling the Pentagon.

1260
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:32,160
Wouldn't stop till the Joint Chiefs
sent us down here to get you.

1261
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,632
God, I love that woman.

1262
01:21:33,735 --> 01:21:37,671
Yeah. You better mow the lawn
when you get home.

1263
01:21:37,772 --> 01:21:39,205
Yes, sir.

1264
01:21:39,674 --> 01:21:42,575
Hey, Larry, this guy wants to talk to you.
Says he's from the State Department.

1265
01:21:42,677 --> 01:21:46,545
Roger Grabowski,
undersecretary, Central American affairs.

1266
01:21:46,648 --> 01:21:50,106
You hear that? Poor bastard's a secretary.

1267
01:21:50,718 --> 01:21:52,948
Bit of a sticky situation we've got here.

1268
01:21:53,054 --> 01:21:55,522
We're in a lot of trouble, ain't we?

1269
01:21:55,623 --> 01:21:57,921
Maybe not. That is,

1270
01:21:58,026 --> 01:22:00,051
if you guys will cooperate.

1271
01:22:01,262 --> 01:22:03,093
We're all about cooperation.

1272
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:05,598
Another victory in the war on terror

1273
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,998
as the White House today
announced the success

1274
01:22:08,102 --> 01:22:09,899
of Operation Sombrero

1275
01:22:10,338 --> 01:22:13,501
with strikes against terror camps
located in northern Mexico

1276
01:22:13,608 --> 01:22:18,068
by U.S. Personnel operating with
permission from the Mexican government.

1277
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:21,808
In a shocking development,
among those captured in the attack

1278
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:25,079
was Grammy-winning musician,
Carlos Santana,

1279
01:22:25,186 --> 01:22:27,677
<i>known for such hits
as Black Magic Woman,</i>

1280
01:22:27,789 --> 01:22:30,417
<i>Evil Ways, and Oye Como Va.</i>

1281
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:36,993
<i>Once more, America is in need
of its best and brightest.</i>

1282
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:42,496
<i>One wonders if there are still heroes
willing to lead us</i>

1283
01:22:42,604 --> 01:22:45,437
<i>through the challenges we face as a nation.</i>

1284
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,474
<i>I say the answer is yes.</i>

1285
01:22:48,843 --> 01:22:51,971
<i>And I am proud to be standing
here with them today</i>

1286
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,809
<i>as we honor their sacrifice.</i>

1287
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:55,212
Ten hut!

1288
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:09,195
What's my name?

1289
01:23:09,297 --> 01:23:11,094
Sergeant Kilgore, sir!

1290
01:23:11,499 --> 01:23:14,195
You will be a mean, lean fighting machine.

1291
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:16,266
One, two, three!

1292
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:17,804
Move it, fat buddy!

1293
01:23:17,906 --> 01:23:19,771
Oh, yeah! That's the way I like it!

1294
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:34,616
Get some!

1295
01:23:57,145 --> 01:23:58,271
Hey!

1296
01:23:58,646 --> 01:24:00,204
Stop it! Stop it!

1297
01:24:00,515 --> 01:24:04,315
I'm a government employee!
You can't do this!

1298
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:06,214
Here you go, honey.

1299
01:24:14,228 --> 01:24:17,197
Oh, I wish I had a thousand of them
just like you, son.

1300
01:24:17,999 --> 01:24:20,763
Any chance I can convince you
to come back to Washington?

1301
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:25,571
Actually, General, I got other plans.

1302
01:24:51,265 --> 01:24:54,234
Mr. Chile, would you like to sing a song?

1303
01:24:54,335 --> 01:24:55,359
Yes!

1304
01:24:56,771 --> 01:25:00,172
Why don't you sing something
by Carlos Santana?

1305
01:25:00,441 --> 01:25:01,999
Okay.

1306
01:25:26,534 --> 01:25:29,025
- You sing very good.
- Thank you.

1307
01:25:29,637 --> 01:25:32,197
- What did you think of the last guy?
- I did not like the last guy.

1308
01:25:32,306 --> 01:25:33,398
- No?
- No.

1309
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:35,066
He was squeezing my stick.

1310
01:25:35,176 --> 01:25:37,337
All right, you're gonna love this. Pull!

1311
01:25:37,445 --> 01:25:39,037
Lace thong.

1312
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:42,847
Wait a second. Those are mine!

1313
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:44,577
When you address me, you will address me

1314
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:47,120
as Sergeant... What is my name? Kilgore!

1315
01:25:47,221 --> 01:25:50,088
How you doing, GI Joe. Can I help you?

1316
01:25:50,391 --> 01:25:51,881
What is my name?

1317
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,726
My last movie was nominated
for two Academy Awards.

1318
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:00,767
I would like to say that.

1319
01:26:16,117 --> 01:26:20,144
Man, who'd have thought
a woman that fat could move so quick?

1320
01:26:20,354 --> 01:26:22,185
Oh, my God, y'all!

1321
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:28,156
Sergeant!

1322
01:26:28,262 --> 01:26:30,025
People of La Mirada...

1323
01:26:31,799 --> 01:26:33,733
People of La Miranda!

1324
01:26:33,968 --> 01:26:35,265
Tonight.

1325
01:26:35,436 --> 01:26:37,165
The end of La Mirada!

1326
01:26:37,438 --> 01:26:38,871
Shit!

1327
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,481
Git-r-done!

1328
01:26:59,794 --> 01:27:02,888
<i>Oye como va, bitches. I'm out.</i>
