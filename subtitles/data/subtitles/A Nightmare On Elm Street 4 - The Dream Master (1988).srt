00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,882
Hello.

2
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,242
Do you live here?

3
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:28,962
Nobody lives here.

4
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,482
Where's Freddy?

5
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,562
He's not home.

6
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,962
One, two

7
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,722
Freddy's coming for you

8
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,282
Three, four

9
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,922
Better lock your door

10
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,007
Five, six

11
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:32,442
Grab your crucifix

12
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,962
Be calm, Kristen.

13
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:13,102
Joey!

14
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,522
Kincaid!

15
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:16,642
Help me!

16
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:33,362
Aw, shit, Kristen, not again.

17
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:34,802
I'm sorry, Kincaid.

18
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,122
Sorry?

19
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,122
You are one spooked chick.

20
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,442
Thank God.

21
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,362
- I thought for a minute...
- What?

22
00:05:48,402 --> 00:05:49,602
Dragging us in here?

23
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:50,802
Yeah. Cut it out.

24
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,642
You're putting one serious dent
in my beauty sleep.

25
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:56,882
It's Freddy. He's here.
I heard him.

26
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,522
Freddy is dead...
buried and consecrated.

27
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:01,202
We won, remember?

28
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:02,642
He's coming back for us.

29
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,762
Kincaid's right.

30
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,242
Fred Krueger's history.

31
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,642
Come here.

32
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:11,642
The pipes are cold.

33
00:06:11,682 --> 00:06:13,562
The boiler is cold.

34
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:14,882
See for yourself.

35
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,722
I don't know.

36
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:39,682
How are you, Mr. Johnson?

37
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,482
That's nice.

38
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,962
Hi, Kristen.
Rick will be out any second.

39
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,922
You going out dressed like that?

40
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,842
What's wrong with me this time?

41
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,762
I'll just wait by the car.

42
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:54,922
Me, too.

43
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:02,042
Something wrong with the stairs?

44
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:03,602
It's avoid all contact day.

45
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,402
What?

46
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:11,122
When Dad's popping aspirin
like popcorn...

47
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,922
it's avoid all contact day.

48
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:18,002
Waiting for a limo?

49
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,522
I'm off to the club, honey!

50
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:27,722
Let's go.

51
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:37,962
All right,
anybody have trig this semester?

52
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:39,402
What happened?

53
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,402
I had a conflict...
homework or "Dynasty"...

54
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:43,082
and "Dynasty" won.

55
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,082
Sad story.
Soaps will kill you.

56
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,602
Mmm. There's Dan Jordan.

57
00:08:51,122 --> 00:08:54,802
We are talking
one major-league hunk.

58
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,762
You know,
you are one major-league hunk.

59
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:06,562
Thanks, Alice.

60
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:08,442
Earth to Alice.

61
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:12,082
Hey, you spacing again?

62
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,322
Rick, please.

63
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,242
Well, tell you what,
he's a friend of mine.

64
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:16,402
I'll introduce you.

65
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:20,162
Just kidding.
But I would introduce her.

66
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:23,242
All right.
I think I see salvation.

67
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:34,602
How can you ride
this health hazard?

68
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,722
It's no wonder
that you have asthma.

69
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:39,842
No, you see, asthma is
an inherited condition.

70
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:41,602
Read a book now and then,
you might know something.

71
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,842
Speaking of books,
isn't trig your favorite?

72
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:47,722
'"Dynasty" again?

73
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:51,522
Deb, do us a favor
and get a VCR.

74
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,602
Hey, baby...

75
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,842
you're sucking
on the wrong nozzle.

76
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,122
Hey, yo, needle dick!

77
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,482
I bet you're the only male
in this school...

78
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,482
suffering from penis envy.

79
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:05,962
I owe you one.

80
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,442
- So disgusting.
- Hey, Supergirl, it's dead.

81
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:13,682
Give a bug a break.

82
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,362
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys?

83
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:35,042
That's all you have to say
after last night?

84
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:37,722
You better be careful.
He's coming back.

85
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,967
Listen, little sister...

86
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:41,402
you got this freako talent to
bring folks into your dream...

87
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,402
but we don't need it anymore.

88
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,042
Time to start living
like regular people.

89
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:46,842
Yeah. Let it rest.

90
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,682
Did it ever occur to you
if you keep going in...

91
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,362
you might stir him up again?

92
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:52,242
Look, we'll help you.

93
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,202
We all have better things
to dream about.

94
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:57,162
You got that right...
signed and sealed.

95
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:59,002
Then what about this?

96
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,482
That don't mean dick.
My dog is like me...

97
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:03,922
drag him into your crazy dream,
and he gets wild.

98
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,202
Here comes your boyfriend.

99
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:07,647
Can he give you
a good night's sleep?

100
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,042
We don't kiss and tell.
How about you guys?

101
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:13,642
Look, we'll talk later,
all right?

102
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:19,642
Those guys are kinda spooky.

103
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:22,882
Oh... then you must think
I'm a total freak.

104
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:24,122
I go back and forth.

105
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:27,362
Hey, lighten up. No one died.

106
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,562
Hi, Dad.

107
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,002
Looking for something?

108
00:12:46,122 --> 00:12:47,242
Shithead.

109
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,082
I'm late. I know.

110
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:00,362
Damn contracts.

111
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:02,722
Let's eat.

112
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,282
We waited a long time.

113
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:07,842
And we gave up, as usual.

114
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:15,242
You call this vegetation a meal
after a ten-hour workday?

115
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,042
What the hell am I, a rabbit?

116
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,682
Christ, Alice,
try to think a little more.

117
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:25,842
Yeah, I can think.

118
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,487
I can think of how sick I am...

119
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:30,282
of watching you
drink your life away...

120
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,722
and taking it out on me.

121
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,162
I'm talking to you.
Are you awake or what?

122
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,722
Dad, don't start.

123
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:40,842
Start what?

124
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:43,322
Telling the little daydreamer
to wake up?

125
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,242
It's long overdue.

126
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,842
I don't need this aggravation.

127
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:27,882
Jason.
Come on, boy, come on.

128
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:30,602
Come on. That's a boy.

129
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:32,562
You almost scared me, boy.

130
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:54,762
You ugly sucker!

131
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,002
Damn!

132
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,722
This ain't my dreamland.

133
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,082
If you're here,
I'm gonna pound your ass!

134
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:56,602
Fuckin' "A."

135
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,002
You shouldn't have buried me.

136
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,962
I'm not dead.

137
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,362
Take that, motherfucker!

138
00:18:55,842 --> 00:18:59,322
Kristen, Freddy's back!

139
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,162
I'll see you in hell.

140
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:16,202
Tell 'em Freddy sent ya.

141
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:23,362
One down...

142
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:24,762
two to go.

143
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:23,642
Wait.

144
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:31,642
How's this for a wet dream?

145
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,442
Kristen! Help!

146
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:49,682
Show it!

147
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,482
Hi, guys.

148
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:37,842
Sorta defeats the purpose,
don't it?

149
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:40,162
- What?
- The mirror.

150
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:41,562
You can't see yourself in it.

151
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:43,922
I don't want to.

152
00:22:45,562 --> 00:22:48,522
You know,
if Mom was still alive...

153
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:50,522
Dad wouldn't treat us like this.

154
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:54,602
Alice, you gotta learn
to stand up for yourself.

155
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:56,602
You know, fight back.

156
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,362
Like that.
It's all in the mind.

157
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:01,642
You see yourself
doing something...

158
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:03,042
and your body reacts
and does it.

159
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,202
Like so.

160
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:06,762
Like that. Now you do it.

161
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,242
Me? No, I can't.

162
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:10,202
- Yeah, you can.
- No, I can't.

163
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:13,562
Yes, you can.
Just get up there and just...

164
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:16,042
Like that.
Big and strong. Do it.

165
00:23:19,322 --> 00:23:21,442
Good, but, Alice-san...

166
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,802
you must have balance.

167
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,282
So go to it.

168
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:36,002
Swish. Killed a fish.

169
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:46,962
Joey, I'm getting tired
of picking up your clothes.

170
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:48,762
And this crap...

171
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,802
I wish you'd turn it off.

172
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,962
Here you are.

173
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,522
Where were you this morning?
Rick's looking all over.

174
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,322
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid?
I can't find them.

175
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:26,762
I'm sure they're around.

176
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:28,522
Well, I'm not so sure.

177
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:33,682
We have matching luggage again.

178
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:37,122
The bags under your eyes.

179
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:38,842
Nightmares?

180
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:40,402
God, I hate dreaming.

181
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:42,762
I love to dream.

182
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:45,162
I just hate the ones
about my dad.

183
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:47,082
How do you handle
your nightmares?

184
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:49,362
My mom taught me
when I was little.

185
00:24:50,962 --> 00:24:52,902
Did you ever hear
of the dream master?

186
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,842
Sounds like
a game show host to me.

187
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:56,402
No, it's a rhyme.

188
00:24:56,442 --> 00:24:59,482
Just have to dream
about someplace fun.

189
00:24:59,522 --> 00:25:00,962
Remember, you're in control.

190
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,322
How do you know so much
about dreams?

191
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:09,482
When it's all you have,
you kinda become an expert.

192
00:25:12,322 --> 00:25:13,402
We better get going...

193
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:15,242
before your brother
starts a search party.

194
00:25:17,322 --> 00:25:20,962
Anyway, Kafka and Goethe
have never been irreconcilable.

195
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:23,722
Kris, where were you?

196
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:31,882
- Hey, what...
- He killed them!

197
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:33,682
What? Wait! Calm down!

198
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:38,722
Hey, somebody help her.

199
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,402
Feeling better now?

200
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:55,202
Yeah, I guess so.

201
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:00,362
What happened?

202
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:02,442
You had quite a nasty bump.

203
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:04,842
I gotta get out of here!

204
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,082
Now, now, now.

205
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:07,602
You stay put.

206
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,322
You need to rest.

207
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:11,162
You don't get it.

208
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,722
He's after me.

209
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:16,802
It's OK, honey.

210
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,042
I wanna draw some blood.

211
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:36,762
Feeling better now?

212
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,842
What happened?

213
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,202
You had quite a nasty bump.

214
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:10,602
You seen Rick around?

215
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:15,722
You are his sister, right?

216
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:19,122
Rick stayed late after school.

217
00:27:19,162 --> 00:27:20,842
Kristen wasn't feeling
very well.

218
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:22,322
Could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

219
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,802
Oh, by the way, I'm Dan.

220
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:32,442
Sorry, Alice.

221
00:27:32,482 --> 00:27:34,402
Your shift's over. My table now.

222
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:40,442
Hi, guys. Hi, Dan.
How are you doing?

223
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:43,002
Hi. Can I get just a Coke
and some fries?

224
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,042
Do you wanna hear our specials,
or do you want any dessert?

225
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,402
Oh, hi, handsome.
Care for some buns?

226
00:27:49,682 --> 00:27:51,642
- Here.
- You in a hurry?

227
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:53,602
Gotta get to the library
before it closes.

228
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:54,842
Killer physics test.

229
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,362
I know. I hardly have
any time to study.

230
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,762
Maybe you shouldn't be
working here so much.

231
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:02,322
You don't want to wait tables
the rest of your life.

232
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:04,962
I know.
It's my greatest fear.

233
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:08,247
You know, he is so cute.

234
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:10,362
- I wonder where he works out?
- Save it, Deb.

235
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:12,842
I mean, there is life
after exercise.

236
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:14,002
One of these days...

237
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,242
I'm gonna set you up
with a real guy...

238
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:18,202
teach you to get
your priorities straight.

239
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:19,522
I think Sheila's
more interested...

240
00:28:19,562 --> 00:28:21,602
in dissecting bodies
than their outsides.

241
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:24,882
Give her time. Her hormones
will kick in some day.

242
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:28,722
Deb, later in life,
you'll appreciate my motto.

243
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:32,362
- What's that?
- Mind over matter.

244
00:28:33,722 --> 00:28:34,842
I'll see you later, OK?

245
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:42,962
Alice, can you leave here?

246
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:44,162
What's wrong?

247
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:45,962
Kincaid and Joey
died last night.

248
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:47,482
What?

249
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:49,842
Hey, Rick, come here!

250
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:51,002
Stay with her.

251
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,802
Kristen, what happened?

252
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:56,842
Look, you're gonna hear
all kinds of stories.

253
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:00,202
And after all
we've been through together...

254
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:02,842
how could I let him get to them?

255
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:04,562
We were a team.

256
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,282
I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

257
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:08,442
Who?

258
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,122
Rick, we gotta go.

259
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:13,362
- Now.
- I'm coming.

260
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:15,762
Before it's too late.

261
00:29:15,802 --> 00:29:17,762
I gotta go.
I guess I'll talk to you later.

262
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,482
So, why the haunted house?

263
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:37,602
It's not just a house.

264
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,842
It's his home.

265
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:42,082
He's waiting in there
for me to dream.

266
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:43,522
Hey, it's OK. We're with you.

267
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:46,202
I told you, you can't help me.

268
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,682
This isn't a normal nightmare.

269
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:50,962
I'm history.

270
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:53,562
I don't get it.

271
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:57,002
- Come on.
- Jeez. What'd I miss?

272
00:29:57,802 --> 00:29:59,562
She told us a story
about Freddy.

273
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:02,167
Fred Krueger.
He's a town legend.

274
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:04,602
He was a child killer
freed on a technicality.

275
00:30:05,602 --> 00:30:06,682
So?

276
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,842
So, a lot of parents
got pissed off...

277
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:11,922
and, according to Kris...

278
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:13,482
they hunted him down
and roasted him...

279
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:15,202
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

280
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:17,202
Nice neighborhood.

281
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:19,922
Anyway,
that's where it gets weird.

282
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:22,762
She says that he comes back
in dreams.

283
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:24,402
And if he kills you
in your dream...

284
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:26,722
you're dead for real.

285
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:32,402
Now I lay me down to sleep.

286
00:30:32,442 --> 00:30:35,322
The master of dreams,
my soul I'll keep.

287
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:38,962
Dream master.
I think I remember the rhyme.

288
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:45,522
Kristen, get the hell
away from that house!

289
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:46,962
! Andale!

290
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:53,762
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

291
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:54,962
I'll take care of you.

292
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:58,442
I better go.

293
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,962
OK...

294
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,122
but I'll call you tonight,
and we'll get through this.

295
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,042
Shotgun.

296
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,162
Something the matter
with the cuisine?

297
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:36,047
Well, Mom, I'll tell you...

298
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:39,522
when two of your friends
die in the same day...

299
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:41,562
let me know what it does
to your appetite.

300
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:42,682
You're just tired.

301
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,562
Don't think I haven't noticed
you aren't sleeping.

302
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:48,642
That has got to stop, honey.

303
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,762
What's wrong with me?

304
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,482
Adolescent anxiety.

305
00:31:58,522 --> 00:31:59,962
That'll make it better.

306
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:07,282
Oh, God.

307
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:09,242
Mom, what did you do?

308
00:32:12,522 --> 00:32:15,042
Jesus! Sleeping pills?

309
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:18,362
Look, Kristen, I'm sorry.

310
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,842
Sorry?

311
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:22,042
Sorry that you
and your tennis pals...

312
00:32:22,082 --> 00:32:24,362
torched this guy,
and now he's after me?

313
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:27,562
In case you haven't been
keeping score...

314
00:32:27,602 --> 00:32:31,082
it's his fucking banquet,
and I'm the last course!

315
00:32:31,122 --> 00:32:33,802
We went over this in therapy!

316
00:32:33,837 --> 00:32:35,682
No, Mother.

317
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:37,522
You just murdered me.

318
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:40,042
Take that
to your goddamn therapy.

319
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:27,282
Dream someplace fun.

320
00:33:48,762 --> 00:33:50,722
Thanks, Alice.

321
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:55,002
Hi, little girl.

322
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,842
- What's your name?
- Alice.

323
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:01,802
I have a friend named Alice.

324
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:55,722
Elm Street's last brat.

325
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,802
Farewell.

326
00:35:57,842 --> 00:35:59,802
We beat you before!

327
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:03,202
And now you're all alone!

328
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:06,802
Kristen, why don't you...

329
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:09,482
call on one of
your little friends?

330
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:10,682
Maybe they could help.

331
00:36:10,722 --> 00:36:12,042
Never!

332
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:14,282
I'm the last!

333
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:16,682
Why don't you reach out...

334
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,242
and cut someone?

335
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,522
How sweet.

336
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,442
Fresh meat.

337
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,362
Alice, wake up and get out!

338
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:50,762
Alice, I'm so sorry.
It was a mistake.

339
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:52,562
I pulled you in.

340
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:55,402
Alice, come to Daddy.

341
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:57,802
Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch!

342
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:01,962
Now no one sleeps.

343
00:37:07,522 --> 00:37:09,762
The souls of my children.

344
00:37:12,842 --> 00:37:15,282
You'll need my power.

345
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:49,762
Are you OK?

346
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:53,082
Kristen...
we've gotta get to her house!

347
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,442
Oh, God! Kristen!

348
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:17,642
Let me go.

349
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:39,882
Hi, Alice.
Wish you were here.

350
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:42,442
Your horrible brother's
up to his old tricks.

351
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:45,202
Rick, as long as I've known you,
I've always wanted to ask...

352
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:48,042
what the hell this shit is
you put in your hair.

353
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:56,402
I want his body.

354
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:58,322
That's bullshit.
What else do you want?

355
00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:59,802
She wants my body.

356
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,682
Alice, what are you doing?

357
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:09,682
I don't know.

358
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:16,122
It makes me feel better.

359
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:21,922
What are you doing?

360
00:39:21,957 --> 00:39:23,682
Hello, baby.

361
00:39:23,722 --> 00:39:24,842
Great.

362
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:27,842
You made her so happy then.

363
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,882
Until all this Freddy shit.

364
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:35,002
Why didn't I just stay with her?

365
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,962
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

366
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,922
Sure it would have.

367
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:43,282
No. I saw it happen in my dream.

368
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:46,602
There was this horrible man.

369
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:50,562
I don't wanna hear
about Freddy, OK?

370
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:53,402
I heard it all from Kristen,
so stop it.

371
00:39:53,442 --> 00:39:56,322
I could smell the smoke.

372
00:39:56,362 --> 00:39:58,442
I could feel the heat
from the fire.

373
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,682
- It wasn't a dream!
- Just stop it!

374
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:04,002
She wasn't crazy
and neither are you...

375
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:06,402
so just cut it out. Please.

376
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:10,082
Jeez.
Why are you acting this way?

377
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,482
I don't know, Rick.

378
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:16,202
I just feel so different.

379
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,522
Something happened in the dream.

380
00:40:24,802 --> 00:40:28,362
And now it's like
part of her is with me.

381
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:35,962
I love you, too!

382
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,562
Hello, everyone!

383
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:42,962
Girl, I am so dead on my feet.

384
00:40:43,002 --> 00:40:45,842
- We have matching luggage.
- What do you mean?

385
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:48,282
You didn't sleep last night?

386
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,082
It's that obvious, huh?

387
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:53,327
- Then you saw him, too.
- Saw who?

388
00:40:53,362 --> 00:40:55,562
I was up all night cramming
for that physics test.

389
00:40:56,882 --> 00:40:59,482
Oh, and I put this
little baby together.

390
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:02,482
You know Deb's afraid of bugs.
I made it for her.

391
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,402
Ultrahigh sound waves.

392
00:41:04,442 --> 00:41:06,602
It'll make 'em run,
screaming their antennas off.

393
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,602
Look, I'll see you in class, OK?

394
00:41:22,162 --> 00:41:23,762
I don't smoke.

395
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:42,282
All right,
you've got forty minutes.

396
00:41:42,322 --> 00:41:44,882
So good luck. Go for it.

397
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,402
Help me!

398
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:13,522
Help!

399
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,562
Wake up!

400
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:16,722
Wake up, damn it!

401
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:10,962
Wanna suck face?

402
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:17,722
Sheila, wake up!

403
00:44:22,482 --> 00:44:24,162
You flunked.

404
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:33,562
Give her her thing.

405
00:44:40,202 --> 00:44:43,082
Didn't you see it? He was here.

406
00:44:43,122 --> 00:44:44,522
What are you talking about?

407
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,642
He was here!

408
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:08,202
Step back, please.

409
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:09,362
Stand back.

410
00:45:13,722 --> 00:45:15,762
Asthma attack?

411
00:45:18,202 --> 00:45:21,242
What 17-year-old
has fatal asthma?

412
00:45:21,277 --> 00:45:24,282
God, she was gonna be a doctor.

413
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:27,162
- It was Freddy.
- Enough with that crap!

414
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:30,202
I saw it. It was my dream.

415
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:32,002
I brought Sheila in.

416
00:45:34,722 --> 00:45:36,762
Oh, God.

417
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:39,642
I brought Sheila in
like Kristen did with me.

418
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,047
No, don't!

419
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,802
I gave Sheila to him!

420
00:45:42,842 --> 00:45:44,842
And now she's dead!

421
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:52,602
I really think Kristen's story
is getting to her.

422
00:45:52,642 --> 00:45:55,482
Dan, I really don't know
if it's a story.

423
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:57,482
Look at us.

424
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,362
We're dropping off
like flies here.

425
00:46:36,242 --> 00:46:39,162
- Good seeing you.
- Bye.

426
00:46:39,202 --> 00:46:40,642
Come on.

427
00:47:02,562 --> 00:47:05,282
Excuse me, miss.
Can I get a pack of gum?

428
00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:11,642
Hey. Where you been?
I haven't seen you around.

429
00:47:11,682 --> 00:47:13,282
I've been working
double shifts.

430
00:47:13,322 --> 00:47:15,402
Guess you need
the extra money, huh?

431
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:19,242
Look, you know why.
You don't want to believe me.

432
00:47:21,802 --> 00:47:23,682
Don't you understand?

433
00:47:23,717 --> 00:47:25,562
I can't sleep.

434
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:27,442
Someone might die.

435
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:41,442
Let's say that
this is real, right?

436
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:44,442
Why, all of a sudden,
is this Freddy guy after you?

437
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:55,202
Kristen was the last child left
of the people who killed Freddy.

438
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,842
Maybe Freddy
can't get to the new kids...

439
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:02,122
unless there's someone
to bring them to him.

440
00:48:06,562 --> 00:48:08,642
We're gonna be late
for the drive-in.

441
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,562
I have to get back.

442
00:48:14,122 --> 00:48:15,322
I guess I'll see you later.

443
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,722
Ninety-three days
till summer vacation, man.

444
00:48:29,762 --> 00:48:32,802
- You tired?
- No. Worried.

445
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,722
Let's see if we can make it
until summer.

446
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:36,122
It's like open season
around here.

447
00:48:36,162 --> 00:48:38,682
Pretty weird stuff.

448
00:48:38,722 --> 00:48:41,562
Speaking of weird,
you gotta feel for that guy.

449
00:48:41,602 --> 00:48:44,282
Dead girlfriend,
basket case for a sister...

450
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:45,522
Shut up, asshole!

451
00:48:46,842 --> 00:48:48,682
What a dick.

452
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:50,562
You know...

453
00:48:50,602 --> 00:48:51,962
You look wasted, man.

454
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:53,882
I've been up with Alice.

455
00:48:53,922 --> 00:48:55,282
Hey, how's she doing?

456
00:48:55,322 --> 00:48:57,202
I saw her last night
at the diner.

457
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,122
She's blaming herself
for Sheila.

458
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,042
I know how she feels.

459
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:03,442
I think about Kristen
all the time.

460
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,602
Maybe I could have stopped it
if I'd have listened.

461
00:49:07,642 --> 00:49:09,042
You mean Freddy?

462
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:10,602
What else?

463
00:49:10,642 --> 00:49:12,562
You ever take a look
at our town's history?

464
00:49:12,597 --> 00:49:14,482
It's not exactly a safe place
to be a teenager.

465
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:17,002
Hey, bozos, let's hustle... now.

466
00:49:18,842 --> 00:49:21,682
Well, if I'm next,
watch your back, man.

467
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:32,842
Where were we?

468
00:49:34,682 --> 00:49:37,962
Every society,
dating back to the ancients...

469
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,902
has had theories
regarding dreams.

470
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:43,762
What they mean,
how to control them.

471
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:47,442
Aristotle believed during sleep
your soul roams free.

472
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:49,802
What it sees are dreams.

473
00:49:49,842 --> 00:49:52,802
The skilled dreamers are able
to control what they see.

474
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:56,042
There is a myth that there's
two gates your soul can enter.

475
00:49:56,082 --> 00:49:58,562
One is a positive gate...

476
00:49:58,602 --> 00:50:00,722
the other a negative gate.

477
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:03,682
The key element is that
there's a dream master...

478
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:05,762
someone who guards
the positive gate...

479
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,162
and, in fact,
protects the sleeping host.

480
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:11,522
Taken altogether, they offer
a fascinating perspective...

481
00:50:11,562 --> 00:50:12,967
on ancient history.

482
00:50:13,002 --> 00:50:15,362
Those of you who don't
find it fascinating...

483
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:18,082
you better listen up,
because it's on the final.

484
00:50:50,562 --> 00:50:53,482
Rick, make me laugh.

485
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:01,082
Going down.

486
00:51:33,602 --> 00:51:34,842
What?

487
00:51:47,442 --> 00:51:50,802
A true warrior needs no eyes.

488
00:51:56,922 --> 00:51:59,362
Come on out and fight me,
you chickenshit!

489
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:11,562
Ninja warriors have calm.

490
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:14,122
Find your balance, Rick!

491
00:52:16,242 --> 00:52:19,562
Too wimpy to show yourself,
Krueger?

492
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:24,402
Well, how's this for balance?

493
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,602
Banzai.

494
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:46,402
How you gonna fight me
without your weapon, Freddy?

495
00:52:53,322 --> 00:52:55,162
Sayonara, Rick-san!

496
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,287
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

497
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:13,882
I shall fear no evil...
for Thou art with me
with Thy rod and Thy staff.

498
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:19,762
Dearly bereaved, we gather here
in remorse for Rick Johnson...

499
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:23,482
a young man whose death
confounds and mystifies us...

500
00:53:23,522 --> 00:53:26,762
for Rick was in his prime,
beloved by all...

501
00:53:26,802 --> 00:53:28,962
exemplary
of young men's ideals...

502
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:31,122
and of strong moral fiber.

503
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:34,962
We grieve our loss but take
comfort in knowing such a man...

504
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:36,882
rests in the kingdom of God.

505
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,442
Let our faith supersede
our knowledge...

506
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:41,962
for truly the Lord
works in mysterious ways.

507
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,042
Hello, baby!

508
00:53:54,122 --> 00:53:56,242
I love this.

509
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,442
They think I'm dead, don't they?

510
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:03,162
This is great.

511
00:54:05,002 --> 00:54:07,767
Hey. What's with the tears?

512
00:54:07,802 --> 00:54:11,122
I wouldn't leave ya.
Come on, don't cry.

513
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:14,682
I'm here. It was a big joke
to fool Freddy.

514
00:54:14,722 --> 00:54:16,682
Come on, smile for me.

515
00:54:17,842 --> 00:54:20,142
No more daydreams.

516
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:22,442
Well, gotta go.

517
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:32,842
Good night.

518
00:54:36,442 --> 00:54:37,762
You OK?

519
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:40,802
Not really.

520
00:54:43,082 --> 00:54:45,082
Is there anything we can do?

521
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:46,602
I don't think so.

522
00:54:48,482 --> 00:54:51,402
I guess this is my own war.

523
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:53,882
No, it's not.

524
00:54:53,962 --> 00:54:57,202
We all have to survive.

525
00:54:57,242 --> 00:54:59,522
I mean, I don't spend hours
working out...

526
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,402
to let some night stalker
beat me.

527
00:55:02,442 --> 00:55:04,522
You don't really get it.

528
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:06,442
He's not a night stalker.

529
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:11,002
And it'll take more
than bench presses to beat him.

530
00:55:11,037 --> 00:55:12,962
So what do we do?

531
00:55:13,042 --> 00:55:14,522
Let's go over
to Debbie's tonight.

532
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,162
We have to make a plan.

533
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:19,962
I got to go.

534
00:55:20,002 --> 00:55:21,882
How about I pick you up
at the diner at 8:00?

535
00:55:24,042 --> 00:55:25,602
Here. It's a good luck charm.

536
00:55:25,642 --> 00:55:28,762
Brings bad luck to the creep
you flatten with it.

537
00:55:28,802 --> 00:55:30,362
This is it.

538
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,922
Mind over matter.

539
00:55:42,082 --> 00:55:44,242
Mind over matter?

540
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:49,122
Sheila used to say that.

541
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:52,362
God, every day, she changes.

542
00:55:52,402 --> 00:55:56,042
No. It's after every death.

543
00:57:09,602 --> 00:57:11,882
What's happening to me?

544
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:19,242
Alice, where are you going?

545
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:20,802
Just to see Debbie.

546
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:22,082
No, you're not.

547
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:27,122
I want you to stay in.

548
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:30,682
Dad, I gotta go, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

549
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:38,682
You have no right to stop me.

550
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:44,482
If you just knew
what was going on.

551
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:48,082
I know very much what's going on
with you and your friends.

552
00:57:48,122 --> 00:57:52,362
Everybody thinks they know,
but they don't.

553
00:57:52,442 --> 00:57:53,562
Look at me, Alice.

554
00:57:54,922 --> 00:57:58,402
I lost Rick
because I didn't watch him.

555
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,482
I don't want to lose you.

556
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:02,162
We're all we have.

557
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:37,602
All the towns in America...

558
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:40,002
and I gotta move
to the Bermuda Triangle.

559
00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:42,602
That's great.

560
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:11,642
What'll it be?

561
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:19,122
Come on, honey.
I don't want to be here forever.

562
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:27,322
If the food don't kill ya,
the service will.

563
01:03:27,362 --> 01:03:29,322
Help us, Alice!

564
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,442
The usual.

565
01:03:33,482 --> 01:03:35,482
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

566
01:03:35,522 --> 01:03:37,002
My favorite.

567
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:38,442
No! Come on, no!

568
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,802
Eeney, meeney, miney...

569
01:03:39,842 --> 01:03:41,362
Come on, no!

570
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:42,482
Moe!

571
01:03:45,282 --> 01:03:46,842
No, Alice, don't let him do it!

572
01:03:46,882 --> 01:03:49,202
Rick, you little meatball.

573
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,562
I love soul food.

574
01:03:50,602 --> 01:03:53,482
No! No! Stop!

575
01:04:01,362 --> 01:04:03,082
Bring me more.

576
01:04:10,842 --> 01:04:13,482
Your shift is over.

577
01:04:45,722 --> 01:04:47,042
Come on. We have to hurry!

578
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:49,042
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

579
01:04:57,722 --> 01:04:59,702
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

580
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:01,682
We got to stop him.
I'm with you on this thing.

581
01:05:01,722 --> 01:05:04,842
I want to help you.
I'm on your side, OK?

582
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:21,762
Here we are.

583
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,927
Come on. We have to hurry!

584
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:34,082
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

585
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:52,442
I don't believe in you.

586
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:54,522
I believe in you.

587
01:06:06,802 --> 01:06:09,522
No pain... no gain.

588
01:06:15,322 --> 01:06:18,682
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

589
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:47,282
Help me!

590
01:06:55,842 --> 01:06:57,202
Here we are.

591
01:07:03,962 --> 01:07:05,242
Come on. We have to hurry!

592
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:07,042
- What's going on?
- I'm driving.

593
01:07:13,802 --> 01:07:16,242
He's going after Debbie.
I've got to stop him.

594
01:07:16,277 --> 01:07:18,682
I get the weirdest feeling
we've done this before.

595
01:07:59,682 --> 01:08:02,202
Come on. We have to hurry.
I'm driving.

596
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:04,882
Oh, my God.

597
01:08:04,922 --> 01:08:06,362
We're both asleep.

598
01:08:06,402 --> 01:08:08,522
He's got us going in circles.

599
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:10,442
We got to go!

600
01:08:28,282 --> 01:08:32,482
You can check in,
but you can't check out.

601
01:08:38,762 --> 01:08:40,682
What the hell was that?

602
01:08:42,922 --> 01:08:44,362
She's gone.

603
01:08:45,842 --> 01:08:48,922
I've collected her
like the others.

604
01:08:58,762 --> 01:09:01,122
All right,
I'm gonna punch his ticket in.

605
01:09:35,802 --> 01:09:37,522
I'm sorry.

606
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:39,082
All right, get him in there.

607
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,642
Base, this is med seven.

608
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:53,207
We have a male Caucasian,
16-18 years of age.

609
01:09:53,242 --> 01:09:56,242
Multiple lacerations
about the head and neck area.

610
01:09:56,282 --> 01:09:58,522
Possible internal injuries.

611
01:09:58,562 --> 01:10:00,962
- What's that do?
- Relaxes your boyfriend.

612
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:03,562
- Put the needle down.
- Rules is rules.

613
01:10:03,602 --> 01:10:05,402
He stays awake!

614
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:07,362
Those are my rules, understand?

615
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:08,762
Are you nuts?

616
01:10:08,802 --> 01:10:10,442
He's allergic, OK?

617
01:10:10,482 --> 01:10:13,362
You should have said something
in the first place.

618
01:10:13,402 --> 01:10:14,802
Damn kids.

619
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:18,082
Don't let them put you to sleep.

620
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:20,962
We have to get ready for him.

621
01:10:36,282 --> 01:10:39,082
- When does he have surgery?
- Fifteen minutes.

622
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:40,482
Let him be, Alice!

623
01:10:42,682 --> 01:10:44,162
They're gonna kill him!

624
01:10:44,202 --> 01:10:45,962
What are you talking about?

625
01:10:46,002 --> 01:10:47,082
Let me go!

626
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:49,242
Alice! Damn it! Get back here!

627
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:23,722
Come on!

628
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:08,562
No. No gas.

629
01:12:08,602 --> 01:12:10,962
No gas. No. Don't put...

630
01:13:32,322 --> 01:13:34,082
Fuckin' "A."

631
01:13:44,442 --> 01:13:47,242
Well, it ain't Dr. Seuss.

632
01:13:53,602 --> 01:13:56,442
Get away from him,
you son of a bitch!

633
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:09,762
- I saw him. He was here.
- I know.

634
01:14:09,802 --> 01:14:11,962
We have to get out
of this place.

635
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:41,002
Out for a spin, lovebirds?

636
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:42,402
Dan, hold on!

637
01:15:06,962 --> 01:15:10,002
Alice, it's too late.

638
01:15:11,362 --> 01:15:12,442
He's hemorrhaging.

639
01:15:12,482 --> 01:15:14,522
Bring him out of it! Hurry!

640
01:15:27,882 --> 01:15:30,122
You got to put me
back under now!

641
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:33,282
Relax, son. It was rough,
but we pulled you out.

642
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:34,842
You're gonna be OK.

643
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:40,542
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

644
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:45,042
Three, four,
better lock your door

645
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:49,202
Five, six, grab your crucifix

646
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:51,322
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

647
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:57,882
Nine, ten, never sleep again

648
01:15:57,922 --> 01:16:00,682
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.

649
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:57,322
You've got their power.
I've got their souls.

650
01:16:57,362 --> 01:16:58,482
Come on.

651
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:21,362
Banzai.

652
01:17:35,482 --> 01:17:38,562
You think
you've got what it takes?

653
01:17:40,042 --> 01:17:44,842
I've been guarding my gate
for a long time, bitch.

654
01:18:41,522 --> 01:18:46,162
I am eternal.

655
01:18:59,562 --> 01:19:03,842
Now I lay me down to sleep.

656
01:19:03,882 --> 01:19:09,762
The master of dreams,
my soul I'll keep.

657
01:19:09,802 --> 01:19:14,162
In the reflection
of my mind's eye...

658
01:19:14,202 --> 01:19:18,682
Evil will see itself,
and it shall die!

659
01:19:39,402 --> 01:19:41,242
Let them out!

660
01:19:58,842 --> 01:20:00,602
You're dead, Krueger.

661
01:21:09,322 --> 01:21:11,082
Thank you, Alice.

662
01:21:11,122 --> 01:21:12,722
You saved us.

663
01:21:13,762 --> 01:21:15,882
Freedom.

664
01:21:29,762 --> 01:21:31,802
Rest in hell.

665
01:22:21,522 --> 01:22:23,722
You know, I slept through
all of last night...

666
01:22:23,762 --> 01:22:25,642
and I haven't done that in days.

667
01:22:25,682 --> 01:22:27,962
I'm still having trouble.

668
01:22:28,002 --> 01:22:31,642
I can sleep two,
maybe three hours, if I'm lucky.

669
01:22:31,682 --> 01:22:32,882
I don't mind, though.

670
01:22:32,922 --> 01:22:35,402
I have more reasons
to stay awake now.

671
01:22:37,762 --> 01:22:38,882
Come on.

672
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:41,362
Make a wish.

673
01:22:41,402 --> 01:22:44,362
Come on,
you don't believe in that stuff.

674
01:22:45,242 --> 01:22:48,642
Yeah, I do,
and I think you do, too.

675
01:22:50,522 --> 01:22:51,642
Here it goes.

676
01:23:01,002 --> 01:23:02,162
What'd you wish for?

677
01:23:11,082 --> 01:23:12,682
If I tell you,
it won't come true.

678
01:23:13,682 --> 01:23:23,682
