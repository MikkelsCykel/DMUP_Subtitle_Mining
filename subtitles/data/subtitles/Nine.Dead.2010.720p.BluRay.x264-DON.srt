00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,782
Shit. Hey, Sully.

2
00:02:33,783 --> 00:02:36,517
Baby, I just needed to rest
my feet for, like, one second.

3
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,949
So that's why you
can't work right now?

4
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:44,692
You get paid to dance, not
to sit on your ass drinking.

5
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,030
Now get to work!

6
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,930
You can be a real asshole
when you want to be.

7
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,269
Stupid bitch.

8
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:02,144
Lock up the joint
when you're done here.

9
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,049
I'm going out.

10
00:03:14,524 --> 00:03:15,813
Hey, dude!

11
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:19,272
Get the fuck off of
me! Get your hands off!

12
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:42,217
And then they beat them by,
like, 65 points last year.

13
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:44,653
That wasn't even football game.
That was a basketball score.

14
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:47,864
You know, he could have said USC. He
could have said a lot of other things.

15
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:50,393
Now he's going to the Aztecs.

16
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:52,627
My friend.

17
00:03:52,728 --> 00:03:55,231
If I'd only gotten
sober 10 years ago.

18
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:21,990
<i>Our attention turns
back to a story</i>

19
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:24,126
<i>that we have been following
for the past several days.</i>

20
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,361
<i>The greater Los Angeles area</i>

21
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:29,264
<i>has been plagued with
a rash of kidnappings</i>

22
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:32,934
<i>with as many as 4 victims
disappearing in separate attacks</i>

23
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:35,470
<i>and all possibly by the
same masked individual.</i>

24
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,573
<i>Now, a source inside
the LAPD refuses to say</i>

25
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:41,471
<i>whether or not there is a connection
between the kidnapped victims.</i>

26
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:43,111
I'll take the check.

27
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,365
<i>A detective with the
West Los Angeles division</i>

28
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:49,578
<i>has also fallen prey
to this masked criminal.</i>

29
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:31,160
You want to get
out of the car?

30
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:35,185
Well, isn't that cute?

31
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:55,371
Sorry, guys. Gotta go. Got
an audition in the morning.

32
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,686
Hey, I saw your
commercial the other day,

33
00:05:57,687 --> 00:05:59,554
and you sucked, asshole.

34
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,512
Hey, it's Kelley.

35
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:26,114
No, I don't know any
more than the cops do.

36
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:27,282
Jackson got nabbed,

37
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:28,984
and they think it might
be linked to a priest

38
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,652
who got nabbed in the
valley on Thursday.

39
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:32,654
And then I got a report
across my desk this morning

40
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:34,022
about a kidnapping in Barstow,

41
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:35,924
and they like Jackson's
guy for that too.

42
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:36,959
I don't know. I guess we

43
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,366
got to pull over every green
Chevy Malibu in the state

44
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:41,563
and see if Jackson's
locked in the trunk.

45
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,868
Yeah, I know that's not practical,
but we got to do something. I mean,

46
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,504
who knows who's next
on this guy's shit list?

47
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:42,390
No.

48
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,588
No, no.

49
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:57,237
You're dead.

50
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:15,189
Do you have any idea who
I am, you son of a bitch?

51
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,667
You're messing with the
wrong woman. Do you hear me?

52
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:23,227
Much thanks.

53
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:30,903
Dear Lord.

54
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:47,065
What you gonna do? Why took
me here? I wanna go home!

55
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:49,405
What the hell is this place?

56
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,934
You're never gonna
get away with this.

57
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,170
<i>I wanna go home.
I wanna go home!</i>

58
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,666
Let me out of here,
or you're dead.

59
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:06,975
I'm gonna bust out of here.

60
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:08,843
I'm gonna bust your head.

61
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:12,976
And I'll take that gun
and stick it up your ass.

62
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:17,452
I brought the 9 of you
here today for a reason.

63
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,264
And your survival

64
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:22,954
depends on you discovering
what that reason is.

65
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:28,863
I'm gonna leave you alone
for your discussions,

66
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:32,033
but I'll return every 10
minutes and kill one of you

67
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:34,666
until you either figure it out

68
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,906
or until you're all dead.

69
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:40,642
If you do manage
to figure it out,

70
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:42,844
I'll free the survivors,

71
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:45,079
notify the police
of our location,

72
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,915
and make a full confession
to all the crimes

73
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,013
I will commit here today.

74
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:54,864
Wait; I don't get it. I
mean, I didn't do anything.

75
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,736
You have 10 minutes.

76
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:17,695
<i>Did he mention about
us getting home?</i>

77
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:48,577
I don't know who all of you are,
but somebody better start talking,

78
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,046
'cause I am not
dying here today.

79
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:53,314
Dude out there's full of shit.

80
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:54,912
What makes you say that?

81
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:58,451
I just know. No one
does this deal for real.

82
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:02,524
Hail Mary, full of grace.

83
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:05,159
The
Lord is--

84
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,562
the
Lord is--

85
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:08,796
shit!

86
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,899
Dude, how does
the rest of it go?

87
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,535
One of you has
to know something.

88
00:11:13,536 --> 00:11:14,803
What did you do?

89
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,438
Don't look at me, bitch.

90
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,229
There's 8 other
guys in this room.

91
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:33,890
Can anyone think of a
reason why they're here?

92
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:36,991
He's gonna kill us,

93
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:38,893
so there has to be something.

94
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:41,029
Well, I'll be
the first to admit

95
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,164
that I have a pretty
messed-up history,

96
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,365
but I don't know
who that guy is

97
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,700
or why I'm here.

98
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,702
And I'll be the last to admit
shit. To hell with that guy.

99
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,104
He's a punk,

100
00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:51,606
and my money says
that he's a cop.

101
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,770
What? You're insane.

102
00:11:54,276 --> 00:11:55,376
The punk-ass pig

103
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,045
puts a bunch of
criminals in one room.

104
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:58,513
All right?

105
00:11:58,514 --> 00:12:03,451
Gets them all scared and crowing
about the shit that they did.

106
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:05,053
The cops write up a
list and bust us all.

107
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:06,187
I'm not saying shit.

108
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,724
This is not a
setup by the cops.

109
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:13,061
I had a friend a
couple years ago,

110
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,496
got in a barroom
fight with a guy.

111
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:17,765
Guy turns out to be a cop.

112
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,702
A couple hours later,
he's in room like this.

113
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:25,006
They threw him a hell
of a blanket party.

114
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,508
The guy never did
walk the same since.

115
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,143
It's not the cops.

116
00:12:29,144 --> 00:12:31,245
How can you be so sure?

117
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:33,681
Because I'm a
fucking genius, okay?

118
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,116
Yeah, well,
anything is possible.

119
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:37,885
I had a customer a
couple of weeks ago

120
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:38,920
threaten to kill me

121
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,552
when I cut him off at the bar.

122
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:45,484
But then he drove his
car into a building.

123
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,664
Maybe this is all
just a mistake.

124
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:52,900
What, do you think he
kidnapped all of us by mistake?

125
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,235
Look, he's obviously crazy,

126
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,804
so that's something we
can use to our advantage.

127
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:58,940
Are we supposed to think of
a crime that's so horrible

128
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,675
that he would kill
9 people as a result,

129
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,910
some horrible
crime that we did?

130
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:10,985
I'm sorry, Father,

131
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,621
but the worst thing one person

132
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,323
can do to another

133
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:18,616
is child molestation.

134
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:20,795
Never.

135
00:13:20,796 --> 00:13:22,723
I never would do such a thing.

136
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,961
I have.

137
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,638
Was it, like, boys or girls?

138
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,141
Does it matter to you?

139
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:35,677
No, no.

140
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:39,411
Me neither. You
sick son of a bitch.

141
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:42,145
You put me in a room with you
and no windows and no doors,

142
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:44,185
and you're gonna wish
that you were never born.

143
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,967
Sweetie, we are in a room

144
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,257
with no windows or doors,

145
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:52,160
and the only thing you're
gonna do is try to survive,

146
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,829
just like me. Maybe
you deserve to die.

147
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,666
What I've done might
have gotten me here,

148
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:01,736
but you two

149
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,902
and all of you...

150
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,208
What have all of you done

151
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,877
to deserve the death penalty?

152
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:19,353
My name is Eddie Vigoda.

153
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,747
Hi, Eddie.

154
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,495
Maybe that helps somebody.

155
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,996
No, Eddie.

156
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:31,356
No, it doesn't.

157
00:14:57,893 --> 00:15:00,661
I'm Dean Jackson.

158
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,930
I'm Kelley Murphy.

159
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,066
I'm an assistant
district attorney

160
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,102
for Los Angeles County.

161
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,904
Can you think of
anyone you've put away

162
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,740
that would want revenge,
like a crazed killer,

163
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,510
you know, some escaped psycho?

164
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:16,911
Take your pick.

165
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:18,713
I mean, I've made more
than a few enemies,

166
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,515
but there are people
that keep tabs on parolees

167
00:15:20,516 --> 00:15:22,283
that might come after me.

168
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:24,142
And no one saw
this guy coming.

169
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:27,989
Jackson, anything
you'd like to add?

170
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:33,961
I know you.

171
00:15:33,962 --> 00:15:36,597
Says you.

172
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:40,301
We did some business
together years ago.

173
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:42,236
I'm sure it was
small-time stuff for you,

174
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,005
but it was pretty big for me.

175
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:47,275
My name is Christian
Collins worth.

176
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:48,676
What kind of
business are you in?

177
00:15:48,677 --> 00:15:51,377
Sully's with the mob.

178
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,116
You know, it doesn't surprise
me that you don't remember me.

179
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:56,184
It's been a long time.

180
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:57,785
What's your name, anyway, man?

181
00:15:57,786 --> 00:16:01,222
Sully Fenton from Vegas.

182
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:03,624
What kind of business
did you two do together?

183
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,154
Ask the kid. Hell if I know.

184
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:11,222
A deal came my way, some
pharmaceutical-grade speed.

185
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:15,002
I was about 5 grand
short, so I went to Sully.

186
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,138
I heard he was in the business
of loaning money for drugs

187
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,639
for part of the
product and profits.

188
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,509
I'm sure 5 grand sounded
pretty sweet to me at the time,

189
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,777
especially selling meth.

190
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:25,112
So what happened?

191
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:27,415
I sold the stuff
to these 2 cool guys

192
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,551
who turned out to
be undercover cops.

193
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:32,486
And I went in for 3 years.

194
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,155
But you still paid me, right?

195
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,457
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,060
Everybody knows what happens
when you don't pay Sully Fenton.

197
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:41,796
I'm not stupid. Are
you sure about that?

198
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:45,867
I had nothing
going into prison.

199
00:16:45,868 --> 00:16:47,101
I had even less getting out.

200
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:50,204
But I got what I needed

201
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,173
as soon as I hit
the streets in May.

202
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:55,209
You were paid by
the end of the month.

203
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,245
Now I'm an actor and
bartender in Hollywood though.

204
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,343
Good for you.

205
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,417
I'm gonna miss my
sitcom audition.

206
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:05,253
Your audition?

207
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:06,654
Where the hell do
you think you are?

208
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:09,257
Jesus, will you cut the
kid some slack already?

209
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,726
We're all scared here.
He's doing his best.

210
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:17,765
Hey, is Sully the only one
who's not from Los Angeles?

211
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,335
My travels have
taken me all over,

212
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,738
including Los Angeles.

213
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:26,030
More than a few prisons.

214
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:29,377
I'm Father Michael Francis.

215
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:34,181
I have Catholic parish in
the San Fernando Valley.

216
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:37,007
Eddie, where are you from?

217
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,887
Barstow.

218
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:42,723
You guys forgot about me.

219
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:44,225
You said you ain't talking.

220
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:45,860
I just figured you're
from Los Angeles,

221
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:47,762
since, you know,
the city's chock-full

222
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:49,230
of you pussies.

223
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,070
I got your...

224
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:51,471
pussy.

225
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:57,564
Excuse me.

226
00:17:58,206 --> 00:18:02,610
No one appreciates your
pissing match more than I.

227
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:05,807
But I think we're
forgetting about someone.

228
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:10,151
Do you speak English?

229
00:18:10,152 --> 00:18:11,418
English?

230
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:14,487
Say something. I know
you understand us.

231
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,869
I know you guys were trying to talk
to me, but I just don't understand.

232
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,809
I'm gonna need helps from you guys.
Just tell me what I have to do.

233
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,864
Does anybody know
what this language is?

234
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:25,899
Anyone know what it
is? Chinese, I think.

235
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:28,138
How the hell do you know?
Old-school kung fu flicks.

236
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:32,105
It's annoying, whatever it is.
I hope he cap her ass first.

237
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:38,594
You're a "black
ghost". Nigger!

238
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:44,852
The chick does speak English.

239
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:46,087
Yeah, she's funny.

240
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:51,425
Let's see who lives
and dies first.

241
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,141
This situation
stinks of a pig setup.

242
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:09,175
Jesus. Told you.

243
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,578
God, for the last time.

244
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,813
This has absolutely
nothing to do with the cops.

245
00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:15,249
How can you be so sure?
Because I am a cop!

246
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,585
I knew it.

247
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:19,720
I thought if I told you
scumbags I was L.A. County,

248
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:22,223
you wouldn't say anything,
knowing I was one of the good guys.

249
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:24,392
Good guys? Yeah.

250
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:25,893
You're one of the
good guys? Yeah.

251
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:29,425
In my old neighborhood, the
cops weren't the good guys.

252
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,565
I'm not a scumbag.

253
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,340
I'll make you a bet

254
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:42,476
that our masked host
comes back in here,

255
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,378
grabs one of us,
brings him outside,

256
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:49,350
shoots the gun up into the
air, and we all think he's dead.

257
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,885
Yeah, that's what
he's gonna do.

258
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:53,054
He's gonna sweat us.
That's what he's gonna do.

259
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:55,168
You think? Yeah,
he's gonna do that.

260
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:58,059
Really? Come on,
guys, come on.

261
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,393
We can do this.

262
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,562
Yeah. If he figured out

263
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:03,597
why we're all here,
we can figure it out.

264
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:05,332
You know what?

265
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,870
I really appreciate
your can-do spirit,

266
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,272
but if this pig is wrong,

267
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,841
my name's Coogan.

268
00:20:14,342 --> 00:20:17,577
And I got to say,
what a pleasure it was

269
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:22,516
to spend the last 10 minutes
of my life with you all.

270
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:24,385
Well, we still haven't
gotten your name.

271
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:26,754
You didn't?

272
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:28,355
Miss chink over there
said it plain as day.

273
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:32,426
It's what you and everyone
else think: nigger.

274
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:33,594
All right?

275
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:35,930
Yeah, is that with 1 G or 2?

276
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,365
That--that--

277
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:41,635
With 2.

278
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,938
You think this is funny?

279
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:45,306
This isn't funny.

280
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:46,907
Hey, what else am I gonna do?

281
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,742
In about 3 seconds
we're gonna find out

282
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:52,213
if Coogan's right
about this being a bust,

283
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:54,141
or we're gonna
find one of us dead.

284
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:09,430
Why are you here?

285
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:11,265
You got to give us more time.

286
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:14,201
You're asking the impossible.

287
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:15,870
We're all willing to
do whatever you want.

288
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,538
But you have to give
us something in return.

289
00:21:24,513 --> 00:21:27,779
Okay, okay.

290
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:33,350
How could I have known that?

291
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,253
Please just wait a
second. Please don't!

292
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:50,604
What are you doing, man?

293
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,940
God!

294
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:08,488
Fuck.

295
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:16,130
Sorry to see him go,

296
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:20,935
but that's one less
to worry about, right?

297
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,436
As I said,

298
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:26,407
you have to know why I brought
each and every one of you here

299
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:28,609
in order to survive.

300
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,477
If you want to walk
out of here alive,

301
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:33,747
you'd better figure out
why he was here as well.

302
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,828
I can't die like this.

303
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:50,297
Please, God. We
ask that you--

304
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,901
Hey, Father.

305
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:56,036
You think we can toss the idea

306
00:22:56,037 --> 00:23:00,574
of him faking the
killing outside the door?

307
00:23:00,575 --> 00:23:03,544
Who are you praying to?

308
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:07,381
God's not here.

309
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:10,718
You still think
this is the cops?

310
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,470
If we don't figure out

311
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:14,488
what's going on before
somebody else dies,

312
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,523
we're not gonna get
out of here alive.

313
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:20,828
Well, does anybody
here speak Chinese?

314
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,162
I speak a little Spanish.

315
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:23,798
Habla español?

316
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:26,568
I don't understand what you're
saying. Don't speak to me.

317
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:29,002
I'm getting mad
at you. Really?

318
00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:31,963
No dice.

319
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:37,478
Padre, you sure you
didn't touch no kids?

320
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:40,614
I have never harmed
a child in my life.

321
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:42,583
Anyway, that thing over there,

322
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:45,068
he's already admitted to the
crime, so stop looking at me.

323
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,854
Hey.

324
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:48,622
Guys, I might be a
little screwed up,

325
00:23:48,623 --> 00:23:50,584
but I just spent
5 years in jail.

326
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:56,930
I'm trying to be
a reformed man.

327
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:59,500
What did you serve time
for? Grand theft auto.

328
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,768
Not child molestation?

329
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:03,230
No, that's all they
could hit me with.

330
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:08,405
You see, they
couldn't find a body.

331
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:11,145
You're a winner, ain't you?

332
00:24:11,146 --> 00:24:12,708
Thank you.

333
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,383
Piece of shit.

334
00:24:18,853 --> 00:24:21,713
I think it's about
time we heard from you.

335
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:26,760
All right.

336
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:29,430
I'm Leon, from L.A.

337
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,598
My brother and I used to do
work up and down the West Coast.

338
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,060
What kind of work did you do?

339
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:54,987
Looking for this?

340
00:25:01,563 --> 00:25:03,397
Don't give me those
fucked-up looks.

341
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:05,499
At least I never sexed
and killed no kids.

342
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,267
I never killed anybody.

343
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:09,670
But I'd rob your ass
if the price was right.

344
00:25:09,671 --> 00:25:12,339
Cash is king, and I
stick to what works.

345
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,208
But guns?

346
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:17,177
Guns can be better than cash.

347
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:19,213
Kelley, did you
ever prosecute Leon?

348
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:21,048
No, he doesn't look familiar.

349
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,483
That's because I
never got caught.

350
00:25:22,484 --> 00:25:24,284
Yeah, well, our friend
out there caught you.

351
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:26,487
Yeah, coming out the
USC library no less.

352
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:27,855
The library?

353
00:25:27,856 --> 00:25:31,091
Yeah, it pays to do
research in my business.

354
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:34,261
If the cop and
Kelley know each other

355
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:38,931
and Christian and Vegas
Sully know each other, then

356
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:42,570
it would make sense that
we're all connected here,

357
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:45,605
whether we know it or not.

358
00:25:47,363 --> 00:25:49,810
Well, if I busted you, you
guys would know better than me.

359
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:51,944
I mean, that list is long.
Yeah, I'm in the same boat.

360
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:53,580
I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

361
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:55,082
But in my business,

362
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,284
we don't do this shit.

363
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:59,753
I forget how you people can
be so thoughtless and careless

364
00:25:59,754 --> 00:26:01,188
when it comes to human life.

365
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,557
I spend every waking
moment serving God

366
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:05,959
by trying to help
people in my community,

367
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,095
and all you seem to do
is try to destroy life.

368
00:26:08,096 --> 00:26:10,697
You put yourself
up on a pedestal,

369
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:11,965
but you're here just
like the rest of us.

370
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:13,834
So why don't you stop talking
about why you shouldn't be here,

371
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:15,135
and let's figure
out why you are.

372
00:26:15,136 --> 00:26:16,562
Hey, Eddie.

373
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:18,972
Eddie. What?

374
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:20,774
Nobody's stopping you
from talking, Eddie.

375
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,676
I work for a health
insurance carrier.

376
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:25,312
I'm from Barstow.
That's fascinating.

377
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:27,915
Any other useless facts
you'd like to pass around?

378
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:30,684
I'm doing my best.
Tell us about your work.

379
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:32,386
What do you do?

380
00:26:32,387 --> 00:26:34,421
Come on, what
do you do, Eddie?

381
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:35,756
Okay.

382
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:40,494
A couple of years ago, I
helped out my brother-in-law.

383
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:41,962
He has colon cancer.

384
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:45,432
My company does a lot of
experimental medical work,

385
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:48,268
and I falsified his forms

386
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:50,771
so that he can
get the treatment.

387
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:54,441
But I did it to help
my brother-in-law.

388
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:56,443
I mean, this
doesn't make sense.

389
00:26:56,444 --> 00:26:57,945
I'm a good person.

390
00:26:57,946 --> 00:26:59,279
I don't deserve to be here.

391
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,614
I shouldn't be here.

392
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:01,815
Hey!

393
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:04,414
Relax there, leaky faucet.

394
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:09,456
Okay.

395
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:11,959
I'm human. Jesus
Christ, Eddie.

396
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,494
So you know, I
mean, all right.

397
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:14,728
Everybody have a look.

398
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:16,630
You know, laugh.

399
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:17,898
But you know what?

400
00:27:20,068 --> 00:27:23,303
If we don't start confessing,

401
00:27:23,304 --> 00:27:25,272
I mean,

402
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:27,274
we're never gonna make
it out of here alive.

403
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:32,069
Everybody--
everybody's got to help.

404
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,451
Jackson and I used
to sleep together.

405
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,687
Yeah, until my wife found out.

406
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:42,689
Would your wife go this far

407
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,191
to get back at you
for cheating on her?

408
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:46,193
No, she divorced me
and moved to Arizona.

409
00:27:46,194 --> 00:27:47,528
I think that's far enough.

410
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:49,796
Plus, she has no way of
getting us all here together.

411
00:27:49,872 --> 00:27:52,666
And she has no reason
to. I pay my alimony.

412
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,502
I don't think she hates me that much.
No ex-wife would want her man dead.

413
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:57,037
That's her money train.

414
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:01,576
Look, no one knows you two,
so I doubt it's the ex-wife.

415
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:05,379
And nobody really wants to
hear about your sex life.

416
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,813
Yeah, well, she's
just pissed off,

417
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:08,115
'cause we got caught.

418
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:09,349
Yeah, it was your big
mouth that got us caught.

419
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,384
You know what, Kelley? You're
not the only one who got hurt.

420
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:12,452
I lost my wife.

421
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:14,388
Yeah, and I was labeled
the home-wrecking slut.

422
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:15,889
That did wonders
for my career.

423
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,191
And I wasn't the only person
you were screwing around with.

424
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:20,960
What was it, a month before
some judge knocked you up?

425
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:23,263
Hey, kitty cats.

426
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:26,199
Why so hostile?

427
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,568
An affair is an affair.

428
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,304
Now we're getting relationship
advice from a pedophile.

429
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,679
What the fuck you looking at?

430
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:24,925
You one tall drink of water.

431
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:26,660
You're turning faggot now?

432
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:30,522
No, I just realized how
I'm getting out of here.

433
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,767
None of you guys are
gonna come up with shit.

434
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:38,639
Closest one to me.
What are you doing?

435
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,407
So start kicking.

436
00:29:40,408 --> 00:29:41,742
You are crazy, man.

437
00:29:41,743 --> 00:29:42,943
You got a better idea?

438
00:29:42,944 --> 00:29:44,277
Break my hand so I can
get out these cuffs.

439
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:46,680
You're crazy.

440
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:48,281
I'm not kidding.

441
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:50,450
Start kicking, man. All right.

442
00:29:50,451 --> 00:29:52,218
My pleasure.

443
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:57,757
Come on, game it
up. I'll get it.

444
00:30:08,136 --> 00:30:09,169
Wait! Come on!

445
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,337
Stop.

446
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:12,139
Wait, I almost got it.

447
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,173
Come on.

448
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:15,975
One more, one
more. Just do it.

449
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,981
Okay, okay, okay.

450
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:23,550
All right, all right.

451
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:34,394
Leon, Leon, get up.

452
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:35,562
Hey, get behind the door.

453
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,864
And when he comes in, you push
him in, and we'll attack him.

454
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,433
Yeah, bring him my way.
Leon, get behind the door.

455
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,802
Come on. That's a good idea.

456
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,305
But I got a better one.

457
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:48,041
Later. You can't leave us.

458
00:30:48,342 --> 00:30:51,846
Bitch, you think I
give a damn about you?

459
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:54,314
To hell with you.

460
00:30:54,315 --> 00:30:56,016
Leon, you can't leave
us in here like this.

461
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:59,271
He's gonna get us killed...
You stupid piece of shit!

462
00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:01,964
Don't do it. You know you
can't leave us in here.

463
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:03,990
Don't leave us here.

464
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:05,198
Damn it!

465
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:43,296
Fuck!

466
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:48,068
Punk-ass bitch.

467
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:53,306
You stupid fucking bitch.

468
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,108
The thoughts that's been
going through my mind

469
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,211
while I was in
that fucked-up room.

470
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,847
And that's a fucked-up room!

471
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:01,982
Now that I got this gun,

472
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:04,618
the shit that I got
in store for you.

473
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:08,522
I have been planning
this for 2 years.

474
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:10,957
Nothing is gonna take away
what I have in store for you

475
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:13,627
and the others.
And I mean nothing.

476
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:16,463
Before I enter,
I place one bullet

477
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:18,799
into that gun you hold.

478
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,568
But this gun?

479
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:23,102
This gun holds 6.

480
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:27,274
Fuck.

481
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,452
He didn't make it.

482
00:33:13,855 --> 00:33:15,882
Why are you here?

483
00:33:28,203 --> 00:33:31,538
Maybe you should move them
out of the way of the splatter.

484
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:33,773
I'd hate to see somebody die

485
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:36,474
before you get a chance
to kill 'em yourself.

486
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:43,951
Yeah.

487
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:45,914
That's a good reason.

488
00:33:52,994 --> 00:33:54,996
God, please.

489
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:57,897
You don't have to do this.

490
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:23,757
Up until now, the
order has been random.

491
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:26,526
I just want you to
know that you're next.

492
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:29,796
Fuck you.

493
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:46,865
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

494
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:48,684
Blessed
art thou--

495
00:34:50,185 --> 00:34:53,220
Blessed art thou
amongst women.

496
00:34:54,421 --> 00:34:56,170
I can't remember
the prayer either.

497
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,959
I used to know it.

498
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,263
I've said it like
a million times.

499
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:04,588
Can you help me, Father?

500
00:35:05,433 --> 00:35:06,466
What?

501
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,234
What's wrong?

502
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:09,770
I don't know. I...

503
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:12,440
I can't remember,
but it's so familiar.

504
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,841
Look.

505
00:35:14,942 --> 00:35:16,978
We got another 10 minutes.

506
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,947
It can take me that long to
find my keys in the morning.

507
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:31,624
You finding something
funny there, bleeding boy?

508
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:38,498
I'm gonna die
like the man said,

509
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:40,460
and you guys are
gonna die with me.

510
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:45,872
I got 8 minutes to live.

511
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:48,198
And I've been thinking
about you bitches.

512
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:56,616
I got to make peace.

513
00:35:56,617 --> 00:35:58,752
Look, if you're
gonna die a happy man,

514
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:01,988
then I'm gonna die a happy
man laughing at your misery.

515
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:05,291
Look, we know
Leon's next to go.

516
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:07,627
That means we have 8 minutes
to figure out why he was here

517
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:11,164
and another 10 minutes
before somebody else dies.

518
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:12,532
Come on, we can
figure this out.

519
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:13,933
Let's put our heads
together, guys.

520
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,565
Come on, we can do this.

521
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:20,763
You look familiar. Know you somewhere.
But I've never caught your name.

522
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,463
Do I look familiar to you?

523
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:26,664
Ah! I remember now!
You're the lawyer!

524
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:30,065
Uh, I got robbed, and
then you helped me out...

525
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,818
Something turned the slant on.

526
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,618
It's you! It must be you! It's
almost comical if you watch it right.

527
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:40,410
Wearing glasses.

528
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:43,113
Pictionary? Wearing glasses.

529
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:44,197
Glasses?

530
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:45,715
Wearing glasses. Glasses.

531
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:47,133
I haven't worn
glasses in years.

532
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:49,302
I remember when
you wore glasses.

533
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:52,505
This lady knows you,
or she did know you.

534
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:53,773
Bang, bang!

535
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:54,808
A shooting?

536
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,109
Some kind of
shooting, a shooting?

537
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,577
Robbery? Bang!

538
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:58,678
Robbery!

539
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,213
Mrs. Chan?

540
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:02,916
Yes, yes! Chan, Chan!

541
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:11,341
Her name is Nhung Chan.
Right, right... I'm Chan.

542
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,844
But we haven't contacted
each other since then.

543
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:15,896
Did you get the
guy who robbed her?

544
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:19,870
Yeah, Chan picked him out of a lineup.
I prosecuted. He went to San Quentin.

545
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:21,702
What was this guy's name?

546
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,739
Greeley, Wade Greeley.

547
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,976
He was a total punk
kid, 20 years old...

548
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:31,645
A total loser.

549
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:34,279
So that's it? That's
why we're here?

550
00:37:34,515 --> 00:37:36,750
Because this kid Wade Greeley

551
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:39,252
is pissed off that
you sent him to prison?

552
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:43,123
All we have here is
a robbery and a name

553
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:46,693
and a whole hell of a lot
of unanswered questions.

554
00:37:46,694 --> 00:37:48,761
Okay, I don't even
remember busting this guy,

555
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:49,796
Wade Greeley.

556
00:37:49,797 --> 00:37:50,997
What about you, Father?

557
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:52,993
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

558
00:37:54,401 --> 00:37:56,235
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

559
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,171
Okay, if Wade Greeley

560
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:00,907
going to jail is
the end-all-be-all,

561
00:38:00,908 --> 00:38:04,041
then we must fit in to
this before that happened.

562
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:09,078
I think I've got
us a time line.

563
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,918
You know, listening to
you guys, I've got a...

564
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,954
a glimmer of hope.

565
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:17,157
I thought for a sec you
had the son of a bitch beat.

566
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:18,191
Well, well, well.

567
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:20,160
Look who's back from the dead.

568
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:22,294
Ease up, man. Ease up.

569
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:28,401
I'm having a change of
heart or something like that.

570
00:38:28,402 --> 00:38:31,204
I'm thinking letting
you people die,

571
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:34,073
it's not right.

572
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:36,899
I haven't done nothing
good in a long time.

573
00:38:39,313 --> 00:38:44,184
I said I never killed nobody.

574
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:48,388
That's a lie.

575
00:38:50,324 --> 00:38:52,625
I want my cut of cash you
gave that bitch of yours.

576
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:53,660
What cash?

577
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:55,128
Man, you fucking tripping.

578
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:56,963
I know about the money belt

579
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:58,822
and those Brentwood
bitches last month.

580
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:02,168
You accusing me
of holding out?

581
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:04,664
Nah, I'm straight saying it.

582
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:08,241
Don't turn your
back to me, man.

583
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:11,637
click!

584
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:17,984
Pull guns on people?

585
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:19,719
For sure, motherfucker.

586
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,419
I got a gun too.

587
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:31,531
I dumped his body in a
dumpster in downtown L.A.

588
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:34,135
at the Cinco de Mayo festival.

589
00:39:36,136 --> 00:39:38,967
He said he never liked the
Mexicans and their parades.

590
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:41,440
One last childish
act on my part.

591
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,113
A couple of days later I went
to the morgue with our mother.

592
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:48,949
I stood over the body.

593
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,559
I didn't say anything.

594
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,323
I went to the street and
sold the rest of our stuff.

595
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:00,327
I never told nobody that.

596
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:10,403
I didn't speak or see too much
of my mother after the funeral.

597
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:14,907
I'll never see
either of them again.

598
00:40:14,908 --> 00:40:17,301
I'll never have a
chance to say I'm sorry.

599
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,065
I want my mother...

600
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:24,150
to forgive me. I
deserve to die. But

601
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:26,818
I want to be
forgiven. Somebody

602
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:29,022
just forgive me.

603
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:31,891
He who seeks forgiveness
shall find it.

604
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:38,765
We're no better off
than we were before.

605
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:41,367
We have nothing new, and
there's like a minute left.

606
00:40:41,368 --> 00:40:43,403
Here's something new.

607
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,239
That guy said he's been
planning this for 2 years.

608
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,175
Okay, what were we
all doing 2 years ago?

609
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:51,277
2 years ago I did 30 days

610
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:54,165
for busting some joker in the head
for hassling one of my dancers.

611
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:55,981
But no one is going to
give 2 shits about that one.

612
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,883
No.

613
00:40:56,884 --> 00:40:59,786
2 years ago
I was just--

614
00:40:59,787 --> 00:41:03,323
I had the same job
selling insurance,

615
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:06,492
approvals, dismissals.

616
00:41:06,493 --> 00:41:07,560
I don't know.

617
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:08,995
It's nothing unusual.

618
00:41:08,996 --> 00:41:10,263
Kelley?

619
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:12,165
Kelley?

620
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,599
2 years ago?

621
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,172
Why are you here?

622
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:21,269
We know part of the answer.
We've got some of it.

623
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:23,676
All or nothing.

624
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:25,880
Son of a bitch.

625
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,588
I'll see you in hell.

626
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:36,622
I know.

627
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,729
What are you doing?

628
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,930
Stop this!

629
00:42:03,384 --> 00:42:05,485
Father, you still with us?

630
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:07,447
You're not going to
like what I have to say.

631
00:42:09,323 --> 00:42:11,691
Anything is better than
nothing at this point.

632
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:13,359
Either say it or don't.

633
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,795
I figured out why I am here.

634
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:17,363
Well, holy shit!

635
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:20,967
I know why someone else
was in this room as well.

636
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:23,935
I know what we have done to
the man that holds us captive.

637
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:25,171
So what is it?

638
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,706
Yeah, spill it.

639
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:28,374
I can't.

640
00:42:28,475 --> 00:42:29,776
What do you mean, you can't?

641
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:31,010
Come on, Father.

642
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:32,712
What was said to me
was said in confidence.

643
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:33,746
I can't repeat it.

644
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:36,048
You want to play Pictionary
or something? Fine.

645
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:38,151
Me and you, Father, against
her and Mandarin Duck.

646
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:39,786
I can't reveal
what was said to me.

647
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:41,154
There's nothing I can do.

648
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,523
My relationship with God
goes beyond my life and yours.

649
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:44,891
This is bullshit, Father.

650
00:42:44,892 --> 00:42:47,660
You better start talking
right now, or so help me,

651
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:49,195
I will goddamn crack
that head of yours.

652
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:50,463
You'll do what?

653
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:53,533
I'm facing death already.

654
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:55,234
I have no fear of death

655
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:57,570
when it comes to
upholding the Lord's law.

656
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:59,872
My loyalty will
not be questioned.

657
00:42:59,873 --> 00:43:01,140
My devotion does not exist

658
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:02,809
only when the situation
deems convenient.

659
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,744
People are dead
because of you.

660
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:06,712
You don't know
that to be true.

661
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:08,381
The hell I don't, cocksucker!

662
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:10,116
Leon laid there dying,

663
00:43:10,117 --> 00:43:11,984
but at least he had the
balls to speak his mind,

664
00:43:11,985 --> 00:43:14,187
even though it went against
his own fucked-up judgment.

665
00:43:14,188 --> 00:43:16,255
And now you're going
to have all of us die

666
00:43:16,256 --> 00:43:17,490
because you're
gonna keep quiet

667
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:19,425
behind some collar
and dusty oath?

668
00:43:19,426 --> 00:43:22,128
Sully, would you
turn in your brother

669
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:23,555
for a lighter sentence?

670
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:26,356
My brother's dead.

671
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:29,268
So then your father.

672
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:31,637
Would you give up your
father to save your own skin?

673
00:43:31,638 --> 00:43:33,206
I would never cross my father.

674
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:35,741
So then you can
understand my situation.

675
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,566
No, I can't!

676
00:43:38,245 --> 00:43:40,980
It's like waking up from
one nightmare into another.

677
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:43,749
Shut the hell up, Eddie.

678
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:46,285
If Father Francis
has made up his mind,

679
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:48,087
we're just gonna have to

680
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:50,490
get out of here without him.

681
00:43:50,491 --> 00:43:52,158
What? You're defending
the cocksucker?

682
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,659
No.

683
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,396
But I got a wife to get home to,
and we're wasting time arguing.

684
00:43:57,397 --> 00:43:59,265
To hell with Francis, okay?

685
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:00,666
If he's not gonna talk,

686
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:02,835
we're never gonna
figure out why he's here.

687
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:05,738
So if we want to live,
we're gonna have to escape.

688
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:08,241
Okay, we're gonna
have to take him down.

689
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:10,309
And we have to face the fact
that we may have to kill him.

690
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,311
On, I ain't got no
problem with that.

691
00:44:12,312 --> 00:44:14,013
Okay, hold on.

692
00:44:14,014 --> 00:44:16,015
What do we know?

693
00:44:16,016 --> 00:44:18,651
We know Greeley robbed
Chan's liquor store.

694
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:20,453
And we know Kelley
prosecuted him.

695
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:24,357
Okay, well, that's
2 out of 9, Eddie.

696
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:26,158
Maybe there's more to it.

697
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:28,160
Maybe it goes
beyond those people

698
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:31,330
who are directly responsible
for him going to jail.

699
00:44:31,331 --> 00:44:33,032
Maybe he's thinking
in bigger terms.

700
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,467
Yeah, maybe we're not

701
00:44:34,468 --> 00:44:35,835
all connected in this.

702
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:38,371
Maybe he's going after
everybody that's ever done

703
00:44:38,372 --> 00:44:40,139
anything wrong to this guy.

704
00:44:42,442 --> 00:44:43,876
We need to come clean.

705
00:44:43,877 --> 00:44:47,370
Completely clean about
everything, right now,

706
00:44:47,571 --> 00:44:48,716
all of us.

707
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:04,766
All right.

708
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:08,601
You want a story?

709
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:09,835
8 years ago

710
00:45:10,936 --> 00:45:12,873
this old man came in
and slapped me around

711
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,474
in front of my crew.

712
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,109
Some crazy bastard
who owed me money

713
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:20,436
came in and tried to punk
me in front of my people.

714
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:25,651
I went back to his
pawn shop that night.

715
00:45:25,652 --> 00:45:29,155
Yeah, I went back,
and I firebombed it.

716
00:45:34,962 --> 00:45:39,131
The problem...

717
00:45:39,132 --> 00:45:42,868
the problem...

718
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:47,106
I didn't know he lived
upstairs in an apartment

719
00:45:47,107 --> 00:45:48,738
with his grandkids.

720
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,883
That's why I deserve to die.

721
00:46:09,997 --> 00:46:11,566
It was my first year...

722
00:46:12,997 --> 00:46:14,536
on the force,

723
00:46:16,937 --> 00:46:19,067
I was working the
valley division, and...

724
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:22,510
my partner got into it
with this speed freak.

725
00:46:24,479 --> 00:46:26,712
It was bad. The kid
was all tweaked out,

726
00:46:26,713 --> 00:46:29,106
and my partner was
having a really rough day.

727
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:33,553
The kid took a
swing at my partner,

728
00:46:34,054 --> 00:46:36,022
and that was it.

729
00:46:36,723 --> 00:46:38,924
He beat the hell
out of this kid.

730
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:43,729
I really wanted to stop it,

731
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,534
but he looked up at me.

732
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,303
He looked at me, and he asked
me if I wanted to join in.

733
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:53,373
You joined in?

734
00:46:54,074 --> 00:46:56,075
Yeah, I didn't want
to hurt my reputation.

735
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:57,309
You know, I mean,

736
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,111
it was my first year out on the street.
I mean, you know what I mean, Kelley.

737
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,614
So you beat the kid.

738
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:03,482
Yeah, but God damn it,
I'm not proud of it.

739
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:05,351
Well, did you go
to Internal Affairs?

740
00:47:05,852 --> 00:47:07,057
No.

741
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:11,323
I stuck around
for 2 more years

742
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:13,225
and got transferred
out of there.

743
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:15,294
So why would your old
partner pull you down here

744
00:47:15,295 --> 00:47:17,296
if you never turned
him in or told anyone?

745
00:47:17,297 --> 00:47:19,065
It wasn't my partner.

746
00:47:19,066 --> 00:47:22,301
I was thinking maybe the
kid finally tracked us down

747
00:47:22,302 --> 00:47:25,204
not for beating him up.

748
00:47:25,205 --> 00:47:26,872
For blinding him.

749
00:47:26,973 --> 00:47:29,075
That's awful.

750
00:47:29,076 --> 00:47:30,576
What was the kid's name?

751
00:47:30,577 --> 00:47:33,046
Alfie Martinez.

752
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:37,683
And I don't know if that's
the reason why I'm down here,

753
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:41,320
but that's what haunts
me every day of my life,

754
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:43,656
that I didn't stand up.

755
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:47,026
I didn't have the
courage to do anything,

756
00:47:47,027 --> 00:47:50,029
to stand up to my superiors.

757
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,198
So if your old
partner is still alive,

758
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:54,266
wouldn't it make sense that
he'd be in here with us?

759
00:47:54,267 --> 00:47:57,269
Yeah, that's just a dead end,

760
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,537
another dead end.

761
00:47:58,538 --> 00:48:00,372
I'm telling you,
we're wasting time.

762
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:02,541
We've got to find our own
way out of here like Leon did.

763
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:04,744
Yeah, that worked
out real well for him.

764
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:08,497
It's time for
your redemption...

765
00:48:08,648 --> 00:48:10,216
Yeah, sing it, sister!

766
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:12,467
Hallelujah! Right, cocksucker?

767
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:15,187
Shut the hell up, Sully!

768
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:20,053
We got to think of something.

769
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:29,101
I just thought of something.

770
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:31,470
I don't know if
this is anything,

771
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:33,205
but since we're
confessing our sins,

772
00:48:33,206 --> 00:48:35,107
and there is
a priest here--

773
00:48:35,108 --> 00:48:37,042
All right, just
spit it out, Eddie.

774
00:48:37,043 --> 00:48:39,044
When I was in college,

775
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:41,781
we had some girls--
strippers over for a party.

776
00:48:41,782 --> 00:48:43,015
We were all drinking,

777
00:48:43,016 --> 00:48:45,451
and I spent some
time with one of them.

778
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:48,087
We both got
really drunk, and--

779
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:49,377
And you banged her.

780
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:52,291
Yeah, but she
said it was rape.

781
00:48:52,292 --> 00:48:54,560
And here all this time we
thought you were so perfect.

782
00:48:54,561 --> 00:48:57,263
It turns out you're just
another asshole frat boy.

783
00:48:57,264 --> 00:48:59,265
They dropped the charges
due to lack of evidence.

784
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:00,966
Mom and dad must
have been so proud.

785
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:02,468
I'm just trying to help.

786
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:03,702
I mean, something might click.

787
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:05,070
Isn't that the whole point?

788
00:49:05,071 --> 00:49:07,006
No, you're getting us
further away from the point

789
00:49:07,007 --> 00:49:08,140
I was trying to make.

790
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:10,676
Guys, look, this is
about the robbery.

791
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:13,279
We're missing
something. I know we are.

792
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,980
No, there's nothing else with
the robbery; I promise you.

793
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:23,255
What was that, Francis?

794
00:49:23,256 --> 00:49:25,457
You know we're going down
the wrong road, don't you?

795
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,293
Yeah, 20 years of poker
tells me that's a "yes."

796
00:49:27,294 --> 00:49:28,661
What do you know, Father?
Forget about the robbery!

797
00:49:28,662 --> 00:49:30,972
Okay, it doesn't matter what
he knows. Shut up, Kelley!

798
00:49:30,997 --> 00:49:32,932
You were about to
beat that kid to death,

799
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:34,366
and now you won't
help me kill the guy

800
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:35,634
who's ready to execute us all?

801
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:37,936
What the hell is wrong with you?
What's wrong with all of you?

802
00:49:37,938 --> 00:49:39,271
Hey, I'm with you, Kelley.

803
00:49:39,272 --> 00:49:41,207
But this cocksucker here
is about ready to crack,

804
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,275
and I'm pretty damned interested
to hear what he has to say.

805
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:45,411
I know you want
to tell us, Father.

806
00:49:45,412 --> 00:49:46,445
Come on.

807
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:48,513
You ready to break
that oath, Father?

808
00:49:48,683 --> 00:49:49,770
This isn't easy, okay?

809
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:52,218
Just say it. It's
the right thing to do.

810
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:55,321
What if I said that
I knew for a fact

811
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:57,823
that Wade Greeley did
not rob Chan's store?

812
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,292
Bullshit. Chan
was the eyewitness.

813
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:02,528
Greeley didn't have an
alibi, and I had the evidence,

814
00:50:02,529 --> 00:50:04,063
concrete evidence.

815
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:06,297
Did Greeley say he was innocent?
Of course he said he was innocent.

816
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,733
Everybody's innocent.

817
00:50:07,734 --> 00:50:10,402
Nobody wants to be convicted
once they're caught.

818
00:50:10,403 --> 00:50:12,438
What do you know
about it, Father?

819
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:15,273
No, I'm telling you.
Greeley was guilty.

820
00:50:16,676 --> 00:50:18,000
Son of a bitch.

821
00:50:19,246 --> 00:50:20,679
What?

822
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,481
One of us confessed to the crime
in Father Francis' confessional.

823
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:26,518
I bet that's it. Is that it?

824
00:50:26,587 --> 00:50:28,988
Is it, Father? Whatever
Father Francis knows,

825
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:30,222
he knows from
the confessional.

826
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:31,590
Otherwise, he would tell us.

827
00:50:31,591 --> 00:50:34,365
Has anyone ever been to confession
in the San Fernando Valley?

828
00:50:34,627 --> 00:50:35,895
Yeah, right.

829
00:50:35,896 --> 00:50:36,962
No.

830
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:38,297
Christian!

831
00:50:39,032 --> 00:50:40,856
It has to be Christian.

832
00:50:42,002 --> 00:50:44,669
You all saw the father's face when
I couldn't remember the Hail Mary.

833
00:50:44,871 --> 00:50:45,971
I reminded him of Christian.

834
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:48,473
He forgot the same
prayer earlier, remember?

835
00:50:50,076 --> 00:50:52,674
What could Christian
have told Father Francis?

836
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:57,508
That he robbed
the liquor store.

837
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:07,092
You've known this whole time?

838
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:08,627
I did not know the whole time.

839
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:11,230
It wasn't until after Chan
came up with the robbery

840
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,564
that I knew for sure.

841
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:13,866
Cocksucker!

842
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:15,801
I told you you wouldn't
like what I had to say.

843
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:17,069
Are you absolutely positive

844
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,634
that it was Christian
in the confessional?

845
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:22,878
The Lord is with thee.

846
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:28,715
Dude, how does the
rest of that go?

847
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:32,117
If I had a Bible, I
would put my hand on it.

848
00:51:32,118 --> 00:51:34,153
You got the wrong
man, prosecutor.

849
00:51:34,154 --> 00:51:36,288
Wade Greeley's the wrong guy.

850
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:38,090
I had the evidence
against him.

851
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:40,726
Regardless, I mean, this is
a whole new ball game now.

852
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:43,228
Holy shit.

853
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:44,263
Sully.

854
00:51:44,264 --> 00:51:45,297
Yeah?

855
00:51:45,298 --> 00:51:48,869
Christian got out of jail the
same time Chan's store was robbed.

856
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:50,602
So what does that
have to do with me?

857
00:51:50,603 --> 00:51:53,337
What happens to people
who don't pay you?

858
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,308
If they owe a little,
I go for their knees.

859
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:57,876
If they owe a lot, I
go for their jugular.

860
00:51:57,877 --> 00:52:01,411
Yeah, well, does Christian look like the
type of kid that could take a beating?

861
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,450
So what?

862
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:05,484
What are you saying?

863
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:06,518
Christian robbed Chan

864
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:09,221
to get you the money.

865
00:52:09,222 --> 00:52:11,457
He said that he got
out of jail in May

866
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:12,491
and paid you soon after.

867
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:14,282
How else could he
have gotten the money?

868
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:17,489
It fits.

869
00:52:19,265 --> 00:52:22,468
Wait a second.

870
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:24,635
So you're telling me, of all
the fucked-up shit I've done

871
00:52:24,738 --> 00:52:26,546
through the course of my life,

872
00:52:26,707 --> 00:52:28,874
I loaned some dead
dumbass 5 grand,

873
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:30,643
and that's what
I'm gonna die for?

874
00:52:30,844 --> 00:52:32,977
The kid needed a motive.
I think you're it.

875
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:38,145
That's goddamn ridiculous.

876
00:52:39,419 --> 00:52:40,913
You're serious?

877
00:52:41,955 --> 00:52:43,255
All I did was
give him some cash.

878
00:52:43,256 --> 00:52:45,389
I got to die for
that? That's bullshit!

879
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,159
The connection between
you and Christian

880
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,861
has been there the whole time.

881
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:50,329
We just never thought
anything of it.

882
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:52,398
And I still don't.

883
00:52:52,399 --> 00:52:55,400
Of all the shit I--
Hey there, asshole!

884
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:57,803
Why are you here?

885
00:52:57,804 --> 00:52:58,971
You know what? We don't know.

886
00:52:59,066 --> 00:53:01,607
But guess what. I
don't give a fuck.

887
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:03,542
I don't know what kind of
shit you got going on here,

888
00:53:03,543 --> 00:53:05,610
but I'm sick of it.
You've got me sweating,

889
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:07,813
rethinking all the horrible
things that I've done in my life

890
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:09,048
and all the people
I've crossed.

891
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:10,315
For what?

892
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:11,884
For some dumbass that I loaned

893
00:53:11,885 --> 00:53:14,887
$5,000 to?

894
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:16,422
Well, guess what.

895
00:53:16,423 --> 00:53:18,724
That's how I do business, and
that's how I get shit done.

896
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:20,659
I don't apologize for shit.

897
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,263
Knowing what you know,
knowing how your life will end,

898
00:53:24,264 --> 00:53:25,898
would you change the
way you do business?

899
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,800
Hell no!

900
00:53:27,801 --> 00:53:28,967
I don't regret anything.

901
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:31,070
I wouldn't do a
damn thing different.

902
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:35,307
What's the matter?

903
00:53:35,308 --> 00:53:38,610
You don't like that, do you,
you dirty revenge-seeking pussy?

904
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:40,946
I don't regret anything.

905
00:53:40,947 --> 00:53:43,449
What, you want me
to regret my life?

906
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:44,883
Fuck you.

907
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:48,487
Tou want the satisfaction
of me begging for my life,

908
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:49,922
don't you?

909
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:51,723
Fuck you.

910
00:53:51,724 --> 00:53:53,559
You want the satisfaction
of killing all of us,

911
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,660
thinking it's gonna
change our lives.

912
00:53:56,196 --> 00:53:58,226
Well, fuck you!

913
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,469
I take that back.

914
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,631
I take all that back.

915
00:54:07,507 --> 00:54:08,774
Yeah.

916
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:10,843
I'm not gonna give
you the satisfaction

917
00:54:10,844 --> 00:54:13,715
of me being pissed
off while I die.

918
00:54:16,316 --> 00:54:20,953
Of all the shit you
could have killed me for,

919
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:23,623
5 grand?

920
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,188
Fuck you!

921
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,869
Come on, bastard.

922
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,370
Let's do this.

923
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:40,606
Hit me right here in the
head, just like my brother.

924
00:54:40,607 --> 00:54:42,374
Reunite me with him.

925
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,475
Come on, asshole!

926
00:54:43,476 --> 00:54:44,743
Pull the trigger.

927
00:54:46,246 --> 00:54:47,980
But it's not your turn.

928
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:50,340
It's Eddie's.

929
00:54:51,684 --> 00:54:54,119
Me?

930
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,855
No, no, no.

931
00:54:56,856 --> 00:55:00,959
Please, no.

932
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,127
No, no.

933
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:03,162
Don't kill me.

934
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:05,863
Just tell me why I'm here.

935
00:55:12,238 --> 00:55:13,639
Damn it!

936
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,407
1 person dies
every 10 minutes.

937
00:55:15,408 --> 00:55:16,608
That's what you said!

938
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:18,277
Father Francis is dead.

939
00:55:18,278 --> 00:55:19,772
You cannot take Eddie now.

940
00:55:25,952 --> 00:55:26,985
Really?

941
00:55:26,986 --> 00:55:29,550
5 grand?

942
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:38,664
You shouldn't be in
such a hurry to die.

943
00:55:38,665 --> 00:55:41,200
If this is the end for you,

944
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,059
you'll want to make
every minute count.

945
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:47,873
This doesn't have to continue.

946
00:55:47,874 --> 00:55:50,275
Okay, we know why you
brought most of us here,

947
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:53,845
and we know what you
must have been feeling,

948
00:55:53,846 --> 00:55:55,347
what you must be feeling now.

949
00:55:55,348 --> 00:55:57,816
Okay, I think I
speak for all of us

950
00:55:57,817 --> 00:55:59,952
when we say we wish we could
go back and change history,

951
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:01,520
but we can't.

952
00:56:01,521 --> 00:56:04,056
Wade.

953
00:56:04,057 --> 00:56:07,392
Wade Greeley?

954
00:56:07,393 --> 00:56:10,930
Whatever it is that you think
we've done to you, whatever--

955
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,099
whatever it is you've done
here today, we can make right.

956
00:56:14,234 --> 00:56:15,734
You just have to talk to us.

957
00:56:15,835 --> 00:56:18,169
Look, we can help. I can help.

958
00:56:18,672 --> 00:56:20,572
Okay, whatever it is you want,

959
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:22,875
we--we-- I can
make that happen.

960
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:25,637
Do you understand what
I'm telling you, Wade?

961
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:32,807
I'm not Wade Greeley.

962
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:49,668
It's not Wade Greeley.

963
00:56:49,669 --> 00:56:52,771
This doesn't make any sense.

964
00:56:52,772 --> 00:56:55,207
There's way too many
coincidences for it not to be

965
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:56,441
this guy, Greeley.

966
00:56:56,442 --> 00:56:58,443
I've spent 5 grand
on a bottle of whiskey

967
00:56:58,545 --> 00:57:01,213
without a care in the
world. Sully, we get it.

968
00:57:01,214 --> 00:57:02,814
I'm telling you, he's
gonna kill us all.

969
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:05,517
Okay, he doesn't care if
we come up with his plan.

970
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:09,888
If he just wanted to kill
us, we'd be dead already.

971
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:12,124
He's here to make a point.

972
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:14,092
But do we really think
this isn't Greeley?

973
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:15,894
If it isn't, it has to
be somebody close to him,

974
00:57:15,895 --> 00:57:17,729
somebody that could
help him plan this.

975
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,032
Kelley, back at the trial,

976
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:21,366
was there anyone there?

977
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:23,968
Were there any friends or
family, anyone who stood by him?

978
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,271
No, no, he didn't have
anything or anyone.

979
00:57:26,472 --> 00:57:28,840
I don't even
think he made bail.

980
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:30,175
Can you give us a
few more details?

981
00:57:30,176 --> 00:57:32,444
Jeez, this was so long ago.

982
00:57:32,445 --> 00:57:35,965
Do you realize how many trials I've
had since then, since before then?

983
00:57:36,115 --> 00:57:38,183
Okay, let's think.

984
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:41,219
Now, Leon said that he'd been
planning this for 2 years.

985
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,954
When did Greeley's
case go to trial?

986
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:45,290
I don't remember.

987
00:57:45,891 --> 00:57:47,358
Can you at least tell us

988
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:49,494
how many years
he got in prison?

989
00:57:49,695 --> 00:57:52,197
Armed robbery,
assault, no plea.

990
00:57:52,198 --> 00:57:53,965
5 years, maybe.

991
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:58,370
Well, then the
years don't add up.

992
00:57:58,371 --> 00:58:00,038
If I was wrongly
convicted of a crime,

993
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,407
I would start plotting my
revenge the day I was convicted.

994
00:58:02,463 --> 00:58:05,177
That's what I'm saying.
Nothing about this makes sense.

995
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:08,140
The only way we're gonna get
out of this is if we escape.

996
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,049
Was Christian in the lineup
when Chan picked Greeley?

997
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:12,517
No, if Christian
was in the lineup,

998
00:58:12,518 --> 00:58:14,953
Chan would have recognized him
when we pulled the hoods off.

999
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:17,689
She didn't recognize
Kelley until later.

1000
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,958
Well, maybe she did. I mean, nobody
understood what she was saying.

1001
00:58:19,959 --> 00:58:21,360
Mrs. Chan? Give it up.

1002
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:22,427
We're getting off track.

1003
00:58:22,628 --> 00:58:23,929
I'm just coming up
with possibilities.

1004
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,831
Well, to hell with
your possibilities.

1005
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:27,199
Why are you pissed at me?

1006
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,202
Because maybe we still
don't know jack about you!

1007
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:32,504
Are you really that stupid
to think I'm hiding something?

1008
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:34,805
I told you everything that I
can think of, so don't blame me.

1009
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:37,175
Something about you still
doesn't sit right with me, Eddie.

1010
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:40,145
You know, you've been riding me
and picking on me this whole time.

1011
00:58:40,146 --> 00:58:42,179
What is your problem? I
might be dead in 10 minutes!

1012
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,183
That's my fucking problem! I
think we all know who's next.

1013
00:58:45,184 --> 00:58:47,986
Calm down.

1014
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:50,589
What about you, Jackson? We
still don't know why you're here.

1015
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:52,391
All we know is that
you beat a kid blind

1016
00:58:52,392 --> 00:58:53,658
and cheated on your wife.

1017
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,927
Well, look who's
grown some balls.

1018
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:57,529
I think I got it.

1019
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:59,131
You better watch
your tone Eddie,

1020
00:58:59,132 --> 00:59:01,366
or I'm gonna start thinking
you're the psycho's partner,

1021
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,402
or at least until I see
your brains against the wall.

1022
00:59:03,403 --> 00:59:05,036
Yeah, yeah, well, not
if I see yours first.

1023
00:59:05,037 --> 00:59:07,071
Fine, go ahead! Sign me up!

1024
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:08,600
Hey, shut up!

1025
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:11,743
All right, you guys are
worse than my strippers.

1026
00:59:11,744 --> 00:59:12,911
Now listen.

1027
00:59:12,912 --> 00:59:14,780
Leon said that he
killed his brother

1028
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:17,048
and dumped him during the
Cinco de Mayo parade, remember?

1029
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:18,350
So what?

1030
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:20,385
Well, Christian said that
he got out of jail in May.

1031
00:59:20,386 --> 00:59:21,520
And?

1032
00:59:21,521 --> 00:59:23,855
What if that was
around the same time?

1033
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:26,792
Look, Christian got
out of jail, right?

1034
00:59:26,793 --> 00:59:30,228
And he said he got my 5
grand right afterwards, right?

1035
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:33,198
Well, if we go back
and think about it,

1036
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,958
Christian said that he had
nothing when he left jail.

1037
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:39,638
I had nothing
going in to prison.

1038
00:59:39,639 --> 00:59:41,406
I had even less getting out.

1039
00:59:41,407 --> 00:59:45,475
But somehow he was able to pull off
this big liquor store robbery heist?

1040
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:49,313
Where did he get a
gun to rob Mrs. Chan?

1041
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:52,609
Leon said the easiest
product to move were guns.

1042
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:56,255
<i>Guns can be better than cash.</i>

1043
00:59:56,456 --> 01:00:00,125
So you think Leon sold
the gun to Christian

1044
01:00:00,126 --> 01:00:02,053
that he used to rob
Chan's liquor store?

1045
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:11,036
So Sully gave Christian
the motive for the robbery.

1046
01:00:11,037 --> 01:00:12,370
Leon gave him opportunity.

1047
01:00:12,371 --> 01:00:14,239
Chan identified the wrong man.

1048
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,474
Kelley locked him up.

1049
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:18,009
And Father Francis
didn't go to the cops

1050
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:19,868
after he found out the truth.

1051
01:00:20,446 --> 01:00:22,271
Okay, so that leaves...

1052
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,951
Jackson, me, and Coogan.

1053
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:28,053
But we can all agree that
this all started with Christian

1054
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:29,254
borrowing money from Sully.

1055
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:32,023
Between that and
Greeley going to jail

1056
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:35,694
is our new time line.

1057
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:38,063
When Christian borrowed
the money from Sully,

1058
01:00:38,064 --> 01:00:41,299
I was studying
pharmaceuticals in Arizona.

1059
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:45,403
Okay, well, Christian said
that he was dealing drugs.

1060
01:00:45,404 --> 01:00:46,805
Could he have
gotten them from you?

1061
01:00:46,806 --> 01:00:48,240
No.

1062
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:49,674
I didn't have any
access to drugs.

1063
01:00:49,675 --> 01:00:52,043
All right, all right, we've
narrowed this down some.

1064
01:00:52,044 --> 01:00:53,378
Narrowed it down?

1065
01:00:53,379 --> 01:00:57,449
All we got is a robbery,
drug dealing, and a pedophile.

1066
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,483
Sorry, buddy. Buddy?

1067
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,052
Look, Sully is a criminal.
Okay, he's a killer.

1068
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:03,672
We would have taken him down
100 times if we had the chance.

1069
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:04,990
And now he's your best friend?

1070
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:08,192
I'm sorry for liking the guy
who's trying to save my life.

1071
01:01:08,427 --> 01:01:09,895
Thank you.

1072
01:01:09,896 --> 01:01:12,130
And for bacon, you're
not so bad yourself.

1073
01:01:12,165 --> 01:01:14,599
Look, our only chance is that
we think Eddie might be next.

1074
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,368
And then hopefully
after that, Sully's next.

1075
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:17,602
So you and I can
take him down.

1076
01:01:17,603 --> 01:01:20,272
God, you are one twisted
home-wrecking bitch.

1077
01:01:20,273 --> 01:01:22,541
Well, it's good to know it
only takes a gun to your head

1078
01:01:22,542 --> 01:01:23,575
for you to speak your mind.

1079
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:25,644
You know what?

1080
01:01:25,645 --> 01:01:28,412
The worst thing I did was not
beating that kid till he was blind.

1081
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:30,148
It was fucking the lawyer.

1082
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:32,417
That hurts.

1083
01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:34,820
Jackson, I hope you die
for getting me into this.

1084
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,723
What are you talking about?
I didn't get you into this.

1085
01:01:37,924 --> 01:01:39,591
What are you talking about?

1086
01:01:39,692 --> 01:01:40,625
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1087
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:42,364
You just said that
Jackson got you into this.

1088
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,463
What does that mean?
What does what mean? Look,

1089
01:01:44,564 --> 01:01:47,062
we have, like, seconds
left till he comes in.

1090
01:01:59,545 --> 01:02:01,213
Why are you here?

1091
01:02:01,514 --> 01:02:04,868
Because this bitch knows
something, and she won't talk!

1092
01:02:16,479 --> 01:02:20,068
Please don't kill me.
It's none of my fault.

1093
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:24,468
I have nothing to do
with your son's death.

1094
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:29,249
I'm begging you.
Don't kill me...

1095
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:34,170
Spare me. Let me go, huh?

1096
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:36,071
Let me go.

1097
01:02:47,927 --> 01:02:49,661
Please, please!

1098
01:02:49,662 --> 01:02:51,162
I beg you!

1099
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:53,231
You can't kill me.

1100
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:54,633
You have to let me go.

1101
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:57,002
My child needs me.

1102
01:02:57,003 --> 01:02:59,567
Okay, my son needs his mommy.

1103
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,340
You're a human being.

1104
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:03,541
You can understand.

1105
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:06,242
You can't take a mother
away from her son.

1106
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:10,448
Your son William goes to
the Sacred Heart School,

1107
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:14,617
where he is picked up every
day by your hired help.

1108
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:16,755
And when was the last time

1109
01:03:16,756 --> 01:03:18,089
you actually spent
time with him?

1110
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,290
And how long will it be

1111
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,827
before you pack him off
to some boarding school?

1112
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:25,196
Do not use your
child as an excuse.

1113
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:28,466
It pisses me off.

1114
01:03:31,437 --> 01:03:33,295
And it should piss
you off as well.

1115
01:03:42,381 --> 01:03:44,215
What was he talking
about, Kelley?

1116
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:48,353
It looks like you
might be a dad, Jackson.

1117
01:03:48,354 --> 01:03:51,423
Billy's mine?

1118
01:03:51,424 --> 01:03:52,757
I didn't think I could.

1119
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:56,094
My wife and I, we'd
been trying for--

1120
01:03:56,095 --> 01:03:57,462
I didn't think
it was possible.

1121
01:03:57,463 --> 01:03:58,730
Yeah, well, it's possible.

1122
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:01,233
Maybe if you had spent a
little less time with me

1123
01:04:01,334 --> 01:04:02,567
and a little more with her.

1124
01:04:02,568 --> 01:04:06,905
How could you do that to me?

1125
01:04:06,906 --> 01:04:11,643
How could you just
keep that from me?

1126
01:04:11,644 --> 01:04:14,045
I know our relationship,
the breakup was bad,

1127
01:04:14,046 --> 01:04:17,215
but how could you just
cut me off like that?

1128
01:04:17,216 --> 01:04:19,184
I had to do what
was best for me.

1129
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:22,020
Okay, jackass over there was
never gonna leave his wife.

1130
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:23,354
He would rather
just lead me on.

1131
01:04:23,355 --> 01:04:25,269
So when I found out, I

1132
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,018
I just blamed it
on someone else.

1133
01:04:29,228 --> 01:04:32,897
What you did was wrong
and downright selfish.

1134
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:34,632
You need to start talking.

1135
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:37,535
And it doesn't matter
what you're holding back.

1136
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:38,870
I don't care.

1137
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:41,772
I forgive you, but we have
to get out of here alive.

1138
01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:45,043
Do you want to die?

1139
01:04:45,044 --> 01:04:47,178
I might as well be
dead if this gets out.

1140
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:49,748
Before, you said Jackson
got you into this.

1141
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:51,182
How?

1142
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:54,919
Look.

1143
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,889
Wade Greeley was picked up 2
miles from the liquor store.

1144
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:00,959
He was a good match
to Chan's description.

1145
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,558
And no one could verify
his lame-ass alibi.

1146
01:05:04,764 --> 01:05:07,398
And then Chan picked
him out of the lineup.

1147
01:05:07,399 --> 01:05:10,034
I had him. I had to have him.

1148
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,937
You remember what I was
going through, Jackson.

1149
01:05:12,938 --> 01:05:14,939
The mother and son,
the abortion case:

1150
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,366
two in a row lost.

1151
01:05:18,144 --> 01:05:21,371
I was just getting into the life
that I had worked so hard for,

1152
01:05:21,914 --> 01:05:23,916
and I felt the pressure.

1153
01:05:24,717 --> 01:05:26,971
You know, I had to have a
conviction, or I was on my way out.

1154
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:30,887
I was the lowest on the totem pole,
and no one was taking me seriously.

1155
01:05:33,292 --> 01:05:36,425
I had to win at all costs.

1156
01:05:38,164 --> 01:05:40,799
Losing cases doesn't
make you incompetent.

1157
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,802
No, but combine
that with budget cuts

1158
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:46,504
and an affair with Jackson that
was growing more public every day,

1159
01:05:46,505 --> 01:05:47,772
and it doesn't look good.

1160
01:05:51,544 --> 01:05:53,812
What did you make
me do, Kelley?

1161
01:05:53,813 --> 01:05:56,915
I had Chan's testimony,
but it was shaky at best.

1162
01:05:56,916 --> 01:06:00,151
I would never be able convince
a jury that a 60-year-old woman

1163
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:01,886
could positively
identify someone,

1164
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:04,556
especially after she'd
been pistol-whipped.

1165
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:06,291
I had to put
Greeley at the scene.

1166
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:09,694
During the struggle,

1167
01:06:09,695 --> 01:06:12,797
Chan grabbed Christian by the
head and got a few couple hairs.

1168
01:06:12,899 --> 01:06:16,906
So I knew I just had to get some
of Wade's hair and make the switch.

1169
01:06:19,638 --> 01:06:22,507
So I snuck the
sample out of the lab.

1170
01:06:22,508 --> 01:06:24,609
I got a few hairs
from Wade's comb.

1171
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,680
And--

1172
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:32,382
and I couldn't get the sample
back into the evidence room.

1173
01:06:39,124 --> 01:06:40,425
And I thought me and Coogan

1174
01:06:40,426 --> 01:06:42,591
were the most fucked-up
2 in this room.

1175
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:47,732
Don't you realize that you
helped kill these people?

1176
01:06:47,733 --> 01:06:50,201
How could you not
tell us this before?

1177
01:07:03,015 --> 01:07:06,150
Look, if the truth ever gets
out of this room, I'm over.

1178
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,218
I'll lose my job.
I'll go to jail.

1179
01:07:08,254 --> 01:07:09,687
I'll never see my son again.

1180
01:07:09,688 --> 01:07:10,889
I might as well be dead.

1181
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,590
I committed a felony.

1182
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:14,092
Yeah, welcome to my world.

1183
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:16,728
You know, I know we're
not a team or a family,

1184
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:17,929
but we have a child together.

1185
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:20,832
Doesn't that mean something?

1186
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,901
No, he's my son,
Jackson, okay?

1187
01:07:22,902 --> 01:07:24,865
You're not a father.
You'll never be a father.

1188
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,571
You were just a
dick, literally.

1189
01:07:27,072 --> 01:07:29,507
You're fucking
unbelievable, Kelley.

1190
01:07:29,576 --> 01:07:31,977
You're not a father. What?

1191
01:07:32,078 --> 01:07:32,911
No, no, no.

1192
01:07:33,012 --> 01:07:34,479
Hear me out for a second.

1193
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,383
Greeley said that he
wasn't Wade Greeley.

1194
01:07:38,384 --> 01:07:42,176
I'm not Wade Greeley.

1195
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:47,292
Did you see how upset he got

1196
01:07:47,293 --> 01:07:49,727
when Kelley tried to
use her son for pity?

1197
01:07:49,728 --> 01:07:53,364
Do not use your
child as an excuse.

1198
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:55,360
It pisses me off.

1199
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,270
I mean, if it's
not really Wade,

1200
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:01,572
then maybe it's his father.

1201
01:08:01,573 --> 01:08:03,775
Has anybody thought about
what happened to Wade Greeley

1202
01:08:03,776 --> 01:08:05,877
after he went to prison?

1203
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,400
Remember when I said

1204
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:33,338
Wade Greeley going to prison
was the end-all-be-all?

1205
01:08:33,339 --> 01:08:35,334
Well, I could have been wrong.

1206
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:39,510
Jackson was on to
something a minute ago.

1207
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:41,045
We've been trying to
see how Coogan and I

1208
01:08:41,046 --> 01:08:43,748
fit into the time
line before the trial.

1209
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:45,650
We weren't thinking
about what happened

1210
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:48,112
after prison.

1211
01:08:50,189 --> 01:08:52,924
You said that Wade
was in San Quentin.

1212
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:54,726
Did Christian say
what prison he was in?

1213
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:56,427
No, but the sick
fucker over there

1214
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:57,996
said he'd been to
a couple of prisons.

1215
01:08:57,997 --> 01:09:00,832
My travels have
taken me all over,

1216
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:03,334
including Los Angeles.

1217
01:09:03,335 --> 01:09:05,603
More than a few prisons.

1218
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:08,631
This must mean something.

1219
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:11,743
Christian couldn't
have known Wade Greeley.

1220
01:09:11,744 --> 01:09:12,810
Christian got out of prison

1221
01:09:12,811 --> 01:09:15,513
before Wade Greeley went in.

1222
01:09:15,514 --> 01:09:18,449
But Coogan knowing
Wade Greeley,

1223
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,118
that's a possibility.

1224
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:21,652
That just leaves me.

1225
01:09:25,657 --> 01:09:26,691
Wait, wait!

1226
01:09:26,992 --> 01:09:28,823
We need more time!

1227
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:34,266
Why are you here?

1228
01:09:34,367 --> 01:09:35,470
Look, we think it
has something to do

1229
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,769
with what happened to your
son after he went to prison.

1230
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:41,571
Isn't this what you want? You
want us to think about our lives

1231
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:44,308
and our actions and crimes and
how they've affected other people?

1232
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:45,610
Well, that's
what we are doing,

1233
01:09:45,611 --> 01:09:46,911
and it's killing us.

1234
01:09:46,912 --> 01:09:50,148
Look, no one has suffered
like you and your son.

1235
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:51,549
Okay, no one
here was on trial.

1236
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,118
No one here was punished
for their crimes.

1237
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:56,254
We've just gone on with our
lives and never looked back.

1238
01:09:56,255 --> 01:10:00,525
But you have to look
back every single day.

1239
01:10:00,526 --> 01:10:02,193
Look, you asked Sully
if he would change,

1240
01:10:02,194 --> 01:10:03,795
knowing what he's done.

1241
01:10:03,796 --> 01:10:05,863
Well, I guarantee, you ask
anyone in this room now,

1242
01:10:05,864 --> 01:10:07,565
and we would change.

1243
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:08,766
We would change
for the better.

1244
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:11,592
Now, speak for
yourself, kiss-ass.

1245
01:10:13,305 --> 01:10:16,174
Kiss my ass.

1246
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:20,745
You could have died finding
some humanity or humility.

1247
01:10:20,746 --> 01:10:23,037
I'd rather go out in style.

1248
01:11:02,921 --> 01:11:06,657
Maybe we do deserve to die.

1249
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:08,659
I just wish I knew why.

1250
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:11,496
What, you two are
ready to give up?

1251
01:11:11,497 --> 01:11:14,298
You're both ready to die?

1252
01:11:14,299 --> 01:11:15,733
Well, fuck you both.

1253
01:11:15,734 --> 01:11:18,069
Okay, never give up.

1254
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:20,504
I've lived through worse than
this, and I'll live through this.

1255
01:11:20,639 --> 01:11:22,006
Worse than this, Kelley?

1256
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:24,709
What could possibly
be worse than this?

1257
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,477
Well, back when you
and I were still dating,

1258
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:31,381
I was stupid enough in this day
and age to think that I could

1259
01:11:31,782 --> 01:11:33,667
walk to my car alone at night.

1260
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:37,559
Some...

1261
01:11:38,088 --> 01:11:41,759
sweaty, bald-headed bastard
grabbed me from behind

1262
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,830
and threw me in his van.

1263
01:11:46,031 --> 01:11:47,999
He bashed my head on
the steel flooring.

1264
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,233
I was dazed, but I could see

1265
01:11:49,234 --> 01:11:51,402
that there was
already blood there.

1266
01:11:51,403 --> 01:11:53,728
This wasn't his first time.

1267
01:11:56,475 --> 01:11:59,972
He put his hand over my face
as he ripped my clothes off.

1268
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:03,071
It's
like my--

1269
01:12:03,813 --> 01:12:06,851
my brain didn't really
register the pain.

1270
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:09,471
I just--
I just kept

1271
01:12:09,622 --> 01:12:12,563
thinking about how I
was gonna get this guy,

1272
01:12:12,664 --> 01:12:14,559
this thing, you know.

1273
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,195
And I was gonna put him away
for the rest of his life.

1274
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:18,563
I kept imagining the courtroom

1275
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:21,832
and how I would be looking
into his eyes, and I would say,

1276
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:25,336
"I'm the one that
ruined your life."

1277
01:12:25,337 --> 01:12:29,941
But then I realized we
weren't in a courtroom.

1278
01:12:29,942 --> 01:12:33,611
There was no judge, no jury.

1279
01:12:33,612 --> 01:12:35,846
It was just me and this shit
head who thought he could

1280
01:12:35,847 --> 01:12:39,016
put his hands all over me.

1281
01:12:39,017 --> 01:12:42,420
Who the fuck was this guy to
violate me, to take my life?

1282
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:45,690
What right did he
have to touch me?

1283
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,729
I wasn't scared.

1284
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:52,897
I was furious.

1285
01:12:52,898 --> 01:12:55,499
Why didn't you
tell me, Kelley?

1286
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,068
We could have done
something about that.

1287
01:12:57,069 --> 01:12:58,936
You could have
searched everywhere.

1288
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:01,005
You never would
have found him.

1289
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:05,576
When he was done,
he rolled off me,

1290
01:13:05,577 --> 01:13:09,714
and I saw that there was
a baseball bat in his van.

1291
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:13,284
And I grabbed it,
and I hit him hard.

1292
01:13:13,485 --> 01:13:16,789
Then I stepped back,

1293
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:21,125
thinking someone must have seen,
someone must have heard. But,

1294
01:13:21,126 --> 01:13:23,363
as I waiting for someone
to come help me, I...

1295
01:13:24,464 --> 01:13:25,697
hit him again.

1296
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,932
And then I hit
him again. And I...

1297
01:13:27,933 --> 01:13:29,500
I just kept swinging.

1298
01:13:29,501 --> 01:13:31,402
And he just kept screaming.

1299
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,770
You know, and he begged. He
begged. Can you believe that?

1300
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:37,675
I swear, I think that
made me hit him harder.

1301
01:13:38,176 --> 01:13:41,579
And
then--

1302
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,415
and then he just
stopped screaming.

1303
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:46,717
He stopped moving.

1304
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:49,954
And I looked around again,

1305
01:13:49,955 --> 01:13:53,791
and still no one was there.

1306
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:57,061
No one heard.

1307
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:59,030
No one cared.

1308
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:00,238
So I...

1309
01:14:00,731 --> 01:14:04,168
I went home, and I cleaned up,

1310
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:08,739
and I burned the
bat in my fireplace.

1311
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,509
And I just went on
with my life like that.

1312
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,844
It was just over.

1313
01:14:13,845 --> 01:14:15,770
And the next day when
they found his body,

1314
01:14:15,871 --> 01:14:18,853
I made sure no one went
looking for his killer.

1315
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:26,724
And now I'm here.

1316
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:28,726
And I promise
you, I promise you,

1317
01:14:28,727 --> 01:14:29,927
I will live through this,

1318
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:34,221
and I will survive
at all-- at all costs.

1319
01:14:46,878 --> 01:14:50,614
What about rape?

1320
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:51,882
We all heard Coogan.

1321
01:14:51,883 --> 01:14:53,351
He didn't care if
it was boys or girls.

1322
01:14:53,352 --> 01:14:55,119
And if he was in the
same prison with Wade,

1323
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,580
why not a
20-year-old kid?

1324
01:15:01,259 --> 01:15:02,560
We did this to him.

1325
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:04,995
How could I have known what
was gonna happen to him?

1326
01:15:04,996 --> 01:15:08,733
Think about Wade
Greeley, an innocent kid

1327
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:10,801
and all the things
he went through.

1328
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:13,371
And think about his father

1329
01:15:13,372 --> 01:15:16,874
having to think about
what happened to his son.

1330
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:18,609
Think about that.

1331
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,711
When Coogan was shot,

1332
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:22,279
when Greeley came
in here and shot him,

1333
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,481
what did Coogan say?

1334
01:15:23,682 --> 01:15:24,849
I don't remember.

1335
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:26,217
What are you thinking?

1336
01:15:26,218 --> 01:15:29,487
He said something about a
splatter and killing everyone

1337
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,222
or something like that.

1338
01:15:31,223 --> 01:15:34,825
Maybe you should move them
out of the way of the splatter.

1339
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:36,727
I'd hate to see somebody die

1340
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:39,063
before you get a chance
to kill 'em yourself.

1341
01:15:39,364 --> 01:15:42,365
Yeah, he was being a smart-ass.
He was talking about the bullet,

1342
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:45,569
if it went through him
and killed somebody else.

1343
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,271
I thought the same thing.

1344
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:49,306
But what if that's
not what he meant?

1345
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:51,438
What if the joke was
about something else?

1346
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:54,211
His blood, for instance.

1347
01:15:54,212 --> 01:15:56,781
His infected blood.

1348
01:15:56,782 --> 01:15:58,215
What if Coogan had AIDS?

1349
01:15:58,516 --> 01:16:00,017
That's a big stretch, Eddie.

1350
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:02,520
Not really.

1351
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:06,857
That's the final
piece of our time line.

1352
01:16:06,858 --> 01:16:08,893
It starts with Christian
borrowing money from Sully.

1353
01:16:08,894 --> 01:16:09,927
I know you.

1354
01:16:09,928 --> 01:16:11,362
Says you.

1355
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:14,231
No, we did some business
together years ago.

1356
01:16:14,232 --> 01:16:18,267
But then he loses that money after
a bad drug deal and ends up in jail.

1357
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,603
When he gets released,

1358
01:16:19,604 --> 01:16:22,106
he buys a gun from Leon,

1359
01:16:22,107 --> 01:16:23,841
uses it to rob
Chan's liquor store,

1360
01:16:23,842 --> 01:16:25,309
'cause he still
owes Sully the money.

1361
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:28,813
Then Chan picks Wade
Greeley out of the lineup.

1362
01:16:28,814 --> 01:16:31,215
Kelley makes sure the
evidence fits her case

1363
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:33,184
and uses Jackson to
secure that evidence

1364
01:16:33,185 --> 01:16:35,986
against Wade for the trial.

1365
01:16:35,987 --> 01:16:39,123
Father Francis learns the
truth during confession

1366
01:16:39,124 --> 01:16:41,551
but being bound by
God, says nothing.

1367
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:45,596
So Wade ends up in prison

1368
01:16:45,597 --> 01:16:48,899
where he has a
run-in with Coogan.

1369
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,401
And that's how I'm
tied into all this.

1370
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:52,770
So why are you here?

1371
01:16:53,171 --> 01:16:56,307
Back around the time when Wade

1372
01:16:56,308 --> 01:16:58,242
would have been
released from prison,

1373
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:00,077
my company had acquired
the exclusive rights

1374
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:02,713
to an experimental drug
therapy for AIDS patients.

1375
01:17:02,714 --> 01:17:05,683
It was said to
prolong the life

1376
01:17:05,684 --> 01:17:09,019
of people living with AIDS.

1377
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:10,855
It was very new expensive.

1378
01:17:10,856 --> 01:17:13,157
I think Coogan infected
Wade Greeley with AIDS.

1379
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:14,859
And the reason Wade's
dad waited 2 years

1380
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,694
is because that's exactly
how long his son lived

1381
01:17:16,695 --> 01:17:19,862
outside of prison
before he died.

1382
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:22,268
It's his father

1383
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:26,271
acting out revenge for
the death of his son.

1384
01:17:27,872 --> 01:17:30,074
Wade must have been
one of the applicants

1385
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:32,443
for the new AIDS drug.

1386
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:36,380
Part of my job was to
turn down applicants.

1387
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:38,182
Improper insurance,
not enough money,

1388
01:17:38,183 --> 01:17:41,886
wrong age, and
criminal records.

1389
01:17:41,887 --> 01:17:44,870
I was the one whose name was signed
to all letters denying applicants.

1390
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:48,259
If I had accepted
Wade into the program,

1391
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,329
he might be alive today.

1392
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,863
That's it.

1393
01:17:52,864 --> 01:17:54,565
That's the answer
he's looking for.

1394
01:18:12,517 --> 01:18:14,318
So why are you here?

1395
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,153
Because your son died of AIDS.

1396
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:18,789
He contracted it in
prison from Coogan.

1397
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:20,257
When he was released,

1398
01:18:20,258 --> 01:18:23,193
you tried to get him into my
company's drug therapy program,

1399
01:18:23,194 --> 01:18:24,562
but
they--

1400
01:18:24,563 --> 01:18:27,998
I turned him down.

1401
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:29,767
Your son could be alive today

1402
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:33,630
if we all hadn't turned
our backs on him and on you.

1403
01:18:35,141 --> 01:18:36,641
He was so,

1404
01:18:38,071 --> 01:18:40,541
so beautiful.

1405
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:03,735
My son was a very
brave and lovely boy.

1406
01:19:05,036 --> 01:19:06,270
And all of you made sure

1407
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:08,872
that he would never
grow up to be a man.

1408
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:11,709
It didn't have
to end this way.

1409
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:15,546
Any one of you could
have prevented his death.

1410
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:16,751
But you all...

1411
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:19,371
saw him as a suspect or

1412
01:19:19,572 --> 01:19:22,510
a number, a toy
to be played with.

1413
01:19:24,055 --> 01:19:27,057
His only fault

1414
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:31,762
was that he became
a part of your lives.

1415
01:19:31,763 --> 01:19:35,132
But it was his life.

1416
01:19:35,133 --> 01:19:37,333
And you destroyed it.

1417
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,973
When
we--

1418
01:19:43,274 --> 01:19:45,379
when we leave here,

1419
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,879
my life will end, but

1420
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,782
you will all still have yours.

1421
01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:55,386
And I want you to remember,
just remember this.

1422
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:59,490
Remember what it
is you have done.

1423
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:02,870
And I hope that it haunts you

1424
01:20:03,671 --> 01:20:06,190
until the day you die.

1425
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:13,504
Show's over.

1426
01:20:13,505 --> 01:20:15,905
The police are already here.
They're in the building.

1427
01:20:16,007 --> 01:20:20,310
Unlock yourself
and the other 2.

1428
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:22,841
It's time to leave.

1429
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,893
What are you doing?
He was letting us go!

1430
01:20:35,894 --> 01:20:37,728
I told you I couldn't have
anyone go to the police

1431
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:39,672
with my story. I'd be ruined.

1432
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,765
Survive at all
costs, remember?

1433
01:20:41,766 --> 01:20:42,866
So you're going to kill him?

1434
01:20:42,867 --> 01:20:45,069
You're never gonna get away,

1435
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,604
no matter what you do.

1436
01:20:47,605 --> 01:20:50,273
You don't get to make any more decisions.
You don't get to do or say anything.

1437
01:20:53,411 --> 01:20:55,465
Jesus! I can't
take this anymore!

1438
01:20:55,513 --> 01:20:58,048
Just get me the
hell out of here.

1439
01:20:58,049 --> 01:20:59,416
Kelley, look.

1440
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:01,185
It's time for us to leave.

1441
01:21:01,186 --> 01:21:03,520
Just calm down, and we
can all go home together.

1442
01:21:03,521 --> 01:21:04,555
Kelley, we survived.

1443
01:21:04,556 --> 01:21:06,390
Together we can do this.

1444
01:21:06,391 --> 01:21:08,025
We have a child
together. Come on.

1445
01:21:08,026 --> 01:21:10,194
I can't have anyone know
what I've done, Jackson.

1446
01:21:10,269 --> 01:21:12,629
She's gonna kill
us! Shut up, Eddie!

1447
01:21:12,665 --> 01:21:15,132
Let me handle this!
Shut up, Eddie!

1448
01:21:15,133 --> 01:21:16,166
No, no, look!

1449
01:21:16,302 --> 01:21:18,235
I'm not gonna say
anything. I swear!

1450
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:32,449
And you.

1451
01:21:32,485 --> 01:21:34,985
You've lost. I haven't lost.

1452
01:21:34,986 --> 01:21:36,921
I've been in control
the whole time.

1453
01:21:37,422 --> 01:21:39,523
See, everybody's
been watching.

1454
01:21:39,724 --> 01:21:43,591
Everybody now knows who
the real Kelley Murphy is.

1455
01:21:46,364 --> 01:21:50,998
What will Kelley do now?

1456
01:21:52,804 --> 01:21:54,605
You don't know me.

1457
01:21:54,606 --> 01:21:56,373
You don't know
what I'm capable of.

1458
01:21:58,176 --> 01:21:59,209
Good luck.

1459
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:00,644
Thanks.
