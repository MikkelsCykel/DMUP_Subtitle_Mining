00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
I mean, it's pretty dumb, but whatever.

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Look at this.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
Oh, my God, that's so pretty.

5
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,440
I love it. Thank you so much, Aunt Nicole.

6
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,480
Isn't it pretty, Brit?

7
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,040
Dad? More decaf?

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,880
So, you two. High school. That's pretty great.

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
I guess. It's gonna be sorta weird though.

10
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,600
Really?

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Our school is kind of a feeder for New Trier's

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,360
so we're gonna know like a ton of people already.

13
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,360
Here, Annie.

14
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,800
Happy Birthday!

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,200
It's like the one you saw on The Hills, right?

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,360
I don't think The Hills are the
role models we were looking for.

17
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a bit revealing, don't you think?

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
She's fourteen, you guys.

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,760
Yeah, no need to remind me.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
- So. You did great.
- Mmm hmm!

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,640
Come on.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
Come on what?

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,960
Give it to me.

24
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,280
What's she talking about?

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,080
It's a heavy box.

26
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,520
It's the new MacBook Pro.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,760
It's got a four gigabyte hard drive

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
2.53 gigahertz proc--

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
What? I know what that means.

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,600
I think you're actually passing wind at this point.

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,600
Daddy.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,640
It's getting late, Banannie.

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,440
Five more minutes, Dad, please? It's still my birthday.

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
15.

35
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,200
Promise.

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,520
Who are you talking to?

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm chatting, Dad.

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,800
My friend Charlie from California.

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,160
He's a junior and plays volleyball for his high school.

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Ooh, a junior. Well, he's obviously a very smart kid.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,120
LOL. Laugh out loud. Right?

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,280
Nice one, Dad.

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,400
PWOMS?

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,360
"Parent watching over my shoulder."

45
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
And what is that?

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,560
"Laughing my ass off. Me too."

47
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,760
No, wait.

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,240
Dad, can you go talk to Mom about
mortgage payments or something.

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,040
All right. Good night, birthday girl.

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
Good night. Love you.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,080
Love you.

52
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,640
All right. Let's see what you got.

53
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,960
There you go, ladies. Touch the line.

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
Make sure you're touching the line.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,160
Last one. You're almost there.

56
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
Hey, Annie, come here!

57
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
This is Serena.

58
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
So, you're Peter Cameron's little sister.

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Your brother's hot as shit.

60
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,040
Uh, thanks, I guess.

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,200
So, I'm having a little party
at my house Saturday night

62
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
and you, little Cameron, are invited.

63
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
Okay. Uh, thanks, Serena.

64
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,200
Tell your brother.

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Is it deliberate?

66
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
No, not at all.

67
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,120
Hey, honey?

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
No phones at the table, please.

69
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Sorry.

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,840
Katie, will you take a picture of me and Peter?

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Hey, what did Mom just say?

72
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,320
I was just gonna send a photo to Charlie, but okay.

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,880
So, seriously, what's this guy's deal?

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,360
Well, he's smart. And funny.

75
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,880
His brother's being recruited
by UC Berkeley for football

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,240
and that's where he wants to go, but for volleyball.

77
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,920
Oh, right. The girl's sport.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
What do his parents do?

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
His mom teaches kids with autism

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,240
and his dad works for ESPN.

81
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,240
I don't know, sweetheart.

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,200
Sounds like he's got too much
going for him for my likin'.

83
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
Hey.

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,360
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm looking at them right now.

86
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,480
These are definitely for a clothing company, right?

87
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
So why isn't anybody wearing a shirt?

88
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,800
No, I'm kidding. Yeah. They're
good. Go with it. Okay. Bye.

89
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,480
Hi, Mom!

90
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
Hey, honey, how'd it go?

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,200
I made the team!

92
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,160
You did? That's great!

93
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,920
What happened?

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Annie?

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,600
Come on. Where are you?

96
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
About time.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
Hi, Charlie.

98
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,240
Where's mine, bozo?

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,760
What?

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,640
"I'm really 20. Sophomore at UC Berkeley."

101
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,920
What?

102
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,120
Twenty?

103
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
Bye.

104
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,920
Hello.

105
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
Wow.

106
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,280
Hi, girls. So did your brother come with?

107
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,400
No, he's packing for college.

108
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,560
Great. Looks like I wore these for nothing.

109
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
Come join us.

110
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,600
We're teaching Alexa how to give a blow job.

111
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
She sucks. She keeps gagging.

112
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
Serena, where's your bathroom?

113
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,720
We have like six of them. Go
down the hall. You'll find one.

114
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,960
Hi, Dad.

115
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,280
Hey, sweetheart. You have a good time?

116
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
M m-hm.

117
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,360
Those girls kinda freaked me out though.

118
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,120
Yeah?

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,520
I-I really want them to like me, you know?

120
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
It means a lot.

121
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,160
Just be yourself.

122
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,880
If the Serenas of the world don't like it, it's their loss.

123
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,560
No, it's high school, Dad.

124
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,840
If the Serenas of the world don't like me

125
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,520
I'm screwed. You get it?

126
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,360
Not really, no. Sorry, I've, I've really gotta--

127
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,040
Yeah, okay.

128
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
'Night.

129
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
Is that Charlie?

130
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,480
Yeah, he has a big paper due tomorrow.

131
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
That picture he sent you is so hot. He's totally ripped.

132
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
Sh. Shut up. My mom.

133
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,440
I got donut holes.

134
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,320
They're very good. Here.

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,760
Who was that?

136
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,160
- It was Serena and Tanya.
- Oh.

137
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
Get anything good?

138
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
M m.

139
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,360
What?

140
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,640
She told me to buy a bra.

141
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,320
Oh, really? Let me see.

142
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Classy.

143
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
- You saved the receipt though, right?
- Mom.

144
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,800
If you think you're ready for a bra like that

145
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,800
then we'll talk about it, okay?

146
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Serena kinda made fun of her sports bra.

147
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,160
- Why?
- 'Cause it totally, like, flattens out my boobs.

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,400
She said that guys would think that I was hotter

149
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
if I, like, had a better bra.

150
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,320
Does, like, Serena say like all the time too?

151
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,880
Because, like, you never used to.

152
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,040
Sorry.

153
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,400
You don't have to dumb yourself
down for guys, like Serena.

154
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,120
You know that.

155
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,560
Maybe she thinks that's all she's got to offer.

156
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
Her parents own half of downtown
Chicago.

157
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,520
You get my point though, right?

158
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,080
Yes, Lynn.

159
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,600
It's a parking lot, moron. Go around!

160
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,160
Did you get my point?

161
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,640
Yeah, Mom. I get it.

162
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,920
Oh, for the love of--

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,440
- Bite me!
- Mom!

164
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,120
Yeah, I'm gonna get the steak sandwich
, medium, with grilled onions.

165
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
And can I get a side of chips, please?

166
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't--

167
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,640
He means French fries.

168
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,160
Twenty years here, he still can't say French fries.

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm gonna have the same thing, actually,
except rare on the steak.

170
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,080
And to drink, we'll have a bottle of--

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,240
Really?

172
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,160
'92 Rothschild.

173
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,880
Fantastic selection.

174
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,800
So what are we celebrating?

175
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,760
So A & A wants to use us. For everything.

176
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,920
- They liked the campaign?
- Liked?

177
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,840
How 'bout I just got a phone call from the CEO

178
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,000
that was basically ten minutes of phone sex.

179
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,800
Hey, let me ask you something.

180
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
How old are you?

181
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
- Old enough.
- Oh.

182
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,080
I'm Claire, by the way.

183
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,240
Hi, Claire. I'm Al.

184
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,920
- That's Will.
- Hi.

185
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
Please let me know if there's anything else you need.

186
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Anything?

187
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,280
Can you stop? She's nineteen.

188
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
One hour. That's all I ask.

189
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
Just one hour with that ass.

190
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,200
How's Barbara?

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,320
Oh, fuck off.

192
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,560
That is so weird.

193
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Peter and I were just doing exactly
the same thing in his room.

194
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,520
Ah, Dad.

195
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
Okay. What now?

196
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,480
What? How old are you?

197
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,400
Why do you keep lying?

198
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,440
What?

199
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
Why do you keep lying to me?

200
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Man, you won't believe
the stuff I'm finding in here.

201
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
I'll say. You wanna keep these Playboys?

202
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,000
What?

203
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
Just kidding.

204
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,480
Oh. Yeah, me too.

205
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,840
What, you packed 'em already?

206
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,640
Yeah, kinda.

207
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,000
You all right with this?

208
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,320
With what?

209
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,360
The whole college thing.

210
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,480
Yeah, I guess.

211
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't feel pressured

212
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,480
into doing things you don't want to do.

213
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,280
Wait. This isn't another father-son talk, is it?

214
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Oh, Dad, we had the sex talk, like, three years ago

215
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
and I still can't order a salad with cucumbers in it.

216
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,120
I just don't want you to lose sight
of what's important, like--

217
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,920
Taking responsibility for my actions

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,120
living up to my potential and personal expectations

219
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,600
staying true to my beliefs. Basically, being a man?

220
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,520
Something like that.

221
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
Relax, Pop. I got this. Trust me.

222
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,600
God. Come on. Let's hug it out.

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,760
I feel the same way.

224
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,720
You coming in, sweetheart? It's getting cold.

225
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,120
Hold on a sec.

226
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,760
Um, I'm talking to Brittany, Dad.

227
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Two minutes.

228
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,320
Okay. Now go away.

229
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,240
Hi.

230
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,280
How do I know that?

231
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,440
Okay.

232
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,040
Well, are you still a virgin?

233
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Good, 'cause that would have been creepy.

234
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,120
So, um, how old were you when you--?

235
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
Did you set the alarm?

236
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,200
Force field activated.

237
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,840
Is Annie upstairs?

238
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,160
She's in her room. Peter's still out.

239
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,280
Amen to that.

240
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,600
You heartless witch.

241
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,080
What?

242
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,080
You're happy he's going, aren't you?

243
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,960
Two words for you. Home gym.

244
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,480
His room's gonna look great with a treadmill in it.

245
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,360
Our poor kid is barely packed and
you're already redecorating.

246
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,800
What can I say? Except--good riddance!

247
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,120
Fuck.

248
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,960
Oh, for God's--

249
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,600
They're in their room.

250
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,480
Right now? Just a T-shirt and some underwear.

251
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,200
No. With just the T-shirt.

252
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,480
Okay.

253
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,960
Okay, it's dark now.

254
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Oh, I guess. What is it?

255
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
No.

256
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,720
Okay.

257
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,040
Is that everything?

258
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah.

259
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Katie, come give me a hug.

260
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,360
No. I don't want you to go.

261
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,160
So, I guess I'm gonna go to college now.

262
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,680
I love you. Email me, okay?

263
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,280
Okay. Hey, and check my tweets.

264
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,200
Okay, we gotta go, guys.

265
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,600
We'll see you later.

266
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,720
Bye. Bye, angel. Bye.

267
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,800
Hi. Uh, it's me again.

268
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,320
Where are you? I'm sitting on the bench just outside.

269
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,440
Annie?

270
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,040
Yes?

271
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,440
It's me. Charlie.

272
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
Hey, you.

273
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,680
God, I can't believe it's really you.

274
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,800
Look at you. You're gorgeous.

275
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,080
Is this a joke?

276
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,800
What?

277
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,720
No, it's me, Charlie.

278
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,920
What's wrong?

279
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,960
You're not 25.

280
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh. Well, hey.

281
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
Don't get upset.

282
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,760
Annie, please.

283
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,880
Just give me a chance to explain.

284
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,360
It's me, Charlie.

285
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
I'm sorry, I, but--

286
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay, all right. You're right.

287
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,080
I just couldn't think of a way to tell you.

288
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,840
You have to believe me.

289
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,200
Annie, please. Please?

290
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,640
Don't get upset. You're killing me here.

291
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,080
Annie? It's still me. Okay?

292
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,480
Forget the age thing. All that
stuff that we talked about?

293
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,640
All the things that we shared? It's me. Charlie.

294
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,960
I'm sitting right here next to you.

295
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,120
Why do you keep lying to me?

296
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,800
Because of this.

297
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,240
I was, I was afraid

298
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,960
that you wouldn't be mature enough to understand.

299
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,680
Annie, when you connect with someone
the way that we connected

300
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,120
when you find a soul mate the
way that we found each other

301
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,240
then nothing else matters.

302
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,440
I thought you were old enough to understand that.

303
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,800
I mean, you made me think
you could handle this, Annie.

304
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,640
I mean, this is ridiculous.

305
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,840
I mean, it's me, Charlie.

306
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,400
The same guy that you've been talking
to every day and every night

307
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,200
for the last two months.

308
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,680
I love you.

309
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,240
Annie.

310
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,480
And I don't get why age has to change that.

311
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,360
Can we just walk a bit? Huh?

312
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,680
Talk a little bit more.

313
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,400
Just for a couple of minutes

314
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,920
before I have my long drive back to the airport?

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,560
Come on. Just--

316
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
I was just looking forward to seeing you so much.

317
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,560
I thought we were friends at least, Annie.

318
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
This remind you of anything?

319
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,600
I was just thinking that. Your year abroad in London.

320
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,960
All these American students come in. I saw this girl.

321
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,320
Love at first sight.

322
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Didn't work out. I ended up with you.

323
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,280
There.

324
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Sorry.

325
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,240
Go ahead, spin it.

326
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,880
The candy's weird. It's better without it.

327
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,200
Can I have some of yours?

328
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,880
Oh.

329
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah. You win. Pistachio rocks.

330
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,960
So Peter took off, huh?

331
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,360
You must be so excited.

332
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,880
Yeah, I'm happy for him.

333
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm just gonna miss him, that's all.

334
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,520
I just hope he doesn't get caught up

335
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
into that whole fraternity rush thing.

336
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
Sounds so stupid.

337
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,040
Yeah, there's definitely some
stupid stuff involved, but

338
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,800
I have to say I was a Delt

339
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,360
and there were some great things about it, too.

340
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,280
I met some, some quality guys that
I hope will be friends for life.

341
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah, I just, when he drinks he kind of loses control.

342
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,520
This one time he tried to text me
the sound of him vomiting.

343
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,040
It's kind of tough to spell.

344
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,640
It's kind of-- I, I don't know.

345
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,480
It's like, "UG," I don't know. But...

346
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,080
I just hope he doesn't just do it to party and get laid.

347
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,000
But, yeah, I guess that's what college is for, right?

348
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,640
Finding out for yourself, finding out who you are.

349
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,720
What?

350
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,560
Nothing.

351
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
It's just

352
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
you amaze me. Seriously.

353
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,040
You're so intelligent and sensitive, like

354
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
wise beyond your years.

355
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,800
It's just amazing, that's all.

356
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,040
Hey.

357
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,360
Want me to teach you the secret Delt handshake?

358
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay.

359
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,200
You can't tell anyone.

360
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,360
I won't.

361
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Okay.

362
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,040
Stick out your hand

363
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,640
like you're gonna shake mine.

364
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,360
So--

365
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,320
So.

366
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,080
You still mad at me?

367
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
No, not really.

368
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,160
Wanna check out your present?

369
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,920
Oh, yeah.

370
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,080
You said you'd want one in red, so--

371
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,600
It's sexy, right?

372
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,720
I can't tell you how many times
I've thought about you in it.

373
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,920
It's crazy, I'm so nervous and excited

374
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,240
to be sitting here with you finally after all this time.

375
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,160
There.

376
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,440
Happy?

377
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,440
You look ridiculously sexy.

378
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,280
No, don't go.

379
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm serious.

380
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,080
Come here.

381
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,160
Come sit down.

382
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,520
Have you thought about us like this?

383
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,080
I know you have because you
told me about it, didn't you?

384
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,680
You don't think my body's weird?

385
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,120
Are you kidding?

386
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
You're, you're gorgeous.

387
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,280
So you're not-- disappointed or anything?

388
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,920
Annie. Annie.

389
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,200
You're perfect.

390
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,000
You take my breath away.

391
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,400
Can I just--?

392
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,200
No, wait, Charlie, wait. Hold on.

393
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,360
It's okay.

394
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,360
Charlie--

395
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,720
It's okay.

396
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,320
Charlie, wait.

397
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,040
Charlie.

398
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,800
It's okay, Annie. Don't worry.

399
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,840
I'm just taking these off.

400
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,240
Oh. Hold still, Annie. I've gotta take these off, too.

401
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,920
That's my girl.

402
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,800
Oh, God. Look at you.

403
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,120
This is perfect.

404
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,400
How about the boys in class?

405
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,640
They're okay.

406
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,760
Are they?

407
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Um, we're making bowls in pottery class, but

408
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,280
mine looks like an ashtray

409
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,880
which is kind of funny because I don't smoke.

410
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,000
Nice.

411
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,080
How 'bout you, Annie? How's school?

412
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Annie.

413
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,520
Hm?

414
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,000
School. How is it?

415
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
Annie?

416
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,920
He's so cute.

417
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,280
I know.

418
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,840
You should go out with him.

419
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,320
Did you get my text?

420
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,640
M m-hm.

421
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,640
Why didn't you call me back?

422
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,520
Check it out, Annie. Your boyfriend.

423
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
Ow!

424
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,320
I told you before. He's not my boyfriend.

425
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,160
You keep saying that.
Makes me think you like him.

426
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,920
If you're so obsessed with him, why you fuck him?

427
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,040
- What's your problem?
- Yeah? He's cute!

428
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,440
Pick up, please pick up.

429
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,440
Is this about Charlie?

430
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,800
No. No.

431
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,520
Annie, what happened?

432
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,960
That was him at the mall, wasn't it?

433
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
How old is he?

434
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,240
It doesn't matter.

435
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,440
Annie, wait.

436
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,160
Oh, my God.

437
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,120
It's not that big a deal.

438
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,520
We met up on Saturday. We had sex.

439
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,520
We're in love.

440
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,040
Oh, my God.

441
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,680
Now just drop it. I'm serious.

442
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,240
The word ciao

443
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,800
comes from schiavo, or servant, and was used as--

444
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,600
Sorry to interrupt, uh

445
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,400
mind if I borrow Annie Cameron for a second?

446
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,120
Ms. Worley, why are we going this way?

447
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,920
Oh, it's all right, Annie. Come on in.

448
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Why don't you have a seat?

449
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,240
I know, yeah.

450
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,360
Holy shit! Dude, dude.

451
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,840
No, it's Antigua. Anguilla
is a totally different island.

452
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,720
Honestly, I was hoping to get the crew

453
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,640
and the equipment in the same place.

454
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,600
Yeah. Hang on. Hang on just a second.

455
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,800
Hello. Speaking.

456
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,840
Sorry, I, I don't understand.

457
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,640
Will. Will!

458
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,880
What happened?

459
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,960
They won't tell me anything.
I just, I just got here, and I--

460
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,720
Excuse me. Annie Cameron. We're the parents.

461
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,880
Let me find the nurse.

462
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,040
M r. and M rs. Cameron?

463
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,880
I'm Officer Gomez.

464
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,760
Your daughter wants you to know that she's okay, but

465
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,040
maybe you should have a seat.

466
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,640
- What's going on?
- What?

467
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,800
We don't know exactly what's happened.

468
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,240
What we do know so far

469
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,800
is that we think she was assaulted

470
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,360
by her alleged boyfriend three days ago.

471
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,680
She hasn't got a boyfriend.

472
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,200
Well, apparently on Saturday

473
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,120
she met up with a man she calls Charlie

474
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,720
at a motel, where she was sexually assaulted.

475
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,320
The man is at least 35 years old.

476
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,800
Jesus Christ. Where is she?

477
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,800
She's in an exam room with the nurse

478
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
collecting evidence for the rape kit. She's okay.

479
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
One of the counselors from the hospital is with her.

480
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,920
I have to see her.

481
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,640
Look, there is a private waiting
room just down the hall--

482
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,000
We have to see her right now!

483
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,040
We want to see her right now.

484
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,560
She's having an exam. You'll see her in a minute.

485
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
I'm almost done.

486
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,680
I just need to get one more picture of that abrasion.

487
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,080
This is fucking insane.

488
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,680
Oh, baby.

489
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,240
It's okay. We're here. We're here now.

490
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,280
M r. and M rs. Cameron, I'm Gail Friedman.

491
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,480
I'm a counselor with the hospital.

492
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm glad you're here.

493
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,400
- Annie here is an amazing young woman.
- Gail.

494
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,720
- Ah. This is Special Agent Doug Tate with the FB I.
- Hi.

495
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,400
FB I?

496
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,840
Well, any time a crime is committed

497
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,400
against a child using the I nternet

498
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,080
and the suspect is a traveler

499
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,880
someone from out of state, they call us in.

500
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Look, Annie, I know you've had a rough day.

501
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,360
But I need to ask you a couple of
questions. You feel up for it?

502
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,640
Do we have to do this now?

503
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,680
Trust me, the sooner we start
this investigation, the better.

504
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,320
Gail, do we still have the clothes
she was wearing that night?

505
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,720
- Yes.
- Are they here?

506
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,600
No, they're at her house.

507
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,600
Okay, I need to get those from
you as soon as possible.

508
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,760
Is that okay?

509
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,120
Yeah, I guess.

510
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,120
M r. Cameron, M rs. Cameron

511
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,640
I would like to talk to Annie alone.
Could you please just--

512
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,240
Look, I've had enough of this.

513
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,240
This is our daughter. We wanna be with her.

514
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,360
You've got to understand that right now

515
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,280
Annie's a victim of a crime and you
and your wife are just witnesses.

516
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
That's why we interview everybody separately

517
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,480
so as not to contaminate anyone's testimony.

518
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
Now if you can just give Annie and I a second alone

519
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,440
and then I 'Il come back to your house

520
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
and we can all sit down and talk.

521
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,720
Fair enough?

522
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,920
So how long will this take?

523
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,080
Well, it depends if we get enough
genetic material to run a profile.

524
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,640
And if there is, how long?

525
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,680
Right now, there's a nationwide backlog.

526
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,120
I n I Ilinois alone, we've got 2 ,000 unopened kits

527
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,600
sitting in freezers waiting to be processed.

528
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,040
Some people have been waiting a year.

529
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,880
- What?
- How is that possible?

530
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,640
We'll run this through the FB I facilities.

531
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,040
So, two weeks, a month on the outside.

532
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,480
A month?

533
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,240
Now can I see the family computer?

534
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,080
Doug.

535
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,600
Yeah.

536
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
- Did you copy the hard drive?
- Yup.

537
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
- We'll take that with the evidence down to the lab.
- Okay.

538
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,680
Apart from Teen Chat

539
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,320
were there any other networking sites

540
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,760
you used to communicate?

541
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,240
No, not really.

542
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,240
Did you guys ever speak on the phone?

543
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,120
You spoke to him.

544
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,880
Now, you said his mother was sick.

545
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,880
Yeah. Cancer.

546
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah, okay.

547
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,200
Tell him you feel awful about his mother

548
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,880
that you really wanna talk to him

549
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,200
that you lost an uncle to cancer.

550
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,320
I-I don't know.

551
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,120
You don't know what?

552
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,240
I just don't wanna lie to him.

553
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,280
What are you talking about,
sweetheart? He lied to you.

554
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,600
What do you think of writing to him

555
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,520
and just telling him how you feel?

556
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,200
Yeah, Annie. Would that be good?

557
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,840
Yeah, I guess.

558
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,840
Okay, good.

559
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,440
Okay, just keep it simple. Be yourself.

560
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,160
Maybe he didn't even like me.

561
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,320
He didn't.

562
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,160
Will!

563
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,480
It wasn't like that, sweetheart.

564
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,480
The man tricked you.

565
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,160
What?

566
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,520
- Is that him?
- Charlie.

567
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,360
Okay, now, remember, he's gonna test you

568
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
to see if you told anybody. You haven't, okay?

569
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,680
Tell him that you're concerned

570
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,480
and a little worried that he hasn't called. Okay?

571
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,720
Should I?

572
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,040
Yeah, answer him. Yeah.

573
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,160
A-are, are you guys tracing this?

574
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,360
Yes.

575
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,400
It says private. What do I do to answer it?

576
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,880
Frank, are we good?

577
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,680
We're good.

578
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,360
Annie? Look at me? Just, just talk to him.

579
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,160
All right?

580
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,560
Okay.

581
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,560
Hello?

582
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,400
Annie?

583
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,720
Charlie?

584
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,480
Hi.

585
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,600
Hi.

586
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,840
It's kinda late. Where are your parents?

587
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,920
They took Katie to the movies.

588
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,200
Charlie?

589
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,160
Shit.

590
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,120
Shame on you, Annie.

591
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,600
Charlie?

592
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,480
Charlie, are you there?

593
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,360
Charlie?

594
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,000
Damn it!

595
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,880
Frank, did we get it?

596
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,440
Well, that's it. He's gone.

597
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,280
Why did you make me do that?

598
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,720
Annie!

599
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,880
He probably got your
cell number off your website.

600
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,440
Look, I 'Il give you a call

601
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,080
when I get back from the motel.

602
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,000
Tell me something. Did she yell for help?

603
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,760
I mean, did she scream, tell him to stop?

604
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,800
Just because she didn't scream for help

605
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,440
does not mean this wasn't rape.

606
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
Now that guy is 20 years older than she is.

607
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,120
He groomed her for weeks just
to get her into the motel room

608
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
and she's armed with what? The eighth-grade biology

609
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,080
and the expectation that the world is a decent place.

610
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,080
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.

611
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,200
No, you won't. That's why I'm
here. Now, we will find him.

612
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,840
And what am I supposed to do?

613
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,160
You go back inside, you support your daughter

614
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,120
and you let us do our job.

615
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,520
What, with just five of you guys
working the whole state?

616
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,520
There's gotta be something I can do. I'm
not just gonna stand around and wait--

617
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,080
M r. Cameron, I promise you.

618
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,880
I put everything I got into these cases.

619
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,280
You just gotta give us a chance.

620
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,120
Now, my cell is on the back.

621
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,520
You call me if you need anything.

622
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,800
I 'Il drop you a line tomorrow when
I get back from the motel.

623
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,160
You want me to sleep with you tonight?

624
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,240
No, I just want my blanket.

625
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,960
No, please, stop.

626
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,760
Stop, please!

627
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,600
Dad, please help me to stop him.

628
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,560
Please, Dad, help!

629
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,720
Don't. Please, Dad, help me, please.

630
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Stop! No!

631
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,280
Will.

632
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,200
You all right, buddy?

633
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,160
Yeah, of course.

634
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,160
If M rs. Van Dersey wants the meeting, fine.

635
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,120
But I think that we should dictate the parameters.

636
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,560
No more of this bullshit.

637
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,080
Good.

638
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,920
Is there any more coffee?

639
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
Grab another coffee.

640
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,960
Hey. I got you a new cell.

641
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,360
Now, you have to promise me

642
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,760
that you're not gonna try and call him

643
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,160
or text him with this new number.

644
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,400
Remember what Tate said about the old one

645
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,600
that if he tries to call you on that,
you tell us immediately.

646
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,400
I'm gonna have to check the bills.

647
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,440
And if I find out that you've tried to contact him

648
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,600
I'm gonna have to take it back.

649
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
Okay?

650
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,920
So what? Do I just start talking like Tony Soprano?

651
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,360
Boy, I hope not.

652
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,720
I'm glad you came.

653
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,880
Yeah, well, my parents said I had to.

654
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,480
Well, even so, I'm still glad.

655
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,960
I want this to be a place

656
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,560
for you to feel safe and comfortable

657
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,960
talking about anything.

658
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,680
I just wanna be helpful to you.

659
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,680
You think I need help?

660
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,400
I think that what you've been through
must be very difficult.

661
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,800
You know, what's the big deal?

662
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,440
There are girls at my school

663
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,080
who've had sex with half the football team.

664
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,440
I lose my virginity and my parents

665
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,080
make a federal case out of it.

666
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,440
Literally.

667
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,840
I think they're more concerned

668
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,040
that you may have been in danger

669
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,960
more than anything else.

670
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,480
Danger?

671
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,200
That's 'cause they don't know him.

672
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,240
You know, the thing is

673
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,840
I bet my dad would really like him

674
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,200
if they'd met, you know, before.

675
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,880
What is it about him you think your father would like?

676
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,240
He's sweet, and smart, and really funny.

677
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,200
And gives great advice and which
, by the way, worked.

678
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,280
I-I made the team because of him.

679
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,080
You think that's the only reason you made the team?

680
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,880
Because of his advice, and not your own ability?

681
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,560
Well, he's older. He's been playing longer.

682
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,600
What'd you think about him being older?

683
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,120
At first I thought he was 16, okay?

684
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,080
And then, all of a sudden he's 20 and I'm like, what?

685
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,440
And then we kept talking

686
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,400
and I was, like, what's the big deal?

687
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,040
He gets me, you know?

688
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,560
He's not judgmental.

689
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,880
He's encouraging.

690
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,240
And despite my age difference he still loves me.

691
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,000
And he thinks I'm beautiful.

692
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,760
What'd you think about him

693
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,560
not being honest about his age?

694
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,920
You know, Charlie said that

695
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,480
when you connect like we did

696
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,360
when you find that soul mate

697
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,280
that's the only thing to think about.

698
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,000
Don't you believe that when two people are in love

699
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,800
nothing else matters?

700
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,480
I can understand how strong those feelings are, Annie.

701
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,400
But, there are reasons why girls your age and men his

702
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,080
aren't supposed to be together.

703
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,360
Whatever.

704
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,840
He loves me. I know he does.

705
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,800
And he's dying to call me or email me

706
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,840
but he knows it's not safe

707
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,880
thanks to my parents and the FB I.

708
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,240
I just--

709
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,960
What?

710
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,280
I just hope he's okay.

711
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,040
What, he go to lunch early?

712
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,200
He went home. Said he wasn't feeling well.

713
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,120
Hello?

714
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,560
Will, it's Agent Tate.

715
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,280
I wanted to give you an update.

716
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,920
Now, look, the motel didn't give us much.

717
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,600
He paid cash for the room.

718
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
He told the manager he lost his wallet.

719
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
He even ordered a credit card right in front of him.

720
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,600
The, uh, the cell phone was prepaid
. It was purchased in St. Louis.

721
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,800
He paid cash for that, too, whoever he is.

722
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,200
So his name's not Charles Hightower.

723
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,960
Yeah, not that we can tell.

724
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,600
I found seven of them living in the U.S. so far

725
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,760
but none of 'em fit the description.

726
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,040
There's nothing that even confirms he's from California

727
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,000
we, uh, we actually traced his IP
address to the Czech Republic.

728
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,760
What?

729
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,160
It seems he's running some sort of ghost program.

730
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,080
It's a software that basically bounces

731
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,240
his IP address from one server to another

732
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,200
all over the world.

733
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,440
Sir?

734
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,560
Sorry, I don't understand.

735
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,240
What does that mean?

736
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,320
It means he's good at what he's doing.

737
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,720
But don't worry, don't worry.
This is exactly how it starts.

738
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,160
You need to go on through, go get your stuff.

739
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,480
Yeah, one minute, please.

740
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,720
What about the car? Anything?

741
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,640
Hang up the phone, sir.

742
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,240
It was an airport rental. He must've
swapped the plates.

743
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,080
Gary!

744
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,400
Look, I'm, I 'Il have to call you back. Okay?

745
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,840
Seriously, is my conversation

746
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,720
that much of a threat to security?

747
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,920
Thank you, sir.

748
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,160
Is it over?

749
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,360
Yeah, you missed a pretty good fight.

750
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,840
When they do Real Housewives of Chicago

751
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,480
I am so auditioning.

752
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,680
Yeah, right.

753
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,520
I talked to Jennie.

754
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,040
Brittany's really upset you won't call her back.

755
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,600
Good.

756
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,000
She was only trying to help, honey.

757
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,280
Yeah, well, she's a bitch.

758
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,680
No, she's your best friend.

759
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,040
Best friends don't narc on each other.

760
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,000
Not like she'll ever get a boyfriend

761
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,680
but if she does, I hope someone ruins it for her, too.

762
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,080
Lynn?

763
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,960
Did you get my message?

764
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,560
Yeah, I called you back

765
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,680
but it went to voice mail. Did you eat?

766
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,280
Have a look at this a second.

767
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,920
You won't believe this.

768
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,600
What is this?

769
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,880
This is the National Sex Offenders Registry.

770
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,720
There's perverts all over Wilmette, not just Chicago.

771
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,680
See this? All these red dots.

772
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,840
They're everywhere.

773
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,760
Oh, my God.

774
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,800
This guy here is literally three blocks away on Linden.

775
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,400
What's going on?

776
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,320
Hi, sweetheart. Um, come here a second.

777
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,160
I, I need you to do something for me.

778
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,800
These men are all registered sex
offenders in the neighborhood

779
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,200
that fit the description.

780
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,800
I need you to look through them.

781
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,160
Why?

782
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,680
I n case one of them's Charlie.

783
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,880
What?

784
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,960
No. N-- No.

785
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,480
Honey, you should. One of them could be him.

786
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,120
None of them's him.

787
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,480
Forget the hair and the mustaches.
Just look at the face.

788
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,920
Could any of them be him?

789
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,880
I said, no.

790
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,440
God, what's your problem?

791
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,120
My problem is you were attacked.

792
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,880
It wasn't like that.

793
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Besides, none of them are Charlie, okay?

794
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,440
Are we done?

795
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,040
PervertTracker. What is this?

796
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,880
It's a group I met with today.

797
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,480
Supposed to be the best in the
country. They hunt predators.

798
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,160
Today? It says they're in New Jersey.

799
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,920
You were in New Jersey today?

800
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,200
You got on a plane today without telling me?

801
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,520
Are you fucking kidding me?

802
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,360
I swear to God, Will

803
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,760
if you ever get on a plane again without telling me

804
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,800
I swear to God, I don't know what I'd do.

805
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,320
I'm sorry.

806
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,880
Honey, you're right. I'm sorry.

807
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,360
I'm gonna go check on her.

808
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,240
I've gotta get out of my house.

809
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,040
How come? What's happening at home?

810
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,880
You know, they think I'm stupid
for meeting up with him.

811
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,000
Going back to his hotel.

812
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,280
They said that?

813
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,000
My dad looks at me like I'm an idiot.

814
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,400
He wants to kill Charlie. That's all he talks about.

815
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,200
Getting his hands on him.

816
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,080
Well, what would you do if he got in touch with you

817
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,400
have you thought about what you would say to him?

818
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,120
I just wanna talk to him. Hear his voice.

819
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,560
See how his mom's doing, and his little dog.

820
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,360
See how we're gonna make this work.

821
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,600
I just wanna talk to him about what happened.

822
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,040
We haven't really talked about that

823
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,640
about what happened in the motel.

824
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,720
Are we supposed to?

825
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,200
I n my experience, it helps. It really does.

826
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,000
But only if you're ready.

827
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,640
It's kind of weird, you know.

828
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,840
Like it wasn't really happening to me.

829
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,200
Like I was watching it from above.

830
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,320
Sometimes when you can't physically
escape from a situation

831
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,080
where you feel frightened or threatened

832
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,920
you find a way to remove or distance
yourself psychologically.

833
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,360
It's a way of protecting yourself.

834
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,880
Does that make sense?

835
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,200
Still have ten minutes.

836
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,520
Yeah, well. I 'Il see you later.

837
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,960
Chicago has a very strong sense of history.

838
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,240
Kinda like when they bought Marshall
Fields, turned it into a Macy's.

839
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,000
They lost half their client base.

840
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,880
It's a fine line. You want a fresh look

841
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,680
but you don't want to alienate your loyal customers.

842
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,120
We loved what you did with A & A

843
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,760
particularly in the tween market.

844
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,280
Well, that was mostly Will's work here.

845
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,800
Well, I don't know if that's true

846
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,280
but I'm very happy to take the credit.

847
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,840
Rebecca?

848
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,120
Becky.

849
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:02,920
Jerry?

850
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,840
Yeah.

851
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,240
Hi, Jerry.

852
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,800
Look at you. You're gorgeous.

853
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,720
You really think so?

854
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,360
Yeah. Can't believe it's you.

855
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,920
Did you bring your stuff?

856
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,920
Uh--

857
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,560
Fuck!

858
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,880
Hey! Hey! Stop! FBI!

859
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,800
Hey, get that guy!

860
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,720
Go, guys, get him, get him! Come on!

861
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,560
Hey!

862
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,200
Actually, there's a lot of similarities

863
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,240
between your company and Academic Appeal.

864
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,880
It's just you have a much more
sophisticated client base.

865
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,560
Everybody wants to broaden their consumer appeal

866
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,320
especially in the tween market.

867
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,240
I mean, it's like the Holy Grail of--

868
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,560
Sorry, would you just excuse me a minute?

869
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,080
Look, I'm really sorry, Will.

870
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,600
So what made you think he was our guy?

871
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,200
The program he was running to scatter his I P address

872
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,720
the chat rooms he used.

873
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,920
Mostly, Will, it was his conversation.

874
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,760
It was the way he spoke.

875
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,520
It was very similar to the way Charlie chatted.

876
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,560
How do you know that?

877
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,720
I was able to get transcripts of
two months worth of I M chats

878
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,160
between him and your daughter from Teen Chat.

879
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,160
You're kidding.

880
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,800
No. I'm not.

881
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,880
So when can I see them?

882
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,280
You can't, Will.

883
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,080
It's an ongoing investigation.

884
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,880
I'd completely lose Annie's trust.

885
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,680
Now, I do have some good news.

886
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,480
The lab was able to extract enough DNA for a profile.

887
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,360
We're gonna run it through CODIS
, the national database

888
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,320
and if there's a hit we should know

889
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
within a week or two at the most.

890
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,920
Hey, I 'Il be right back. I gotta call in.

891
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,760
Lynn.

892
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,440
Will, what are you doing here?

893
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,680
I just came from seeing Tate.

894
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,040
What's wrong?

895
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,000
You're not gonna believe this.

896
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,120
What? What is this?

897
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,560
Read it.

898
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,600
What is it?

899
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,240
Just read it.

900
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,840
"I can't stop thinking about it."

901
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,600
"You inside me. I get wet when I picture it."

902
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,920
Okay, stop.

903
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,920
Our daughter wrote this.

904
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Annie.

905
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,000
"How big are you? I bet you taste good."

906
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,280
Will, stop it.

907
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,440
"I wanna see it right now."

908
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,280
Stop it, Jesus God!

909
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,360
I mean, she's 14. Where the hell did she learn this?

910
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,280
She's 14, she didn't make this happen!

911
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,080
Yeah, but we're gonna have to talk to her about this.

912
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,760
- You are not gonna talk to her.
- But look at it!

913
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,400
Our daughter sounds like a fucking porn star!

914
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,640
You cannot confront her about this.

915
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,000
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.

916
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,640
I swear to God, I'm gonna find

917
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,480
this animal and I'm gonna fucking kill him!

918
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,600
Stop it!

919
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,480
Oh, my God. You're acting crazy, Will.

920
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,920
No, you're not gonna-- You're not gonna read this.

921
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,880
Just leave it alone. Give it to me.

922
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,400
I 'Il see you tonight.

923
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,160
Now I need you to bring
that back to me right now, Will.

924
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,880
I 'Il get it back to you tomorrow.

925
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,760
You do know it's a federal crime, right?

926
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,240
I just think I have a right to know

927
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,120
who my daughter's talking to.

928
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,040
No, no, no. You are interfering with the investigation.

929
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,240
You've betrayed your daughter's trust to me.

930
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,880
She doesn't need to know.

931
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,680
You're not letting me do my job, M r. Cameron.

932
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,240
I need you to bring them back to me right now, Will.

933
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,800
Yeah, I will. I 'Il get it back to you.

934
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,160
Right--

935
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,440
Oh, you son of a bitch.

936
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,960
Hey, stranger.

937
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,800
This is something, huh?

938
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,240
Oh, yeah, it's great. I feel 80.

939
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,280
Mojito?

940
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,760
I'm fine, thanks.

941
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,680
Hey, great party, man.

942
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,320
Will, come here!

943
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,840
Will. Are you all right?

944
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,520
No, I'm, I'm, I'm just feeling, I'm--

945
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,040
S-- Sorry.

946
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,680
Will? Will!

947
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,840
I heard the door.

948
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,040
That was me.

949
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,000
I, I couldn't sleep. I took a drive.

950
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,920
Well, you scared me.

951
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,400
Will, you scared me.

952
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,920
Sorry.

953
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,840
All right, so, are you coming up?

954
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,560
In a bit.

955
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,960
What are you doing?

956
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,400
Nothing.

957
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,080
Is this you?

958
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,120
Are you, are you Sad Little Girl?

959
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,480
What are you doing?

960
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,680
You're posing as a teenage girl

961
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,360
to chat with men on line, seriously?

962
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,920
That's what they do. They showed me.

963
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,320
Oh, my God.

964
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,840
It's a way of drawing them out.

965
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,200
Good night.

966
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:55,840
I spoke to Pete today.

967
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,800
He's coming home for Halloween.

968
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,720
Well, he said he would
try. He's got a lot of work.

969
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,200
But, and he sounds good. Happy.

970
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,600
You didn't tell him, did you?

971
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,680
No. But I--

972
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,840
Don't, okay?

973
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,080
Oh, about what? What?

974
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,160
Remember what we talked about upstairs, sweetie

975
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,680
about Annie being hurt?

976
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,920
I'm serious, okay?

977
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,480
Okay.

978
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,840
How 'bout we go to the movies this weekend?

979
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,640
Is there anything you wanna see?

980
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,960
Nothing you'd be interested in.

981
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,000
Well, try me. I may surprise you.

982
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,120
Yeah, right.

983
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,440
What does that mean?

984
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,560
Why are you being so mean to me? What did I do?

985
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,720
I'm not being mean.

986
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,160
Katie, am I being mean?

987
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,600
No.

988
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,840
How 'bout we go on a bike ride this weekend?

989
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,600
Well, yeah. Uh, can we also go along the lake?

990
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,320
Yeah. And we can go to that
favorite rock that you like.

991
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,920
Cool.

992
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,840
Great.

993
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,000
You know, you don't have to do this, honey.

994
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,560
Yeah, I know.

995
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,480
Well, call me if you need anything, okay?

996
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,280
Honey? Give me a kiss.

997
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,760
I love you.

998
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,560
See you later.

999
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,680
Okay.

1000
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:32,720
You're gonna have to talk to me sometime.

1001
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,040
I'm really sorry, Annie, okay?

1002
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,720
I didn't know what else to do.

1003
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,880
Annie?

1004
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,920
You're sorry?

1005
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,240
Yeah.

1006
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,920
Do you realize what you did?

1007
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,880
You fucked up everything.

1008
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,000
Charlie, my parents, everything.

1009
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,240
I was scared, okay?

1010
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,080
No. It's not okay.

1011
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,040
I kept every secret of yours.

1012
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:57,400
Annie, you're my best friend and
I was worried about you.

1013
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,080
"Was." I was your best friend.

1014
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,800
Do me a favor and never talk to me again.

1015
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,640
Annie.

1016
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,840
Annie!

1017
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,080
That was fucking embarrassing
at the big launch party.

1018
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,880
Oh, yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

1019
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,360
It was just some personal stuff. It was nothing.

1020
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,200
You're sure?

1021
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,040
Because you've been kind of M IA around here lately.

1022
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,400
There just could not be a worse time to be distracted

1023
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,080
while I really need your head in the game.

1024
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,040
What, you don't think I'm giving a 100 %, Coach?

1025
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,240
Well, you tell me. I put this on your desk a week ago.

1026
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,960
Mel's been waiting since Monday
for you to sign off on this.

1027
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,960
Well, tell him, then, fine. Run with it.

1028
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,120
You haven't even looked at it, have you?

1029
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,600
What the hell's going on?

1030
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,560
It's Annie.

1031
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,600
She was sexually assaulted.

1032
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,040
What?

1033
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,000
Oh, my God.

1034
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,960
I had no idea, Will.

1035
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:05,240
She's fine. I mean, she wasn't, but she's okay.

1036
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,040
They catch the guy?

1037
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,800
They're looking for him.

1038
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,160
They started with the crime scene in the motel.

1039
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,640
Jesus. She was kidnapped?

1040
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,400
No, she-- She sort of knew the guy.

1041
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,800
I-- I don't understand.

1042
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,440
It was someone she met online

1043
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,040
someone she'd been talking to for a while.

1044
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,920
Oh, I thought you meant she was
like attacked, you know. I--

1045
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,720
You scared the shit out of me.

1046
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,160
She was raped.

1047
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,080
She's 14. The guy's in his 30s.

1048
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,680
I know, I know. It's just that I was picturing--

1049
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,400
Well, you don't wanna know what I was picturing.

1050
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,840
Could have been much worse.

1051
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,880
Hey, can I come in?

1052
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,760
I guess. What's up?

1053
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,720
How was school?

1054
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,080
Okay.

1055
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,160
Was it weird seeing your friends again?

1056
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,120
It was fine, Dad.

1057
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,360
Did you see Gail today?

1058
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,680
No, tomorrow.

1059
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,080
How, how's that going?

1060
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,040
Great. I'm cured.

1061
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,280
Still no contact from "Charlie"?

1062
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,440
I hate when you do that.

1063
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,680
Say his name like that.

1064
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,840
It's not his real name, is it?

1065
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,160
What do you want, Dad?

1066
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,360
Has there been any contact?

1067
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,320
No.

1068
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,160
None at all?

1069
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,640
What, you don't believe me?

1070
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,120
You wanna check my phone?

1071
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,120
Would you have a problem with that?

1072
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,480
Yeah, I would.

1073
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:48,800
Why, if there's nothing to hide

1074
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,840
why would that be a problem?

1075
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,440
You're unbelievable.

1076
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,560
What?

1077
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,680
Take it. What's your problem?

1078
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,080
What is my problem? My problem
is you lied to me, sweetheart.

1079
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,120
From the second that you knew he wasn't
15, you should have told me

1080
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,960
and you didn't. You lied.

1081
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,440
Why didn't you come and talk to me or your mother

1082
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,200
and say what was going on?

1083
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,240
When you found out for the first time, what--

1084
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,000
What were you thinking?

1085
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,720
You didn't know then that something was wrong?

1086
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,720
When you, you met him in the mall
and saw him for the first time

1087
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,400
what do you do, you don't call
me? You don't run away?

1088
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,920
You get in a car with him? It's like rule number one.

1089
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You know, I'm trying to understa--

1090
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,080
Please just leave me alone.

1091
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,560
But talk to me. I--

1092
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,600
You're just pissed you didn't know.

1093
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,200
No, that's not--

1094
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,720
No, everything would've been fine

1095
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,480
if everyone would've just chilled out.

1096
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,720
- What are you talking about?
- Charlie and me.

1097
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,840
Are you out of your mind?

1098
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,920
You're the crazy one!

1099
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,280
Checking my phone,

1100
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,680
bringing out sickos on the web.

1101
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,760
I'm trying to find the scumbag!

1102
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,960
He's not like that!

1103
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,760
You don't even know him!

1104
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,600
My God, you're protecting him. The guy raped you.

1105
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,920
And you're protecting him.

1106
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,680
He didn't rape me!

1107
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,880
Get out, get out of my fucking room right now!

1108
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,600
I hate you. Get out!

1109
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,440
Get out!

1110
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,600
Get out of my room!

1111
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,440
I just wanted to know how Annie's doing.

1112
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,960
You know I can't discuss her treatment
with you, M r. Cameron.

1113
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,640
I'm sorry, but this still doesn't make sense to me.

1114
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,240
She's my daughter. A minor.

1115
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,440
If she needed an appendectomy

1116
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,280
you'd need my signature for surgery, right?

1117
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,520
Therapy is different.

1118
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,080
Yeah, but this whole--

1119
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,400
None of this makes sense to me.

1120
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,440
And I'm really starting to--

1121
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,880
What's going on?

1122
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:47,080
I cannot stop thinking about it.

1123
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,560
I'm driving my car

1124
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,160
whatever, in the office, in a meeting

1125
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,240
and I think about him on top of her.

1126
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,120
The other night I had this dream. I'd got him.

1127
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,680
I was beating the life out of him.

1128
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,520
I was on top of him and I was punching him

1129
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,000
and punching him and his face was caving in

1130
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,800
there was blood going everywhere

1131
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,800
and I could actually taste it.

1132
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,560
I woke up, I found I'd actually chewed
the inside of my mouth.

1133
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,040
It's my own blood I was tasting.

1134
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,320
What if they did catch him and they put him
in jail him. How would that make you feel?

1135
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,160
Good. Relieved.

1136
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,640
Angry.

1137
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,960
Why angry?

1138
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,520
Because I'd still want to rip

1139
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,880
his fucking head off and now I couldn't.

1140
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,120
What else are you angry about?

1141
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,640
I'm angry I didn't know what was going on.

1142
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:52,960
I'm angry that Annie lied to me.

1143
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:58,160
That I didn't know the extent of her intimacy with him.

1144
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,240
That I couldn't--

1145
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,920
What?

1146
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,760
Stop it?

1147
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,520
We can't control what happens to us or our loved ones.

1148
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,320
What happens when Annie goes to college?

1149
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,560
What are you saying?

1150
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,640
People get hurt.

1151
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,200
There's only so much we can do

1152
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,520
to protect ourselves, our children.

1153
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,960
The only thing we can do

1154
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,600
is we can be there for each other

1155
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,640
when we do fall down, to pick each other up.

1156
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,840
Ugh!

1157
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,520
Can I help you with anything today, sir?

1158
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,960
Hey, Pop!

1159
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,240
Hey.

1160
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,520
You look older.

1161
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,840
It's only been six weeks, smart ass.

1162
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,440
Yeah, still, maybe it's, uh

1163
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,120
like Einstein's special relativity.

1164
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,320
You know, six weeks to me, five years to you.

1165
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,680
I think I preferred you with
a high school education.

1166
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:08,280
Dude. No way. I don't
want you to hurt yourself.

1167
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,320
So how was the ride in?

1168
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,680
Okay.

1169
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,120
Okay. I'm still a little, ech.

1170
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,440
Oh. Big night, eh?

1171
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,440
I was off my face, wasn't I?

1172
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,000
Come here.

1173
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,360
Jesus, Pop. What is it?

1174
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,680
Where are the kids?

1175
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,120
Come on, kids. Hurry
up, the food's gonna be cold.

1176
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,960
All right, ready?

1177
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,480
Hey!

1178
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,560
It's fantastic.

1179
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,240
Look at the toilet seat cover.

1180
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,080
It was her idea.

1181
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,560
Let me help you off with your flippers so you can eat.

1182
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:55,000
No, Mom, that's cheating.

1183
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,160
That's not a very scary mask, Pete.

1184
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,320
It is to Grandpa.

1185
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,360
Don't get me started.

1186
01:12:58,440 --> 01:12:59,960
He's a socialist.

1187
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,520
Oh, Cal, now come on.

1188
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,600
No costume, Annie?

1189
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,560
This is my costume.

1190
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,240
You're not supposed to wear a penguin

1191
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,680
you're supposed to be a penguin.

1192
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,360
Do you want me to come or not?

1193
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,920
Okay. I guess you can come.

1194
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,080
I'm sorry I didn't get to email much.

1195
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,560
You know, things have been really crazy.

1196
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:19,560
It's no big deal.

1197
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,040
No. No, I should have called more. Checked in a bit.

1198
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,840
You know I love you, right? Right?

1199
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,680
Did you kids ever hear the story

1200
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,640
about when Grandpa and I met on Halloween?

1201
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,360
He asked me to take a picture of him

1202
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,280
next to this statue of a werewolf.

1203
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,960
They've all heard the story, Susan.

1204
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,880
No, no, we haven't.

1205
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,880
Okay, good.

1206
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,360
So, he goes up

1207
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,920
and he stands right under it

1208
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,280
trying to impress me, of course.

1209
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,640
But it turns out it's just a guy in a costume, right, hon?

1210
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,720
And he grabs Grandpa.

1211
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,080
And Grandpa starts screamin' like a girl.

1212
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,200
- I did not.
-  You did.

1213
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,080
Annie, honey. Is that corn cold?

1214
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,200
Because I could heat it up for you, sweetie.

1215
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,240
M m. It's fine.

1216
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,280
Annie, you have to try the sweet
potatoes. They are amazing.

1217
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,920
Oh, they are, sweetheart, they are. Just,
just have a little. You'll love 'em.

1218
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,480
You guys wanna cut my steak, too?

1219
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,360
So, I hear you got a girl, Pete.

1220
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,640
What? No. No, God, no.

1221
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,640
No, it's just this girl I met at a mixer.

1222
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,560
Yeah, she's a DG.

1223
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,240
But we're not-- you know, we're just friends.

1224
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,440
She's super athletic though. She
plays tennis and lacrosse.

1225
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,240
You'd really like her.

1226
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,200
Cool.

1227
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,280
But, you know, she's, she's not
my girlfriend or anything.

1228
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,640
We just started hanging out.

1229
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,360
Yeah.

1230
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,080
Peter, it's okay for you to have a girlfriend.

1231
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,000
It's pretty normal. Right, Dad?

1232
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,080
I'm not sure I understand.

1233
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,480
You don't understand?

1234
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,760
Have you guys had sex yet?

1235
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,800
Annie.

1236
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,600
Was she good?

1237
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,440
That's enough.

1238
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,000
What?

1239
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:07,560
You can tell everybody about my life

1240
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:13,200
about me having sex and who
with, but I can't ask him?

1241
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:16,440
I asked you not to tell him.

1242
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,480
That's the only thing I asked.

1243
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,080
Thank you, Dad.

1244
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:27,720
I hope you guys have an awesome time.

1245
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,680
Honey, please, please stay.

1246
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,160
No. No. Let me go.

1247
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,160
Okay. Good news.

1248
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,680
We ran the DNA from his shirt

1249
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,440
through the national database.

1250
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,440
And we actually found a match.

1251
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,920
That's, that's incredible.

1252
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,520
So what happens now? You arrest him?

1253
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,080
It's not that easy.

1254
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,240
While the DNA is on the database

1255
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,640
it's still a John Doe. We don't know who it belongs to.

1256
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,080
I don't understand.

1257
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:55,680
Well, there were other cases, Will

1258
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,760
three of them, where rapes were reported.

1259
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,360
We were able to recover genetic material

1260
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,040
from the victim and the crime scene.

1261
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,080
The DNA profile is the same.

1262
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,720
It's just that we don't know who it belongs to.

1263
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,720
So he's done this before.

1264
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,000
- Yes, he has.
-  Oh, my God.

1265
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,680
Well, he's had other girlfriends before. I told you that.

1266
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,200
These weren't girlfriends, Annie.

1267
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,480
These were minors who reported a rape.

1268
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,760
Well, DNA can be wrong.

1269
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,320
The odds of these four samples not
coming from the same person

1270
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,040
are in the hundreds of millions. It's the same guy.

1271
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,640
Now, look. We, uh, we don't normally do this.

1272
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,360
We're very careful with victim information.

1273
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,000
But I'm hoping there might be some kind

1274
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,400
of connection between all four of you girls.

1275
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,320
Maybe you went to the same camp together

1276
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,240
you shopped at the same mall.

1277
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,960
I can't give you their names but I was hoping that

1278
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,320
you might take a look at their pictures.

1279
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,800
Wait a minute. I don't
know if this is a good idea.

1280
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,280
No, no. I want, I want to. Yeah.

1281
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,440
All right, Annie, do you know this girl?

1282
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,200
She's from Cleveland.

1283
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,640
She's fifteen years old.

1284
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,840
No.

1285
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,240
No? Okay.

1286
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,760
This is the M ilwaukee case.

1287
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,760
This photo was taken about a year ago.

1288
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,920
She's fourteen.

1289
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,880
Now, this girl was assaulted in
St. Louis seven months ago.

1290
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:17,120
She's twelve.

1291
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,760
Oh, my God.

1292
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,000
I don't, I don't know them.

1293
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,320
Okay. It's okay. You did a good job.

1294
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,520
Thank you, Annie.

1295
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,160
Honey.

1296
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,520
No. I'm fine. I just need a second.

1297
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,800
So you're telling me the FB I's been
chasing this guy for years?

1298
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,280
It looks that way, yeah.

1299
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,720
Look, on the upside, Will there's
more information for us.

1300
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,600
There's more evidence for us.

1301
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,800
The investigation is seeing a real breakthrough.

1302
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,320
I bet the agent in St. Louis said the same thing

1303
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,040
to some family about seven months ago.

1304
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,640
I understand your frustration, Will, I do

1305
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,080
but I'm working as hard as I can for Annie.

1306
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,280
Yeah, but it's not enough, is it?

1307
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,360
I mean, that sick fuck is still out
there grooming other girls, right?

1308
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,440
Will, I'm doing all I can. I'm sorry
you don't see it that way.

1309
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,480
Annie? Annie!

1310
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,920
Did she come down here?

1311
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,600
You okay?

1312
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,840
You want something to drink? Water?

1313
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,400
There were other girls.

1314
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,960
What other girls? Tell me what you mean.

1315
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,280
Charlie. He had other girls.

1316
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,720
Three of them. Like me.

1317
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,400
There were other victims, you mean?

1318
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,120
He said that I was special.

1319
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:40,360
That I was the only one for him.

1320
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,480
But if there are other girls--

1321
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,120
They weren't even-- They weren't even that pretty!

1322
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,120
Tell me why it matters.

1323
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,320
No. No. No.

1324
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,960
Why does that matter?

1325
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:54,440
Because they were just like me.

1326
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:59,040
He told me, he said I was pretty.

1327
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,000
What's wrong with me?

1328
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,200
Why does it mean that something's wrong with you?

1329
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,680
If he lied to me the way he lied to those
other girls, he never loved me.

1330
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,640
He lied so he could have sex with me.

1331
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,160
What, Annie?

1332
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,160
Oh, my God.

1333
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,800
He raped me.

1334
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,640
He, he raped me.

1335
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:38,120
How could I have been so stupid?

1336
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,760
All he wanted-- My God.

1337
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,440
All he wanted was--

1338
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,760
God, I'm so sorry.

1339
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,880
Oh, God. She's finally asleep.

1340
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,880
This guy is one sick fuck.

1341
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,680
Will, I'm so worried about her. I've
never seen her like this. I'm just--

1342
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,360
He's just destroyed her.

1343
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,520
He sent her a picture of his dick.

1344
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,520
Please stop looking at this shit!

1345
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,080
What are you doing?

1346
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,160
What the f-- What are you doing?

1347
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:50,120
Why are you down here when you
should be up there with her?

1348
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,160
You think finding this guy is more important

1349
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,200
that it's gonna make her better? Do you think that--

1350
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,240
Well, it might. Or it might save
some other poor fucking girl.

1351
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,360
I want this guy out of my house.
I want him out of my house!

1352
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,480
You want me to go up there
and talk to her? I've tried.

1353
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,840
She won't fucking talk to me!

1354
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,040
Shut up!

1355
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,080
She finally fell asleep.

1356
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:13,120
You'd fucking know that if you were up there with her.

1357
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,200
It's Annie. It's Annie.

1358
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:20,560
She is in pain. She needs you and you're just--

1359
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,720
You're sitting there doing nothing!

1360
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,720
All right.

1361
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,280
Here, here you go.

1362
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,840
Cameron!

1363
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,960
Look, Vicki's sick. She can't play today.

1364
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,480
You're gonna start in her place.

1365
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,680
I don't know, Coach. I--

1366
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,360
We need you, Annie.

1367
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,160
Can I count on you?

1368
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,600
Yeah.

1369
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,120
That's the spirit.

1370
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,320
At the net.

1371
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,560
Annie! Harder!

1372
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,760
Hey, guys. Hi, Lynn.

1373
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,760
Hey.

1374
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,960
You having fun? Yeah?

1375
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,760
Dig in!

1376
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,320
Nice set!

1377
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,720
Block it!

1378
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,240
You having a good time?

1379
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,040
Huh?

1380
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,520
You enjoying this, looking at all the young girls?

1381
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,520
What's that?

1382
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,360
You sick fuck!

1383
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,320
I'll kill ya! You fucking shit.

1384
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,240
You sick fucking cunt! I'll kill ya!

1385
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,680
Oh, my God!

1386
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,080
Dad, are you okay?

1387
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,720
What happened?

1388
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,160
What are you doing?

1389
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,840
I'm calling the police.

1390
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,840
Hey, hey, no, no, there's no need

1391
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,520
it's, it's just a misunderstanding.

1392
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,800
Dad, you're hurt.

1393
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:42,960
No, no. Pumpkin, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm sorry if I scared you, I'm okay.

1394
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,680
- Are you sure?
-  Absolutely.

1395
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,320
It's just a misunderstanding, that's all.

1396
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,000
Okay, can we get the game going
again, please?

1397
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,080
How could you do that to me?

1398
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,440
I'm really sorry.

1399
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,720
You're sorry? Gee, Dad, thanks.

1400
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,680
That makes everything so much better.

1401
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,480
I lost my temper. I don't know
what else to say. I'm sorry.

1402
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,160
Don't you get it? There's nothing anybody can say.

1403
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,440
My life is ruined.

1404
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,440
No, it's not ruined.

1405
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,600
We're going through a tough time
but your life's not ruined.

1406
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:19,400
We're going through a tough time?

1407
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,240
We didn't get raped.

1408
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,400
We're not the laughingstock of New Trier. I am!

1409
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,360
I got raped. Not you!

1410
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,360
I know that.

1411
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,120
Nothing's ever gonna be the same. I know that.

1412
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:40,600
But, please, can you please stop reminding
me of it every second?

1413
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,440
Annie, wait! I'm so sorry.

1414
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,240
For what? It's not your
fault my dad's a psycho.

1415
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,640
What? No. I swear to God, I had nothing to do with it.

1416
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,960
Wait, what are you talking about?

1417
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,840
The I nternet thing.

1418
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,760
What?

1419
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,200
Oh, uh--

1420
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,680
Annie!

1421
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,080
Annie!

1422
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,360
Cameron.

1423
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,040
Oh, my God.

1424
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,360
My God.

1425
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,400
Hello?

1426
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,760
Lynn?

1427
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:14,160
Hello?

1428
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:16,480
Will, where have
you been? I've been calling you.

1429
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,800
What, what do you mean? I'm
, I'm here. Where are you?

1430
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,000
On my way. Is, is Annie there?

1431
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,880
No, I don't, why?

1432
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,960
Just-- Brittany called me. Something's happened.

1433
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,400
Is she there?

1434
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,760
What? Annie? What, what happened?

1435
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,120
I-- don't-- just go check, please! Call me back.

1436
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,240
Annie!

1437
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:39,880
Annie.

1438
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:42,960
Annie, are you in there?

1439
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,440
Annie, open this door!

1440
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,880
Annie!

1441
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,200
Shit.

1442
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,080
Will?

1443
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,880
Call an ambulance!

1444
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,960
How many pills have you taken?

1445
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,320
I'm not really--

1446
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,280
Call an ambulance!

1447
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,480
Hello?

1448
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,320
Open your mouth.

1449
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,880
Open your mouth, sweetheart.

1450
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:12,920
We need, please--

1451
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,640
She's taken too many pills?

1452
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:16,640
Yeah. Come on.

1453
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:18,160
It's all right.

1454
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,720
She asleep?

1455
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,480
I'm through talking.

1456
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,520
Brittany's spending the night.

1457
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,800
Good night.

1458
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,240
Dad?

1459
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,640
Dad.

1460
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,680
Are you okay?

1461
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,520
You remember the first time you went in the pool?

1462
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,000
What?

1463
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:08,240
You probably don't. You were two.

1464
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:12,120
Peter was scared to death the first time he went in.

1465
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:16,520
He screamed and cried so much, he didn't stop.

1466
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,240
He was fine in the bath, but pool...

1467
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,800
Not you.

1468
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,640
You were fearless.

1469
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,120
I remember.

1470
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,040
You were amazing.

1471
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:39,360
Came in with me and almost immediately
started laughing

1472
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,320
and playing and splashing around.

1473
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:47,080
You just had this confidence.

1474
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,320
It wasn't just swimming.

1475
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,800
You just had this--

1476
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:54,520
trust--in things, people, the world.

1477
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,640
It was who you were.

1478
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,600
No fear.

1479
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:08,800
God, I loved that.

1480
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,120
I was so proud of it.

1481
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,440
I envied it.

1482
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,640
And I was so afraid that you'd lose it as you grew up.

1483
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:23,360
That confidence. That faith.

1484
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,520
But you didn't.

1485
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,040
And then I failed you.

1486
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,440
It was my job to make sure you didn't lose it.

1487
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,040
To keep you safe.

1488
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,880
What am I if I can't protect you?

1489
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,120
And to see you lose that confidence

1490
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,800
to see you question yourself.

1491
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,600
That the idea would even occur to you

1492
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,600
to want to hurt yourself.

1493
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,480
Or for you to think for one minute

1494
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,960
that you weren't as beautiful--

1495
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,480
I don't know if you can ever forgive me, Annie.

1496
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:32,040
I really don't know if you should.

1497
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,880
But I'm sorry.

1498
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:38,440
I'm so sorry.

1499
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,080
Dad. Daddy.

1500
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,880
I love you so much.

1501
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,880
Dad.

1502
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,360
Dad. Come on. How much longer?

1503
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,760
We just got here, buddy.

1504
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,640
Let's at least pick up some stuff for the park. Okay?

1505
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,280
What a day.

1506
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,520
Susanna. Grab some apples, will ya?

1507
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,760
Hey, Dad. Can I do it for awhile?

1508
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:25,360
Okay. Be careful, all right, buddy?

1509
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,200
Well, hello. How do I look?

1510
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,600
Goofy.

1511
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,200
Yeah. Probably so.

1512
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,000
Mr. Weston!

1513
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,360
Hey, Tyler, how's it going?

1514
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,440
I'm good. How about yourself?

1515
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,920
I'm good.

1516
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,280
Uh, Mom, Dad, this is M r. Weston.

1517
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,520
Hey, very nice to meet you.

1518
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,920
He's my physics teacher.

1519
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,680
Pleasure, pleasure. Hey, Susanna.

1520
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:46,560
One of my students, Tyler.

1521
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,000
Oh. Hi, Tyler. I'm Susanna. Nice to meet you.

1522
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,120
My wife, Susanna.

1523
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,080
And I'm Jennifer.

1524

So, great day, huh?

It is gorgeous.

1531
