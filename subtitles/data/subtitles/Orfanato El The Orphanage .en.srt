1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,940
Run you crook!

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,470
Above, Laura!

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,897
Orphanage "Good Shepherd"
Tell me.

4
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,069
It's all prepared.

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,579
She is now playing.
Even he knows nothing.

6
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,052
Laura will be very happy
In his new home.

7
00:00:36,353 --> 00:00:40,019
Do not worry.
Until this afternoon.

8
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:09,097
Your friends are going to throw you
Much less, Laura.

9
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:16,944
Do you crook!

10
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:24,629
Mamaaaaaaa!

11
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,925
Mamaaaaaaa!

12
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,069
Mamaaaaaa!

13
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,049
Mamaaaaaaaa!

14
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:36,644
Mamaaaaaaaaaaa!

15
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,484
-- And I go,
I am coming to me.

16
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:45,645
Mamaaaaaaaa!

17
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:47,830
-- Since going.

18
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:06,912
-- Simon.

19
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:12,063
-- Are outside, listening.

20
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,320
-- Go to sleep.

21
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:21,535
Sorry, honey, no.

22
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,800
Sure. Watson and Pepe
Have fallen

23
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,200
... Playing until very late,

24
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:29,556
And now they can not
Go right?

25
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:32,314
... Come to the inside.

26
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:34,278
Let's see, the son ....

27
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:37,548
Do not you think that you are a bit
Greater for these things?

28
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:41,390
-- When you lived here
Girl, had we not afraid?

29
00:03:41,582 --> 00:03:43,546
-- No child. It was impossible
Be afraid in this house,

30
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,747
If we were a bunch
In the room.

31
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:47,201
And the lighthouse us
Lit up all night.

32
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:48,502
-- Was there a lighthouse?

33
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,430
-- And still, what happens
That is not working now, son.

34
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:53,034
Tomorrow when alight
To the beach, you teach.

35
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,435
-- And why not
Faro works?

36
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,075
-- Will I guards
A secret?

37
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,376
-- Yes.

38
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,210
-- In fact, if it works.
But light is invisible

39
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:08,311
And we took care of all the dangers.

40
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,329
-- How the light that is invisible?

41
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,060
-- Look, sees a
Thing, see.

42
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:15,919
Look toward the window.
It out.

43
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,675
There, eh. No.
You move.

44
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:29,667
Okay?

45
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,225
What?
Have you seen?

46
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,481
-- The children who go to these come,

47
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,782
Why can not
Stay at home?

48
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,537
-- Honey, they are
Very special children,

49
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,738
Who need them
Care a lot, a lot.

50
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,036
And they can not go and
Come every day,

51
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,537
Because they are very
Away, do I understand?

52
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,572
-- If

53
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:52,300
Can I sleep with
You tonight?

54
00:04:55,269 --> 00:04:57,926
-- You what you have
Morro much.

55
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:55,137
-- Is Dad is not going to come with
Us to the beach?

56
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,038
-- Do not going to go down Watson and Pepe?

57
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:58,952
-- They can not.

58
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,345
With the jaleo tonight
They have not stuck eye.

59
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,137
-- But what have nose!

60
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,287
It seems to me that you
Accounts with friends

61
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:06,488
... Only if you are interested.

62
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,218
Come on, ready,
Take the pill.

63
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,519
-- The "S" of Simon.

64
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:19,674
-- Anda, ascends to your room
And go by the bag,

65
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:21,775
... Which then will go to dad
The beach with us,

66
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,049
Okay?

67
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,846
Some of the two
Have a talk with Simon.

68
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:30,368
I refer to the issue of
Friends invisible.

69
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,499
-- That is normal,
Do not worry.

70
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,112
He was alone and bored.

71
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:36,843
And watch where
Reach the other children,

72
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,244
Forget the
Friends invisible.

73
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,253
Everything is going to come out very well.

74
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,669
We are going to mount a
Super residence.

75
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:57,374
I am very happy
We are here together.

76
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,059
-- Pirate!

77
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,225
-- Pirate.

78
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,331
-- Cave ...

79
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,518
-- Cave.

80
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,534
-- And lighthouse.

81
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:15,993
-- And lighthouse. Let's see ... Erase una
After a pirate very bad,

82
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:20,140
That hid their treasures at
A cave near a lighthouse.

83
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,541
-- And what treasures?

84
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:25,344
-- The treasures that robbed. But
To enter the cave

85
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,645
.... Do not think it was easy to enter, he ...

86
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:41,546
(Sound of the Sea)

87
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:37,744
-- Hello.

88
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:41,212
Hello.

89
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,599
Hello.

90
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,474
-- Is Simon?

91
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,270
Simon, let's go!.

92
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,363
Simon!.

93
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:26,218
-- What is your name?

94
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,577
I Simon.
Want to play?

95
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:39,444
Well, would you like to come
After playing to my house?.

96
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:44,127
-- Simon. But
What you do there?

97
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,013
-- We are playing.

98
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:47,851
-- But if Watson and Pepe not
Went down to the beach.

99
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,596
-- Not them, is another child.

100
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,406
-- Well, you say that games
Another site. That it is dangerous.

101
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,897
Come on, come on.

102
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:01,074
-- Can you come home to play?

103
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:03,974
-- Yes.

104
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,506
-- Why breathe pulling
Shell, son?

105
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,222
-- It is a path for
My friend will follow us,

106
00:10:45,523 --> 00:10:47,723
And come home to play.

107
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,038
-- Échalos in the middle of the road.

108
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:54,730
-- In this step will not need
Home for more children.

109
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:24,210
-- Hello.

110
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,272
-- Good afternoon.

111
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,549
I am sorry that I
This unannounced

112
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,546
... But I had been impossible
Locate your phone.

113
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:37,931
My name is benign Escobedo.
I am a social worker.

114
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:41,064
-- Well, I feel that there
Made the trip in vain, but

115
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,664
... Had not reached any
Interview for today.

116
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:47,720
-- Does Interview? Not. I
I am here by Simon.

117
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:55,042
-- That room! It'sa
Beautiful house.

118
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,899
-- Y. .. How gave her?

119
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,301
I grew up here. This was
A small orphanage.

120
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:04,042
I always wanted to return.

121
00:12:04,243 --> 00:12:05,983
So we did
The idea of residence

122
00:12:06,137 --> 00:12:07,446
-- Are residence?

123
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,372
-- A residence for
Disabled children.

124
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:10,786
I thought that was why.

125
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,571
-- But you need a lot of people ...

126
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:14,011
To be able to handle everything.

127
00:12:14,212 --> 00:12:16,091
-- It is not that type of residence.

128
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:19,341
With 5 or 6 children we
Would be satisfied.

129
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:22,456
-- To do otherwise, it would be very
Complicated. Right?

130
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,899
-- What I wanted
Simon count?

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,058
-- Yes. Yes, of course.

132
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:33,792
-- Yesterday I sent
His file,

133
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,041
And I thought I should visit

134
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:39,575
And introduce if
Need something.

135
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,381
Do you think so many
Reforms at home?

136
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:46,306
-- Sorry, but I do not understand very
Well the reason for his visit.

137
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,384
-- But this is information
Of long ago.

138
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,762
-- I know, but I
Have commanded everything.

139
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:01,887
There are new treatments.

140
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:03,588
This is a pilot program.

141
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:05,550
We need to make an application and

142
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,421
I thought that maybe you
Were interested.

143
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:11,104
-- My husband and
Know, is a doctor.

144
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:13,015
And we are very up to date
On progress

145
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,050
In the treatment of
Simon's disease.

146
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:17,386
And now I ask him to leave.

147
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:19,587
Simon does not know
It is adopted.

148
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:21,286
And much less anything
About his illness.

149
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,710
Besides these issues
I like to treat them ...

150
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:24,614
When my husband is at home.

151
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,063
-- Jack

152
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:53,971
-- And I go,
I am coming to me.

153
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,070
-- Who Goes there?

154
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,820
(Noise of metal falling)

155
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:41,219
Who is there?

156
00:16:58,037 --> 00:16:59,473
Carlos!
Carlos!

157
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:02,127
-- What's going on?

158
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:10,897
-- Will you machacarle head
The old with that stick?

159
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,097
Sleep tonight
With Simon.

160
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,273
If reappears by
The house, call the police.

161
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:45,759
-- Mom, Mom

162
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,360
Already I awaken?
Already I awaken?

163
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:06,567
-- You are awake now
You can raise children.

164
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,585
-- Is Wendy is getting old and dying?

165
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:18,506
-- Wendy ages, but Peter
Pan comes every year

166
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:20,457
.... To take his daughter to "Never Never."

167
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,815
-- And why Wendy
Not going with them?

168
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,088
-- Well ...

169
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:28,089
-- And if Peter Pan came to me,
You vendrías me?

170
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,628
Not. I am too old for
Go to "Never Never", son.

171
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,819
-- Do you, how old are you?

172
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,739
-- 37.

173
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,424
-- How many in
Years you will die?

174
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,883
-- Anyway ...
What question is that?

175
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:45,171
Well, I die
In much, much,

176
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:46,372
... When you and you too old.

177
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:48,690
-- I am not going to be higher.

178
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:51,325
I am not going to grow.

179
00:19:54,816 --> 00:19:55,753
-- What will you be?
How Peter Pan?

180
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,000
-- Like my new friends.

181
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:02,328
-- Now, do you have
More than one?

182
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:03,529
-- Son 6.

183
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:05,092
-- And they also
Going to grow?

184
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:06,593
-- They can not grow.

185
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:44,343
-- What are these things
Carried in their hands?

186
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,418
-- They are treasures to play.

187
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:50,307
-- Ya. Is that played between them,
Invisible friends?

188
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:52,601
-- Well, of course. You remove the treasure.

189
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,709
Something you want much
And you have to find it.

190
00:20:55,984 --> 00:20:57,707
-- That's it, that's the game.

191
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,730
Find something you have removed.

192
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,077
-- Yes. But following
Tracks.

193
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:03,282
If you find it
Grant you a wish.

194
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,083
-- Oops.

195
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,606
Y.. Do you have a treasure?

196
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:11,588
-- The currencies of mice. A
Grandfather were left in the park.

197
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:14,873
I think we are
Gold. Very valuable.

198
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:17,708
Want to see them?

199
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:26,277
Do not look yet.

200
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,264
-- Where did you get
You all this?

201
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:32,065
-- I find it.

202
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:33,670
-- And this?

203
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:38,211
-- It is the first ice that I took
After operarme of angina.

204
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:42,403
-- The currencies of mice.

205
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,582
-- Are These are the coins?

206
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:48,310
... Are your baby teeth.
Where do you find those?

207
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,853
-- Do not you realize?
They are the first clue.

208
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:52,554
There have been my coins.

209
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,079
-- Do you want us to play treasure?

210
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:58,101
-- No, the game has already begun.

211
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:01,560
You have to remember where
Save my baby teeth.

212
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:04,618
If you find my treasure,
I ask for a wish.

213
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:18,344
-- Guess which could have sand.

214
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:21,371
-- That has prepared
You, right?

215
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:24,765
In the beach?

216
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:26,645
-- No, not worth, has
To be at home.

217
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:42,607
-- And this?

218
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,543
-- The sewing!

219
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:49,573
-- Simon, wait.

220
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,061
Come on, run.
Come!

221
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:34,267
This key rings me. But
If it is the key to the kitchen!

222
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:44,908
-- My treasure!

223
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:46,395
-- Those are things dad.

224
00:23:46,507 --> 00:23:49,536
I now have the treasure!
Now I ask one wish!

225
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:51,507
-- Simon!

226
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,008
These are things
Daddy and me.

227
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:55,048
And you do not have to have
Hiding anything. Is that clear?

228
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:56,870
-- I have not been myself.
They have been.

229
00:23:58,024 --> 00:23:59,584
-- Look, do not stand
That tell lies.

230
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:00,845
-- I do not relax.

231
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:02,433
You are the liar.

232
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:04,732
You are saying that you
My mother and you are not my mother.

233
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:07,957
-- What do you mean?

234
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:09,458
-- You are not my mother.

235
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,377
-- Where did you
Drawn that?

236
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:12,778
-- My friend has told me.

237
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,011
-- Who is your friend?

238
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:15,633
-- Thomas, Thomas I
Has told the truth.

239
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,055
That I am like them.

240
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:18,726
That I do not have
Father or mother.

241
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:20,327
That I will die.

242
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,783
You are not my mother!
You are a liar!

243
00:24:39,218 --> 00:24:41,244
-- We thought wait
That you were a bit

244
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:43,871
.... More higher
Talk of certain things.

245
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:46,436
-- If you have something that
You want to ask, whatever ...

246
00:24:48,832 --> 00:24:52,307
-- What of the Magi,
Will also is a lie?

247
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:57,402
-- Simon Watch: Escuchaste what mom
Was talking to this lady,

248
00:24:57,678 --> 00:24:59,712
Dressed what was in the envelope
And we invented the game

249
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:02,406
Because they were afraid to ask
You'd discovered.

250
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,087
-- What if one day
I am not the volume?

251
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:07,688
-- Do not pass anything.

252
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:13,433
How long without tomármelas
Have to go to I die?

253
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:16,557
-- Many, many days. Many.
Weeks whole, right?

254
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:19,860
Look, you do not worry, because
We will take care of you,

255
00:25:20,092 --> 00:25:22,096
... You will no ill
Let alone to die.

256
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,045
All right?

257
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:51,047
Simon, low son!

258
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:07,334
Simon.

259
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,104
-- Simon, hurry up already
The children come first.

260
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,389
-- We can still download

261
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:15,917
... I have to teach you something.

262
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:17,651
-- Really? What you
That show?

263
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:19,032
-- The house of Thomas.

264
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:20,211
-- But not now, darling.

265
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,091
Tomorrow when we
Teach me alone, okay?

266
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,053
-- No.

267
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,416
-- Now may not be Simon.

268
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,317
-- Now!

269
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:27,149
-- Lower immediately
I said you!

270
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,437
-- Do not give me the win!

271
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,023
-- Slow!

272
00:26:29,224 --> 00:26:32,206
-- I said that to come
See the house of Thomas!

273
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:41,520
-- OK, but you want to get off,
Stay on board. Nobody forces you.

274
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:19,939
-- See Where is the mask?
-- Is this where you wanted?

275
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,936
Simon!

276
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:05,186
Simon!

277
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,579
Simon!

278
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,184
Honey!

279
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:28,855
Is Honey?

280
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:35,811
Simon!

281
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:20,405
Is Simon?

282
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:22,937
Simon, son.

283
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:31,659
(Shout)

284
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:57,094
(Shout)

285
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,391
Carlos!

286
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,765
But what is
Happening?

287
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:10,608
Is Honey?

288
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:16,872
Is Simon?

289
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:21,919
(Laughter children)

290
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,093
Simon!

291
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:28,966
Simon!

292
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,121
(Noise of metal falling)

293
00:30:58,671 --> 00:30:59,529
Simon!

294
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,544
Simon!

295
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,121
Simon!

296
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:15,969
Simon!

297
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,681
Simon!

298
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:20,472
Simon!

299
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:23,073
Simóoooon!

300
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,070
Simóoooon!

301
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:29,059
Simóoooon!

302
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:35,065
Simóoooon!

303
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:36,858
Cariñooooo!

304
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:38,455
Simóoooon!

305
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,607
Simóoooon!

306
00:31:41,738 --> 00:31:42,670
Lauraaaaa!

307
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:47,999
Noooooo! (Shout)

308
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:50,858
Simon!

309
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,906
Simóoooon!

310
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:01,029
Noooooo! Simóoooon!

311
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:03,498
Simóoooon!

312
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:05,949
-- It's there, Carlos!

313
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:07,672
-- That there is nobody, Laura.

314
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:10,228
I am saying that you
Hence there is nobody.

315
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,683
We could not be more here.

316
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,123
-- That is my son.
Sim -...!

317
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,497
Carlos is here.
He spoke with police

318
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:53,624
And now wants to talk with you,

319
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,543
If you feel forces.

320
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:04,502
-- How are you?

321
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,531
It is not in the cave.

322
00:33:09,598 --> 00:33:11,038
-- But I saw someone, Carlos.

323
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,079
-- He had to imaginárselo,
Excitement of the moment.

324
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:17,810
Rest assured,
His son was not there.

325
00:33:19,937 --> 00:33:21,094
My name is Pilar.

326
00:33:22,444 --> 00:33:24,564
I know that it is
Going wrong. But ...

327
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:26,185
I want to know
We are going to do

328
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,287
Everything in
Our hands

329
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:30,022
To locate his son,
As soon as possible.

330
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:33,177
-- Pilar is a psychologist.
It cooperates with the police.

331
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,904
They are working hard
To find Simon.

332
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:40,293
-- I would like to ask
Some things.

333
00:33:40,494 --> 00:33:44,183
Her husband told me
Regard to the adoption

334
00:33:44,418 --> 00:33:45,579
And the illness of his son.

335
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:47,749
Being Simon adopted ...

336
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,950
There are possibilities
We can not rule out.

337
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,193
-- Like what?

338
00:33:53,394 --> 00:33:55,854
-- A possible abduction by
Some biological relative.

339
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:00,098
I understand that
Discovered the other night

340
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:01,327
... A woman loitering around your house.

341
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,794
-- Benign Escobedo.
From Social Affairs.

342
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:06,560
She appeared at home a few days ago.

343
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,538
-- There is no woman
Social Services under that name.

344
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,343
Could you describe that woman?

345
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:22,034
-- I was about 70 years,
White hair, blue eyes,

346
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:25,035
... And a very thick glasses.

347
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:30,025
-- Please be assured that
Let's give this woman.

348
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,321
He does not fit any doubt.

349
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,347
-- Who is going to leave to care for her son,

350
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:03,702
... If I am not able to take care of or mine?

351
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:10,841
-- We do one thing.

352
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,942
Stay with medal
San Antonio from my grandmother.

353
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,538
You know that I love you.

354
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,039
It is a sort of
Good luck charm.

355
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:20,549
-- But if you do not think
In these things.

356
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,593
-- For the same reason. Contigo
Going to be much stronger.

357
00:35:24,046 --> 00:35:25,872
It is not a gift, eh.
It is a loan.

358
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:29,198
When again with
Simon, I am the return.

359
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,865
(Shout)

360
00:36:48,877 --> 00:36:49,769
Is Carlos?

361
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,170
(Strike a strong metal)

362
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:00,019
Carlos!

(Laura): My son has disappeared
6 months ago. His name is Simon.

374
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:21,797
The city is empapelada
Poster.

375
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,688
Probably so
Seen his photograph.

376
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,824
We have tried everything.
Not a clue.

377
00:38:27,825 --> 00:38:30,929
Neither the lower track.

378
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:43,530
My son had some friends
Playing with imaginary

379
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:51,363
And never wanted to give them importance.

380
00:38:58,174 --> 00:39:00,565
But I have the feeling
They are at home.

381
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:12,403
-- I saw my daughter. One year
After his death.

382
00:39:18,345 --> 00:39:20,238
It was night, and
We were sleeping.

383
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:28,971
I woke up. And without knowing
Why I went to her room.

384
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:37,704
And there she was.

385
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:44,657
Smiling and calm.

386
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:52,878
And I think that was
His way of saying:

387
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,045
I am fine. I am safe.

388
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,853
Do not suffer more for me.

389
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:05,340
-- It is not strange feeling
Somehow

390
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:08,054
The presence of a loved one

391
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:09,568
After his death.

392
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:12,585
Any of those
We are in this group of mourning

393
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,860
They can
Similar stories.

394
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:31,350
-- I am not being understanding.

395
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,518
My son is not dead.

396
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,519
We have led
His friends invisible.

397
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,585
I myself saw the one
Day he disappeared.

398
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:40,091
She was in the house.

399
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:43,092
And llegaré where needed

400
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:46,077
.... To recover
My son. I am not mad.

401
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:52,173
Believe me.
I know what I see.

402
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:51,858
(Sound horn)

403
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:01,083
-- It is!
It is the woman who was at home.

404
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:04,202
Are Benign?

405
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:10,061
(Shout)

406
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:16,436
(Gritos)

407
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:30,126
Señooooor!

408
00:43:51,246 --> 00:43:53,217
-- We have been in
Benign house,

409
00:43:53,418 --> 00:43:55,488
We found
Photographs

410
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:56,929
And old Super 8 movies.

411
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,924
I would like them echase a glance.

412
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:03,378
Does any of these faces
He is familiar?

413
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,794
-- This is Antonia, the school's director

414
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,444
And some are children of the orphanage.

415
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:09,818
They were my friends.

416
00:44:10,742 --> 00:44:13,979
This is Martin. He liked
Martin known to him.

417
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,198
Rita, Victor. I think this
Child was named Guillermo.

418
00:44:17,867 --> 00:44:22,464
She was named Liliana, it was
Blind ... and it's me.

419
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:29,919
Are Benign?

420
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:31,426
-- A woman who was in her house.

421
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:33,581
It was one of the caretakers of the orphanage.

422
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:42,034
-- But if it is impossible.
I agree.

423
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:44,722
-- Not too long he worked there.

424
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,318
He had a son: Thomas.

425
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:54,719
Apparently the little had
Born with a malformation.

426
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,385
That's why we kept
Separated from the others.

427
00:44:58,086 --> 00:44:59,386
Nobody knew him.

428
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,398
For the townspeople
Was a real surprise

429
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,447
When they found his body.

430
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:07,513
-- What does it mean?

431
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:11,332
-- Apparently, he disappeared, playing ...

432
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:16,170
Shortly after that
You were adopted.

433
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,076
One of the small,
Confessed later,

434
00:45:19,577 --> 00:45:21,706
Who had attempted
Gastarle a joke.

435
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,560
It was loaded with
Tomas in the caves

436
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:27,761
And then removed him for the sack
See if they dared venture outside.

437
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:31,469
There never left
There. It drowned.

438
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,911
They found his body
When the tide went down.

439
00:45:36,044 --> 00:45:37,258
The children never accused ...

440
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:39,072
Of the crime. Only
Were playing.

441
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,078
-- This child was in my house.

442
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,564
-- We ask all present

443
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,049
... At the festival opening.

444
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,421
Nobody remembers seeing
A child with a sack

445
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,123
... In the head while walking through there.

446
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,944
(Laura): - You do not know what is
Sleep at a stretch all night.

447
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,000
I can not stop thinking.

448
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,545
Remember as llamábamos
Simon knew what when?

449
00:47:47,822 --> 00:47:55,058
Two kilillos. My two of kilillos
Moreover, you said. That weighed.

450
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:03,467
Doctors said that it was
Very little for their age.

451
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,537
But, of course, to you and to
I seemed enough.

452
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,405
And that we knew that ...

453
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:17,895
Had many chances ...

454
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,005
Not a person
Normal like us.

455
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,110
But when we met her ...

456
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:34,249
When we saw for the first time
His smile, and his eyes, ojitos ...

457
00:48:38,939 --> 00:48:41,359
Simon made us strong, Carlos.

458
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:47,859
Together we are strong.

459
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,844
Together.

460
00:48:51,689 --> 00:48:55,793
And if you ever lose forgives
Nerves. But it is difficult.

461
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,690
Charles, there is someone in the bathroom.

462
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:31,708
-- What's going on?

463
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:33,437
-- Someone has put in bed.

464
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:40,562
Carlos, I do not look well,
Tócalo, it is still hot.

465
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,842
-- Of course it is hot,
I just lift.

466
00:49:44,546 --> 00:49:47,562
-- Someone has put in bed.
I am convinced.

467
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:57,329
This is what Jung stating

468
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:59,940
... Which is in the subconscious
To really

469
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,836
Cohabiting with the living dead.

470
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,117
In Germany, have another
Name for the emissary

471
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:09,733
... From death.

472
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:11,534
It is a being who represents ...

473
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:15,846
As the image of a
. That is a double.

474
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:18,688
Crossing the gaze with him

475
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:21,281
... Or any of them like that

476
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:25,944
I taught mean,
Irredeemably

477
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:30,912
... Secure a passport
The other world.

478
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,147
-- How long does it take
Her son disappeared?

479
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:36,065
-- Nine months.

480
00:50:39,095 --> 00:50:41,595
In my house are occurring
Strange things,

481
00:50:41,796 --> 00:50:43,695
Things related
Disappearance of my son. 

482
00:50:46,428 --> 00:50:48,490
And I no longer know 

483
00:50:48,491 --> 00:50:50,552
-  is Not so simple

484
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:53,555
It is not going to get you a
Exorcist in the yellow pages.

485
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,901
-- What the child arranqué
That was my son.

486
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:06,875
The police assured that leads
Died more than 30 years.

487
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,335
Someone has my son.

488
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:11,536
I do not know for what purpose.

489
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,099
But I assure you that I will not
Stay home waiting.

490
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:19,334
-- Is there anybody in this
Field who if I fio.

491
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:22,614
Of course, I am speaking for my instinct.

492
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:28,584
Do you agree Visit
From a medium in your house?

493
00:51:54,674 --> 00:51:56,381
-- This was not a dormitory children ...

494
00:51:56,382 --> 00:51:58,089
When it was an orphanage, right?

495
00:51:58,254 --> 00:52:00,336
-- No, the bedroom of
Children are there in the background.

496
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:06,289
-- So it is right that
Begin here. Enrique!

497
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:08,804
-- Perfect, I am hour.

498
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,755
-- I would like some object
This old house.

499
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,849
Something related to its past,

500
00:52:16,075 --> 00:52:20,992
And if possible,
Some clothes thereafter.

501
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:26,304
We are not alone.

502
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:29,005
(Bell)

503
00:52:32,075 --> 00:52:33,991
-- There is a psychologist who is
Working with the police,

504
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:37,311
Pilar, which is keen
In attending the meeting,

505
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,821
If there is no objection.

506
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:44,239
-- Perfect, perfect.
The police Mola.

507
00:53:02,085 --> 00:53:04,013
-- Could you explain to
Need this doll?

508
00:53:04,786 --> 00:53:08,959
-- Aurora needs an object
To motivate trance.

509
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,907
The clothing and other objects he
Help to get into a situation,

510
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:12,804
So we can start back.

511
00:53:13,014 --> 00:53:14,121
-- A regression?

512
00:53:14,287 --> 00:53:16,461
An invocation of mind.
The past, present

513
00:53:16,462 --> 00:53:18,635
And the future
Overlap and intersect.

514
00:53:19,261 --> 00:53:22,037
It would be something like a trip back in time.

515
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:23,614
I know that like
Is a witchcraft,

516
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:25,827
But I can assure you that
There is nothing to fear

517
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:27,451
... Parallel to the perception.

518
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:29,552
If there is something to do, Aurora will see.

519
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,475
-- If there is something to do, I hope
That what we all.

520
00:53:35,314 --> 00:53:36,451
-- Are you ready, Enrique?

521
00:53:40,752 --> 00:53:42,389
-- All ready, when you want.

522
00:54:04,335 --> 00:54:05,484
-- Dawn, can you hear me?

523
00:54:05,685 --> 00:54:06,834
-- Perfectly prepared.

524
00:54:07,225 --> 00:54:08,053
-- Let there.

525
00:54:16,584 --> 00:54:20,661
Everything around you
Begins to fade.

526
00:54:20,662 --> 00:54:24,739
The dark forms a
Circle around you

527
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,526
And increasingly close.

528
00:54:28,527 --> 00:54:30,627
Everything fades.

529
00:54:30,927 --> 00:54:32,227
We are no longer here.

530
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:37,320
Now you are by yourself in
Midst of the darkness.

531
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:41,314
And the darkness
Starts to disappear.

532
00:54:43,164 --> 00:54:48,133
I will count backwards
From the number 10,

533
00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:53,102
When you finish
Go anywhere.

534
00:54:53,947 --> 00:55:00,463
And you can also see anyone
To hide in this house.

535
00:55:01,929 --> 00:55:13,578
10 .. 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ...

536
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:23,179
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1

537
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:26,525
You can open your eyes.

538
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:42,179
-- Uff ... it's cold. The
Window is open.

539
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:55,508
-- Aurora, I want
Look around you.

540
00:55:55,509 --> 00:55:58,431
Is there somebody else you
In this room?

541
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:01,427
<i> - I hear someone </ i>.

542
00:56:04,522 --> 00:56:05,368

<i> I hear something </ i>.

<i> I am sure that children are </ i>

551

00:57:58,883 --> 00:58:00,726
(Crying Child)

556
00:58:01,013 --> 00:58:02,179
<i> - Why are you crying? </ I>

557
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:04,465
-- We are sick ....

558
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:05,466
<i> Who they are? </ I>

559
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:10,175
<i> - I do not come to harm them.

560
00:58:10,376 --> 00:58:15,103
<i> Ábreme the door. No.
Be afraid. It opens the door </ i>.

561
00:58:15,622 --> 00:58:17,637
(Crying Child)

562
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,305
-- I want to get out.

563
00:58:22,821 --> 00:58:27,336
(Cry of a child)

564
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:35,696
<i> What have you done? </ I>

565
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:42,428
(Gritos children)

566
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:48,636
-- Aurora, I need that I
Tell what you are seeing.

567
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:58,491
<i> - Are very sick. They
Crying. Oh! What happened? </ I>

568
00:59:05,085 --> 00:59:07,147
<i> - Who would want envenenarlos </ i>

569
00:59:10,866 --> 00:59:14,571
(Voice of girls): He wants to kill us all!

570
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:17,496
-- Is there my son?.

571
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:20,090
-- Aurora, are you Simon?

572
00:59:22,903 --> 00:59:24,949
<i> - (Aurora): Is Simon here? </ I>

573
00:59:41,762 --> 00:59:44,781
-- Aurora! Aurora! Will I
Listening? Let's look.

574
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:48,000
Aurora, it is necessary that you
Stay in the middle of the room.

575
00:59:48,749 --> 00:59:51,297
I am going to count to 10.

576
00:59:52,484 --> 00:59:59,317
10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ...

577
00:59:59,618 --> 01:00:08,018
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1

578
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,771
-- I was in this house,
But it was very different.

579
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:27,226
The beds,
Toys, decoration

580
01:00:27,629 --> 01:00:28,580
... Was much older.

581
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:34,727
The light from the lighthouse fall
Through the windows.

582
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:39,607
-- Is it safe
Simon saw no?

583
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:43,517
-- It was very dark, sorry.

584
01:00:43,918 --> 01:00:47,026
I could not recognize anyone.
But there were children.

585
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:49,377
-- So you saw
To children. Is that so?

586
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:50,378
-- That's right.

587
01:00:50,582 --> 01:00:53,022
-- We are saying that
This house there are ghosts.

588
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:55,762
-- What is a ghost Carlos?

589
01:00:55,982 --> 01:00:58,553
In this house there is something
And all we saw today.

590
01:01:00,376 --> 01:01:02,436
-- When something terrible
Happens in a place,

591
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:05,797
... Sometimes leaves a footprint

592
01:01:06,983 --> 01:01:11,753
A wound that serves as a hub
Between two lines of time.

593
01:01:13,594 --> 01:01:17,975
It's like ... like an echo that
Is repeated over and over again,

594
01:01:18,076 --> 01:01:19,776
... Waiting to be heard.

595
01:01:20,653 --> 01:01:23,042
As a brand, uy! Forgives.

596
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:29,231
As the mark of a pinch,
Which seeks caress relief.

597
01:01:33,275 --> 01:01:34,210
Laura ...

598
01:01:37,011 --> 01:01:41,011
Those who are
Close to death ...

599
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:44,545
We are more receptive
This kind of message.

600
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,306
-- Trying to tell me that my son
Could see these children

601
01:01:55,107 --> 01:01:56,207
Because ...?

602
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,652
-- Well, Laura, I think
That enough is enough.

603
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:02,014
Recojan their things and
Go, please.

604
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:04,885
-- Jack, we can not fail
That these people were going well.

605
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,933
-- Laura, all this is a farce,

606
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:08,131
... A trick show.

607
01:02:08,364 --> 01:02:10,508
-- I am not what I believe. And why?

608
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:12,553
Let's see, what purpose?.

609
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:13,983
What we said
It was true, right?

610
01:02:14,184 --> 01:02:15,309
We have asked for money.

611
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:16,742
-- From time.

612
01:02:16,843 --> 01:02:18,160
-- And what intends to do?

613
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:19,978
Let's see, tell me what it intends to do?

614
01:02:20,121 --> 01:02:22,317
Throughout this time the police
I had not a single sign,

615
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,583
... Neither one of which may be my son

616
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:25,894
... Dead or alive.

617
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:27,695
What is supposed to
I do?

618
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:28,632
Do Cruzarme arm?

619
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,197
Let's see what I can ill
Listen to these people?

620
01:02:30,395 --> 01:02:31,399
-- Laura, please, enough already.

621
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:31,904
-- No, you let me.

622
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:35,530
Tell me Pilar, in this
Bad people death ...

623
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:37,890
How many cases like that of
My son has brought you?

624
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,653
Búsquese other occupation
If it is boring,

625
01:02:40,854 --> 01:02:42,557
Not because I invited her to my house.

626
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,849
-- What is supposed to
I do?

627
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:56,340
-- You are a strong mother.
Their plight gives you strength.

628
01:02:56,541 --> 01:03:01,548
And you will be, but only
Do you know where ...

629
01:03:01,749 --> 01:03:05,356
Is able to get to
Find her son.

630
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:07,612
-- Is that I no longer know what to do.

631
01:03:08,013 --> 01:03:10,559
-- You will hear, but not heard.

632
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,860
This is not
Seeing is believing,

633
01:03:13,065 --> 01:03:14,491
... But to see to believe.

634
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:20,292
Create, and then you will see.

635
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,293
-- What are you doing?

636
01:03:50,032 --> 01:03:52,568
-- I do not think that we should continue
Living in this house.

637
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:55,005
We should leave
Here at least one time.

638
01:03:58,005 --> 01:03:59,521
-- But the kids are in the house.

639
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:01,738
Aurora has seen.
I can not quit.

640
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:03,640
You've heard voices.

641
01:04:04,016 --> 01:04:05,399
-- That guy, Enrique,

642
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,082
... Has been one hour to top
Moving cables.

643
01:04:07,297 --> 01:04:08,992
Did not you realize that everything
This can be a montage?.

644
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,854
-- That is the theory of Pilar, right?. That everything is a complete fabrication.

645
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:13,179
That is its scientific theory.

646
01:04:13,376 --> 01:04:14,625
-- Pilar just trying to protect ourselves.

647
01:04:16,241 --> 01:04:17,677
-- Do Protegernos what?

648
01:04:17,878 --> 01:04:19,014
-- Something Protegernos
As of tonight,

649
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:20,977
... Anyone who
No amount enter

650
01:04:20,978 --> 01:04:22,201
... In our home and jodernos life,

651
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:22,995
Moreover, that.

652
01:04:23,798 --> 01:04:25,052
-- But only if
Want help.

653
01:04:25,253 --> 01:04:26,006
-- How to Help

654
01:04:26,219 --> 01:04:28,018
But what you have paid attention
To what they were saying?

655
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:29,883
At any time have
Even mentioned ....

656
01:04:29,884 --> 01:04:31,279
The possibility of
Simon back?

657
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:32,912
No! What these people want to do ...

658
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:34,356
Is contact with the dead, Laura.

659
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,278
If Simon is alive,

660
01:04:41,479 --> 01:04:43,017
... I do not see this as
People can help.

661
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:49,176
And if it is not, they do not
We will return.

662
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:51,909
I do not want nor can I follow
Suffer more.

663
01:04:52,174 --> 01:04:53,762
Vámonos this
Home, Laura. Please.

664
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:59,773
-- I am not going to stop
I leave you nor,

665
01:04:59,774 --> 01:05:01,244
Pilar nor anyone else ... or Carlos, no.

666
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:05,286
-- Laura, we can overcome this.

667
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:07,107
Many couples lose
A son and continue forward.

668
01:05:07,421 --> 01:05:08,593
-- I just
I want to be back

669
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:09,765
... With Simon, do not you understand?

670
01:05:09,982 --> 01:05:11,118
I just want to be with him.

671
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,555
If you want to go, I
Not what you can prevent.

672
01:05:12,813 --> 01:05:16,982
I just want ... to be with him.

673
01:06:23,387 --> 01:06:26,731
Where are you now? I am afraid I do not.

674
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,294
Want to play.

675
01:07:39,404 --> 01:07:40,870
Are you playing with me?

676
01:10:06,293 --> 01:10:08,027
Benign!

677
01:13:40,256 --> 01:13:41,262
-- There are 5, right?

678
01:13:41,563 --> 01:13:42,263
-- Yes

679
01:13:43,682 --> 01:13:48,937
-- All my friends. Martin,
Rita, Alice, William, Victor.

680
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,356
Benign killed them.

681
01:13:52,825 --> 01:13:55,123
Therefore returned to the shed,
Getting their bodies.

682
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:57,379
What I have been thinking.

683
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,745
Kids playing killed Thomas,

684
01:14:00,046 --> 01:14:02,046
And are now playing
With Simon and me.

685
01:14:02,211 --> 01:14:03,295
Do not you understand?

686
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,432
Simon is in danger.

687
01:14:07,633 --> 01:14:10,257
I no longer know how to play.
We no longer know how to play.

688
01:14:10,462 --> 01:14:12,845
-- Laura, that is the history you
You have mounted on your head.

689
01:14:13,071 --> 01:14:14,296
-- Jack, I have seen
With my own eyes.

690
01:14:14,765 --> 01:14:16,123
How do you explain it this afternoon?

691
01:14:16,324 --> 01:14:17,582
Who rode all these tracks?

692
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:20,123
-- Simon invented this game
To call your attention.

693
01:14:20,124 --> 01:14:22,295
-- Who? Dímelo.
Come on, tell me who.

694
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:26,811
-- I made the suitcases. No.
I want to continue here.

695
01:14:29,683 --> 01:14:30,857
-- Well, I can not go yet.

696
01:14:30,858 --> 01:14:32,532
-- I am not going to continue to live in this house.

697
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:35,921
And you do not you will be here alone.

698
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:38,387
-- I can go from one day to another.

699
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:40,029
Too many memories, Carlos.

700
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,530
I need to say goodbye.

701
01:14:47,723 --> 01:14:50,451
Two days. Sola.

702
01:14:52,952 --> 01:14:54,752
I need it. Please.

703
01:14:57,153 --> 01:14:58,153
Please.

704
01:18:37,309 --> 01:18:44,560
(Tap bell)

705
01:19:54,794 --> 01:19:55,756
Well, what else do you want from me?

706
01:19:57,957 --> 01:20:00,018
What else should I do?
What else should I do?

707
01:20:02,033 --> 01:20:06,008
I do not have time. I do not have time.
I do not have time. I do not have time.

708
01:20:16,696 --> 01:20:18,913
Do you want to continue playing? Right?

709
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,172
That's all I want.

710
01:20:20,373 --> 01:20:21,530
So, we do a deal.

711
01:20:21,805 --> 01:20:22,883
I play a little more with you,

712
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:23,872
You and I say where is Simon.

713
01:20:24,073 --> 01:20:25,061
All right?

714
01:20:27,435 --> 01:20:30,780
All right?
All right?

715
01:20:56,029 --> 01:20:59,811
1,2,3, touches the wall.

716
01:21:10,333 --> 01:21:13,733
(Sollozando): 1,2,3, touches the wall.

717
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,108
A ...

718
01:21:28,437 --> 01:21:30,967
1,2,3, touches the wall.

719
01:21:45,702 --> 01:21:48,016
1,2,3, touches the wall.

720
01:22:00,222 --> 01:22:02,658
1,2,3, touched the wall!

721
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,795
1,2,3, touches the wall.

722
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:33,383
1,2,3,

723
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:47,294
Wait! Wait! Wait!

724
01:22:48,605 --> 01:22:49,581
... Wait, I will not hurt you

725
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:52,081
Really, I just
I want to find Simon.

726
01:27:03,905 --> 01:27:04,922
-- Is Simon?

727
01:27:11,108 --> 01:27:12,607
-- Mom,
Why are you weeping?

728
01:27:15,157 --> 01:27:21,110
-- Oh, my life. Are you OK?
You are Ice son.

729
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,647
You do not worry about anything.
Do not panic

730
01:27:24,648 --> 01:27:26,374
... I will take you from here.

731
01:27:31,659 --> 01:27:35,172
(Sound of metal) (voices of children)

732
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:38,846
-- Stay to play with us.

733
01:27:39,047 --> 01:27:41,185
-- No love, we
We can be playing.

734
01:27:42,997 --> 01:27:43,966
(Children laughing)

735
01:27:47,406 --> 01:27:48,583
I want to be if you, Simon.

736
01:27:49,956 --> 01:27:51,518
I want you to think
Only we, you and me.

737
01:27:51,519 --> 01:27:53,081
All right?

738
01:27:54,357 --> 01:27:56,326
Think of the days before
It reached this house.

739
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:58,295
Do you remember, son?

740
01:27:59,144 --> 01:28:00,800
Well, just think about it, okay?

741
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:02,456
Think only that.

742
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:06,862
And dad, and the upcoming Christmas.

743
01:28:06,863 --> 01:28:08,162
And all the things

744
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:09,662
We remained to be done together.

745
01:28:11,022 --> 01:28:13,705
So much my love.
Close your eyes!

746
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:16,389
God! Very strong! Strong!
Strong! But more!

747
01:28:17,419 --> 01:28:20,708
Think. Think you would like to be mayor.

748
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:23,998
What would you like to be
Most, my love?

749
01:28:25,296 --> 01:28:26,640
And the colleges to which you go.

750
01:28:26,841 --> 01:28:28,185
All children who are you going to know.

751
01:28:30,342 --> 01:28:34,358
Y. .. y. .. and think only for a moment,

752
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:38,374
... Thomas and the other children,
Are all a fantasy.

753
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:41,897
That this is crazy, my life.

754
01:28:41,898 --> 01:28:43,546
That, this ... this is like a great dream.

755
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:49,609
That has been very long.
Long. Larguísimo, okay?

756
01:28:51,342 --> 01:28:56,498
Close your eyes. Please
Have been gone. Please.

757
01:29:21,234 --> 01:29:23,576
Close your eyes, my life.

758
01:29:23,812 --> 01:29:24,983
Continue playing with me, okay?

759
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,234
Continue playing, sweetheart.

760
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:31,034
Okay?

761
01:30:14,933 --> 01:30:17,608
(Recalling): - What do you have to show me? --
The house of Thomas.

762
01:31:15,212 --> 01:31:18,992
Noooooooooo!
Noooooooooo!

763
01:31:34,103 --> 01:31:41,820
Nooooooooooooooooo!
Nooooooooooooooooo!

764
01:32:20,306 --> 01:32:22,467
I saw you at a fair price.

765
01:32:27,774 --> 01:32:29,542
I saw you.

766
01:34:13,643 --> 01:34:15,393
I wish to re Simon.

767
01:35:17,448 --> 01:35:19,482
 Mom, Mom, did I wake up?

768
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:25,246
 Of course, if my life.
Of course it can.

769
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:33,915
Mom, mom found
The currencies of mice.

770
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:37,055
Now I ask my lack desire.

771
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:41,780
I want to keep
Care for all of us.

772
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,308
 Laura.

773
01:36:43,418 --> 01:36:44,289
 It's Laura!

774
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:49,636
 Hi, Laura.

775
01:36:53,683 --> 01:36:55,949
It has become old as
The Wendy's story.

776
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,011
It is Laura.

777
01:37:09,653 --> 01:37:11,009
Come, you site.

778
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:17,556
The house, the beach and the lost children.

779
01:37:22,861 --> 01:37:23,719
Yes.

780
01:37:24,341 --> 01:37:29,382
Once upon a time, one house
I was on the beach,

781
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,583
Where they lived ...
