1
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,600
The Mifulu represent
a fascinating example

2
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,400
of failed culture.
The people of the Mifulu

3
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,960
communicated
entirely in rhyme,

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,680
although that's actually
less impressive than it sounds,

5
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,200
because their language
only contained one vowel.

6
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,120
Also, if you've
noticed,

7
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,280
the only artifacts
we've been able to unearth

8
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,160
are primitive musical
instruments.

9
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,840
The Mifulus had
plenty of drums,

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,760
guitars, harmonicas
and the like,

11
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,640
but no weapons
or tools.

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
So, in essence,
they had rhythm, they had music,

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,120
but they had no
hammers and spears,

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,040
so they died.

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,880
In any case, this brings us
to the final room of the tour

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,440
and my personal
favorite-

17
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,000
The Hall
of Norse Mythology.

18
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,680
This is Odin,

19
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,560
chief divinity of the entire
Norse pantheon...

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,480
"The Allfather"
as he's called...

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,440
and these paintings depict
some of Odin's many sons.

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,440
That is Thor,
God of Thunder,

23
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,360
with his mighty hammer.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,560
And this is Balder,
God of Beauty.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
Who's that ugly guy?

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,360
Oh, I was just
about to get to him.

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,660
That's Loki,
Norse God of Mischief.

28
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:07,920
He was also known
as "The Trickster. "

29
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,800
As the youngest
son of Odin,

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Loki was the black sheep
of the Norse mythological family.

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,560
His constant
mischievous pranks

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,480
were an endless source
of embarrassment

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,400
to his father
and his siblings.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,560
He was, in other words,
a bratty little brother.

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,960
And Loki's ultimate tool
of mischief was this,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,320
the mask
which he created

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
and tossed down to earth
thousands of years ago

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,520
to create mayhem among the mortals.
For, according to legend,

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,200
the wearer of the mask is imbued
with the powers of Loki himself.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,440
- Is that true?
- No, of course not.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,920
If it were, I'd be
wearing it myself.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,560
No, no, it's textbook
mythical allegory.

43
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,480
Loki represents
the "id,"

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,400
the suppressed parts
of ourselves,

45
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,560
and the mask is the tool
which unleashes the id.

46
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,960
I go into this very topic
in my critically acclaimed book.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,200
Now, of all
the Aesir gods...

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,560
excuse me, sir.
Please don't touch the mask display.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,320
Of all the Aesir gods,

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Loki was the only one
who could shape shift...

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,520
change his form,
even turn himself into a woman.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
A woman?! Man alive,
lock up your sons and daughters

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,480
around that twisted
piece of fruitcake, hey, Doc?

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,040
Well, I guess that's
one way of putting it.

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,480
Anyway, Loki brought nothing
but shame to Odin and his ilk.

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,760
In fact, Loki was
such an unruly child

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,760
that Odin ultimately
locked him up in chains

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,440
far beneath the earth.

59
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,520
He did not!

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,920
- Good God!
- And don't you forget it!

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Apparently, you do not
agree with my theories.

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Finally!

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- This is a fake!
- Yes, but it's a good fake.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,520
Ow. Sir, that
is museum property.

65
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,960
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me replace it.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,200
What... what are...
what are you doing?

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,400
Perhaps I should inform you
I suffer from vertigo

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
and I have a lawyer.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
Hello?

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,600
Where's my body?
Come get me.

71
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,040
- Yeah. Oh yeah.
- Hold it right there!

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't like it here.

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
Thanks for dropping by.

74
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
- Dropping?
- Bye.

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,960
Where's... my...

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
mask?!

77
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Who's a happy baby?

78
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,800
Aw, Clare, he's amazing.
Honey, look at him.

79
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,200
They said he's very
alert for his age.

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
He's going to be
a genius

81
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,040
just like his brothers
and sisters.

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,320
Little Tommy's starting
Junior Mensa next week...

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,800
and Clancy just took
his first potty poop.

84
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,800
Oh, look. Honey, he just
took his first poop.

85
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,920
Good poop, Clancy!

86
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,400
Whoa, Captain Underpants,

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,800
watch your aim.
He's gonna need those.

88
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,200
- You okay?
- Yup.

89
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,960
Here. Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,680
So, when are you two gonna have
one for yourselves?

91
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,640
Oh...

92
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,040
It's a boy.

93
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,080
And agirl!

94
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,800
- Twins?
- And another boy!

95
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,640
- Girl.
- Boy.

96
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,280
Girl, boy, girl, boy...

97
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,440
Tim!

98
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Whew.

99
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,240
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

100
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,000
That was flat out
embarrassing.

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,360
The mere mention
of the word "baby" and your throat

102
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
seizes up like
you swallowed Drano.

103
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,760
After seeing those kids,

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,760
Drano sounds like
a good option.

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
- Honey, just think...
- Yeah?

106
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,960
if we have a baby, you'll have someone
you can play video games with.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,240
- Hey!
- You'll have someone you can relate to.

109
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,400
Okay, honey, look.
I know you're upset, okay?

110
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,040
- But can I ask you one question?
- What?

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,480
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

112
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,160
Tim, stop it.
I mean it.

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,560
Look, babe,
who's a turkey?

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,480
Bawk bawk bawk
bawk bawk!

115
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,280
- I'm serious!
- Who's a rabid dog?

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
Ow!

117
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,880
- Who's Hannibal the Cannibal?
- Stop it.

118
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
Jeez, babe.

119
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, I'm driving...
driving... driving here!

120
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,120
- Ugh.
- Honey, slow down.

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,480
You know I can't run and apologize
at the same time.

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,640
Come on, Tonya. I'm not saying
I don't want to have a baby.

123
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm just saying I don't want to have
a baby right now.

124
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,480
So why not?
Why not now?

125
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,400
- Because.
- Ugh.

126
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,320
Wha... babe!

127
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,000
Tonya!
Ton-ton...

128
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,880
Hey, Otis.

129
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,440
You got room
in your doghouse?

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,560
Here you go.
Here you go. Yeah!

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

132
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,240
Up.

133
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,280
You're good, aren't you?
Now, get in the hole.

134
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,120
Tretiak's in the net
for the Soviets.

135
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,080
Paul Henderson's out
of the penalty box.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
He's on the break!
he shoots!

137
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,685
Oh, what a save!

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,640
What a comeback!
Oh! Free beef jerky for everybody!

139
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,560
And the ice is being pelted
with Kibbles 'n Bits.

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,245
What's this?

141
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,160
Now, Otis, how many
times have I told you?

142
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,600
If you're gonna steal something,
steal something with a little value.

143
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,320
That's what we're looking for.
Get up here, come on.

144
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,320
Come here.

145
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,960
Thanks, pal.
Your kissing is getting a lot better.

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
You don't want a baby
right now, do you?

147
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,160
He said it.

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,080
Mmm.

149
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,240
LOKI!

150
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,600
Dad?

151
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,200
I- I mean,
Oh, masterful Odin, is that you?

152
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,560
Have you found
your mask, Loki?

153
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,440
I found a mask,
but as it turns out,

154
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,080
- it was a fake.
- Why are you relaxing on this beach?

155
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,600
I'm just taking a few
moments reprieve from my...

156
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
Nonsense!
That mask

157
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,120
has caused enough mischief
and malfeasance among the mortals.

158
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,800
I curse the day
you created that thing.

159
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,160
Why don't you just use
that all-seeing eye of yours

160
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,800
- and tell me where it is?
- This is your mess

161
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,400
and you will clean it up!

162
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,800
You're a god!
Now start acting like one!

163
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:41,320
Now, find that mask

164
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,840
before I open up a can
of lightning on you!

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,040
Do you need anything
while I'm out?

166
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm just gonna go make
a baby with the neighbor.

167
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,840
- Honey, come here.
- What?

168
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,760
Look! Look at all
this stuff.

169
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,400
I've been trying to do
this for 10 years

170
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,560
of my life, creating
these shows and...

171
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,920
I just need more time.

172
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,600
Okay, I get it, okay?

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,480
You want your own show,

174
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,640
and I want you
to have your own show.

175
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,800
You're so good!

176
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,760
But I also...

177
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,960
really, really
wanna have a baby.

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,480
So, what do we do?

179
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,880
I want our child
to be proud of us,

180
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,800
both of us.

181
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,840
And if somebody asks that child,
"Hey, what does your mommy do?"

182
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,960
He's gonna say, "Oh, she's the managing
director of Apt Apparel. "

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,360
They'll say, "Cool. " When they say,
"What does your daddy do?"

184
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,880
They'll say,
"He's a... he's a... "

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,400
Hey, boys and girls.
I'm Torpedo Tortoise!

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,840
# Here at Animagine,
your dreams come true #

187
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,480
# There's so much fun here
for me and you #

188
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,480
# Animagine inthe morning,
Animagineatnight#

189
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,640
# If watching cartoons
is wrong #

190
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,040
# I don't want
to be right! #

191
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,120
And here's one for you.

192
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,440
Halloween party's
tomorrow night, homes.

193
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,760
- Got a costume?
- No.

194
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
Hey, maybe you could
go as a turtle.

195
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,560
Thanks, Chad.

196
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,760
I can't believe Chad
got promoted again.

197
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,400
When the executives look at me,
all they see is a tortoise.

198
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,640
Hey man, you want things
to change, you gotta make 'em change.

199
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,800
- You ever pitch to the top man himself?
- Daniel Moss? Hell no.

200
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,720
Well, then it's time
to man up, my road dog,

201
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,440
because there he is.

202
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,640
Oh my God.
He never eats lunch down here.

203
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,320
He's too busy being
an animation god!

204
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,400
Then it's fate, man.
You got to go over there

205
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,960
and say, "Yo, I am
Tim Avery and I've been slugging away

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
in this costume
for six months now

207
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,000
and I got an idea
for a show and you need to hear it. "

208
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,600
Be aggressive, man.
If a bug bites you, bite him back!

209
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,200
Oh, you mean like you
have with Sylvia?

210
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,640
Shut up.

211
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,480
You know,
maybe I should.

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,920
- Should what?
- Just walk up to Daniel.

213
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,280
- I mean, he's just a guy, right?
- Right.

214
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,240
- What do I have to lose?
- You got nothing to lose, man!

215
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,600
- I'm gonna do it.
- Are you crazy?

216
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Hey, Torpedo Tortoise.

217
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,200
Hi.

218
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,640
Something I can
do for you?

219
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,560
Uhm...

220
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,160
actually, yes.
Yes, you can.

221
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,480
Um, see I've been
in the turtle suit for a while now,

222
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,240
but, uh, I'm
a trained animator.

223
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,160
I went to school
and everything,

224
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,560
and, uhm, I got an idea
for a show that, uh,

225
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,320
you gotta hear.

226
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,040
Cool.
Lay it on me.

227
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Now?

228
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,005
So what did he say?

229
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,560
That my ideas lacked spark,
but the door was always open.

230
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Well, that's
a good thing.

231
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,640
No. It's always open so he can push
guys like me out of it.

232
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,040
Come on, Otis.

233
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,280
Otis. Come on.

234
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,520
Come on, boy.
Come on, Otis.

235
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,320
Thank you, Otis.

236
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,800
You're so sweet
and thoughtful.

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Which is why you'd make
such a great dad.

238
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,200
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

239
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,120
Well, I was gonna go
as a werewolf victim,

240
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
but Otis ruined my mask.

241
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Well, honey, you know,
we've got so much stuff around here.

242
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,400
I don't know, just...
wear that thing.

243
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,000
This?

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
I can't go as this.

245
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,840
Everyone at Animagine always goes
all out with their costumes.

246
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,480
This is the crappiest
piece of crap in Craptown.

247
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,480
Be a lot less crappy
if you went with me, though.

248
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,440
I know, but I can't.
I gotta finish the Orion brochure.

249
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,840
- You know what?
- Hmm?

250
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,760
Go to the party...

251
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,765
have fun,

252
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,685
and when you get home,

253
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,240
you can tell me
all about it.

254
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,120
So lame.

255
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Whoa!
What the...?

256
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,440
Don't you just
love Halloween?

257
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:42,560
Whoa!

258
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,880
Trick or treat.

259
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,440
Hardy-har.
Let me see your work ID, please.

260
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,200
- ID?
- No ID, no party.

261
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
Where did the wife
put that invitation?

262
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,640
ID, not IV.

263
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Excuse me.
My bad.

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Maybe I left it in
my other pants.

265
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,360
- Crazy!
- Okay.

266
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,680
Here's your drink.

267
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,920
This party
is embarrassing.

268
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,840
Can't we stir
things up a little?

269
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,200
- I'm on it.
- Go get 'em.

270
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
Who's that green guy?

271
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,720
You'd better cover up,
young lady.

272
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,280
You might catch
a chest cold.

273
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,240
Ah.

274
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,440
What am I thinking?

275
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,360
Whoa! Oh!

276
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,920
Hey!
Oh!

277
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,840
- Whoo! Whoo!
- Ah.

278
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,800
- Jorge.
- Sylvia.

279
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,640
Thank you, God.

280
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,880
- # You're just too good to be true. #
- Let's go.

281
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,760
# I can't take my
eyes off of you. #

282
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,480
Boo! Boo!

283
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,920
Now hold on.
Where is everybody going?

284
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,920
Whoo! All right.
All right!

285
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,840
- Boo! Lame!
- Whoo-hoo!

286
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,640
- # Yeah, Fringe City in the house! #
- # Work it! #

287
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,720
- # What, what, what #
- # This is the part where you dance #

288
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
- # This is the part where you boogie #
- # Ooh, ooh, ooh #

289
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,840
- # This is the part where you dance #
- # Uh, uh, uh, uh #

290
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,560
# Shake your booty,
shake your cans like this #

291
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,240
# Shake your pants,
shake-a shake-a #

292
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,400
# Shake your pants like this,
shake your pants #

293
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,320
# Uh, uh, uh, uh,
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh #

294
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,080
# Ladies,
let me hear you #

295
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,560
# You're just too good
to be true, yeah, good to be true #

296
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,880
# Can't take my eyes off of you,
I love you, baby #

297
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,840
# You feel like heaven
to touch, mm-hmm #

298
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,725
# I wanna hold you
so much, yeah, yeah #

299
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,240
# At long last, love has arrived,
I thank God I'm alive #

300
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,120
# You're too good to be true,
can't take my eyes #

301
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,080
- # Can't take my eyes off of you, yo #
- # What #

302
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,120
# Pardon the way
that I stare #

303
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,320
# No one else
who can compare #

304
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
# The sight of you
leaves me weak #

305
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,280
# There are no words
left to speak #

306
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,200
# So if you feel
like I feel #

307
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,440
# Please let me know
that it's real #

308
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,680
# You're just too good
to be true #

309
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
# Can't take my eyes
off of you. #

310
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,320
# I love you, baby. #

311
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,920
- Yee-haw!
- # Don't bring me down #

312
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,320
# I pray, oh pretty baby... #

313
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,880
- All right!
- # Now that I found you #

314
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,160
# Stay and let me
love you #

315
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,525
# Baby, let me
love you #

316
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,480
# You're just
too good to be true #

317
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:40,200
# Can't take my eyes
off you #

318
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,800
# You feel like heaven to touch,
I wanna hold you so much #

319
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,440
# Now at last long,
love has arrived #

320
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,920
# I thank the Lord I'm alive,
you're too good to be true #

321
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,360
# I can't stop watching you,
can't take my eyes off you #

322
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,720
# Too... good...
to... be... #

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,200
# I love you, baby,
hands in the air #

324
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,360
# And if it's quite all right,
I need you, baby #

325
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,200
# Even though you
don't care #

326
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,280
# To warm those lonely nights
I love you, baby#

327
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,560
# Allthe ladiesonthe left#

328
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,480
# Trust in me
when I say #

329
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,800
# Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it, shake it #

330
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,440
- # Oh pretty baby #
- # All the fellas on the right #

331
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,200
# Don't bring me down,
I pray #

332
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,120
- # Oh, pretty baby #
- # Getting freaky on the side #

333
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,320
# Now that
I found you, stay #

334
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,160
# And let me
love you, baby. #

335
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,280
- Jump, jump, jump, jump.
- # Let me love you #

336
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,240
# This is the part
where you boogie #

337
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,160
# This is the part
where you dance! #

338
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
Honey, I'm home.

339
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,840
- Babe, what's gotten into you?
- Let's find out.

340
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,840
That was off the chain
last night, guru.

341
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,480
You were a whirling dervish
of craziness, homes.

342
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,040
Hey, um, did you...
did you use holograms

343
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,120
for... for all that...
that stuff?

344
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,720
Whoa, Avery, I didn't know
you had it in you, man!

345
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,840
Yeah, well,
me neither.

346
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,920
- Tim Avery?
- Yeah.

347
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,080
Daniel Moss would
like to see you in his office.

348
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,040
Do you have
a minute?

349
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,160
This has potential.

350
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,760
Come here.
Come here.

351
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,720
This has that spark
I was looking for.

352
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,605
I mean, not to be
crass about it,

353
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,320
but this guy... this could be
a franchise character.

354
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,880
How'd you come up
with this?

355
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,080
M- my dog brought
it to me.

356
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,480
Oh, yeah. If we knew
where the great ones came from,

357
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,560
we'd go there
every day, right?

358
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,560
Yeah.

359
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,800
Listen,

360
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,520
I think we could
do something with this.

361
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,760
How would you
like to move up to the second floor?

362
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,240
Where is it?
Where is it?

363
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,120
Otis! You know that mask
you were chewing on,

364
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,040
the wooden one?
Where is it, boy?

365
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
Find it and I'll take
you to see Venus...

366
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,960
you know, that cute little Jack Russell
you're always trying to jump?

367
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,840
Yes, I think you guys
would make a good couple.

368
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,760
I don't know.
I don't speak Doberman.

369
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,760
Babe!
I got incredible news!

370
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,080
Really?
I think I do too!

371
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,000
- Really? What?
- Um, you go.

372
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,560
- No, you go.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

373
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,160
- Babe, let me go.
- Okay, go.

374
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Guess who got moved up
to the second floor?

375
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,640
Oh God, that is so great!
I am so proud of you.

376
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,680
- Oh, then it was meant to be.
- What's meant to be? What's your news?

377
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,840
I've been feeling
really funky all day

378
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,800
- and you're not gonna believe this.
- I'm not gonna believe what?

379
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,080
- Tell me! What? What?
- Okay. I think I might be...

380
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,480
- Pregnant.
- Yes!

381
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh, but how can that be, 'cause we...
that can't be... we just...

382
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,200
Who's a fish?
Who's a fish?

383
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,680
Where's there a trashcan?
Where's there a trashcan?

384
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,080
- Is that normal?
- No.

385
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,400
And what's worse,
it's not covered by insurance.

386
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,280
# Baby face #

387
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,000
# You've got
the cutest little #

388
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,040
- # Baby face. #
- Mm-hmm!

389
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,520
- He goes here, he comes running...
- # There's not another one #

390
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,000
- # Could take your place #
... and bam, in his face.

391
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,600
# Baby face #

392
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,320
- # My poor heart is jumpin'. #
- Honey, that's our baby!

393
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
# You sure have
started something. #

394
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,120
# Ah, freak out! #

395
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,400
# When I play the maracas
I go chic-chicky-boom #

396
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,560
# Chic-chicky-boom #

397
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,120
# Baby face #

398
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,040
# I'm up in heaven #

399
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,600
- # When I'm in your fond embrace. #
- Hello, in there.

400
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
- Wow.
- What?

401
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,920
- I-I think my water just broke.
- # I didn't need a shove #

402
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,800
- # 'Cause I just fell in love... #
- Really?

403
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,000
- It's a boy.
- # With your pretty baby #

404
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,920
# Pretty baby #

405
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,120
# Face! #

406
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,040
Oh, Alvey.

407
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
Say hello to your son.

408
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,360
Uh, hello there, son.

409
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,320
I've been waiting
to meet you

410
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:20,040
for nine months now.

411
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,480
Whoa. He's got
a killer grip.

412
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,920
But Dad counteracts
with his Pinky of Doom.

413
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,880
Hey, do you know
who I am?

414
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm your dad.

415
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,800
Loki!

416
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
There was a baby

417
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:50,480
born of the mask!

418
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,880
Damn!
Where's my mask?!

419
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,160
Sir, y-you're gonna
have to pay for that.

420
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,280
The advertisement
said they were authentic!

421
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,200
They are authentic.

422
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,440
They're authentic Pakistani
Norse Mythology masks.

423
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,560
Okay.
Now let me think.

424
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,000
What should
I turn him into?

425
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,640
Loki!

426
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,280
Dad?

427
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,760
Fool!

428
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
What in Helveti were you
about to do to this shopkeep?

429
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,480
- Nothing, I was just...
- Fool!

430
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,405
Don't you dare
lie to me.

431
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,960
You know, Thor never gave me
this kind of trouble.

432
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,520
Okay, here we go again
with the Thor crap.

433
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,240
Thor, Thor, Thor.
You know, father, I'm not like Thor.

434
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,200
I'm never gonna
be like Thor.

435
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,080
I just wish that...
can't you just

436
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,280
love me for who I am

437
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,560
and not for who I'm not?

438
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,280
No! I want you to be
more like Thor!

439
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,200
Now, I've wasted
enough time here.

440
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,120
I felt a tremor.

441
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,480
A child has been
born of the mask!

442
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,680
Wow. A baby's born
of the mask,

443
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,640
so that sort of makes me
kind of like a dad, huh?

444
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,880
- Find it!
- The baby or the mask?

445
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,800
Find the baby

446
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,040
and you will
find the mask.

447
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,000
Right.

448
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,520
Tonya, have you
seen Otis?

449
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,440
He's in his
new doghouse!

450
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,160
Who's a happy baby?

451
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,240
Let's blow up
another one.

452
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,520
You like these, huh?
They're pretty!

453
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,445
Honey, honey, honey,
just a second ago,

454
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,360
he was counting the balloons.
He held up five fingers.

455
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,280
That's great, hon.
I gotta go.

456
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,960
Daniel brought in Chad
to backstab me... oh, I mean help me...

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,200
and I gotta get to work
before he helps me out of a job.

458
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,120
Hey.

459
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,200
What do you think,
Double A?

460
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,160
Would you watch this, huh? Hey hon,
I know I've asked like a million times,

461
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,040
but you happen to see that mask I was
looking for, you know the wooden one...

462
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,680
Okay, a billion times, and no.
Why do you need it so badly?

463
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,480
I don't need it.
Who said I need it? Don't need it.

464
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

465
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,480
Bye. Say "Bye, Daddy. "
Bye bye.

466
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,360
Bye bye. Here.
You want another one?

467
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,280
Okay, watch,
watch, watch.

468
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,320
"I want you to be
more like Thor. "

469
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,240
Oh, what a jerk.

470
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,560
Oh hey!
It's my ear, nose and throat guy.

471
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,480
Odin thinks
he's so great.

472
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,560
Hello! No one even
worships you anymore.

473
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,320
I could have
been a doctor

474
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,400
if the SAT weren't
so culturally biased.

475
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,600
Now, let's see. Oh, "Infectious
Diseases," that always cracks me up.

476
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,440
Maternity ward.

477
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,520
Okay, first I find
the magic baby,

478
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,280
then downstairs to the cafeteria
for some Jell-O brick.

479
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,640
Who do you have to sting to get some
answers in this place?

480
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,280
Bingo!

481
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,200
All right,
here we go.

482
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,120
Buckle up.

483
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,200
Oh, hold on tight.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

484
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,120
Okay, baby, this
is gonna hurt you

485
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,000
more than it's
gonna hurt me.

486
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Ah!

487
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,480
Okay, let's start with...

488
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,680
uh, July 27th.

489
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
Babies born on that day.

490
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,920
Oh, my. Why are there
so many babies born?

491
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,400
- Who are you?
- You.

492
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,320
- Me?
- Who?

493
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,840
- # I thank the Lord for the nighttime #
- # Lord for the nighttime #

494
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,080
- # To forget the day #
- # Forget the day #

495
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
- # A day of up... uptight time #
- # Up... uptight time #

496
00:30:18,035 --> 00:30:19,885
- # Baby, chase it away #
- # Chase it away #

497
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,440
- # I get relaxation #
- # Lord for the nighttime #

498
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,800
- # And it's a time to groove #
- # A time to groove #

499
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,960
- # I thank the Lord for the nighttime #
- # Lord for the nighttime #

500
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,920
# I thank the Lord
for you #

501
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,080
# Talk about plans,
now, baby, I got plenty. #

502
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,840
- It's okay.
- # Nothing ever seems to turn out #

503
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,160
- # The way it should. #
- It's okay.

504
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,760
- Bottle.
- # Seems like just one time #

505
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,640
# I'm feeling good #

506
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,520
- # I thank the Lord for the nighttime #
- # Lord for the nighttime #

507
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,960
- # To forget the day #
- # Forget the day... #

508
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,120
Huh?

509
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,600
Hmm?

510
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,760
- # I get relaxation #
- # Lord for the nighttime #

511
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,000
- # And it's a time to groove #
- # A time to groove #

512
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,960
- # I thank the Lord for the nighttime #
- # Lord for the nighttime #

513
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,760
- # Baby #
- # I thank the Lord for you. #

514
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
# Save me. #

515
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,680
- It's okay, baby. I got him.
- Okay.

516
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,320
Tim.
Tim.

517
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,040
- Okay, it's my turn.
- No, no. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

518
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
- It's... it's my turn?
- He's asleep. He's asleep.

519
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,920
But, baby, can you go in
late to work today?

520
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,360
My office just called. Um, they're
sending me to New York for a week.

521
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,160
- Hey, where you going?
- I'm... I'm sorry, Daniel.

522
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,720
My wife's gotta go out of town
for work. It's just a week,

523
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,600
but I have to take care
of the baby.

524
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,920
Hey, you gotta do the kid
thing, I understand.

525
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Just unfortunate timing.
The network called,

526
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,160
they want to see our green guy
thing by the end of the week,

527
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,880
but I'll just put
Chad on it.

528
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,040
- I'm on it.
- What?

529
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,960
I said I need to be home,
as in my house,

530
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,880
but I didn't say
I couldn't work.

531
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,800
Line up the pitch.
I'm on it,

532
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,720
and I won't let
you down.

533
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,920
Cool. Try to give it that spark I saw
at the Halloween party.

534
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,680
Okay.

535
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,960
I left all the phone numbers
on the refrigerator

536
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,360
and you need to give him a bath
before he goes to bed,

537
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,520
but don't get any water in his ears,
'cause he freaks out a little bit.

538
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,080
Um, and if he gets cranky,
you just put him in his car seat

539
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,200
and play the Baby Mozart CD, but don't
just pop him in front of the TV;,

540
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,120
it's gonna
make him stupid.

541
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,080
Um, uh, if you feel
like you're drowning,

542
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,520
just go see Betty down the
street. She has like 10 kids.

543
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,680
- Honey? Do I have to mash his bananas?
- Yeah?

544
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,280
- I... I...
- Okay, you're gonna be fine.

545
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,640
Can I say goodbye?

546
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,240
Mommy loves you
so much.

547
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,680
Okay.

548
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,640
And Mommy loves you too.

549
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,200
- Mommy, I can't do this.
- Huh? You can.

550
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,640
- I can't.
- You can.

551
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,840
Mommy. Honey, take him.

552
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
- Bye.
- Honey, take him.

553
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,440
- I love you.
- Honey, take him.

554
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,280
Bye.

555
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,200
Okay.
All right, Alvey.

556
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,040
Okay. All right.
We're gonna have a good time.

557
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,080
Here we go.
Come on. Yes.

558
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,920
Look at the pretty colors.

559
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,280
Oh, look! Ah, ee.

560
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,440
Fun, right?

561
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,800
Look at me!
I'm happy, I'm... happy.

562
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
Okay.

563
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,440
Okay, buddy,

564
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,400
it's just you
and me this morning

565
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,320
and we're gonna
have fun and gonna play.

566
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,240
You excited?
Okay.

567
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,720
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy. Can you get down here now?

568
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,240
- Daniel's asking for you.
- No, I can't come in right now.

569
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,920
- I'm stuck here with my kid.
- You'd better think of something.

570
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,320
He wants to see your drawings
before the pitch on Friday.

571
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,480
All right. I'll do the drawings now
and I'll fax 'em over after lunch.

572
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
- All right.
- Okay, bye.

573
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,200
Hey, pal.

574
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,920
Daddy's got a teensy-weensy bit
of work to do,

575
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,840
so can you be a good
boy and let him?

576
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,920
Hello?

577
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,760
- Honey, hey!
- Hey, hon, how you doin'?

578
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,480
So, how are you
and Alvey doing?

579
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,600
Oh, we're doing fine.
Yeah, we're doing great.

580
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,800
Two little peas in a pod.
How's your thing going?

581
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,320
Good. Uh, he loved
the comps,

582
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,280
so now we just gotta rush
it all into production.

583
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,240
So, how's Alvey?

584
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,160
Is he eating?
How's he sleeping?

585
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,320
Hold on, hon.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

586
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Hi! How's my little
womping wompet?

587
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,160
Oh, I miss you. I just want to kiss you
and kiss you and kiss you!

588
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Okay, hon.
Yeah, he loves you too.

589
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:30,000
- Hurry home. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

590
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,480
Aww.

591
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Well, isn't it great

592
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,360
that her work
is going so well?

593
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,920
- Ma?
- Yes. Ma and her career are just...

594
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,840
- Did you say ma?
- Mama.

595
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,760
Oh my God.
You said mama!

596
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,680
Well, can you say "dad"

597
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,320
- or "da-da?"
- Mommy.

598
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,600
That's great!
You're doing great!

599
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,680
but come on,
say "da-da". Da-da

600
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,400
Mother.

601
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,120
Timmy Tyler,
are you my mask baby?

602
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,920
- Yes?
- Good afternoon!

603
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,760
- May I come in?
- Ah...

604
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
What a lovely abode.
Oh my, and such a lush carpet.

605
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,960
You're exactly
the kind of person

606
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,320
the Vacuummeister 3000
was invented for!

607
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,800
Well, if I don't
clean up, no one will.

608
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,440
That is why you need
the Vacuummeister 3000!

609
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,760
It has dual sweeps,
durable airpaths,

610
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,600
jiggle control, multi-Teflon
coated filtering

611
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,000
and it's built
with a direct-drive design

612
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,600
that is so powerful,
it sucks the dirt

613
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,160
off the dirt!

614
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,360
- Is that safe?
- Allow me to demonstrate.

615
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,280
- Oh, don't you need to plug it in?
- No.

616
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,480
This is a terrible
demonstration.

617
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,920
Hello, you little...
ugly thing.

618
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,160
Let's see if you're
the one, hmm?

619
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,080
Bend. Morph!

620
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,800
Shape shift.

621
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,720
Well, do something
for Odin's sake.

622
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,800
No!

623
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,480
I think it's time to introduce you
to man's best friend.

624
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,600
And I don't
mean you, Otis.

625
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,520
Okay.

626
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,440
Mommy doesn't want me
to do this,

627
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,040
but what Mommy doesn't
know won't hurt her.

628
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,400
...sour cream and onion...
- Oh, look.

629
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,920
Hey, wait a minute.

630
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,440
We don't like
your attitude!

631
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,960
Keep an eye
on him, will ya?

632
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,200
Look at Bam Bam.

633
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,400
Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!

634
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,640
Bam Bam looks miserable
without Pebbles.

635
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,680
Bam.

636
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,480
Bam, bam, bam.

637
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,720
Smoking!

638
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,120
# Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey #

639
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,200
# Hello, myragtimegal#

640
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,400
# Send me a kiss
by wire #

641
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,640
# Baby, my heart's
on fire #

642
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,360
# If you refuse me,
honey, you'll lose me #

643
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,240
# Then you'll be left alone,
oh, baby, telephone #

644
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,280
# And tell me
I'm your own. #

645
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,400
# Everybody do
the Michigan rag #

646
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,320
Every Mame and Jane
and Ruth... #

647
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
# Stomp, romp,
pomp the Michigan #

648
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
# Jump, clump, pump
the Michigan rag #

649
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,840
#Thatlovin' rag! #

650
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,320
# Please don't talk
about me when I'm gone #

651
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,240
# Oh, honey #

652
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,880
# Though our friendship
ceases from now on. #

653
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,360
I don't know how.
I don't know which end is up.

654
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,720
I'm running on fumes.

655
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

656
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,240
I don't know.

657
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,960
Yeah, I've still
got the kid.

658
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,400
Oh God,
you have no idea.

659
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,920
Man, they just suck
the life out of you.

660
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,840
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with him.

661
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,280
I think I may be on to something
for my pitch, though.

662
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,240
I don't know,
it's just...

663
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,760
# Hello, my baby,
hello, my honey #

664
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,720
# Hello, myragtimegal#

665
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,040
# Send me a kiss

666
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,840
# Baby, my heart's

667
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,920
# If you refuse me,

668
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,960
# Then you'll be left alone,

669
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,240
# And tell me
I'm your own. #

670
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,400
Yow! Ooh!

671
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,400
Hi, 911?
I already told you.

672
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,400
My son is bouncing
off the walls!

673
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,960
Yes, off the walls,
the couch,

674
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,040
and the ceiling.
Hello. Hello? Hello?!

675
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,600
# Everybody do
the Michigan rag #

676
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,680
# Everybody likes
the Michigan rag #

677
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,600
# Stomp, romp,
pomp the Michigan #

678
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,280
- # Jump, clump, pump the Michigan rag #
- Betty!

679
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,000
# Everybody do
the Michigan rag #

680
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,200
# Everybody likes
the Michigan rag #

681
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,920
#Thatlovin' rag! #

682
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,680
Don't stop, little...

683
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,280
- Yeah?
- Betty!

684
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,640
I need your help.

685
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,080
Tim, what's wrong?

686
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,040
Uh, uh, well, Tonya said
if I ever needed...

687
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,480
you know... oh, uh, well, if any...
if I saw anything weird.

688
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,040
It's Alvey. It's Alvey.
It was Alvey. See?

689
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,480
He was...
he was bouncing

690
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,480
and he... he did the Woody laugh,
you know...

691
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,120
And he was singing.

692
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,400
Well, lots of babies
his age sing.

693
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,800
Vaudeville?

694
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,880
Okay, I'll show you.

695
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,080
Okay, okay.
Here we go.

696
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,960
Go on. Sing.

697
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,960
Go on, Alvey.

698
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,360
Do it.

699
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,200
Do it.
Sing, damn it!

700
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,125
- Sing...
- Tim!

701
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,920
- He's a baby.
- Exactly my point.

702
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm here to unclog
your throne.

703
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,160
Oh, Jason Kemperbee,

704
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,240
be my baby.

705
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,840
Come on.

706
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,160
Hook me up.
Show me the magic.

707
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,600
Alvey.

708
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,200
Put that down.

709
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,600
That's Mommy
and Daddy's.

710
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,280
Please put the fax
machine down.

711
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,600
Want some juice?
Here, want some juice?

712
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,000
It's okay. Here you go, Alvey.
Have some juice.

713
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah, you like juice.

714
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,680
See, Alvey?
Daddy's not gonna hurt you.

715
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,680
Whoa! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

716
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,080
No! Hey! Hey! Ah!

717
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,880
Hey! Hey! Hey!

718
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,760
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam!

719
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,720
Rattle.

720
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,920
Aww, poor baby.

721
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,280
Huh? Oh!

722
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,200
Uh-oh.

723
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,280
# If they could
see me now #

724
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,840
#Thatlittlegangofmine#

725
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,840

00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,800
# All I can say is, "Wow" #

728
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,000
# Look at where I am #

729
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,320
# Then I landed... pow! #

731

00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,760
# Holy cow #

733
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,680
# Never believe it #

734
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,120
# If my friends
could see me now #

735
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,760
# Lord, if they could
see me now. #

736
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,200
- Yes?
- Hi!

737
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,280
Would you like
some Thin Chocolate?

738
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,360
Yeah, you can run,
but you can't hide!

739
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
Transformers.

740
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,560
Alvey?

741
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
You... you wouldn't do that
to Da-da, would you?

742
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,720
I'm your dad.

743
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,960
C- can you say "dad"?

744
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,840
"Da-da"?

745
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,800
Madre.

746
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,640
This is too much
too handle.

747
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,560
I mean,
this is insanity.

748
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,520
Dancing?

749
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,000
No. No.

750
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,520
Shh.

751
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,360
Fire!

752
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,320
Bull's-eye!

753
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,160
Hmm?

754
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,720
Here we are
by the baby.

755
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,440
Oh, yeah.
Who's the dog?

756
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,360
Who's the big dog...

757
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,000
Whoa!

758
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,320
Mommy!

759
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,200
I surrender.

760
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,640
Bye-bye.

761
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,400
Oh, shoot.

762
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,080
Oh!

763
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,600
Stop it!

764
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,000
This is insane!

765
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,960
Point it down!

766
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,200
- All done?
- Hmm.

767
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,640
- Hey, I'm Rod.
- Get in here!

768
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,640
Okay.

769
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,760
Uh, take a look at this.

770
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,920
Hey, what a cute
little baby.

771
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,920
- Oh, of course!
- Mind if I take a look at him?

772
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,880
No, go ahead.
I don't care.

773
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,280
Come on.
Do something crazy.

774
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,160
Yeah, do
something crazy!

775
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,320
Crap! Huh-uh, huh-uh.

776
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,280
Damn it. This isn't
the right one either.

777
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,040
Hey!
What are you doing?

778
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,960
Uh, I left your package
in the foyer.

779
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,040
Do I have a package? Okay.

780
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,560
Oh well.

781
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,760
What happened?

782
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,120
You did this to me.
I know what you're doing.

783
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,680
You're trying
to drive me crazy.

784
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,320
You're a cunning
little mastermind

785
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,920
who will stop at
nothing until I go

786
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,840
completely insane.

787
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,480
Well, come on.

788
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,080
Start dancing again.

789
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,120
Start screwing
with my mind!

790
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,560
Start, huh?
Come on!

791
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,680
Why aren't you
screwing with my mind?

792
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,440
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

793
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,360
Maybe I am just
going crazy.

794
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,960
Maybe I am
just going crazy.

795
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,880
Maybe I am just going crazy.

796
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,280
Maybe I am
just going...

797
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,280
That's it, buddy.
First I'm taking you to a pediatrician,

798
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,240
then I'm taking you
to an exorcist.

799
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,080
Who are you?!

800
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh my G...

801
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,120
my son is the devil.
My son is the devil.

802
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,080
Oh my Odin,
it is him.

803
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,680
We're just going to have
a nice little drive,

804
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,640
while Daddy has
a nervous breakdown.

805
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,440
Please leave a message.

806
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,760
Tonya, it's Betty.
You said I should keep an eye out

807
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,680
and call you if there
are any problems?

808
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,360
I think there's a problem.

809
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,040
No parking there.

810
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,000
That's a handicapped zone!

811
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,920
Hey! Sir?

812
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,400
Hey, wait!

813
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,400
Stop! You!

814
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,560
Hey!

815
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,200
What is it?

816
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,200
- Ah!
- Okay, where is the mask?

817
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,640
- What?
- The mask. My mask. Where is it?

818
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,240
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

819
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,880
I am Loki, God of Mischief.

820
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,480
Yeah, and I'm Tim, God of Crazy
Babyland. Will you get out of the way?

821
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,960
That baby is born
of the mask... my mask.

822
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
- Now, where is it?!
- Born of the mask... what?

823
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,760
Oh, so that explains why
he could pee like that!

824
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,040
But wait a minute.
This is my baby.

825
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,560
I don't care about that.
Just give me my mask!

826
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,480
- I don't know where it is.
- Oh really?

827
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,440
Maybe this will
jog your memory!

828
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,760
- Loki!
- Dad?!

829
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,920
I've warned you! You've
left me no other choice.

830
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,520
I don't have time for this.
Look, Dad, there's Balder.

831
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,280
- Just give me the mask.
- I don't have it.

832
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,320
I think my dog ate it.

833
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,880
That is the oldest
excuse in the book,

834
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,240
and I've read some really,
really old books.

835
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,800
But if you want
to do this the hard way...

836
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,040
so be it.

837
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,920
Oh, you're good.

838
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,680
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

839
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,605
You really are a chip
off the old block.

840
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,240
But I don't have time for this.
Prepare to feel my true power!

841
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,600
Loki!

842
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,480
You have defied me

843
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,960
for the last time.

844
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,560
I've had it up
to here with you!

845
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,280
Dad, please listen to me.
You're holding the baby.

846
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,800
Silence!
You have left me no choice.

847
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,840
- Listen, listen...
- You are hereby stripped

848
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,680
of your immortal powers
and forever banished

849
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,885
to the land of mortals.

850
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,200
No! Please, hear me out.
That baby...

851
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,200
Whoa.

852
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,480
- Pretty.
- Whoa.

853
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,920
Whoa.

854
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,200
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you, homes?

855
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,240
Your pitch meeting
is starting right now.

856
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,920
Um, I just met Green.

857
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,480
- Loki.
- Snap out of it.

858
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,400
Where are you?
I'll pick you up.

859
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,640
What's the deal, Tim?
I get you a network pitch,

860
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,720
and you repay me by showing up
20 minutes late

861
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,440
looking like an escaped
mental patient?

862
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:58,360
Andwith a kid?

863
00:58:58,395 --> 00:59:00,640
Huh?

864
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,640
This is Tim Avery.

865
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,600
He created
the character,

866
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,000
so why don't I just let him
tell you more about it?

867
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:08,920
Tim?

868
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,240
Tim?

869
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,200
Guys, I could walk.

870
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,840
I- I guess he didn't
like the pitch.

871
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,320
I just...
I wanna get all my stuff.

872
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,760
Tim?

873
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,680
Pick up the phone!

874
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,600
Tim!

875
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,080
Betty just called.
She's completely freaked out!

876
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:42,480
Oh, God. Call me the second
you get this message.

877
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,280
Hey, it's me.

878
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,200
Uh, got your message.

879
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,520
Well, things are
really great here.

880
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,920
Uh, me and Alvey got chased
by a guy named Loki.

881
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,120
Well, that's
not important.

882
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,800
I pitched, uh,
my show today,

883
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,720
and, um...

884
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,680
I got fired.

885
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,760
Yeah.

886
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,680
Um...

887
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,600
but Alvey pooped,

888
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,560
which is good, and, uh...

889
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,600
and Alvey saved me.

890
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,080
It was amazing.

891
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,000
But, uh, uh,
the main thing is, uh,

892
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,440
we're totally fine.
Everything's great.

893
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,120
Um, better than fine,
actually.

894
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,920
Alvey's great.

895
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,840
I love you.

896
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,760
Okay, bye.

897
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:54,400
# I, well, I see
trees of green #

898
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,760
# And red roses too #

899
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,840
# I'll watch them bloom
for me and you #

900
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,320
# And I think to myself #

901
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,360
# What a wonderful world #

902
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:18,640
# I hear babies cry
and I watch them grow #

903
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,160
# They'll learn much more
than we'll know #

904
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:26,640
# And I think to myself #

905
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:32,120
# What a wonderful world. #

906
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,840
Whoa!

907
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:42,440
By Kylvie,
King of Svitjod,

908
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,840
Houthedy
and Yppor.

909
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:50,360
I summon thee,
God of Gunningap

910
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,320
- Nifleheim, Kvelge...
- Tim?

911
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,400
Tim? Is that you?

912
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,040
Tim!

913
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,120
Kvelgemir!

914
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,120
Who summons Odin,

915
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,160
- Allfather of the gods?
- Shh!

916
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,480
- G... Loki?!
- Shh!

917
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,680
- You'll wake the baby.
- Oh, sorry.

918
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,040
Loki, is that you?

919
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,640
Tim.

920
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,000
What are you doing
in there?

921
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,160
You did
the conjuring ceremony

922
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,080
- by yourself?
- I pay attention.

923
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,720
- Sometimes.
- But you don't have the mask.

924
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,680
- Well, yeah, that's why I...
- Rules are rules, Loki!

925
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,360
And I specifically... ow!

926
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,640
Could you just stop lecturing me
for one minute and listen?!

927
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,720
I found the baby.
He's right there.

928
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,680
- That child is strong.
- Mmm.

929
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,880
Very strong.

930
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,080
I had him before.
I was this close,

931
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,320
but you took my powers
and they got away.

932
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,280
So, please, father,

933
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,200
give me my powers

934
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,440
and I will
give you the mask.

935
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,200
Very well.

936
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,560
Your resourcefulness
pleases me,

937
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,960
and your mother says
we should be trying

938
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,880
"positive reinforcement,"

939
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,800
whatever the Helveti
that is.

940
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,640
So, as a reward,

941
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,000
I shall grant you
a reprieve.

942
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,160
You have until
the sands have fallen.

943
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,080
Oh, hey, hey.
Wait, wait. Hang on.

944
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,720
- Hmm?
- I want to sync up.

945
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,400
Ready... now!

946
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,560
Don't disappoint me, Loki.
Use your powers wisely

947
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,280
and complete your task.
This truly is

948
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,240
your final chance!

949
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,120
Tim.

950
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,040
What's going on
up there?

951
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,480
Tim Avery, what are
you doing in there?

952
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,040
Hmm.
Nosy neighbors.

953
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,480
Ah... ah... choo!

954
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,360
- Guess who?
- No! Ah!

955
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,200
Tim, snap out of it!

956
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,480
Baby?

957
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,400
- Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

958
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,320
What are you
doing up so late?

959
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,480
- And where's Alvey?
- Seriously.

960
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,560
Is that really you?

961
01:06:01,595 --> 01:06:03,320
No, you idiot.

962
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,800
Oh God.
Ah... what... I...

963
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,320
Oh Jeez.

964
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,240
Bro, listen.

965
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,160
I'm a god.
I can shape shift.

966
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,080
I can create stuff
out of nothingness.

967
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,080
I can alter
the fabric of reality,

968
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,760
so, please, quit being
a knucklehead.

969
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,360
- What do you want from us?
- Oh, don't worry.

970
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,720
I'm not gonna
hurt you...

971
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,640
yet!

972
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,840
This baby was born
out of the mask,

973
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,960
and I want
my mask back!

974
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,240
Meet me in exactly
one hour.

975
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,560
So you find the mask
and meet me at... hmm.

976
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,880
Where shall we meet?
Um, how about Red Lobster?

977
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,440
It's always so difficult getting a table
there, especially on Fridays

978
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,160
- when they do that special.
- There's a wick burning.

979
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,160
Well, how about we meet
in an alley in the city?

980
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,080
- There's a wick...
- Met at one before.

981
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,080
- Sure, it's a little cliche...
- Sir, your...

982
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:02,000
but it's not so cliche that I think
to myself, "Wow, that's too cliche!"

983
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,960
- But... it... it...
- Meet me in that alley within the hour,

984
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,800
with the mask,

985
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,360
if you ever want to see
your little monster again.

986
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:13,240
No!

987
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,920
Alvey! No!

988
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,680
What...
Tim?

989
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,320
Tim?!

990
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,280
Alvey?!

991
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,840
Oh God. Tim!

992
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,920
What are you...
what are you...

993
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,240
Tim.
What are you doing?

994
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,160
What are you doing?

995
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,440
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Get off of me!

996
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,040
Get out of there, Loki!
Where's my son, you mongrel from hell?

997
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,920
Tim! Ah!

998
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,840
Tonya?!

999
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,760
Tonya!
Oh, it's really you.

1000
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,360
- Oh my God.
- Oh God, I'm so sorry.

1001
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,080
Betty was right.
You have gone crazy.

1002
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,920
No, I haven't.
I thought I did, but I didn't.

1003
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,160
Where's Alvey?

1004
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,200
- Okay, don't freak out.
- Where's Alvey?!

1005
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,080
- You're freaking out.
- Where's my baby?!

1006
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:38,965
- Loki t-took him.
- Took him?!

1007
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,920
Oh my God.
Did you call the police?!

1008
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:42,840
- No, I...
- Oh my God.

1009
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,165
Tonya, listen!

1010
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,085
- This is an emergency!
- Tonya!

1011
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,760
- My son is missing...
- No, Tonya, listen!

1012
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,560
The police can't help us!
He's the freaking God of Mischief.

1013
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:56,080
All he wants is his mask,
which Otis is wearing.

1014
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,240
And if I can just figure
out where Otis is, I can just...

1015
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,160
of course!

1016
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,520
Our child is missing and you're worried
about the damned dog?!

1017
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,600
This is crazy!

1018
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,040
See what I'm
talking about?

1019
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,845
Now, you're gonna
have to trust me

1020
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,360
and get in the car, because I know where
Alvey is and I know how to get him back,

1021
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,320
because I know the one place
Otis the moose would go.

1022
01:09:15,355 --> 01:09:17,240
# And they called it #

1023
01:09:17,275 --> 01:09:20,480
# Puppy love. #

1024
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,760
# Oh, I guess they'll
never know. #

1025
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,640
See there's this really
cute pooch Venus.

1026
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,320
Otis?

1027
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,600
Otis!

1028
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,360
That's not Otis!
That's a green critter.

1029
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,280
I'm sorry, okay?

1030
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,920
I've ignored you
and I've been impatient,

1031
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,080
but I need you, buddy.
Loki, that guy that made the mask?

1032
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:47,000
He wants it back.
He has Alvey.

1033
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:48,920
And he's a bad guy,
Otis.

1034
01:09:48,955 --> 01:09:51,285
He hates dogs.

1035
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,840
He doesn't realize that dogs
are truly man's best friend.

1036
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:55,765
- Huh?
- You heard me.

1037
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,120
You're this man's
best friend.

1038
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,560
But Alvey's my son

1039
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,960
which sort of makes you
like his big brother.

1040
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,200
And when he grows up,
he's gonna be your bestest friend.

1041
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,320
But right now,
he needs you

1042
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,080
and he needs that mask.

1043
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,480
All right.

1044
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,880
So, I guess you're

1045
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,840
kinda cute, huh?

1046
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,520
Um, can you, like,

1047
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,440
do anything you want,
like me?

1048
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,360
I mean, can you
do this?

1049
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,400
Wow.

1050
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,320
Well, look at you!

1051
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,240
You're just a little
outlaw, ain't you?

1052
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,120
Okay, hombre. Let's see how tough
your rawhide can be.

1053
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,400
Gotcha.

1054
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,640
I like it!

1055
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,200
So, you like games, huh?

1056
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,120
Well you'd better watch out

1057
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,800
'cause I've got a game
that no one can beat me at.

1058
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,240
Super Twister!

1059
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,920
It's just around
the corner, right here.

1060
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:42,805
Here we go.

1061
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,560
# Come on, baby #

1062
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,480
# Let's do the twist #

1063
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,160
# Come on, baby #

1064
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,080
# Let's do the twist #

1065
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,000
# Take me
by my little hand... #

1066
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:56,920
Isn't this fun?

1067
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,880
# And go like this #

1068
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,160
- # Ee-oh, twist. #
- Hi.

1069
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,920
# Baby, baby, twist #

1070
01:12:04,955 --> 01:12:09,440
# Whoo, yeah. #

1071
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,920
- Ah!
- # Just like this #

1072
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,880
# Come on, little miss #

1073
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,560
# And do the twist. #

1074
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,920
- No, that's cheating.
- # Let's all do it. #

1075
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,200
Whoa!

1076
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,000
No fair! That crash
threw me. Rematch!

1077
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,840
Okay, you give me Alvey,

1078
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,640
and the mask is yours.

1079
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,560
I can't let go.
I've grown attached.

1080
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,485
- Alvey!
- Hey, we had a deal!

1081
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,200
I'm the God of friggin' Mischief,
what did you expect?

1082
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,840
- Huh.
- Hey, Loki.

1083
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,800
Honey, you look hot.

1084
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,960
Give me back my son!

1085
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:49,880
Um... no.

1086
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,880
Honey, I think
it's time we trade up.

1087
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,040
Buckle up, baby.

1088
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,040
Listen to Loki, kid.

1089
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,640
Dads are overrated
and I speak from experience.

1090
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,080
Ah, there's nothing
like a Sunday drive.

1091
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,240
You wanna have some fun,
kid, you stick with me.

1092
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,800
All right. It's time
to lose them for good.

1093
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,160
Oh, look out,
look out, look out!

1094
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,120
Yahoo!

1095
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,360
Whoa!

1096
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,840
Hey, babe, look.
No hands. I'm kidding.

1097
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:20,400
Let's just
finish this.

1098
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,360
Now, where did he go?

1099
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,360
- Hmm.
- Uh, honey?

1100
01:15:29,395 --> 01:15:31,400
I think, maybe, there?

1101
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,120
And here he is, folks,

1102
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:53,260
the failure of Fringe City,

1103
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:57,360
Yes, it's
Tim "No-win" Avery!

1104
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,960
Tim, it's Alvey.
I'm gonna go get him.

1105
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,920
Kick his can, honey.

1106
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,760
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1107
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,560
Hi, baby.
Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

1108
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,960
Oh, yeah? Well, jump
like a grasshopper

1109
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,480
and stink like a skunk!

1110
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,840
Caught me
with my mouth open!

1111
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,040
You can't fight me
if you're locked in a trunk.

1112
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,520
Huh?

1113
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,960
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1114
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,800
Let's get out of this dump.
Come on.

1115
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,880
And Loki said, "Let there
be a brick wall!"

1116
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,520
And there was!

1117
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,480
Okay!

1118
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:07,240
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

1119
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,560
Say hello to my
little friend!

1120
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,520
Tim! Tim!

1121
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,000
Here's Loki!

1122
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,120
Tim, Tim, Tim, Tim,
T- T-T-T-T...

1123
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,360
Wait.

1124
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,800
This is a waste
of time.

1125
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,960
We're evenly-matched
opponents.

1126
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,120
I think we should
let the kid decide.

1127
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,600
Why, that's
a swell idea.

1128
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:10,160
Alvey, this is
your decision.

1129
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,160
- Pick me, pick me!
- Alvey?

1130
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,920
- I'm your real dad!
- Come on, you little devil. Let's play!

1131
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,960
- Come on, Alvey.
- Alvey.

1132
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,200
Alvey?

1133
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,840
- Yeah, that's right.
- Tim!

1134
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,440
Son.

1135
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,200
Alvey,
look at me.

1136
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,400
It's your dad.

1137
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,280
There's no more
superpowers.

1138
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,440
I know at first
I was kind of a jerk.

1139
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,640
I didn't know
how to handle a son,

1140
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,280
but you helped me
grow up.

1141
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,360
And I want
to repay you

1142
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,320
by helping you
grow up.

1143
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,760
I love you.

1144
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,320
Come on.

1145
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,400
- Da-da.
- Oh, Alvey.

1146
01:19:25,435 --> 01:19:27,800
It's my son.

1147
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,920
Yes.

1148
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,720
I just wanted
a friend.

1149
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,640
Push! Push!

1150
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,760
Huh?

1151
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,600
Off the throne.
He's off the throne. That's not good.

1152
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,320
Your time is up, son.

1153
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,720
As expected, you failed
in your promise.

1154
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,640
You failed in your quest.

1155
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,560
You are, in every sense
of the word,

1156
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,240
- a failure.
- And I thought your dad was mean.

1157
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,160
Hey, we both knew
it would end like this, right?

1158
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,640
You always set me up to fail.
At least in that respect,

1159
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,120
- I'm living up to your expectations.
- Silence!

1160
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,280
You've brought me
much pain, Loki.

1161
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,120
Right back
at you, Dad.

1162
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,880
- Hey!
- Tim, no!

1163
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,125
Hang on just a minute,
Grizzly Adams.

1164
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,760
I don't know how things work
in the god world,

1165
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:53,045
but you're his father,
he's your son.

1166
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,160
And even if you banish him,
he's still gonna be your son.

1167
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,800
There is nothing more important
in this entire universe

1168
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,120
than your relationship
with your family,

1169
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,760
especially
if you're immortal.

1170
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,160
You're like 1,000,
he's like 800,

1171
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,260
so you might as well
get things right now

1172
01:22:10,295 --> 01:22:12,320
and enjoy the rest
of your eternal life.

1173
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,880
Here's the thing.
Just take it.

1174
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,440
Okay?
Loosen up.

1175
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,840
Come on, son.
Let's go home.

1176
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,720
- Okay?
- Okay.

1177
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,040
Godspeed.

1178
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:52,480
Maybe now, I can help you
patch things up with Mom?

1179
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,200
Don't push it.

1180
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,760
A baby and a dog competing
for Dad's attention...

1181
01:23:12,795 --> 01:23:14,965
I love it.

1182
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,600
Simple, but it's...
it's got...

1183
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,520
- Spark?
- Yes.

1184
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,720
Where did you
get the idea?

1185
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,440
Well, I just kind of quit
trying so hard and...

1186
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,880
the idea just
came to me.

1187
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,160
It's great.

1188
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,840
Yay! Yay!

1189
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,920
Honey, oh.

1190
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,920
That was such
a good show!

1191
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,520
But I think you might
need to add another character.

1192
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:16,120
What?

1193
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,520
- Really?
- Yeah.

1194
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,240
What do you think about that,
Double A?

1195
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,200
A little brother
or sister?

1196
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,080
How does
that sound?

1197
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,560
# Life, it sails
on the ocean #

1198
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,480
# It can swallow
the hills alone #

1199
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,080
# But you don't have
to see to know #

1200
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,840
# Time, it can fly
with the wind #

1201
01:25:06,875 --> 01:25:10,400
# I imagine
the world above #

1202
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:14,400
# And it's all
inside your mind #

1203
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,680
# Would you follow
me tonight? #

1204
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,680
# Find what the world
has for us inside #

1205
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,680
# But one other way
is clear #

1206
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:34,280
# Now it's time
for you both to grow #

1207
01:25:34,315 --> 01:25:38,840
# Just close your eyes
and dream #

1208
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,760
# Of the endless
possibilities #

1209
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,480
# Life, it sails
on the ocean #

1210
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,320
# It can swallow
the hills alone #

1211
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,960
# But you don't
have to see to know #

1212
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,560
# Time, it can fly
with the wind #

1213
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:02,200
# I imagine
the world above #

1214
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,880
# And it's all
inside your mind #

1215
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,360
# Many places
hiding deep inside#

1216
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,760
# A world that's
right there fighting #

1217
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,880
# in all ourlives#

1218
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,440
# Life, it sails
on the ocean #

1219
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:35,400
# It can swallow
the hills alone #

1220
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,000
# But you don't
have to see to know #

1221
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:41,800
# Time, it can fly
with the wind #

1222
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,520
# I imagine
the world above #

1223
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,560
# And it's all
inside your mind #

1224
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:57,280
# And it's all
inside your mind. #

1225
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,880
# Okay #

1226
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,920
# Now, on the one
now #

1227
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,280
# One, two, three, oh! #

1228
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,200
# Likethis#

1229
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,040
# Sing with me #

1230
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,800
# We are all a family #

1231
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,840
# Sing with me #

1232
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,020
# My dog is on
my family tree #

1233
01:27:21,055 --> 01:27:23,160
# You know
you got it, baby #

1234
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,885
# Still, don't let it
drive you crazy #

1235
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:27,440
# There's no if or buts
or maybe... you can be a star #

1236
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,560
# You can reach your highest goal
if you search within your soul #

1237
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,520
# When you have control,
you know who you are #

1238
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,600
- # Sing with me #
- # Hey hey, yeah! #

1239
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,880
- # We are all a family #
- # We're all a family #

1240
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,240
- # Sing with me #
- # Yeah, yeah #

1241
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,760
# My dog is
on my family tree #

1242
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,160
# Put your hands
together now #

1243
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,080
# Shake it, shake it,
shake it #

1244
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,840
# 'Cause when we stick together,
we can make it, make it, make it #

1245
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:53,720
# Put yourself together
and don't hide behind a mask #

1246
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,280
# You can take it,
take it, take it #

1247
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,040
# All you got
to do is ask #

1248
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,920
- # Sing with me #
