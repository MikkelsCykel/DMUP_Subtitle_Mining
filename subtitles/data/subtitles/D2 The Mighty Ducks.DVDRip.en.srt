00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,881
- Bring it in, Gordon.
- Okay, Dad.

2
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:16,047
All right! Way to shoot, there.
You look good, son.

3
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:18,057
Thanks.

4
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,117
Listen, i want you
to remember this pond.

5
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,288
No matter how far you go,
don't forget your home.

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,517
Here in the third period, where the
Minnehaha Waves led by Gordon Bombay...

7
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,951
are in the lead four to one.
What a story this is.!

8
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,320
He went from a legal career to coach
the Minneapolis Mighty Ducks...

9
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,951
to a State Pee Wee
Championship last year.

10
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:56,518
And this year, at age 29...

11
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:59,963
he's one short step away
from the N.H.L.

12
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:03,867
There's the puck at center ice.
It's intercepted by Gordon Bombay.

13
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,963
Bombay across the blue line. He's in
all alone. Great chance for Bombay.

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,941
Dekes once, twice, in front.
He shoots. He scores.!

15
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,945
Yeah!

16
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:16,107
Gordon Bombay, unassisted,
puts his team up five to one.

17
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:18,811
Boy, he can still fly.

18
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:22,821
Ifhe keeps this up, I'd expect to see
him in the National Hockey League...

19
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,857
real soon.

20
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:43,743
Here's Bombay in his own zone. Comes up the
right wing side, steps away from one check there.

21
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,745
Still has the puck at center ice.
Gets pinned along the boards.

22
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,714
Fights to get free.

23
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:52,979
Aah! Aah!

24
00:02:56,423 --> 00:03:00,883
Oh, what a hit.!
Bombay goes down hard.

25
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:12,460
~Like the river flows ~

26
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,494
~Like the snow melts ~

27
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:22,671
~ You're gonna find your situation ~

28
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:25,472
~ Changing for the better ~

29
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,979
~Like the melting snow ~

30
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,177
~Just let your troubles go ~

31
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,589
~ 'Cause you and I ~

32
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,186
~ will get through this together ~

33
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:51,267
- ~Some days seem to drag on forever ~
- it's great to be home.

34
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,431
~ You need all your strength ~

35
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:57,340
- ~Just to keep your head together ~
- Hello,Jan!

36
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,846
Welcome back, Gordon.
Get in! Get in!

37
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,678
Thanks for comin' down to get me.

38
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,880
Great to see ya.

39
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:10,889
Hans couldn't make it?

40
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,858
Ah, don't get me
started on that strudel-head.

41
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,952
He went back
to the old country for the summer.

42
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,691
Left me to run
the shop all by myself.

43
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:20,733
Wanted to visit our mama.

44
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,325
She loves him more, you know.

45
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:29,737
~ This too will pass ~

46
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:35,646
~ This too will pass ~~

47
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:42,148
- Sorry, did i wake you?
- Hey, Charlie.

48
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:45,554
- Hey, Coach. it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

49
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,890
We really missed you.

50
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:51,829
For breakfast, my specialty:
Jan's hasen-

51
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,832
Hasenpfeffer and eggs.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,891
I thought I smelled
something burning.

53
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,563
i see you've met
my new apprentice.

54
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,038
Jan told me you did
this job when you were my age.

55
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:04,338
- That's right. i hope he pays you more than he paid me.
- You got paid?

56
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:07,608
Eat, everybody, before
the hasenpfeffer gets cold.

57
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:23,061
That was a good day.

58
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,063
Look at Charlie. God, he's grown.

59
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,190
Oh. They do that.

60
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:31,465
Since his mother remarried, he
started spending a lot of time here.

61
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,802
i just had to hire him.

62
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:37,036
- i should've kept in touch more.
- But you are here now.

63
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,044
So what's your plan?

64
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,046
Have you talked
to Ducksworth?

65
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:44,982
No, no. i'm not a lawyer,
Jan, i'm a player.

66
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:48,452
But your injury,
it requires rest and time.

67
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,955
Yeah, time is something
i don't have a whole lot of.

68
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:55,620
i was this close to the N.H.L.,Jan.
i was back in the game.

69
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,289
And, man, i was alive.

70
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,300
Have you thought about coaching?

71
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:05,667
After all, you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

72
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:08,674
Well, coaching the Ducks was one
of the best things in my life...

73
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,676
but i can't make a living
coaching Pee Wee hockey.

74
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:13,008
Where there's a way,
there must be a will.

75
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,015
My hockey suppliers tell me
Team U.S.A. is still without a coach...

76
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,017
for the
Junior Goodwill Games.

77
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,485
Sounds great. Give 'em
a call for me,Jan.

78
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:25,149
- Maybe i can sharpen their skates.
- Don't knock skate sharpening.

79
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,523
i know.
it's a great skill,Jan.

80
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:31,086
But i don't want to spend the rest of my life
sharpening skates in this rinky-dink town.

81
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,325
i want something better.

82
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,266
Something bigger.

83
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,769
Whoa!

84
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:52,843
- You don't have to do them right now.
- Oh, thanks.

85
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,853
You have a customer.
Go and help him.

86
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,185
Then come back and do them.

87
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,197
- Can i help you?
- Oh!

88
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:08,291
Oops, sorry.
Got away from me. Hi.

89
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:12,168
Oh, wow, yeah.
You look great. Yeah.

90
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,798
- Yeah, much better than your pictures.
- Thanks.

91
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:16,967
i'm, uh, Don Tibbles...

92
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,068
Senior V.P.,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.

93
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:22,581
How's the knee? i have a doctor in Los
Angeles i want to take a look at it.

94
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,016
- He's doing great things with baboon ligaments.
- Hendrix Hockey, huh?

95
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:29,145
What exactly is it that
you want, Mr. Tibbles?

96
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:31,417
i want you, Gordon.

97
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:34,426
i want the next coach ofTeam
U.S.A. to become a household name.

98
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:36,689
i want you to become
synonymous with winning...

99
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,754
and winning to become
synonymous with Hendrix.

100
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:43,030
Er, wait a minute.
Y- You're joking, right? i mean...

101
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:47,129
- this is a joke.
- it's no joke. This is the real thing, Gordon.

102
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:51,070
You want me to coach
Team U.S.A.?

103
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,442
Your friend Jan's been
pitching you for months.

104
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:56,914
Gordon, what you did with the
Ducks, there was magic, and we-

105
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,917
and by we, i mean
Hendrix Hockey...

106
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,921
theJunior Goodwill Games and your country
- need that magic.

107
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:06,447
What do ya say, coach?

108
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:11,429
Come on.
Let's round up those Ducks.

109
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,829
- Got a lot of work to do.
- Gordon.

110
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,800
Use this.

111
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,829
- Thanks,Jan.
- Go get 'em, Gordon.

112
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,820
Hey, Charlie.!

113
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,490
Hey.! You wanna
play some hockey?

114

Come on, man! Move it!

Yes! Yeah!

117

Jesse, we're back!

Let's go get Averman.

- Look out!
- You can't-

120
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,626
What are you kids
doin' over there!

121
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,825
- Whoa, hey!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

132
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:27,054

Oh, look.

- Whoa!

141
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:13,439
He's comin' across the goalie,
between his legs- Score!

142
00:12:13,513 --> 00:12:16,539
Hey, cake-eater,you wanna

143
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,948
- Yeah, come on!

144
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:25,485

145
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,492
Hey, man, bring 'em on.

Ow! Ooh!
Hi.

148
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,569
Ducks!

149
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,767
I still can't believe
they beat us last year.

150
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,538
Well, let's do
somethin' about it.

151
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:48,705
Yeah.! All right.!

154
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:03,654
- Come on. Over here. Over here.
- Shh.

155
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,323
They're sittin' ducks.

156
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,163
- Here they come.
- i love this.

157
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,169
They are so stupid.

158
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:14,832
One large order of
shredded duck comin'up.

159
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:18,035
- They won't know what hit 'em.
- i know.

160
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,377
Who said that?

161
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,117
Hi, guys.

Okay! All right!

173
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,058

174
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:19,264

175
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,272

176
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,207
All right! All right!

177
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:27,075
Awesome.! Wow.! Who's in there?

178
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,376
Can't be from this neighborhood.

179
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,848
Hey, guys! i'm Don Tibbles,
Hendrix Hockey Apparel.

180
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,352
We're your official sponsors.

00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,253
Yeah, yeah! Absolutely!

182
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:39,416
Hey.

183
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:43,724
Nice wheels. i used to
ride around in one of these.

184
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,730
Well, i got something
to show you.

185
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:49,029
This is your endorsement
contract with Hendrix.

186
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:52,036
i been tryin' to figure this out.
What does Hendrix want with me?

187
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:55,631
- i-i'm just a coach.
- Pat Riley, Bear Bryant...

188
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,938
Mike Ditka,
are theyjust coaches?

189
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,275
Gordon, today coaches have
images. Images mean dollars.

190
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:05,408
i sell you, you sell the sport.
We both get rich. How's that sound?

191
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:08,885
- Don't get me wrong. i don't have anything against making money.
- No, Gordon.

192
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,423
A lot of money.

193
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:15,255
You're gonna pay me that much
to endorse sportswear?

194
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,456
Gordon, life can be great
when you know the right people.

195
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,658
What do you say?

196
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,963
- Got a pen?
- Oh,yeah.

197
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,468
Former Pee Wee coach and minor
league player Gordon Bombay...

198
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:30,839
makes the move to the national stage as
he steps behind the bench for Team U.S.A.

199
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,108
Coach Bombay's Ducks will bejoined
by some of the top young players...

200
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,115
from around the United States.

201
00:15:37,183 --> 00:15:40,346
Tell me about my new kids.
- That's Luis Mendoza.

202
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,786
He's from our Miami club.
A real speedster. Incredible skater.

203
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:47,485
I clocked him at 1.9 seconds,
blue line to blue line.

204
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:59,200
- Good-lookin' skater. - Very
good-lookin'. What do you think, Guy?

205
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,968
- Shut up, Averman.
- Oof!.

206
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,975
He has one minor problem.

207
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:06,534
Aah!

208
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,672
- Has a little trouble stopping.
- i'd say so.

209
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:11,842
- Are you okay?
- Need some help?

210
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:15,045
Yeah. i'm all right.
i almost had it that time.

211
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:21,985
Yee-haw! How is everyone!
Y'all ready to play some puck?

212
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:25,292
- Hey, look.
it's Hopalong Gretzky.

213
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:27,855
That's Dwayne Robertson
from Austin.

214
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,867
He's the best puck handler
I've ever seen.

215
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:32,699
- You mean for his age.
- No, i don't.

216
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:36,037
Hey, this is easier than
ropin' hogs! Yee-haw!

217
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,506
- He does have a tendency to showboat.
- Yahoo!

218
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,037
- Wow.
- There's Julie "The Cat'"Gaffney.

219
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:47,017
She won the state championship
for Maine three years in a row.

220
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:49,247
Well, we have a goalie.
Goldberg.

221
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:52,621
All right! Bring 'em on, man! i'm ready
for this! i'm the man! i'm the man!

222
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:55,159
Ohh.!

223
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:57,320
Uh, help.

224
00:16:57,396 --> 00:17:00,456
Watch this.

225
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:07,697
Well, we...
could use a backup.

226
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,867
Isn't that that kid from the
Olympics? The figure skater?

227
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:13,844
Yup. Ken Wu.
What can I say?

228
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:16,381
I convinced him that hockey
had more of a future.

229
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,577
We put a stick in his hands
and nobody's been able to touch him.

230
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:25,347
Yeah. Show time!

231
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:28,621
- That guy's a teenager?
- ~ Don't you know that ~

232
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:32,755
~ Everything's on fire, yeah ~

233
00:17:32,832 --> 00:17:35,630
- Uh, yeah. Hormones.
- He's a goon.

234
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:39,034
- Ohh!
- C'mon, Tex! Sing it with me!

235
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:42,404
- Uh-uh! No!
- ~ Everything ~

236
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:45,410
- Here ya go, sweetie!
- My kids don't play that kinda hockey.

237
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,639
i believe they're
called enforcers, Gordon.

238
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:50,648
- When you play iceland, you're gonna need him.
- My little man!

239
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:53,549
- Who does this guy
think he is?

240
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,213
- All right, that's it!
- Let me take care of this.

241
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,996
Everybody freeze!

242
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:11,428
Now, we didn't
come here to fight!

243
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,438
We came here to play hockey!

244
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:16,839
We're Team U.S.A.
You represent your country.

245
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,605
- That's right.
- Now, i want you-

246
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,612
To be all that you
can be, right?

247
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,615
Ya gotta raise yourself up,
guys! Ya got-

248
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:27,743
- All right, now. Let's
start with the scrimmage.

249
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,584
Great! Scrimmage!
You heard your coach! Now-

250
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,817
Hey. You don't need me here.

251
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,827
i've got an appointment anyway.
i've got to see Miss MacKay.

252
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,420
- She's the team tutor.
- Don?

253
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,000
Come on.

254
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,832
You'll get it back
at the end of the school term.

255
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:48,373
All right, Ducks.

256
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:51,137
Show 'em what you got!
Let's scrimmage!

257
00:18:53,746 --> 00:18:57,147
- Great day for hockey, ain't it?
- Sure is, cowboy.

258
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,344
Yee-haw!

259
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,217
- Hey, man, take it easy! Slow down!
- Goldberg, look out!

260
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:11,124
Oh, no!

261
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,290
This guy's gotta
learn how to stop.

262
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:16,698
- Thanks for breaking my fall.
- Anytime.

263
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,539
- Let's go, defense!
- Whoa!

264
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,478
Come on!
Dig it out of there!

265
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,480
Let's go! Come on!

266
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,482
Haven't you guys been training
in the off-season?

267
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,883
You know, i knew
we forgot somethin'.

268
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,990
Good shot, Adam.
Way to show 'em.!

269
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:45,422
- How do you feel,
tough guy?

270
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,599
Ding! Round one.

271
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait 'til you meet these kids.
They're just fantastic.

272
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:59,169
- Look out!
- It's Fulton.! Look out for his shot.!

273
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,611
What a bunch of wusses!

274
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:04,308
Oh!

275
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:10,453
Half of'em are ringers from various
parts of the U.S. Then the other half-

276
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:12,457
- Duck!
- That's right. The Ducks.

277
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,691
Hello? Mr. Tibbles?

278
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:19,595
Mr.. Tibbles?
Mr. Tibbles, can you hear me?

279
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:22,429
Mr. Tibbles, wake up.

280
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,766
Oh, Mr. Tibbles,
are you all right?

281
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:29,535
Oh, uh, i-i'll have the cheeseburger,
fries, and a chocolate shake, please.

282
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:35,080
i think he'll be okay.
We'll keep an eye on him.

283
00:20:35,147 --> 00:20:38,082
Oh, i'm sorry. He didn't
have a chance to introduce us.

284
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,744
i'm Michele MacKay,
their tutor.

285
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:43,117
Hi, i'm Coach Bombay,
their coach.

286
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:46,589
- Who said we need a tutor? - Yeah.
Really. - i don't need no school.

287
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:49,355
Now, Miss MacKay,
we're America's team here.

288
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:51,395
Shouldn't we just
be concentrating on hockey?

289
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:53,590
May i suggest
optional attendance?

290
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:56,294
- i agree.
- Yeah. Good idea.

291
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,599
- Well, that's not a bad idea.
- Call me Goldberg.

292
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:03,073
Goldberg. Yes.
School will be optional.

293
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,337
However-

294
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,780
However, should you not attend,
you will not be eligible to play.

295
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:13,784
Oh, that's unfair.!
Man, can she do that?

296
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:17,015
Hey, is that a tattoo?
is it real?

297
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:20,024
- Get away from me.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:26,658
Well, i'm just here to tutor the kids and
provide them with a little adult supervision.

299
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,839
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh!

300
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:38,434
- That was awesome. Are you okay?
- Yes.

301
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,535
All right.!

302
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:45,516
- Sorry.
- Yeah, sorry.

303
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:47,643
We're okay.

304
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:53,190
This is more crowded than
a truckload of goats.

305
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:56,193
Somebody better
watch their hands.

306
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,286
Yeah, someone licked me!

307
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:01,822
- Oh, i smell somethin'. Eewh.
- Eewh.

308
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,027
Goldberg!

309
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:07,038
- it wasn't me.
- No, it was me!

310
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:09,074
Thank you.

311
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:12,076
i don't know how to make
this any clearer.

312
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,305
You are a team.

313
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,043
And to win this thing,
you have to work as one.

314
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:21,245
Now as one, skate.

315
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,653
Whoa!

316
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,658
Everyone goes their own way,
everyone falls down.

317
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,660
Now get up and try it again.

318
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,220
- All right, all of you move to your right. Now.
- Who made you boss?

319
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,233
- Everyone to the left.
- Yeah, left guys. Come on.

320
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:40,067
- Aw, man.
- You guys can argue all you want...

321
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:43,074
but i am not untying you
until you move as one.

322
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:47,942
Now you're learning!
Communication! That's it!

323
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,174
Good, together.
Move together.

324
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,547
Charge! All right!

325
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:54,552
- Right turn!
- Turn right.

326
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,181
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
All right! Knock wood, Charlie.

327
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:02,216
You guys are startin' to look like
hockey players. i'm proud of ya, team.

328
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:04,228
You worked hard today.

329
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,992
But hockey
should also be fun.

330
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,363
- Rancher Dwayne.
- Yes, sir!

331
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:12,427
- Round me up some stray
cattle there. - Uh-oh.

332
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,438
- My pleasure!
- Whoa!

333
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:18,875
~ Together we stand
Divided we fall ~

334
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:22,277
~ Come on, people
Let's all get on the ball ~

335
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,406
~And work together ~

336
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:28,476
~ Come on, come on
Let's work together ~

337
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,545
~Now, people ~

338
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:35,286
~Because together we will stand
every boy, every woman ~

339
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,294
~And man ~

340
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,162
~Make someone happy,y'all
Now make someone smile ~

341
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,796
~Let's all work together
and make life worthwhile ~

342
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:48,772
~Let's work together ~

343
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:52,004
~ Come on, come on
Let's work together ~

344
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:54,602
~ Uh hey now, people ~

345
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,811
~Because together we will stand
every boy, every woman ~

346
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,820
~And man ~~

347
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:13,363
- ~ Ta da ~~
- Oh! That's awesome!

348
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,033
- Hey, y'all. That's us!
- Duh, whatta ya know?

349
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,504
- Today,
it's a Wheaties box.

350
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:26,636
Tomorrow, it's video games, action
figures, lunch boxes. The sky is the limit.

351
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,806
Now,just to make sure
that everybody knows who you are...

352
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:32,544
try on one of these.

353
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:36,714
- Oh, that's so cool!
- Brought to you by those wonderful people at Hendrix...

354
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,225
for all your hockey needs.
Fulton, there you go. Coach.

355
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:43,318
Everybody take your own. I'm not
gonna give 'em out to everybody.

356
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:50,365
That's nice, Coach, but we're Ducks.
This stuff says "Hendrix" all over it.

357
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,801
Well, yeah, they're
our sponsors, Charlie.

358
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:55,066
So what?
Can't we be U.S.A. Ducks?

359
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,233
Or at least
keep our own colors?

360
00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,869
it's business stuff, Charlie.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:04,580
- What'd ya think?
- i love it. it's cool.

362
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:11,154
Ancient Greece was the beginning
of Western Civilization.

363
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:14,715
See, in Greece, they didn't
have professional sports...

364
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,920
or Wheaties boxes.

365
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:19,520
So the athletes competed
for another reason.

366
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:22,089
- Anybody?
- Falafels?

367
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,102
- Ohh. Greg.
- You wish, Goldberg.

368
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,230
- Charlie?
- Pride.

369
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:32,073
That's right. The various
city-states waved their flags...

370
00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:34,078
and wore
their home colors proudly.

371
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,341
Did America always dominate?

372
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:38,246
- Fulton.
- That's a good question.

373
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:42,185
- No. America wasn't
around back then.

374
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:45,018
- it's okay.
- Don't forget that compared to other countries...

375
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,617
America is still young,
still forming its own identity.

376
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:53,631
- America is a teenagerjust like you.
- Like us?

377
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:57,294
You bet.
A little awkward at times...

378
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:01,635
but always right there
on the verge of greatness.

379
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:05,569
~ i don't know but i been told ~

380
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:08,943
~ Team U.S.A.'s gonna win the gold ~

381
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:10,879
~ U.S.A.'s gonna win the gold ~

382
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,543
~Listen up and listen good ~

383
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:14,950
~ Listen up and listen good ~

384
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,649
~ We're all headed for Hollywood ~

385
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,319
- ~Sound off ~
- ~ One, two ~

386
00:26:22,394 --> 00:26:24,555
- ~Sound off ~
- ~ Three, four ~

387
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,157
- ~Bring 'em on down ~
- ~ One, two, three, four ~~

388
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:40,442
Welcome to Los Angeles, California,
and theJunior Goodwill Games...

389
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,972
as teams from around the world arrive to
compete in both winter and summer events.

390
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,781
The U.S.A. is expected to
score well in the medal count...

391
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:51,414
especially in basketball,
swimming and hockey.

392
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,426
And there's Team U.S.A. hockey
led by Coach Gordon Bombay.

393
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:59,055
They're looking fit and anxious
to begin the competition.

394
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:04,865
Tonight's game matches
the second-seeded Team U.S.A...

395
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:07,770
against the tenth-seeded team,
Trinidad Tobago.

396
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,935
This marks the first game for Team
U.S.A. in this double-elimination...

397
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,274
winner-take-all
tournament.

398
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:19,784
Gordon Bombay looks to have his team well
in control here. They lead six to nothing.

399
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:30,793
This is sewn up tight!

400
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:33,160
All right! Yeah!

401
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:37,531
Yeah, high-five some more. Man, my
little brother could score on these guys.

402
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:41,663
- Go bother him, then. - Ha-ha!
i ain't even got a little brother!

403
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,867
Hey,Jesse.! Quit gabbin'
and get on the ice.

404
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:45,876
Show me
you want it, son. Go!

405
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah, show us
you want it son. Go!

406
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:52,876
'Kay.

407
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:05,058
- Ohh!
Face-off!.

408
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,064
Hey, what's
your problem, man?

409
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:10,033
Jesse, forget about it.!
Let's go.!

410
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:13,765
U.S.A. penalty, number nine,
Hall. Two minutes, roughing.

411
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,899
He dissed you bad, G.

412
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:19,739
- Yeah? Come here, man!
- Ha-ha. Bye-bye.

413
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:22,974
Have a nice day.

414
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:33,151
- All right, Fulton, let's have some fun!
- Yeah, Portman, let's do it!

415
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:43,099
- All right!
- Yeah! Yeah!

416
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,329
- That's it.
- All right, Portman, take it!

417
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,607
- Way to go! Hey, hey!
- Yeah!

418
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:53,235
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

419
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,779
- Yeah!
- All right!

420
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:59,248
- Yeah!
- Look at those guys! Look at 'em!

421
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:02,753
They're the Bash Brothers!

422
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:05,619
Hey, ya got a girl
in the stands?

423
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,624
No. Scouts, man.
Look at 'em.

424
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:11,287
Don't worry about scouts, Adam.
Just play your best.

425
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:14,332
Team U.S.A. loses the puck
at center ice.

426
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,334
Here's Bellafonte across the
blue line with a great move.

427
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,838
Walks right down in front.
He shoots, he scores.!

428
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:24,034
Way to go, man!
Way to go!

429
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:35,179
Nearing the end of the game, Team
U.S.A. with it out at center ice.

430
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:38,620
Here's Connie Moreau. Moreau
stick-handling in the Trinidad zone.

431
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,182
Moreau still with it, moves around
a pileup, gives it to Kenny Wu.

432
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,195
Wu, the former figure skater, back behind
the net, ducks underneath the check.

433
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:47,993
Moves around the it.
It's a wraparound. He scores.!

434
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:51,302
All right, way to go.!

435
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:55,430
- That wasn't a game,
that was a statement!

436
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:01,334
Ladies and gentlemen,
Team U.S.A. hockey.

437
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,974
And the man chosen to lead
them to the gold, Gordon Bombay.

438
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,144
- Bring the bear up here. This
is Henry, the Hendrix bear.

439
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,520
- Hello, everyone.!
- Guys, I want you to come in, get some shots with the bear.

440
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:15,116
Big wave.! Big wave.!
Wave to everybody.!

441
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:19,027
- Hello, everybody! it's great to be here!
- Got that? Great.

442
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:22,897
Thanks a lot. Okay, we're gonna
open it up to questions. Yes.

443
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,562
Team U.S.A., how does
it feel competing...

444
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:28,128
on the international level
here in Los Angeles?

445
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:30,640
- Um-
- Feels good. Love it.

446
00:30:30,709 --> 00:30:34,270
Coach Bombay, the Vikings from
iceland are the heavy favorite.

447
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:37,177
Their coach has already
guaranteed victory.

448
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:42,186
- How are you gonna handle them?
- Um... hard work.

449
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:45,985
i think our team is ready to go
up against the best in the world.

450
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:49,356
We're not worried about 'em.
Iceland may be tough, but, uh...

451
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:51,987
we're Team U.S.A. and
we're goin' all the way.

452
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:55,225
- Yeah.! All right, Coach.!
- Okay, that's it.

453
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,235
Thank you very much.
Thank you, everybody.

454
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:01,830
- Real good. Did good.
- Team U.S.A. 's going down.

455
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:05,001
That's where
you're going.

456
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:08,807
See you on the ice, Bombay!

457
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:12,379
That's, uh, Stansson.

458
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,714
Coach of the Iceland team.
He's wound a little tight.

459
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:18,051
Stansson from the N.H.L.? Wolf"The
Dentist" Stansson is coaching?

460
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:21,752
- You didn't tell me that.
- it's all right!

461
00:31:21,826 --> 00:31:24,056
- That guy's a dentist?
- That was his nickname.

462
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,859
Played one year of pro,
collected more teeth than goals.

463
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:30,231
- He even punched out his coach.
- They ran him out of the league and the country.

464
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:34,033
What happened to freedom of
speech, huh? isn't this America?

465
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:36,835
That's his team?
Those guys are huge!

466
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:39,570
- One more thing- - He's
already told you what he thinks.

467
00:31:39,644 --> 00:31:41,578
- Gordon.
- Thanks. How'd i do?

468
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:45,582
- Great. it was quite a circus, huh?
- it's all part of the game.

469
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:49,450
A giant polar bear with sunglasses
is part of hockey now?

470
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,455
i guess the game's
really changed.

471
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:54,651
Gordon, come on.
CNN, one on one.

472
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:56,660
CNN.

473
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:59,663
Gordon.! Just one question.!
One question.!

474
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:03,497
- Hello, there, missy.
How about a bear hug?

475
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:06,833
Tibbles, what are we
doin' here in Malibu?

476
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,465
This is your new place, man.
it's our way of saying "Thank you. "

477
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:12,510
You take care of Hendrix,
Hendrix is gonna take care of you.

478
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:16,513
i can't help feeling a little guilty.
Shouldn't i be closer to the team?

479
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,850
Whoa.

480
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:34,760
You know, they don't
need me 24 hours a day.

481
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:38,200
- i'm sure they're just fine in the dorms.
- Yeah.

482
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,847
Shh. Do it quiet.

483
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:56,716
All right.
Let me get the hand.

484
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:59,723
- Hurry.
- i'm hurrying! Shh!

485
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,282
Go ahead.

486
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,624
Okay, that's good.
Feather.

487
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,704
Shh.

488
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:45,068
Ah.

489
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:47,661
A little tune-age
to go to sleep by?

490
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,333
- Yeah.
- All right.

491
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,376
- ~ Ain't seen nothin' yet ~
- All right.

492
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:56,540
~ B-B-Baby, you just
ain't seen nothin' yet ~

493
00:33:56,614 --> 00:33:59,674
~ Here's somethin' Here's somethin'
that you just won't forget ~

494
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,684
Sweet dreams, dude.

495
00:34:14,432 --> 00:34:18,391
What's goin' on?

496
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,405
Yeah! Whoo!

497
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:24,306
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

498
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:28,710
It's great to be here. The guys at Hendrix
Hockey have been absolutely fantastic.

499
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,910
But i got a game against italy, so
i'll talk to you right after we win it.

500
00:34:32,984 --> 00:34:34,918
Thank you.
Thanks, Coach. Good-bye.

501
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:37,113
Good luck, Coach.

502
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:40,988
- Get 'em tonight.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

503
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,084
- Oh. i'm sorry.
- i'm sorry. Uh-

504
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:46,494
No, it was my fault.
i was clumsy.

505
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:49,055
- You're Coach Bombay.
- That's right.

506
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:51,102
You play well.

507
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,468
- Well, thank you.
- i mean your team. Your team plays well.

508
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,007
i- i know
what you meant.

509
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,444
So who are you?

510
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,343
i'm the trainer
for the iceland team.

511
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,644
My name is Marria.

512
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:18,925
Well, you have a way
with the ladies.

513
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:24,694
We haven't formally met. i'm
Gordon Bombay, coach ofTeam U.S.A.

514
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,760
i know my competition.
i know you.

515
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,773
Yeah, but do you know
the real me?

516
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:38,378
You're full of confidence.
Cocky. American.

517
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,611
i like that.

518
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,552
it will make our triumph
even more enjoyable.

519
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:45,816
Your triumph?

520
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,484
Lighten up a little bit.
We're all just here to have-

521
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,551
A little fun, right?

522
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:53,028
Don't you worry.

523
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:56,555
We will. We will.

524
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,873
It's been all Team U.S.A. tonight.

525
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:11,177
They lead Italy six to nothing.
They've really dominated this game.

526
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,513
Italy with the puck
across the line.

527
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:16,247
D'Agistino shoots.
Glove save by Goldberg.

528
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,721
Have no fear!
Goldberg is here!

529
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,588
Hey, man, there was nothing
on that. How about a real shot?

530
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:24,025
Hey, paisan, meatballs
are slowing you down?

531
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:27,360
Uh, how do you say,
in italiano, "wussy"?

532
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:30,162
Break it up! Break it up!

533
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,398
- Goldberg!
- What'd i say?

534
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:36,065
Hey, look!

535
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,672

Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!

537
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:04,091
Okay, people.

539
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:12,400

00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:15,139
~Mr. Big Stuff ~

541
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:17,147
~ Who do you think you are ~

542
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,775
~Mr. Big Stuff ~

543
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,877
~ You're never gonna get my love ~

544
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:25,218
~Not because you wear ~

545
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,884
- ~All those fancy clothes ~
- ~ Oh yeah ~

546
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,427
~And have a big fine car ~

547
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:32,622
~ Yes ya do now-~~

548
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:35,825
Gordon, take a look around you.
You gotta change your thinking.

549
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,835
- What'd ya mean?
- Ya see, in this town, everybody is something other...

550
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:42,339
- than what they really are.
- Hi, i'm Terry. i'll be your server.

551
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:45,638
Terry, let me ask you a question.
What do you really want to be?

552
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,644
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

553
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:50,647
- Head of production for a major studio.
- Yes, perfect.

554
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:53,149
Thank you. We're done.
See what i mean?

555
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:55,913
Everybody wants to be
something bigger.

556
00:37:55,987 --> 00:38:00,253
Listen, all i'm saying
is you could be big. i mean Costas big.

557
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:02,987
N.H.L. stars Neely,
Chelios and Robitaille.

558
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:07,157
Cam, Chris and Luc, this is
Gordon Bombay, coach ofTeam U.S.A.

559
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,997
Gordon, Greg Louganis,
Kristi Yamaguchi, our Olympians.

560
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:12,866
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

561
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:15,337
Kareem, i'd like you to meet
Gordon Bombay, coach ofTeam U.S.A.

562
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:17,636
- Hey, Gordon, how ya doin'?
- Glad to meet ya.

563
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:21,008
Coaching. Okay,
two words about that: Pat Riley.

564
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,138
What it is, it's a loafer.

565
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:25,842
And we'll call it
the Air Bombay loafer...

566
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,147
for kids who wanna coach.

567
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:31,052
You think there's enough kids
out there who wanna... coach?

568
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:33,056
Absolutely.

569
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,455
This don't look like
no Rodeo Drive to me.

570
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,462
No, that's Ro-day-o Drive.

571
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,693
You can't fool me. i saw it on
the sign. it says Rodeo Drive.

572
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:45,395
No, see, there's
an accent at- Never mind.

573
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,064
i don't get it. This is Beverly
Hills. Where's all the hills?

574
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:52,075
- Where's that 90210 school? What about the Hillbillies?
- Where are the movie stars?

575
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,134
Wasn't that the captain
from The Love Boat?

576
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:57,147
- Let's go check out some stores.
- Great. i gotta buy my mom a T-shirt.

577
00:38:57,215 --> 00:38:59,513
- She'll love it.
- Yeah.

578
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,576
Let's think about it
and go get an espresso, okay?

579
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:06,188
Maybe they're not open.

580
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:09,351
Hey, there's a doorbell here.

581
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:12,863
i'm sorry. We do not allow
unsupervised children into the store.

582
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:17,867
- Can you make an exception?
- No, now go away or the police will be called.

583
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:20,369
if we were in Texas,
this wouldn't have happened.

584
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,929
- We'll find some other place.
Step back from the vehicle.

585
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:26,272
- You have activated
the theft-deterrent device.

586
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:30,440
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, we'd like four burgers. What do you want to drink?

587
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:33,951
You kids get outta here!
Quit playin' with that thing!

588
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:37,715
- I'm sorry.
We do not allow unsupervised-

589
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:42,123
i'm sure Uncle Aaron will be very upset to
hear we were treated with such disrespect.

590
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,127
Aaron? Aaron Spelling?

591
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:47,392
No, Hank Aaron.
Of course, Aaron Spelling.

592
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:50,593
Now, i want you to make yourselves
comfortable. Carole, beverages.

593
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:53,193
And i will be with you
in a moment.

594
00:39:56,641 --> 00:40:00,441
- Gosh, this store sure is nice.
- Goldberg, my man.

595
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,775
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

596
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:07,613
i know you boys.
You're, um-

597
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:09,949
- Aaron Spelling's nephew.
- No.

598
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:13,957
- Team U.S.A. hockey.
- You guys are just great!

599
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:16,892
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks.

600
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:18,952
Now, a gift for your mother.

601
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,262
You'll want something light, airy.
it is summer, after all.

602
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:25,894
i'm going to show you
my private collection.

~How about givin'me

614
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:58,768
- No, it's not quite what i'm looking for.

615
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:03,799
~Here it is

616
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,843
~Here it is ~

617
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,107

619
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:16,318
~Do you want it
Do you know how-~~

620
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:18,617
Well, gentlemen, did you
see anything you liked?

621
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:22,181
You know, i gotta be honest.
My mom really needs...

622
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,125
a bikini.

623
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,363
- Hey!
- You little brats don't ever come back into this store.!

624
00:41:29,433 --> 00:41:31,458
Anti-children!

625
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,471
No, no, no. it's not a sneaker,
it's a street shoe.

626
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:37,133
Like coaches wear.

627
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:39,142
Yeah, come on in.

628
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,508
Sure, with a pump.
That'll work.

629
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,481
Go ahead, sit down.
We'll talk about it at dinner. Okay.

630
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,745
What's up?

631
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:51,721
i wanna play.
When am i gonna get my chance?

632
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:53,757
Julie, Goldberg's
on a hot streak.

633
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,986
i gotta stick with him
as long as we're winning.

634
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,029
i understand. But i left
my team in Maine...

635
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,326
to show
the world what i can do.

636
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:03,333
Just give it time.

637
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:06,393
You will show the world.
i promise.

638
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,495
Okay?

639
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:11,167
All right.
Now get outta here.

640
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:16,671
~ Bom, bom ~

641
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:19,773
Look at them. Fulton.
Fulton, talk to 'em.

642
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:22,786
Uh, hey, ladies. Nice night
for a stroll, wouldn't you say?

643
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:24,947
That was a good one!

644
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,956
No curfew's
gonna keep us down.

645
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:29,117
- Yeah!
- ice cream.

646
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:32,287
Wait a minute. I thought
Iceland was covered with ice.

647
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:35,423
- No, it's very green.
- i thought Greenland was green.

648
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:39,765
- Greenland is covered with ice, and iceland is very nice.
- Ahh.

649
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:43,568
i imagine it'd be
like Minnesota, where you're from.

650
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:46,439
How do you know
where i'm from?

651
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,705
i asked around.

652
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:51,680
Okay.

653
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:56,145
Look at this.
She's an iceland chick.

654
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,485
What's he doin'with her?
Great coach we got.

655
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:08,264
All right, are we ready
for warm-ups?

656
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:11,824
- Let's go!
- Whoa! He's stylin'! Mr. Coach!

657
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:13,837
Yeah, all right.
All right.

658
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:18,274
- Nice jacket. Did you get
- two pairs of pants with that?

659
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:21,505
- Good night last night, Coach?
- Yeah, it was fine.

660
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:23,513
What'd ya do?

661
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:26,675
Oh, i... just watched some TV,
got to bed early.

662
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,015
But not without
a little dessert, right?

663
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:32,451
A little
ice cream, maybe?

664
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:35,424
Nice haircut.
What, ya lose a bet?

665
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:42,188
Live from Los Angeles, welcome
to theJunior Goodwill Games.

666
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:45,429
Tonight's matchup, Team U.S.A.
faces off against Team iceland.

667
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:49,030
- Cakewalk.
- We have with us Greg Goldberg, goaltender for Team U.S.A.

668
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:52,701
Greg, what is it gonna take to beat
these feisty icelanders tonight?

669
00:43:52,777 --> 00:43:56,543
i think it'll take a supreme
individual effort by me, Greg Goldberg.

670
00:43:56,614 --> 00:44:00,209
- Let's play hockey, gentlemen.
- Okay, cut it.

671
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,775
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to today's game.

672
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:07,051
This is a very important matchup,
Team U.S.A. against Iceland...

673
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:10,150
in what could be a preview
of the championship game.

674
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:12,218
Iceland, coached by
Wolf"The Dentist'"Stansson.

675
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,924
He'll be taking on
Gordon Bombay.

676
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:18,668
Good luck, there,
Coach.

677
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:21,398
You'll sure need it.

678
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:30,078
What does that mean?

679
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,910
You'll find out.

680
00:44:34,885 --> 00:44:37,251
Come on, fool! Get up!

681
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,915
- You ran at him unprovoked.
- Huh?

682
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:43,757
- Calm down, son. You're out of the game.
- Give me a break!

683
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:48,322
You're throwin' him out? You can't do
that! it's three seconds into the game!

684
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,635
Oh, man.

685
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:03,102
Come and get it.

686
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,448
Wake up, defense.
Can't do this all myself.

687
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:17,586
Hey, Goldberg! if that puck was a
cheeseburger, you'd stop it! Ha-ha-ha!

688
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:31,138
Yee-haw!

689
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,268
- Pass the puck, Dwayne! Come on!
- Dwayne, give me the puck.!

690
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,540
- Pass it to Fulton!
- Dwayne, pass it!

691
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:41,343
- Look out, Dwayne!
- Yee-haw! Aah!

692
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:45,155
Oh, man!

693
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:48,953
i can't believe this is
happening! i should be out there!

694
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:51,961
...missing big Dean Portman,
it's one-nothing iceland.

695
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:55,465
iceland outhitting and
outskating Team U.S.A...

696
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,093
all over the ice
in the first period.

697
00:45:58,169 --> 00:46:00,103
Here's Gunnar Stahl
again for Iceland.

698
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:04,403
Team U.S.A. can't stop him.
On the backhand, saved by Goldberg.

699
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:09,639
Captain Adam Banks has it for Team
U.S.A. He gets knocked head over heels.

700
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:14,741
Team U.S.A. still with the puck.
Luis Mendoza, he can really fly.

701
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:18,687
Mendoza across the blue line. He
gets tripped, slides into the boards.

702
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:20,849
Come on, ref,
call something.

703
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:25,191
- We're in trouble, Ken. What can you do for us?
- Let's see.

704
00:46:25,262 --> 00:46:28,356
Uh, a triple aerial
with a Double Hamill Camel...

705
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:32,368
that should split the D, then a
pirouetting half-toe-touch for the goal.

706
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:36,532
- Show it to me, son.
- Come on, Kenny. Get us back in the game.

707
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:39,167
i'm sure
you can do it, Ken.

708
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,714
Aah!

709
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:51,679
Aw, man. Aw.

710
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:53,689
Aw.

711
00:46:56,861 --> 00:46:58,795
Was that it?

712
00:47:00,397 --> 00:47:03,889
Please give me one more
chance to get those guys!

713
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:08,530
They've got to get back into
this game. Iceland with the puck.

714
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:10,972
Here's Olaf Sanderson
right down the middle.

715
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,738
- Sanderson over to Stahl.
He scores.!

716
00:47:17,214 --> 00:47:19,307
Where's our concentration?

717
00:47:19,383 --> 00:47:23,046
You guys are runnin' around like a bunch
of chickens with your heads cut off!.

718
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,022
- We're doin' our best.
- Well, your best isn't good enough anymore.

719
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:30,424
Blow this game and we are one
loss away from elimination.

720
00:47:30,494 --> 00:47:34,590
You guys might want to go home
early, but i sure as heck don't.

721
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:40,328
My, that was inspiring.

722
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:43,702
Four-nothing, Iceland, as we
head for the final period.

723
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:48,802
I hope Bombay's got some magic up his sleeve,
because he's getting manhandled tonight.

724
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:03,716
No! No.

725
00:48:06,463 --> 00:48:08,954
You're off, Goldberg!

726
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,733
Ah, thank you.

727
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:16,933
- Hey, good luck, goalie. You're gonna need it.
- Thanks, Goldberg.

728
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:22,975
- Sending in a woman to do a man's job.
- Don't break a nail.

729
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:29,049
i'm sorry, boys, but can you
help me with my pads, please?

730
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,714
Yeah. Oof!.

731
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,918
Intent to injure.!
You're out of the game.!

732
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:40,259
- See ya around, fellas.
Aw, geez.

733
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:43,391
Thanks for the breather.

734
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,925
- Fulton! Get out there and blast one!
- Go on in!

735
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:49,996
Fulton Reed on the ice
for Team U.S.A.

736
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:53,407
- He's open to the blue line.
- Fulton, fire it in there!

737
00:48:53,477 --> 00:48:55,570
Reed winding up-

738
00:48:57,248 --> 00:48:59,409
Whoa.! Glove save by Seggi.

739
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:03,351
Oh, what a save.! He'll have an
imprint of a puck in his palm...

740
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,354
after that one.!

741
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:13,964
- Hi.
- i know how you feel.

742
00:49:14,031 --> 00:49:17,592
Here's Banks,
starts onto the ice...

743
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:19,863
moves along the left wing side,
now moves into the center, but-

744
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:22,371
A spinning move.! A great
move to the blue line.

745
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:25,875
Banks all alone.
He scores.!

746
00:49:25,943 --> 00:49:27,877
Yeah, we got one!

747
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:30,505
Hey!

748
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:34,681
Come on! Relax!
Take it easy!

749
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:36,686
- Calm down, son.
- Are you okay?

750
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:38,881
- i'm all right. i'm okay.
- Are you sure?

751
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,789
He scored!

752
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:48,558
- Sit down. Right in there.
- Sanderson!

753
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:50,566
In my country,
we call that a love tap.

754
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:53,694
i want a piece of you,
Sanderson! You're mine!

755
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:55,864
- Oh, you think it's funny?
- Come on, get down!

756
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:58,066
i want you!

757
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:01,134
Hey, man, don't touch me.!

758
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:06,812
C'mon, Charlie!
That's it!

759
00:50:15,492 --> 00:50:17,585
- iceland!
- Olaf.

760
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:19,720
Ja, Coach.

761
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:22,493
- Good game, Coach.
- Thanks, ref.

762
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:26,594
Damn it!

763
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:35,476
Twelve to one, huh?
Twelve to one.

764
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:38,878
Ya think Hendrix is interested
in backing a loser?

765
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:41,110
Hey, how are ya?

766
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:43,176
You're only good to us
if you win.

767
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:46,552
Don, i'm- i've-

768
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:50,059
i- i've been good to you, man.
i gave ya a real shot.

769
00:50:50,127 --> 00:50:52,061
A real shot
to be somebody...

770
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,120
and this is
how you repay me.

771
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:57,463
We just didn't have
the magic tonight.

772
00:50:57,534 --> 00:51:01,026
Well, you better get the damn
magic, and you better get it fast.

773
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:04,802
Or i'm out of a job, and you're on your
way back to Palookaville, Minnesota...

774
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:07,969
shoveling snow
and sharpening skates.

775
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:10,104
Have a nice night.

776
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:19,647
Twelve to one.

777
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:24,353
You know what word comes to
mind when you think of that? Hmm?

778
00:51:25,496 --> 00:51:27,293
Pathetic.!

779
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,724
You guys were brought
here to play hockey.

780
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:33,598
- What about you?
- What about me,Jesse?

781
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:37,401
Coach Stansson knew everything
about us. They were ready for us.

782
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:40,671
And you spend your time driving around in
convertibles talking to those sponsor fools.

783
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:44,942
Or hanging with the iceland lady.
We saw you two Saturday night.

784
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:47,279
Eating ice cream with
the enemy, huh, coach?

785
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:50,184
What? What are you talking
about? What's going on?

786
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:56,219
Hey. Hey, what i do is none of
your business. is that clear?

787
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:01,656
Don't take those pads off.

788
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:04,826
Everyone stay in your gear.
We have practice.

789
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:06,665
Tonight?

790
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,725
This isn't
very much fun, Coach.

791
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:32,728
Who said it was
supposed to be fun?

792
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:35,026
You did, when you
coached the Ducks.

793
00:52:35,098 --> 00:52:37,532
Well, i don't see
any Ducks here, Charlie.

794
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:41,628
All i see is Team U.S.A.
one loss away from elimination.

795
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:44,502
Twenty more sprints!
Let's go!

796
00:52:44,575 --> 00:52:47,510
Line up! Come on, let's go!

797
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:51,639
Line up, Charlie!

798
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:55,207
Let's go! Keep you here
all night if i have to.

799
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:13,729
Not my best...

800
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:15,897
Luis.

801
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:17,907
Sorry.

802
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:21,603
All right, let's go!

803
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:25,273
Team?

804
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:29,612
Hello!

805
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:33,115
Hey, guys.

806
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:37,752
- Hello?
- I canceled their practice.

807
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:41,525
- What're ya talkin' about? Where are they?
- They needed a day off. Trust me.

808
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:43,566
i need 'em here
to practice!

809
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:45,727
Well,
they need to rest.

810
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:48,066
You've been running
those children ragged.

811
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:51,767
They can barely stay awake in class.
They're calling you Captain Blood.

812
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:54,902
i am preparing these kids for
battle. Can you understand that?

813
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:56,946
We win the gold,
we go on to bigger things.

814
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:58,948
- Bigger things?
- That's right!

815
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,450
Please!
Gordon, it's a game!

816
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:05,010
You said it yourself. Games
should be fun. Remember?

817
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:10,885
- And hold, two, three- - Coach
isn't here. Why do we have to be?

818
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,759
We have a game tonight.
We have to work out.

819
00:54:14,661 --> 00:54:17,824
i say mutiny.
Who's with me?

820
00:54:17,898 --> 00:54:19,957
Goldberg,
i'm too tired to mutiny.

821
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:22,831
Come on, guys, it's not like we
couldn't use the conditioning.

822
00:54:22,903 --> 00:54:27,033
- Speak for yourself, babe.
- Her name is Julie, not "babe. "

823
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:31,339
- Don't tell me how to talk, rich boy!
- Hey, Portman, chill!

824
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:34,175
Hey, you want a piece of this?

825
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:38,013
Yo, Team U.S.A., what are you gonna
do today, a million jumping jacks?

826
00:54:38,051 --> 00:54:41,487
- This kid's crazier than me. Forget about him. Look, Fulton!
- Hey, chill!

827
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:43,647
Hey, man,
i'm gettin' sick of you!

828
00:54:43,723 --> 00:54:46,988
i'm gettin' sick of seeing the U.S.A.
represented by a bunch of whining babies.

829
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,290
Too bad you can't back up
that mouth.

830
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:51,990
Me and my boys can take you
anytime, anywhere.

831
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:54,795
- i don't see no "boys. "
- i got 'em waitin'.

832
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:57,369
Grab your gear and let's go play
some schoolyard puck.

833
00:54:57,437 --> 00:55:00,998
- Or maybe you forgot what it's like to play for real pride.
- You got a pass?

834
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:03,907
- Come on, it's not too far, you little wimps.
- Come on.

835
00:55:03,977 --> 00:55:07,276
- What are you doin'? Get off!. You comin' or not?
- Let's go.

836
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:13,210
My little brother Russ here has been telling
me that you have been chokin' big time.

837
00:55:13,286 --> 00:55:16,312
Your brother's
got a big mouth.

838
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,717
Uh-oh.

839
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:24,525
He does, doesn't he?

840
00:55:24,597 --> 00:55:27,828
- Oh, boy.
- We thought we'd call you all to see what you got.

841
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:30,870
We know you can talk to the
press and sign autographs.

842
00:55:30,937 --> 00:55:35,237
- We can do more than that.
- Yeah? We can teach you to play like the real Team U.S.A.

843
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:38,072
What would you know
about it?

844
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:40,078
~Party people ~

845
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:43,377
You gotta earn every inch.

846
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:46,715
~ Tag team back again Check
it's a record and let's begin ~

847
00:55:46,786 --> 00:55:49,016
~Party on party people
Let me hear some noise ~

848
00:55:49,122 --> 00:55:51,750
- ~D.C. 's in the house
Jump,jump forjoy ~

849
00:55:51,825 --> 00:55:55,556
~Party over here, party over there, wave
your hands in the air, shake your derriere ~

850
00:55:55,628 --> 00:55:59,359
~ These three words while you're
gettin'busy Whoomp, there it is, hit me ~

851
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:01,423

852
00:56:01,501 --> 00:56:07,201
~ Whoomp, there it is Whoomp,

853
00:56:07,273 --> 00:56:11,733
~ Whoomp, there it is
Whoomp, there it is ~

854
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:16,271
Hey, ain't no whistles out here either.
You keep diggin' until you score that goal!

855
00:56:16,349 --> 00:56:19,284
Pick it up!

856
00:56:19,352 --> 00:56:21,877
- He scores!
- All right, Russ!

857
00:56:24,457 --> 00:56:27,620
And then you take a few breaths,
slug some water...

858
00:56:27,694 --> 00:56:30,720
- and get out there
and do it again!

859
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:33,298
- ~Let me hear you say ~
- ~ Whoomp, there it is ~

860
00:56:33,366 --> 00:56:36,267
Don't just stand there.
Come and get it.

861
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:38,600
Don't mind if i do.

862
00:56:38,671 --> 00:56:41,765
- Yeah, Luis!

864
00:56:44,377 --> 00:56:47,972
Whoa! Not again!

865
00:56:48,048 --> 00:56:51,575
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Use the brakes, baby.

866
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:05,456
- Eh, no sweat. it happens all the time.
- Excuse me.

867
00:57:05,532 --> 00:57:10,196
- Throw it back, please.

868
00:57:11,504 --> 00:57:14,337

872
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,014

00:57:31,558 --> 00:57:34,618
Yeah! All right!

874
00:57:34,694 --> 00:57:36,662
Did you see that?

875
00:57:36,729 --> 00:57:39,391
What the heck
kinda shot was that?

876
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:41,991
- Ah, you like that, huh?
- Yeah.

877
00:57:42,068 --> 00:57:46,198
That's my knucklepuck. it's hard to be
accurate but it drives goalies crazy.

878
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:48,331
Let's play!

879
00:57:48,408 --> 00:57:51,343
Come on, Danny, come to me.!

880
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:53,311

887
00:58:12,098 --> 00:58:16,057
Stick, gloves...

888
00:58:17,804 --> 00:58:19,829
- Okay?

Stick, gloves,

895
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,667
Go, U.S.A.
Go get 'em.

896
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:14,388
This is not a place
for a coach.

897
00:59:16,996 --> 00:59:20,090
So who's looking
after the shop?

898
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:22,430
We are closed.

899
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:24,732
First time in ten years.

900
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:29,002
i saw the iceland game
on television.

901
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:33,637
- Who was that man in the suit with the wet hair? Was it raining?
- it's a style,Jan.

902
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:37,308
You looked like
you just got out of the shower.

903
00:59:37,383 --> 00:59:41,820
You came 2,000 miles to make fun of me?
You could have done this over the phone.

904
00:59:41,888 --> 00:59:44,755
On TV, you looked like
a man who needs a friend.

905
00:59:46,492 --> 00:59:49,154
You don't understand.

906
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:53,162
Gordon...

907
00:59:53,233 --> 00:59:57,465
when i told the Goodwill Committee
who you were...

908
00:59:57,537 --> 01:00:00,438
i did not talk
to them about your good looks.

909
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:03,441
I didn't tell them
you would win at any cost.

910
01:00:05,345 --> 01:00:09,304
i told them you were a man
who loves the game.

911
01:00:09,382 --> 01:00:13,011
And i told them you were a man
who could teach the kids...

912
01:00:13,086 --> 01:00:16,112
about more than just
winning or losing.

913
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:20,353
I told them you were
the Minnesota Miracle Man.

914
01:00:20,426 --> 01:00:24,294
And only you
could teach them to fly.

915
01:00:24,364 --> 01:00:26,457
So be that man.

916
01:00:28,234 --> 01:00:30,634
Be that man, Gordon.

917
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:26,391
Hey, team.! Hey, team.
We're gonna be great today, right?

918
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:28,859
- Where's Gordon?
- You tell us.

919
01:01:28,928 --> 01:01:32,386
- i don't believe this.
- Team U.S.A. i'm sorry.

920
01:01:32,465 --> 01:01:34,865
Without a coach behind the bench,
you'll forfeit the game.

921
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:38,233
- But you can't do that.
- We have one.

922
01:01:38,304 --> 01:01:40,864
Miss MacKay.!

923
01:01:42,942 --> 01:01:44,876
Hey, Charlie,
what's up?

924
01:01:44,944 --> 01:01:47,378
You have to pretend you're a coach
or we forfeit the game.

925
01:01:47,447 --> 01:01:50,883
- Where's Coach Bombay?
- Pretend or we're out of the tournament.

926
01:01:50,983 --> 01:01:54,783
But i don't know anything
about coaching.

927
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:01,692
Here she is, our coach; Coach MacKay.

928
01:02:02,995 --> 01:02:05,589
Yeah.

929
01:02:05,665 --> 01:02:09,795
- Come on, Coach MacKay.
- What are you waitin' for, ice to freeze? Let's play!

930
01:02:09,869 --> 01:02:12,804
Let's go.

931
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:14,601
Yes!

932
01:02:14,674 --> 01:02:16,904
Face-off at center ice.
Germany wins the draw.

933
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:20,035
Comes across the U.S.A. blue line.
Germany on the right wing side.

934
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:22,444
Down to big Klaus Stabias.
He shoots.!

935
01:02:22,515 --> 01:02:25,245
And a save by Goldberg.
Great save by Goldberg.

936
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:29,117
As Germany is really
throwing their weight around.

937
01:02:29,188 --> 01:02:33,921
Oh! We look tired.
We need to, uh... trade places.

938
01:02:33,993 --> 01:02:36,962
- What?
- New players.

939
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:39,793
- Oh, say, "Change it up. "
- Change it up.

940
01:02:39,866 --> 01:02:41,993
- Scream it!
- Change it up!

941
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:50,339
Cool.

942
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:56,477
- We're late in the period
with a face off coming up.

943
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:03,814
Look who finally
shows up.

944
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:06,791
- Just ignore him. Averman,
take the face-off. - All right.

945
01:03:30,716 --> 01:03:34,652
- What do we got to lose?
- Respect. He'll dump us the minute it's all over.

946
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,281
Come on in!
Let's go, come on.

947
01:03:40,993 --> 01:03:43,086
Thanks.

948
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,604
Team.

949
01:03:54,407 --> 01:03:56,375
Guys.

950
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:59,275
I was wrong.

951
01:04:00,746 --> 01:04:04,842
And i'm sorry.
i forgot about the team.

952
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:08,353
And the team is all I have.

953
01:04:08,421 --> 01:04:12,084
All I want...
is another chance.

954
01:04:12,158 --> 01:04:14,149
Just one more shot.

955
01:04:15,428 --> 01:04:18,488
i'm back.
Okay?

956
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:22,867
Believe me.

957
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:29,366
Together now.

958
01:04:36,616 --> 01:04:39,380
Come on,Jesse.

959
01:04:41,487 --> 01:04:45,548
- Jesse,just do it, man!
- All right, let's go! Flying "V"!

960
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:50,722
Hall joined by his teammates behind
the Team U.S.A. net in the third period.

961
01:04:50,796 --> 01:04:53,356
They start back out
and they form a "V';

962
01:04:53,466 --> 01:04:58,836
I've heard of this before but I've never
seen it. It's the Flying "V'"led byJesse Hall.

963
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:02,238
Hall up to center ice. Hall with
it toward the Germany blue line.

964
01:05:02,308 --> 01:05:06,335
Hall
- Shot by Averman. He scores.!

965
01:05:11,651 --> 01:05:13,585
Yes!

966
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:23,426
i've had a lot of big distractions
since i've been here in L.A.

967
01:05:23,496 --> 01:05:26,124
This is a distraction.

968
01:05:26,198 --> 01:05:30,066
- Nice haircut, Coach.
- Looks familiar. i know that guy.

969
01:05:32,872 --> 01:05:35,204
This is a fire in a barrel.

970
01:05:42,048 --> 01:05:45,449
This is a distraction in a
fire in a barrel. Any questions?

971
01:05:45,518 --> 01:05:47,577
Good job, Coach.

972
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:50,212
All right!
Wooo!

973
01:05:51,891 --> 01:05:54,917
All right, Coach.!

974
01:05:58,397 --> 01:06:03,130
We've got a lot of work to do. We've gotta
study our opponents and study ourselves.

975
01:06:06,038 --> 01:06:08,438
We have to learn
from our mistakes.

976
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:12,307
You all have special skills.
Now we have to refine them.

977
01:06:12,378 --> 01:06:16,974
Luis, your speed is a great weapon.
Now you must learn to harness it.

978
01:06:17,049 --> 01:06:19,882
Let's do it.

979
01:06:23,756 --> 01:06:27,248
- Whoa!
- We need to get back to basics.

980
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:31,660
That's it. Dwayne, hustle. We're gonna
be a lean, mean, fighting machine.

981
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:34,859
Move that big butt.
Go!

982
01:06:34,934 --> 01:06:37,994
- Hey, how you feelin' today, Goldberg?
- Lean and mean.

983
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:42,200
Banks.!
Show me something, now.! That's it.!

984
01:06:42,274 --> 01:06:44,208
Good. Good.

985
01:06:46,846 --> 01:06:48,939
Hey, Banks,
let's go!

986
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:51,347
Comin'.
i'll be right there.

987
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:56,150
And no matter what, we'll work
together to overcome every obstacle.

988
01:07:11,537 --> 01:07:14,836
- Nowjust think how you'd play with two good wrists.
- Coach.

989
01:07:16,308 --> 01:07:20,108
it's just a little sore.
i'm okay.

990
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:25,412
i should have spotted this sooner.
Sorry, man, i wasn't doin' my job.

991
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:27,884
Coach, i'm fine.
i can play, i swear.

992
01:07:27,953 --> 01:07:30,285
Okay.

993
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:34,724
Here.
Let's find out.

994
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:39,327
The other hand.

995
01:07:43,302 --> 01:07:45,236
Now rotate it.

996
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:53,569
i have to bench you.

997
01:07:53,646 --> 01:07:55,773
No!
You can't do that.

998
01:07:55,848 --> 01:07:58,646
- Adam, you could injure yourself permanently.
- You can't bench me.

999
01:07:58,718 --> 01:08:02,415
i gotta play. All the scouts are
here watching me. This is my shot.

1000
01:08:02,488 --> 01:08:05,685
You're young and you're gonna
have plenty of shots, believe me.

1001
01:08:05,758 --> 01:08:08,659
But my dad's
counting on me.

1002
01:08:09,595 --> 01:08:11,995
I'm sorry.

1003
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:19,436
Hey.

1004
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:22,599
My dad worked a lot
when i was a kid.

1005
01:08:22,675 --> 01:08:25,166
So when he made it
to a game...

1006
01:08:25,244 --> 01:08:28,611
i wanted so bad
to score 100 goals for him.

1007
01:08:28,681 --> 01:08:32,947
i spent half the game a nervous
wreck, my stomach in knots.

1008
01:08:33,018 --> 01:08:35,748
That's how i feel.

1009
01:08:37,356 --> 01:08:40,621
Before he died,
my dad told me...

1010
01:08:40,693 --> 01:08:43,161
that his happiest times...

1011
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:46,892
were watching me skate on this
pond we had behind our house.

1012
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:50,333
He didn't need me
to score 100 goals for him.

1013
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:53,633
He was proud of me
'cause i was his son...

1014
01:08:53,706 --> 01:08:55,936
and i did my best.

1015
01:08:57,276 --> 01:09:00,143
I'm sure that's how
your dad feels.

1016
01:09:02,414 --> 01:09:04,609
i know it is.

1017
01:09:08,821 --> 01:09:11,312
Thanks, Coach.

1018
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:14,416
All right. Let's go
get that wrist X-rayed.

1019
01:09:14,493 --> 01:09:16,518
Come on.

1020
01:09:16,595 --> 01:09:20,258
- That's the way.
- We will work hard and we're gonna succeed.

1021
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:26,462
Nothing will bring us down.

1022
01:09:27,907 --> 01:09:30,774
If we fall,
we'll get up and try it again.

1023
01:09:30,843 --> 01:09:33,038
Way to get over
on your edge there, Connie!

1024
01:09:33,112 --> 01:09:35,637
Good, Portman, good.
Soft hands.

1025
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:45,713
Coach. Coach, i know with Banks
out, we got a roster slot open.

1026
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:49,352
- Yeah?
- You know how I always told you I'd make a better coach than a player?

1027
01:09:49,428 --> 01:09:54,365
I did some scouting
for us. Come on in.!

1028
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:56,993
- Russ Tyler. Coach Bombay.
- Hiya, Coach.

1029
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:01,567
Russ Tyler, huh.

1030
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,404
Well, Russ,
what can you do for the team?

1031
01:10:04,476 --> 01:10:07,036
You never heard
of my knucklepuck?

1032
01:10:07,112 --> 01:10:10,172
Knucklepuck?
No.

1033
01:10:12,384 --> 01:10:15,444
- U.S.A. leading Russia two-to-one
here in the third period. - Over here.

1034
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:19,981
Russ Tyler, Team U.S.A. 's newest member from
Los Angeles calling for the puck. He gets it.

1035
01:10:20,059 --> 01:10:22,926
- it's knucklepuck time.
- He winds up.

1036
01:10:22,995 --> 01:10:24,826
He shoots.
He scores.!

1037
01:10:24,897 --> 01:10:29,334
Yeah!

1038
01:10:31,804 --> 01:10:33,829
- Yeah!
That's my stuff!.

1039
01:10:33,906 --> 01:10:38,639
I told him no visitors, but he
wanted to congratulate you anyway.

1040
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:41,475
That's Wayne Gretzky.

1041
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:44,311
Can i shake your hand?

1042
01:10:44,383 --> 01:10:46,010
How ya doin'?

1043
01:10:46,085 --> 01:10:48,315
- This is The Great One.
- Wayne's fine.

1044
01:10:48,387 --> 01:10:52,653
- Say, hockey.
- Hockey!

1045
01:10:53,192 --> 01:10:55,319
Powered by a one goal victory
over Russia...

1046
01:10:55,394 --> 01:10:59,330
Team U.S.A. hockey advances to the
finals of theJunior Goodwill Games...

1047
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:03,198
where they'll go up against the
top-seeded team from Iceland.

1048
01:11:05,437 --> 01:11:08,838
- Coach, shouldn't we have our hockey gear on?
- Yeah?

1049
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:13,504
- Guys, this is our last team practice,
which means- - The return of Captain Blood.

1050
01:11:13,579 --> 01:11:16,139
No.

1051
01:11:16,215 --> 01:11:19,810
- it means... let's have some fun.
- All right!

1052
01:11:25,457 --> 01:11:28,119
- Easy, easy now.
- Whoa.

1053
01:11:28,193 --> 01:11:30,320
- Good.
- i love it.

1054
01:11:30,396 --> 01:11:32,330
i can skate.

1055
01:11:32,398 --> 01:11:34,662
Yes, he can skate.

1056
01:11:36,568 --> 01:11:39,366
Oh.

1057
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:14,071
Playtime is over.
We have the ice now.

1058
01:12:14,139 --> 01:12:17,006
You and your little rink rats
must leave.

1059
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,340
We're right here,
Coach.

1060
01:12:21,947 --> 01:12:24,541
The only thing little
was your career in the pros.

1061
01:12:26,452 --> 01:12:28,750
Gordon, no,
let's go.

1062
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:33,053
Well, at least I had a shot.
I was there.

1063
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:36,322
You were a disgrace.

1064
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:44,033
All right, team,
we're outta here.

1065
01:12:44,103 --> 01:12:47,231
- Let's go, i said! Come on!
- Can you still move on the ice?

1066
01:12:47,306 --> 01:12:49,638
Well, please,
play a little with me.

1067
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:55,303
Show me the famous triple deke
your daddy taught you.

1068
01:12:55,381 --> 01:12:59,442
Or was it that
old geezer over there?

1069
01:12:59,518 --> 01:13:01,452
Marria.

1070
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:15,564
Three bar. First one to hit
both posts and the crossbar.

1071
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:18,967
- Have to take it out past the blue line.
- i know the game.

1072
01:13:52,004 --> 01:13:53,972
Come on, Bombay.
Come on!

1073
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:57,099
That's it. That's it.!
Yeah.!

1074
01:14:09,188 --> 01:14:12,248
News flash.

1075
01:14:12,357 --> 01:14:15,087
That wasn't even
my triple deke.

1076
01:14:21,433 --> 01:14:25,529
One more post and you go home crying. By
the way, Stansson, you owe me a beach ball.

1077
01:14:43,255 --> 01:14:46,486
It's all right.

1078
01:14:53,132 --> 01:14:56,363
Get your coach off the ice.
We have to practice now.

1079
01:14:56,435 --> 01:14:58,995
Stay back!
Back, back, back.

1080
01:15:11,116 --> 01:15:14,745
Live from the Arrowhead Pond
in Anaheim, California...

1081
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:20,383
it's Team U.S.A. versus Iceland in the
hockey finals of theJunior Goodwill Games.

1082
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:23,622
Hi, everybody. This is Bob
Miller along with Jacques Berman.

1083
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:27,461
Nice to have you with us for what
should be an exciting title game tonight.

1084
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:29,694
Coach.

1085
01:15:31,837 --> 01:15:35,739
i woke up...
and the pain was gone.

1086
01:15:41,113 --> 01:15:44,014
Adam, i'm sorry,
we already have a full roster.

1087
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:49,612
He can have my spot.

1088
01:15:54,826 --> 01:15:57,954
it's what i can do
for the team.

1089
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:00,191
Let me do it.

1090
01:16:02,334 --> 01:16:06,634
Charlie, i need you on the bench,
+coaching right there with me.

1091
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:12,272
Take a deep breath.
Here we go.

1092
01:16:29,528 --> 01:16:32,793
Now the two teams gather
at their respective benches.

1093
01:16:32,864 --> 01:16:37,164
In their last meeting,
Iceland crushed Team U.S.A., 12-one.

1094
01:16:37,236 --> 01:16:40,501
Heads high.! Stand tall.! Fly straight.!

1095
01:16:40,572 --> 01:16:44,099
- U.S.A.!
- All the way!

1096
01:16:44,176 --> 01:16:45,939
Wooo!
Wooo!

1097
01:16:51,683 --> 01:16:54,914
We're ready for the opening face-off
in tonight's championship game.

1098
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,954
Team U.S.A.
against Iceland.

1099
01:16:57,055 --> 01:17:00,320
Lester Averman will move in
to take the draw for Team U.S.A.

1100
01:17:00,392 --> 01:17:02,656
And off the face-off,
Averman gets knocked down.

1101
01:17:02,728 --> 01:17:06,186
Iceland physically dominated
the first game between two teams...

1102
01:17:06,265 --> 01:17:08,358
and they'll try
to do it again tonight.

1103
01:17:08,433 --> 01:17:11,197
Guy Germaine gets checked down
in the corner.

1104
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:16,333
Behind the net, Goldberg cuts it off
for U.S.A. Here comes Dean Portman.

1105
01:17:16,408 --> 01:17:19,172
He's hit hard into the glass
by Gunnar Stahl.

1106
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:21,804
Iceland out to dominate
this game early.

1107
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,974
Puck is still in the U.S.A. zone.
There's a shot from the blue line.

1108
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,213
Stick save by Goldberg.
Good save.

1109
01:17:28,287 --> 01:17:31,848
Held in by Iceland. Goldberg
looks like he got tripped.

1110
01:17:31,923 --> 01:17:35,222
Iceland still with it. Back behind the
net. Here's a wraparound by Sanderson.

1111
01:17:35,294 --> 01:17:39,230
- He scores.! Iceland gets
an early one-to-nothing lead.

1112
01:17:39,298 --> 01:17:41,493
it's all right.
We'll get that one back.

1113
01:17:41,566 --> 01:17:44,694
Hey!
Too slow, big boy.

1114
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:48,672
- All right! That's it!
- Don't listen to him.

1115
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:52,870
- That guy'll kill you.
- Well, at least hold me back like i'm gonna kill him.

1116
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:56,072
Come on, man! Let me at him! Let me go!

1117
01:17:56,148 --> 01:17:58,207
You want some of this?
Let me at him!

1118
01:17:58,283 --> 01:18:00,376
Line change!

1119
01:18:00,452 --> 01:18:03,683
Guy,Jesse, Russ.

1120
01:18:03,755 --> 01:18:06,519
- You ready? Get out there.
- Yeah.

1121
01:18:11,296 --> 01:18:13,264
That's the shooter!
Watch him! Get him!

1122
01:18:18,437 --> 01:18:21,429
- There he is.
- There you go. That's my boy!

1123
01:18:21,506 --> 01:18:23,531
Cross sticks.

1124
01:18:29,448 --> 01:18:32,281
What are you doin'?
Get off me.

1125
01:18:32,351 --> 01:18:35,946
Boo!

1126
01:18:38,824 --> 01:18:41,418
- Over here, man. Gimme the puck.
- Shooter!

1127
01:18:41,493 --> 01:18:44,553
Watch out, boy.
it's knucklepuck time.

1128
01:18:46,798 --> 01:18:49,733
Aw, man,
i messed up.

1129
01:18:49,801 --> 01:18:53,737
Iceland with a one-nothing lead.
Throwing everything they have at U.S.A.

1130
01:19:07,986 --> 01:19:12,446
Team U.S.A. has to find a way
to get back in this game...

1131
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:16,483
because they are being totally dominated
by a bigger, faster Iceland team.

1132
01:19:16,561 --> 01:19:21,999
We can't make it. iceland's bigger,
stronger, faster. They got more facial hair.

1133
01:19:32,244 --> 01:19:34,974
Banks, you're on.

1134
01:19:35,046 --> 01:19:38,072
Hey, be careful
out there.

1135
01:19:49,928 --> 01:19:55,662
Sit down. Sit down. Hey, Ref, why don't you
call something? He almost took his arm off!.

1136
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:59,465
- That'll be two minutes.
- Two minutes well worth it.

1137
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:02,472
Get in the box,
you big goon.

1138
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:14,682
- i'm okay.
- You sure?

1139
01:20:14,753 --> 01:20:18,849
Yeah. i'm fine. They
just hit the pad. Really.

1140
01:20:18,924 --> 01:20:21,051
You'll be okay,
Banks.

1141
01:20:21,126 --> 01:20:23,959
Way to hang in there, Adam.
Great playing.

1142
01:20:31,903 --> 01:20:35,930
Now the crowd doing the wave, trying
to get Team U.S.A. back in this game.

1143
01:20:36,007 --> 01:20:40,501
It may be working.
Team U.S.A. up to center ice.

1144
01:20:40,579 --> 01:20:44,208
Moreau to the blue line of Iceland. Drops
it back to Mendoza. Ducks under a check.

1145
01:20:44,282 --> 01:20:49,083
Robertson with it now for Team U.S.A.
He's got great moves with the puck.

1146
01:20:49,154 --> 01:20:52,180
Robertson still with it. Portman
calling for it in front of the net.

1147
01:20:52,257 --> 01:20:56,557
Robertson knocked down from
behind. Iceland will take over.

1148
01:20:56,628 --> 01:20:58,755
- Somebody get on him.
- Get him, Luis.!

1149
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:02,357
Here's Luis Mendoza in a
footrace trying to catch Amselik.

1150
01:21:02,434 --> 01:21:05,528
Amselik on a breakaway.
He could make it three-nothing.

1151
01:21:05,604 --> 01:21:08,698
Mendoza trying
frantically to catch him.

1152
01:21:08,773 --> 01:21:12,402
Amselik moving in on Goldberg.
Gets hit from behind.

1153
01:21:12,477 --> 01:21:15,207
Taking the puck-

1154
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,774
Amselik, Mendoza and the puck
all in the net. It's a goal.

1155
01:21:19,851 --> 01:21:22,877
And Iceland leads now...
three-to-nothing.

1156
01:21:25,357 --> 01:21:28,588
Show me the Flying "V".
Let's go! Let's go!

1157
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:30,560
Hey!

1158
01:21:50,382 --> 01:21:54,443
And here's a four-on-none
break for Iceland.

1159
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:58,956
- Gunnar Stahl to Sanderson.
Wide open net and he scores.

1160
01:21:59,024 --> 01:22:00,992
Four-nothing,
Iceland.

1161
01:22:07,365 --> 01:22:10,801
And iceland is really taking it
to Team U.S.A.

1162
01:22:10,869 --> 01:22:13,531
They are completely
dominating this game.

1163
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:18,269
As we start the second period, you wonder
how is Team U.S.A. going to get back in this.

1164
01:22:18,343 --> 01:22:21,403
It's like
David versus Goliath.

1165
01:22:24,049 --> 01:22:26,347
Oy, vey.

1166
01:22:26,418 --> 01:22:31,981
- You guys wanna ease up a little bit? Just thought i'd ask.
- Come on, guys.

1167
01:22:32,057 --> 01:22:36,187
Off the face-off,Averman gets
knocked down by Gunnar Stahl.

1168
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:39,822
And the heavy hitting by Iceland continues.
It's gonna take something drastic...

1169
01:22:39,898 --> 01:22:43,561
for Team U.S.A.
to turn this game around.

1170
01:22:46,371 --> 01:22:48,965
Party!

1171
01:22:57,048 --> 01:23:00,176
Yeah!

1172
01:23:00,251 --> 01:23:04,847
Iceland trying to pad their
lead in the second period.

1173
01:23:04,923 --> 01:23:07,915
Number 74 spins around.
He's right in the slot.

1174
01:23:07,993 --> 01:23:10,518
He shoots.!
And a save by Goldberg.

1175
01:23:10,595 --> 01:23:14,531
Kenny Wu picks it up behind the U.S.A.
net. Wu, the former Olympic skater...

1176
01:23:14,599 --> 01:23:18,558
weaves his way up to center ice,;he's
gonna try and split the Iceland defense.

1177
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:21,003
Get him!

1178
01:23:28,279 --> 01:23:30,247
Pretty cool, huh?

1179
01:23:30,315 --> 01:23:32,715
Fulton back to Wu.
He shoots.

1180
01:23:32,784 --> 01:23:34,843
- He scores.!
- Yeah!

1181
01:23:37,489 --> 01:23:39,582
- Yeah! Yeah! Yes!
- Wooo!

1182
01:23:41,126 --> 01:23:43,856
Wu.! Wu.! Wu.!
Kenny Wu...

1183
01:23:43,928 --> 01:23:47,728
puts Team U.S.A. on the board.!

1184
01:23:47,799 --> 01:23:51,235
What'd you think of that?
Pretty sweet, huh?

1185
01:23:51,302 --> 01:23:55,705
Hey, you wanna piece of me?
Here, take that.

1186
01:23:55,774 --> 01:23:59,733
- All right! Yeah! i taught him that.
- Yeah, i know, man!

1187
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:03,406
- Come on! Let's go.
- Take that! What'd i do?

1188
01:24:03,481 --> 01:24:07,281
All right. All right. Grim up.
We still got a lot of work to do.

1189
01:24:08,987 --> 01:24:11,581
What are you doing out there? Wake up!

1190
01:24:11,656 --> 01:24:15,285
- That'll be two minutes, son.
- Two minutes? Well worth it.

1191
01:24:19,464 --> 01:24:23,730
- All right, Ken Wu!
- Our little Bash Brother! He's our man!

1192
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:30,631
- Yeah! Get up!
- Come on! Get up!

1193
01:24:30,709 --> 01:24:34,805
Hey, you guys, come on, get-

1194
01:24:34,879 --> 01:24:38,042
- Yes!

1195
01:24:42,053 --> 01:24:45,614
Yes, let's hear it for the three
Bash Brothers entertaining the crowd.

1196
01:24:51,162 --> 01:24:53,790
Yeah!

1197
01:24:53,865 --> 01:24:57,494
- Come on!
Let's go, come on.

1198
01:24:57,569 --> 01:25:01,505
Fulton and Portman are gonna
get misconduct penalties here.

1199
01:25:01,573 --> 01:25:05,669
They're ushered into the penalty box where
theyjoin Wu and they're still going wild.

1200
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:08,304
Now there's
three Bash Brothers.

1201
01:25:08,379 --> 01:25:10,313
- Olaf!.
- Ja.!

1202
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:12,815
Destroy!

1203
01:25:12,884 --> 01:25:15,819
Connie, be careful out there.
They're gunning for you.

1204
01:25:15,887 --> 01:25:18,515
Don't worry.
i'll be fine.

1205
01:25:37,642 --> 01:25:41,703
Iceland on the attack again.
Uberjavik fires the puck in the corner.

1206
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,975
Connie Moreau
over to get it.

1207
01:25:44,048 --> 01:25:47,882
- Sanderson has her lined up.
- Get out of there.!

1208
01:25:49,587 --> 01:25:51,521
Yee-haw!

1209
01:25:51,589 --> 01:25:53,386
No, Dwayne!

1210
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:56,291
i'm comin', Connie.

1211
01:26:10,108 --> 01:26:12,008
All right!

1212
01:26:15,647 --> 01:26:20,107
Get up there! Where i come from,
we treat ladies with respect.

1213
01:26:20,185 --> 01:26:23,848
Thank you, Dwayne,
but i'm no lady; i'm a Duck!

1214
01:26:23,922 --> 01:26:27,551
- Come on!
- Way to go, you little filly.

1215
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:29,559
i'll get you for th-

1216
01:26:29,627 --> 01:26:32,528
Referee taking Robertson
over to the penalty box.

1217
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:37,226
What are they gonna call this
penalty? It's two minutes for roping?

1218
01:26:37,302 --> 01:26:41,261
That's a new one on me. We're
at the end of the second period.

1219
01:26:41,339 --> 01:26:44,137
Iceland has a commanding
four-to-one lead.

1220
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:47,645
This isn't a hockey game;
it's a circus.

1221
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:56,514
- Did you all enjoy that?
- Yeah!

1222
01:26:56,621 --> 01:27:01,615
So did they, because they're still three
points up and we're one period away from defeat.

1223
01:27:03,895 --> 01:27:08,059
- if we can't beat them, we might as well keep our pride.
- Yeah.

1224
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,661
Jesse, that's not pride.

1225
01:27:11,736 --> 01:27:15,502
Sure, when Dwayne roped that
big oaf, part of me cheered.

1226
01:27:15,573 --> 01:27:18,508
But, guys, i've been there.
i know how you feel.

1227
01:27:18,576 --> 01:27:22,478
i wanted to cream that jerk that busted
my knee when i played in the minors.

1228
01:27:22,547 --> 01:27:26,176
And i really, really wanted to go
after Stansson for that cheap shot.

1229
01:27:26,251 --> 01:27:29,243
But you know what?
My knee will heal.

1230
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,120
And if i become
someone i'm not...

1231
01:27:33,191 --> 01:27:36,592
if i sink
to their level...

1232
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:39,528
well, then,
i lost more than my knee.

1233
01:27:39,597 --> 01:27:41,531
You understand?

1234
01:27:41,599 --> 01:27:44,033
Yeah.

1235
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:52,207
We're not goons.
We're not bullies.

1236
01:27:52,277 --> 01:27:55,337
No matter
what people say or do...

1237
01:27:55,413 --> 01:27:57,847
we have to be ourselves.

1238
01:27:57,916 --> 01:28:00,282
You.

1239

1246
01:28:19,037 --> 01:28:20,971
Les Averman.
Brooklyn Park, Minnesota.

1247
01:28:21,072 --> 01:28:23,632
- Fulton Reed. Stillwater, Minnesota.
- That's right!

1248
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,835
Russ Tyler.

1249
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:28,242

1250

1251

Dwayne Robertson.
Austin, Texas.

1254
01:28:36,587 --> 01:28:38,680
Michele MacKay.
Duluth, Minnesota.

1255
01:28:38,756 --> 01:28:41,623
And i'm Gordon Bombay.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1256
01:28:45,730 --> 01:28:49,894
We're Team U.S.A., gathered
from all across America.

1257
01:28:49,968 --> 01:28:54,701
- And we're gonna stick together. You know why?
- Because we are Ducks.

1258
01:28:54,772 --> 01:28:58,003
- And ducks fly together.
- That's right,Jan.

1259
01:28:58,076 --> 01:29:02,274
- And just when you think they're about
to break apart- - Ducks fly together!

1260
01:29:02,347 --> 01:29:07,011
- And when the wind blows hard and
the sky is black- - Ducks fly together!

1261
01:29:07,085 --> 01:29:12,352
When the roosters are crowing and the
cows are spinning circles in the pasture-

1262
01:29:12,423 --> 01:29:16,120
- Um. Okay.
- Ducks fly together!

1263
01:29:16,194 --> 01:29:21,188
And when everyone says it can't be done
- Ducks fly together.

1264
01:29:21,265 --> 01:29:24,200
Now, new Ducks...

1265
01:29:24,268 --> 01:29:28,227
and old Ducks must unite
under a new banner.

1266
01:29:28,306 --> 01:29:31,434
And i thought perhaps
something like this.

1267
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:37,509
Wooo!

1268
01:29:40,451 --> 01:29:44,547
Here to start the third period,
what team is this?

1269
01:29:44,622 --> 01:29:48,956
It's not Team U.S.A. Yes, it
is. They've got on new uniforms.

1270
01:29:49,027 --> 01:29:52,929
They're wearing the logo of the
duck. I've never seen this before.

1271
01:29:52,997 --> 01:29:54,464
Yeah! Come on!

1272
01:29:56,801 --> 01:30:00,601
I'vejust gotten word that there is
no rule against changing uniforms.

1273
01:30:00,671 --> 01:30:05,074
- Come on. This is ridiculous.
- Well, Gordon Bombay's old team was called the "Ducks';..

1274
01:30:05,143 --> 01:30:08,374
and I guess we've got
the U.S.A. Ducks out there now.

1275
01:30:09,747 --> 01:30:13,080
Quack! Quack!
Quack!

1276
01:30:23,528 --> 01:30:26,361
Go... Ducks!

1277
01:30:35,006 --> 01:30:38,373
~ We will
We will quack you ~

1278
01:30:41,012 --> 01:30:45,039
~ We will
We will quack you ~

1279
01:30:47,218 --> 01:30:50,278
~ We will
We will quack you ~

1280
01:30:52,557 --> 01:30:55,526
~ We will
We will quack you ~

1281
01:30:55,593 --> 01:30:58,289
~Buddy,you're a boy
make a big noise ~

1282
01:30:58,362 --> 01:31:01,126
~Playin'in the street
Gonna be a big man someday ~

1283
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:04,657
~ You got mud on your face
You big disgrace ~

1284
01:31:04,735 --> 01:31:07,135
~Kickin'your can
all over the place ~

1285
01:31:07,205 --> 01:31:11,904
- ~Singin'~
- ~ We will We will rock you ~

1286
01:31:11,976 --> 01:31:14,672
Germaine gives it to Wu.
Wu back to Germaine.

1287
01:31:14,745 --> 01:31:18,476
Germaine slides it to Connie
Moreau. She shoots. She scores.!

1288
01:31:20,418 --> 01:31:23,546
Connie Moreau with a lovely move
in front of the net...

1289
01:31:23,621 --> 01:31:26,818
pulls Team U.S.A.
to within two goals.

1290
01:31:26,891 --> 01:31:30,122
Yes! Yes. All right,
you guys! Way to go!

1291
01:31:32,797 --> 01:31:36,494
Team U.S.A. still down by two
goals. Trying to get back in it.

1292
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:41,027
- Shot and a diving save by Goldberg.
- Watch your back!

1293
01:31:41,105 --> 01:31:45,166
Averman with it, leads the attack. Comes
right up the middle. Averman lost the puck.

1294
01:31:45,243 --> 01:31:47,768
Iceland gets it over Gunnar Stahl.
He's got an open net. He scores.!

1295
01:31:47,845 --> 01:31:53,010
- Yes! - Oh, that hurts. The
Ducks trail now, five-to-two.

1296
01:31:53,084 --> 01:31:55,177
Okay, Ducks,
take a look here.

1297
01:31:55,253 --> 01:31:59,155
- Charlie, this isn't the NBA.
- it's the perfect teamwork play.

1298
01:32:10,268 --> 01:32:12,498
Now, cowboy!

1299
01:32:12,603 --> 01:32:14,628
Alley-oop, boys.

1300
01:32:24,649 --> 01:32:28,813
Yeah!

1301
01:32:31,055 --> 01:32:33,888
Wooo!
All right!

1302
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:35,892
Yeah.! Wooo.!

1303
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,928
All right!

1304
01:32:37,995 --> 01:32:39,929
That's the way,
Dwayne!

1305
01:32:39,997 --> 01:32:42,830
Play continues here
in the final period.

1306
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:46,097
The hitting has picked up, but
the Ducks are hanging in there.

1307
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:49,071
However, they're still down by
two goals with time running out.

1308
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:52,735
Bodies flying all over the ice.
The puck is in the Ducks'zone.

1309
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,472
Here's Mendoza on a breakaway.
He can really fly.

1310
01:32:55,546 --> 01:32:58,743
The speedster
into the Iceland zone.

1311
01:33:02,987 --> 01:33:05,512
- i stopped.
- Put it in, Luis!

1312
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,956
He scores.!

1313
01:33:08,025 --> 01:33:10,755
- Luis Mendoza on a breakaway...
- Yeah!

1314
01:33:10,828 --> 01:33:13,296
scores with
two minutes left.

1315
01:33:13,364 --> 01:33:15,298
And the Ducks
trail by one.

1316
01:33:18,369 --> 01:33:22,430
it's five-four. We are still
in this. Come on, we can do it!

1317
01:33:22,506 --> 01:33:24,997
- Russ.
- Yeah, Coach.

1318
01:33:25,076 --> 01:33:28,045
- Two minutes left. Can you get your shot off?
- i don't know.

1319
01:33:28,112 --> 01:33:31,104
- They're gunning for me.
- Make it happen.

1320
01:33:40,925 --> 01:33:44,452
Get off me, man. Get off me!

1321
01:33:44,528 --> 01:33:48,988
Time out. Time out. Time
out! Guys, come in. Come on!

1322
01:33:49,066 --> 01:33:52,797
Goldberg! Huddle up! Listen up!

1323
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:55,065
This is what i wanna do.

1324
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:59,906
When 56, Tyler's on the ice, he's covered
with three men. Do you understand that?

1325
01:33:59,977 --> 01:34:02,377
- Ya.
- Okay. Go!

1326
01:34:02,446 --> 01:34:05,381
Go... Ducks.!

1327
01:34:05,449 --> 01:34:08,009
Let's go!

1328
01:34:08,085 --> 01:34:10,713
Time running out here
in the third period.

1329
01:34:10,788 --> 01:34:16,192
The Ducks with the puck. They're still down
by a goal. They're back in their own zone.

1330
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,320
I don't know why they're not moving it
up to center ice. They have to attack.

1331
01:34:19,397 --> 01:34:23,595
- The clock is ticking. Iceland with a one goal lead.
- All right! Guy, now!

1332
01:34:23,668 --> 01:34:27,934
Here's Germaine in his own zone.
Germaine gives it to Luis Mendoza.

1333
01:34:28,005 --> 01:34:31,668
Mendoza goes behind the net.
Starts up on the attack.

1334
01:34:31,742 --> 01:34:34,768
Mendoza drops it back
to- to Goldberg?

1335
01:34:34,845 --> 01:34:38,440
He gave it to the goaltender
Goldberg. Wait, it's not Goldberg.

1336
01:34:38,516 --> 01:34:41,349
- it's Russ. - Here,
take it. - Thanks.

1337
01:34:41,419 --> 01:34:43,751
The goalie!

1338
01:34:45,423 --> 01:34:48,358
Tyler with it.
Tees up the puck.

1339
01:34:48,426 --> 01:34:51,361
- No!
- With the knucklepuck.

1340
01:34:53,831 --> 01:34:57,858
- Russ Tyler with the knucklepuck ties the game...
- Yeah!

1341
01:34:57,935 --> 01:35:01,803
with no time left
on the clock.

1342
01:35:06,444 --> 01:35:09,345
Yeah! That's my boy! That's my boy!

1343
01:35:13,451 --> 01:35:16,181
Yeah!

1344
01:35:20,691 --> 01:35:23,922
So the championship
comes down to a shootout.

1345
01:35:23,994 --> 01:35:28,055
Each team picks five of their
best. One-on-one with the goalie.

1346
01:35:28,132 --> 01:35:31,659
No rebounds. Best of
five shots wins it all.

1347
01:35:31,736 --> 01:35:33,863
What a way to end it.!

1348
01:35:58,662 --> 01:36:02,359
Yeah!

1349
01:36:29,727 --> 01:36:31,592
All right!

1350
01:36:50,314 --> 01:36:51,941
Yeah!

1351
01:38:04,622 --> 01:38:06,487
Yes!
Oh, yes!

1352
01:38:11,795 --> 01:38:15,060
Gunnar, you can do it.
Come on.

1353
01:38:15,132 --> 01:38:17,225
Go.

1354
01:38:20,571 --> 01:38:24,598
Julie, you got the fast glove.
i know this kid's move.

1355
01:38:24,675 --> 01:38:28,076
Triple deke, glove side.
Anticipate it and you got him.

1356
01:38:28,145 --> 01:38:31,308
- What if he goes stick side?
- He's fancy. He'll go glove.

1357
01:38:31,382 --> 01:38:33,612
Don't hesitate.
Let's go.

1358
01:38:33,684 --> 01:38:36,619
In a surprise move,
Bombay has gone to his bench.

1359
01:38:36,687 --> 01:38:40,680
He's sending outJulie Gaffney to replace
Goldberg. She'll face Gunnar Stahl.

1360
01:38:40,758 --> 01:38:45,752
- Go get him,Julie.
- I don't know about this move by Bombay.

1361
01:38:45,829 --> 01:38:48,696
Putting in a cold goaltender
to face the leading scorer...

1362
01:38:48,766 --> 01:38:51,599
in the tournament.

1363
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:56,038
But hang on to your hats. Here we
go. IfJulie "The Cat'"Gaffney...

1364
01:38:56,106 --> 01:38:59,269
stops Gunnar Stahl,
the U.S.A. wins.

1365
01:38:59,343 --> 01:39:01,709
That's one.

1366
01:39:01,779 --> 01:39:03,508
Two.

1367
01:39:03,581 --> 01:39:06,049
Three.

1368
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:30,738
Ducks win.! Ducks win.!

1369
01:39:30,808 --> 01:39:33,641
- Oh, I can't believe it.! The Ducks have come...
- Yes! Yes!

1370
01:39:33,711 --> 01:39:35,611
- from behind to beat Iceland...
- Yes! Yes!

1371
01:39:35,713 --> 01:39:38,113
in a shootout
in the championship game.!

1372
01:39:40,084 --> 01:39:42,644
Nice try.

1373
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:46,884
Bombay, the Minnesota
Miracle Man, has done it again.

1374
01:40:15,919 --> 01:40:17,819
Gunnar.

1375
01:40:19,757 --> 01:40:22,021
You lost it for me.

1376
01:40:22,092 --> 01:40:24,617
You lost it
for yourself.

1377
01:40:28,699 --> 01:40:31,964
Let's go shake
their hands.

1378
01:40:34,638 --> 01:40:36,299
- Good game.
- Good game.

1379
01:40:36,373 --> 01:40:38,273
- Good game.
- Good game, guys.

1380
01:40:39,276 --> 01:40:42,040
Good work, Captain Duck.

1381
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,977
Thanks, Gunnar.

1382
01:40:49,453 --> 01:40:52,718
- Good job, Coach.
- Thanks, Wolf.

1383
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:55,725
We'll see ya again.

1384
01:40:55,793 --> 01:41:00,196
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

1385
01:41:43,006 --> 01:41:46,908
Ducks! Ducks! Ducks!

1386
01:41:49,913 --> 01:41:54,247
Come on, Ducks!
We're goin' home.

1387
01:42:10,534 --> 01:42:14,732
- Whoa! Help me!
- You're not supposed to light it on fire.
