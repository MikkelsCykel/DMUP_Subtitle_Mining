I tell you what, there's a party at my bar tonight.

165
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:15,095
- Do you wanna drive me?
- All right, yeah.

166
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:19,599
I'll give you a few pesetas. Go and get yourself
some evening wear. Then pick me up.

168
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:25,731

Yeah.

Listen, why don't you stick around for a bit?

224

226
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,593
Yeah, why not?

227
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:45,430
I'll stick you on the payroll

I don't know what to say, Charlie.

230
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,316
Well, don't, then.

00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,155
I like that bit.

314
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:15,409
- What was it?
- Horizontal strokes.

315
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,827
Sorry.

316
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,000
Listen, Charl.

317
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,084
What?

318
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,630
I really appreciate what you've done for me.

319
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,841
But...

320
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,636
<i>... maybe I should go now.
I don't wanna get in the way here.</i>

<i>I told you, don't worry about Sammy.</i>

323
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:40,976
He's wild, but he's got a good heart.

324
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,730
Anyway, fuck all that bollocks.
There's a party down at the club tonight.

325
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,440
I need you to drive us.

326
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:48,608
<i>That Dutch firm might show up.</i>

327
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,114
Wanna come for a swim, Frankie?

Sammy tells me you've got a little problem
we might be able to help you with.

I'm hoping so, please.

you look better on the LP covers

Ah, los banderos ingleses.

00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:59,054

- He said you are criminals from England.

347
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,140
- Tell him to fuck off.
- No, no, no, whoa.

00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:03,225
No.

349
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,769
Offer him some champagne.

350
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,229
From us.

351
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,106

Go and sit in the corner.

<i>Put that out.</i>

Right, here are the rules.

387
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,001
You take her shopping,
you let her get what she wants.

388
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,545
You take her to lunch,
you let her eat what she wants.

389
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,423
But you take her to a bar drinking
and that's when we fall out.

390
00:22:39,464 --> 00:22:43,051
I get back from Gibraltar and I find she's drunk,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

<i>We understand each other?</i>

392
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:49,266
And one last thing,
you even think about trying to get hold of her...

393
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:51,643
Sammy, I'd never do that. She's your lady.

394
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:55,272
All right. We'll be back just before sunset.

395
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,274
OK. Good luck with the Dutch.

396
00:22:57,316 --> 00:23:00,152
Shut your mouth about the Dutch.
It's nothing to do with you.

397
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:03,488
<i>While Sammy and Charlie went
to make a deal with the Dutch,</i>

398
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,073
<i>I had to look after the snake.</i>

Fuck.

474
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,215
Fucking liberty.

475
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,925
- What?
- You know what.

476
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,720
What do you mean? He's all right.

477
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:39,806
Go on, stick him in the boot if he's moaning.

478
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:49,024
Don't worry, son. You'll live.

479
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:56,615
What's the matter? You're off, ain't you?

480
00:27:59,117 --> 00:28:01,411
It's just that... I'm just...

481
00:28:01,453 --> 00:28:04,748
It's all right, don't worry.
You ain't gotta explain nothing to me.

482
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,959
It's just, it ain't a bit of me, Charl.

483
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,877
I ain't one of yous.

484
00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:10,712
Here, look, come here.

485
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:13,548
Here, take it.

486
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:18,971
Any time you want a holiday,
you come and see me, all right?

487
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:21,098
Don't, don't worry about it.

488
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:24,434
Don't worry about it. You just make sure
you come and see me again.

489
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:27,104
You'll be all right, you know that, don't you?

490
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:28,522
Am I?

491
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:32,567
Course you fucking are. You've got character.

492
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:37,114
Anyway, look, I've gotta go and sort out
these Dutch cunts.

493
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:39,241
I'll see you later.

494
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:40,909
Take care.

495
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,043
Ta-ta.

496
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:56,318
<i>The way I saw it,</i>

497
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,697
<i>it was go back to London and wank my life away
playing Donkey Kong in the kebab house</i>

498
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:04,159
<i>or sign up to a life of crime, women and drugs.</i>

499
00:30:05,952 --> 00:30:08,372
<i>What else was I gonna fucking do?</i>

500
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,499
# SHANNON: Let The Music Play

501
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:42,990
# Let the music

502
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:47,327
# Just to groove

503
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:51,790
# Let the music

504
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:55,460
# This groove again

505
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:58,380
# No, no, once again now

506
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,132
# Let the music

507
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,097
# He'll come back

508
00:31:44,718 --> 00:31:48,221
<i>It's eight miles straight across
from Morocco to Gibraltar.</i>

509
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:51,933
<i>Every night, we had one chance when
the Navy patrol boats were far enough apart</i>

510
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:55,145
<i>for us to sneak our dinghies full of drugs
through the middle.</i>

511
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:57,064
<i>And it weren't easy, our line of work.</i>

512
00:31:57,105 --> 00:32:00,984
<i>Cos you had to get up around five, have some
paella, if you're lucky, a bit of shrimp,</i>

513
00:32:01,026 --> 00:32:02,319
<i>then wait for night.</i>

514
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:05,447
<i>We prayed for clouds
so they could give us that extra bit of cover.</i>

515
00:32:05,489 --> 00:32:08,617
<i>Even then, Sammy was the only one
that made the call.</i>

516
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:11,370
<i>Sometimes we misjudged the timings
of the patrol boats.</i>

517
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,250
<i>And as I wiped Moroccan kids' brains off me,
I questioned my morals.</i>

518
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:20,671
<i>But with the amount of money at stake
and Sammy breathing down my neck,</i>

519
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:23,048
<i>there was no time for regret.</i>

520
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,884
It ain't good news. We've lost a few of 'em.

521
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:30,013
<i>Oh, well, you live and learn.</i>

522
00:32:30,055 --> 00:32:31,974
<i>Unless you're a dead kid.</i>

523
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:34,851
<i>It was Danny and Ronnie's job to get the puff
from the dealers,</i>

524
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:39,439
<i>load up the boats with the barrels and make
sure the mules headed in the right direction.</i>

525
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:42,526
<i>Unless it was Ramadan.
Fucking Holy Month costs us fortunes,</i>

526
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,695
<i>because parents wouldn't let their kids go,</i>

527
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:46,863
<i>even when we doubled their carry money.</i>

528
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:49,408
<i>But we got round it. We went to the orphanages.</i>

529
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:52,911
<i>Sammy was the eye in the sky
and everything went on his order.</i>

530
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:55,831
<i>He was the only one
that could give the green light.</i>

531
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:58,041
<i>Me and Charlie were on beach patrol.</i>

532
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:01,295
<i>It was our job to make sure
the kids didn't run off with our drugs.</i>

533
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:04,798
<i>They're thieving cunts, Moroccans,
it's in their blood.</i>

534
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,344
<i>So we'd grab 'em out the dinghies, sling 'em
in the back of our van before they could run off,</i>

535
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:14,391
<i>then we'd drive into the Linea, switch lorries
and send the puff off to Madrid to be sealed.</i>

536
00:33:15,851 --> 00:33:18,186
<i>The bath is empty. I repeat,...</i>

537
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,188
...the bath is empty.

538
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,441
- Go! Go!
# Shooting stars never stop

539
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:25,527
- Go!
# Even when they reach the top

540
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:28,155

545
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,540
# What a pushover

546
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,167
# Yeah

547
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:50,385
- Come on, then, you little fucking pikeys!
- Come on!

548
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:55,432
Come on, venga! Venga!

549

# We're a long way from home

550
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:02,773
<i>With the Dutch out the way, we changed
the way drugs were smuggled into England.</i>

551
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:05,859
<i>We slashed the prices
and drove them through the Continent.</i>

552
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:09,154
<i>Our operation grew so big,
I was bringing my mates down to help.</i>

553
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:12,908
<i>I lived to regret it cos, like Moroccans,
South Londoners are thieving cunts</i>

554
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,077
<i>and couldn't keep their hands to themselves.</i>

555
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:16,328
Fuck Frankie!

556
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,498
And the ginger cunt.
He looks like Ronald Mc-fucking-Donald.

557
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:29,466
You shoot your mate in the foot, you can go.
If not, Ronnie'll shoot you in the foot.

558
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:32,928
Sam, please, I can't shoot him,
he's my fucking pal.

559
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,764
- Ronnie!
- All right, all right.

560
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:38,350
Leave it out, Dan.
I've known you since I was five.

561
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,190
Fucking hell. I'm sorry, mate, I've gotta do it

562
00:34:45,232 --> 00:34:47,234
or I'm gonna get fucking shot.

563
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:49,403
Look what you made me do.

564
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,322
Sorry, mate.

565
00:34:53,323 --> 00:34:54,574
Argh! Fuck!

566
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,829
Oh, fuck.

567
00:35:00,372 --> 00:35:02,374
Ronnie!

568
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:05,377
Leave it out, Sam. They're kids.

569
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:09,298
<i>Argh!</i>

570
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:12,217
Fucking hell!

571
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:17,973
And you,

572
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:22,060
you'd get one right through the fucking nut
if you wasn't Charlie's boy.

573
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:24,855
<i>The funny thing was,
as my life got bigger,</i>

574
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,565
<i>my world got smaller.</i>

575
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:30,068
<i>The more money we made,
the less time we spent enjoying it.</i>

576
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,070
<i>Sammy cut away anyone he didn't need.</i>

577
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:34,573
<i>Every day above ground

578
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:37,576
<i>No-one was safe. I'm telling you, fucking no-one.</i>

579
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:40,495
Sam, there's a geezer out front
wants to see you.

580
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:42,581
Who is it?

581
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,458
One of the mayor's lot.

582
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:55,969
Hello, English. How are you?

583
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,388
What do you fucking want?

584
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:03,393
The mayor is having a dinner party
at his residence this evening.

585
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:05,979
He has requested your company.

586
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:07,731
What for?

587
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:09,858
That's between you and him.

588
00:36:11,818 --> 00:36:13,987
A party, eh?

589
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:16,114
We expect you at six.

590
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:18,033
It's glamorous casual.

591
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,912
<i>Tell your man we'll be there.
- OK.</i>

592
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:24,039
I tell my man you'll be there.

593
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,166
Whatever. Come on.

594
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:30,379
Listen, we can't exactly blank him.

595
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:32,839
<i>We'll make a night of it.</i>

596
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:37,219
- What's fucking glamorous casuals, anyway?
- I'd better dust my tux off, eh?

597
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,388
What for?

598
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,681
For the party.

599
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:42,808
No need to bother, Dan.

600
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:46,311
Oh, yeah, Sam? Why's that?

601
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:48,438
What do you think, Ron?

602
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:51,650
What's that mean? You dropping us?

603
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:54,861
No-one's dropping anyone.
But some things are for us only.

604
00:36:54,903 --> 00:36:57,906
<i>- All right?
- I thought we were all partners.</i>

605
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:02,077
Well, we fucking well ain't partners, Ron.
You and your pal are on the payroll.

606
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,496
So don't start getting fucking lemon.

607
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:08,250
<i>There was never talk of partnerships.
You both fucking knew the deal</i>

608
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,835
and we've looked after you.

609
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:12,754
Sammy, are you fucking winding us up?

610
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:16,466
No, I'm not winding you up, Ron.

611
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,554
<i>Ronnie, come on.</i>

612
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:22,180
Let's go.

613
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,400
- What do you reckon?
- Fuck 'em. They're gonna have to swallow.

614
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:41,116
Listen, Frank, this ain't like the real world.

615
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:44,453
<i>Every cunt on this coast is your pal
when you're looking after 'em.</i>

616
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:46,246
<i>The next day, they wanna fuck you,</i>

617
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:48,790
and the day after that,
they wanna be your pal again.

618
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:50,917
It's a fucking dog business.

619
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,545
What about you?

620
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:54,671
<i>Me?</i>

621
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:56,256
I'm different.

622
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,183
Fucking hell, kid. This is where you wanna be.

623
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:08,560
Three years, this'll be mine.

624
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:10,228
Nice gun.

625
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,732
<i>Tell the mayor
he's got a fantastic place here.</i>

626
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:16,109
Ask him if we can rent one of the wings.

627
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:22,407
Le gusta tu casa.
Dice que, "Es posible arrendar un ala aquí?"

628
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:27,537
Lo primero que me interesa saber

629
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:31,208
es qué es lo que están trayendo
en los botes aquellos?

630
00:38:31,249 --> 00:38:33,043
<i>What's he say?</i>

631
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,170
<i>He said, "Thank you."</i>

632
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,546
<i>And?</i>

633
00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:39,549
He would like to know
what are you bringing on the boats?

634
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:42,636
What boats?

635
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:44,179
<i>Dice, "Qué botes?"</i>

636
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:50,227
Dile que, en este mundo, todo
se puede arreglar si uno conoce la gente clave.

637
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:54,231
<i>He say anything is possible
if you know the right people.</i>

638
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,735
Amigos?

639
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,905
Amigos.

640
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:03,198
OK.

641
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:08,245
Una cosa más. Y es muy importante.

642
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,665
Con la coca, no.

643
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:15,460
Marijuana, ningún problema.
Siguen trayendola, bueno.

644
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,546
Pero, si con la coca, hay problema.

645
00:39:17,587 --> 00:39:19,715
<i>There is one thing you must know.</i>

646
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:21,883
The cocaine.

647
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:24,261
<i>You must never bring it onto his coast.</i>

648
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:26,555
<i>The marijuana is OK.</i>

649
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,974
But if you sell the cocaine, it is a problem.

650
00:39:29,016 --> 00:39:31,310
<i>And if there is a problem,</i>

651
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:33,103
you lose.

652
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:35,522
Buenos amigos, eh?

653
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:37,524
Amigos.

654
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,447
<i>Ese chico
me lo sientan al lado para la cena?</i>

655
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:46,199
He's saying he would like
to sit next to you for dinner.

656
00:39:49,036 --> 00:39:51,371
Tell him it's OK.

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,782
<i>- A sacrifice.
- Who's gonna do that?</i>

785
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:10,579
Think about it. He likes boys. My mate Sonny,
a right skaghead in London, right,

786
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,873
absolute fucking heroin addict.

787
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:16,835
<i>You know what they're like when they're
clucking. They'll do anything for a fix.</i>

788
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:19,254
- Exactly.
- Can he be got?

789
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,715
<i>What a fucking amazing plan, eh?</i>

790
00:48:21,757 --> 00:48:24,635
<i>Cocaine junkie rent boys and a corrupt mayor.</i>

791
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:26,511
<i>And this is how it was gonna work.</i>

792
00:48:26,553 --> 00:48:30,307
<i>Flying the white from Colombia
straight to London was too hot by now.</i>

793
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:35,228
<i>So the South Americans had more produce
than they could shift. That's where we came in.</i>

794
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:38,940
<i>They'd fly it as far as Morocco
and, from there, we'd switch planes</i>

795
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,818
<i>and run it across the Gibraltar Straits like before.</i>

796
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,366
# M-M-My Sharona

797
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,493
<i>But it weren't like marijuana.</i>

798
00:48:49,534 --> 00:48:52,537
<i>We couldn't afford to lose one package.
It was worth too much.</i>

799
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:55,415
<i>But if our sacrifice worked
and we kept the mayor sweet...</i>

800
00:48:58,043 --> 00:49:01,129
<i>... we'd wind up with more money
than we could dream of.</i>

801
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:04,716
Ah, I'm so pleased
you invited me down here, Frankie.

802
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:08,220
- I don't know how I'll be able to repay you.
- I'm sure you'll find a way.

803
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:10,347
So, what was it you said you wanted me to do?

804
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:12,474
Oh, just meet some fella.

805
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,728
- What's he buying?
- A bit of this, son, a bit of that.

806
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,563
Usual stuff.

807
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:21,608
Sweet. You know, I'm so glad I'm clean again,

808
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,112
otherwise I'd be in a squat in Peckham
with a needle hanging out my arm.

809
00:49:25,153 --> 00:49:28,573
Clean? I thought you said
he was bang in trouble, you cunt.

810
00:49:28,615 --> 00:49:31,285
Fuck it. We'll get him drunk.

811
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,663
Give us my Wilson.

812
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:37,207
- What's that?
- A putter.

813
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,584
Ow! Fuck!

814
00:49:39,626 --> 00:49:41,670
Sorry, I'm a bit rusty.

815
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,798
I see it didn't take you long
to buck up with your mates again.

816
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,550
Well, no-one else wanted me.

817
00:49:46,591 --> 00:49:49,845
Seeing as me and Ronnie are old pals
and went to school together,

818
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,597
it seemed stupid to fall out
over something so silly.

819
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,559
<i>- Why don't you fucking grow up, Sam?
- I wish I could, Charl.</i>

820
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,020
<i>- How are you two doing, anyway?
- Yeah, not bad.</i>

821
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,897
- Just brushing up with my irons.
- It looks that way.

822
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:05,068
Here, can't you find
your own fucking club to play in?

823
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:07,946
- I'm a member.
- Hark at it. It talks.

824
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:09,990
<i>- That's what they say about you.
- Yeah?</i>

825
00:50:10,032 --> 00:50:12,659
It's a bit strong, innit,
coming from a known grass?

826
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,202
<i>Fucking grass?</i>

827
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,621
Who did you get that from?

828
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:18,415
- Danny.
- How come you've never done any bird, then?

829
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:20,584
Cos I'm sensible, prick.

830
00:50:20,626 --> 00:50:22,878
Talking of pricks, how are you doing, Frankie?

831
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,422
- All right, boys?
- All right, Carl?

832
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,800
- How are you, darling?
- All right, Frankie.

833
00:50:28,842 --> 00:50:31,261
- How are you?
- Shut up, you slag.

834
00:50:31,303 --> 00:50:34,640
Fuck off, Sammy. Don't try and make
a fool of me in front of your mates.

835
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:46,568
Birdie.

836
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,366
<i>We had more coke
than we could handle.</i>

837
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,160
<i>The more we sent back home,
the more they wanted it.</i>

838
00:50:55,202 --> 00:50:59,289
<i>And by 1987, London was covered
in a white blanket.</i>

839
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:01,083
<i>Every fucking one was at it.</i>

840
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,335
<i>From city boys to rent boys,</i>

841
00:51:03,377 --> 00:51:05,504
<i>yuppie girls to call girls.</i>

842
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:10,092
<i>There were even stories of the Royals getting
stuck in, banging it up their fucking toffee noses.</i>

843
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:12,386
<i>Maybe that's why she called her son Charlie.</i>

844
00:51:12,427 --> 00:51:15,681
<i>And how do you think she survived
on four hours' sleep a night?</i>

845
00:51:15,722 --> 00:51:18,934
<i>In our own little way,
we were shaping the future of our country.</i>

846
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:21,103
<i>After cocaine, it would never be the same.</i>

847
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:25,190
<i>It brought us together, pulled us apart,
made us sell our souls as well as our mates.</i>

848
00:51:25,232 --> 00:51:26,650
<i>It was a glorious time.</i>

849
00:51:26,692 --> 00:51:28,902
<i>#...for the touch of the younger kind</i>

850
00:51:28,944 --> 00:51:30,779
# My, my, my

851
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,322
# Aye, aye

852
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:33,490
# Whoa!

853
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:39,204
<i>And as long as we kept this old bastard happy
and Sonny did his job,</i>

854
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:40,998
<i>it was never gonna end.</i>

855
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,083
He say you have the face of a film star.

856
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,711
Well, tell him, I said thanks.

857
00:51:45,752 --> 00:51:50,966
And I've actually been thinking
about getting into acting when I get home.

858
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,135
<i>Dice que gustaría ser un actor.</i>

859
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,636
Fantástico!

860
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:00,017
Dile que si quiere ser un actor,
yo tengo algo que mostrarle.

861
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:02,811
He say...

862
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,396
<i>if you want to be an actor,</i>

863
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:06,732
<i>he has something to show you.</i>

864
00:52:06,773 --> 00:52:08,191
Yeah?

865
00:52:09,151 --> 00:52:11,903
Come on, toilet. Come on.

866
00:52:21,496 --> 00:52:23,540
I fucking love them Colombians!

867
00:52:23,582 --> 00:52:25,709
I thought it'd be a fucking bag, wouldn't you?

868
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,502
<i>- What for?
- Fucking old knob.</i>

869
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,962
Fuck him. Come on.

870
00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:31,214
It's still welcome. Fuck that.

871
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:41,433
Hey!

872
00:52:41,475 --> 00:52:42,601
Chico.

873
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:43,977
Amigos.

874
00:52:44,019 --> 00:52:46,813
Yeah, mate. Amigos.

875
00:52:49,691 --> 00:52:51,401
Amigos, huh?

876
00:53:00,285 --> 00:53:01,620
Argh!

877
00:53:01,662 --> 00:53:03,413
Hijo de puta! Cabrón!

878
00:53:03,455 --> 00:53:06,500
- Hijo de puta!
- Fucking hell, that was quick.

879
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:12,089
Jesus, Sonny, what did you do to him?

880
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,133
He whipped his cock out,
so I done him in the arse.

881
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:18,428
Good boy. Did he like it?

882
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,890
I don't know. Do you want me to stick it in yours
and you can find out?

883
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,017
No. No, you're all right, mate.

884
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:27,562
I'd do anyone that wants to know.

885
00:53:28,397 --> 00:53:30,482

diamonds from Cartier by the morning.

Everybody knows who you are back in London.

896
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:22,034
They couldn't believe it when I said
I was coming to do work for you.

897
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:23,869
Good for you, son.

898
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,495

They love it back in Peckham.

<i>One day, I'm gonna have a bar like yours.</i>

I'm gonna do it up like Peppermint Park,
get all my mates down...

903
00:54:37,549 --> 00:54:41,303
Shut up, Sonny, for fuck's sakes!
You're doing my swede in.

<i>Qué hace con este chulo de mierda
en este huerto?</i>

907
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:56,985
He says, "What are you doing
hanging around in the orange groves

908
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,154
with this vicious little cunt?"

909
00:55:01,156 --> 00:55:04,534
What does it look like? I'm having a stroll.

910
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:11,458
<i>Dice que un paseo.</i>

911
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,462
<i>- Cocaína.
- He say...</i>

912
00:55:15,504 --> 00:55:17,547
<i>- I know what he said.
- Ya te lo dije antes.</i>

913
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:22,678
Si quiere jugar bandero en buena parte,
aquí no. En mi territorio, no.

914
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,681
Porque es un problema, y problema serio, eh?

915
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:29,351
He warn you that
if you want to play Wild West on his coast...

916
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:31,812
<i>...it is a problem.</i>

917
00:55:31,853 --> 00:55:33,313
So, ask him what he wants.

918
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:39,695
Come on, hurry up, for fuck's sakes.
I'm getting sunburn.

919
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,783
- He says he wants nothing.
- Good. That's that, then.

920
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:47,869
Hey, ingleses.

921
00:55:48,662 --> 00:55:50,497
There is problem.

922
00:55:51,456 --> 00:55:53,542
Yeah, whatever.

923
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,877
Jules. Come on, boy.

924
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:03,760
Please stay with me tonight. I can't bear
to go back to him after being with you.

925
00:56:05,012 --> 00:56:06,972
I wish I could.

926
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,308
I've gotta go meet these fucking Colombians.

927
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:11,435
What for? Can't it wait?

928
00:56:11,476 --> 00:56:13,729
Baby, if I could get out of it, I would.

929
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,566
Do you really think I wanna be standing
on a hillside near Estepona all night?

930
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,527
What time are you meeting them?

931
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:23,739
Can't you come after that?

932
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,991
It's not till sunset.

933
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,826
I'll try and come and see you after.

934
00:56:27,868 --> 00:56:30,579
- Good boy.
- Listen to me.

935
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,706
This is our secret, all right?

936
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:36,126
If Charlie finds out, he'll fucking kill me.

937
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:38,795
Our secret.

938
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:47,804
You're unbelievable.

939
00:56:53,185 --> 00:56:54,978
Where the fucking hell have you been?

940
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,314
You were meant to be
at the drop zone an hour ago.

941
00:56:57,356 --> 00:56:59,733
What have you been doing?
Sipping that shit?

942
00:56:59,775 --> 00:57:03,111
- Oh, and you ain't?
- Get out my fucking chair!

943
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:09,076
What's that smell?

944
00:57:09,117 --> 00:57:11,995
<i>- Smells like perfume.
Shut up, Son!</i>

945
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:13,622
No-one asked you.

946
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:18,377
- It is fucking perfume. Who's been here?
- It's mosquito spray. They're everywhere.

947
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,883
- That fucking mayor's on us!
- Why? Where did you see him?

948
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:29,554
Listen, we've gotta keep the Colombians sweet,
otherwise they'll fuck us off!

949
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:31,264
We don't wanna fall out with them.

950
00:57:31,306 --> 00:57:33,600
All right. I'll speak to 'em.

951
00:57:33,642 --> 00:57:37,938
No, I'll fucking speak to 'em.
It's better coming from me.

952
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,648
Really?

953
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,942
<i>Maybe you should take it easy with that, Charl.</i>

954
00:57:41,984 --> 00:57:44,778
Don't fucking tell me what I can and can't do.

955
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,322
<i>You're only where you are
cos I fucking put you there.</i>

956
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:49,783
<i>Now get your coat.
We've gotta go and sort this out.</i>

957
00:57:49,825 --> 00:57:50,993
Move!

958
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:03,547
Fancy a game of Pacman, Frank?

959
00:58:04,339 --> 00:58:06,425
# OMD: Maid Of Orleans

960
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:30,699
How the fuck did Sammy know we was here?

961
00:58:38,665 --> 00:58:40,459
<i>- Hector.
- Charlie.</i>

962
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,628
How are you?

963
00:58:42,669 --> 00:58:44,755
Good to see you. OK?

964
00:58:44,796 --> 00:58:46,882
Good to see you. You all right?

965
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,592
How are you doing, mate?

966
00:58:49,968 --> 00:58:51,345
How's it going?

967
00:58:51,386 --> 00:58:54,931
I was just telling our friends here
how you're always late.

968
00:58:56,725 --> 00:59:00,354
Sorry about what happened earlier.
Unwanted company. Won't happen again.

969
00:59:00,395 --> 00:59:03,023
<i>We change our drop.
It's too risky there.</i>

970
00:59:03,065 --> 00:59:04,941
They building hotels everywhere.

971
00:59:04,983 --> 00:59:08,820
<i>Yeah, I kept telling him, "Move down the coast,
it's too hot for us round here."</i>

972
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:10,405
Sí. Your partner is wise.

973
00:59:10,447 --> 00:59:12,074
<i>You should listen to him.</i>

974
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,951
Anyway, it's done now.

975
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:15,661
We're all here.

976
00:59:15,702 --> 00:59:18,705
Let's just wipe our mouths of what happened
and move forward, eh?

977
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:20,832
<i>So, why not a big drop next?</i>

978
00:59:20,874 --> 00:59:24,169
We can move double the amount.
Can you handle that?

979
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:27,130
<i>Can we handle it?
What do you think we are? Spanish?</i>

980
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:32,010
<i>- I like your partner, Charlie. He has mucho ball.
- Yeah.</i>

981
00:59:32,052 --> 00:59:35,347
We've known each other since we were kids.

982
00:59:35,389 --> 00:59:37,474
<i>He's one of your own.</i>

983
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:41,853
Well, we'll speak on telephone.
Same call box, same time.

984
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:43,230
For sure.

985
00:59:43,271 --> 00:59:45,857
- Bye, Charlie.
- Take care.

986
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:47,609
Safe journey.

987
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,878
What the fucking hell are you playing at, Sam?
How did you know we was here?

988
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,089
What are you doing slipping in on my deal?

989
01:00:09,131 --> 01:00:11,967
<i>Listen, Charl, that's not important now.</i>

990
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,677
Keep your fucking deal.

991
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:16,305
We've all got the same problem
to deal with right now.

992
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,597
Which is?

993
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:20,142
<i>- The mayor.
- So?</i>

994
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,853
What are we gonna do? Kill the geezer?

995
01:00:24,938 --> 01:00:26,106
Yeah.

996
01:00:26,982 --> 01:00:31,111
Here, one of you two talk some sense
into this fucking div.

997
01:00:31,153 --> 01:00:33,947
What else are we gonna do?
- What do you mean?

998
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:37,618
Well, what else are we gonna do?
Shut up shop and fuck off back to Peckham?

999
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:40,871
<i>Bollocks.
This geezer can close us down in an hour.</i>

1000
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:42,164
<i>You.</i>

1001
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:46,376
Now, I don't wanna be your mate,
but am I talking bollocks here?

1002
01:00:46,418 --> 01:00:48,003
Can he be got at?

1003
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:51,673
Course he can be got at. Anyone can be got at.

1004
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:53,800
<i>We do this one thing together</i>

1005
01:00:53,842 --> 01:00:56,094
<i>and then we go our own way.</i>

1006
01:00:56,136 --> 01:00:58,013
No agg.

1007
01:00:58,055 --> 01:01:00,390
<i>You got any tools?</i>

1008
01:01:01,308 --> 01:01:02,851
Bring 'em.

1009
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:04,603
Ta-ta, Charles.

1010
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:19,201
How the fuck did they know we was here?

1011
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:21,036
I don't fucking know.

1012
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:07,499
<i>Like I told you earlier,</i>

1013
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,710
<i>- drugs make you greedy.
- Bollocks.</i>

1014
01:02:09,751 --> 01:02:12,337
<i>And we were about to blow the lot,
down to cocaine.</i>

1015
01:02:13,171 --> 01:02:15,590
<i>We'd fucked with the old country.
They'd had enough.</i>

1016
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:19,803
<i>They shut us down, took away everything we
had before we could even chop out another line.</i>

1017
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:23,390
<i>But we were so out of our heads,
we couldn't even see it coming.</i>

1018
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:27,352
<i>We were about to learn the hard way.</i>

1019
01:02:42,743 --> 01:02:45,829
Here you are, have some of that.
Wait here a minute.

1020
01:03:13,774 --> 01:03:16,485
Oh, what do you fucking want, you snake?

1021
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,279
<i>- Shut up, bitch. Where's Ronnie?
- Akip!</i>

1022
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:20,739
Fucking wake him, then.

1023
01:03:20,781 --> 01:03:22,950
Leave off, he'll fucking kill me.

1024
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:25,035
I'll kill you, if you don't. Go and wake him.

1025
01:03:25,077 --> 01:03:26,244
Fuck.

1026
01:03:33,627 --> 01:03:35,045
What do you want?

1027
01:03:35,087 --> 01:03:36,672
We ain't got nowhere to sleep.

1028
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:40,300
What did you fucking wake me up for?
Why didn't you just let 'em in?

1029
01:03:40,342 --> 01:03:42,260
<i>Fuck off.
Hurry up.</i>

1030
01:03:42,302 --> 01:03:45,597
All right, mush, keep it down. I'll buzz you in.

1031
01:03:59,695 --> 01:04:01,780
<i>Are you still awake?</i>

1032
01:04:02,823 --> 01:04:05,242
<i>I'm hardly gonna be asleep, am I?</i>

1033
01:04:10,289 --> 01:04:11,999
Listen.

1034
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,668
We'll get the mayor out of the way
in the morning.

1035
01:04:16,044 --> 01:04:18,338
We'll be back in business by lunchtime.

1036
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:21,383
We've gotta open the club.

1037
01:04:21,425 --> 01:04:24,177
Sonny reckons he's throwing a party
tomorrow night.

1038
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:27,222
He couldn't throw a tennis ball.

1039
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,273
<i>Hey, Charl, I've been thinking about
getting one of them Learjets.</i>

1040
01:04:36,315 --> 01:04:38,525
The only way to travel.

1041
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,195
<i>How much?</i>

1042
01:04:42,237 --> 01:04:44,323
No, you buy into 'em.

1043
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:47,618
Like share it with a pop star.

1044
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,370
Maybe Madonna.

1045
01:04:50,412 --> 01:04:51,705
Holiday?

1046
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:52,831
<i>No.</i>

1047
01:04:52,873 --> 01:04:54,958
For work and that.

1048
01:05:05,594 --> 01:05:08,013
You know what I might do next?

1049
01:05:10,557 --> 01:05:11,892
Go on.

1050
01:05:13,268 --> 01:05:15,354
<i>Slip down to South America.</i>

1051
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:17,773
<i>I reckon we'd crack it down there.</i>

1052
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,566
<i>Plot up,</i>

1053
01:05:19,608 --> 01:05:21,693
<i>send the odd parcel home.</i>

1054
01:05:21,735 --> 01:05:23,779
We'd be caked in six weeks.

1055
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,782
<i>Fly backwards and forwards in the Lear.</i>

1056
01:05:29,701 --> 01:05:31,787
That's it.

1057
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:33,914
Now you're talking.

1058
01:05:35,123 --> 01:05:36,875
We're really living, ain't we?

1059
01:05:44,091 --> 01:05:45,759
Every fucking minute.

1060
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:13,245
<i>Sweet.
- Where did you kip?</i>

1061
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:16,498
<i>Ronnie's. You?
Round my mate's time-share.</i>

1062
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:19,543
Are you ready for this?

1063
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:21,670
Course I fucking am. Couldn't get no tools.

1064
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:23,797
Have a peep in the boot.

1065
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,318
<i>Are you fit?</i>

1066
01:06:44,359 --> 01:06:45,777
Come on.

1067
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:49,281
- Let's do this lively.
- I've gotta take the kids to the beach.

1068
01:06:49,323 --> 01:06:51,491
Right, who's gonna go and have a look about?

1069
01:06:53,827 --> 01:06:57,539
- Any volunteers?
- We'll do spuds, eh, Charl?

1070
01:07:02,044 --> 01:07:04,171
One potato, two potato, three potato, four.

1071
01:07:04,212 --> 01:07:06,840
Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more.

1072
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:10,969
Ron.

1073
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:17,059
I tell you what, this is bollocks.

1074
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:31,615
Good fuck, was she?

1075
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:33,992
Better than I thought.

1076
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:37,454
But seeing as she hadn't come in
a couple of years, what else did I expect?

1077
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:38,872
You're a fucking...

1078
01:07:38,914 --> 01:07:41,291
What, Sam? What are you gonna do?

1079
01:07:41,333 --> 01:07:43,418
Are you gonna shoot me on the spot?

1080
01:07:44,544 --> 01:07:46,630
Blow your chances here?

1081
01:07:46,672 --> 01:07:48,090
You're a mug.

1082
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:50,217
You always have been.

1083
01:07:51,718 --> 01:07:55,889
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna put one right through your nut.

1084
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:58,809
If you get out, you ginger cunt.

1085
01:08:33,093 --> 01:08:34,636
Wait.

1086
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,613
Come on.

1087
01:09:59,137 --> 01:10:03,058
<i>Remember when I told you
me and the playboy had the world in our hands?</i>

1088
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,145
<i>Well, it passed.</i>

1089
01:10:21,076 --> 01:10:23,203
Don't you fucking move!

1090
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:25,747
Put that fucking gun down now! Don't you move!

1091
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:27,499
<i>Don't fucking move!</i>

1092
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:30,043
You fucking cunt! Take that!

1093
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,427
# Look now, look all around

1094
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:42,597
# There's no sign of life

1095
01:10:43,598 --> 01:10:46,351
# Voices, another sound

1096
01:10:46,393 --> 01:10:49,021
- Where is it?
- Tell us where it is, for fuck's sake!

1097
01:10:49,062 --> 01:10:50,939
Tell me where the fucking gear is!

1098
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:52,608
Tell me!

1099
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,943
Else I swear I'll fucking kill the lot of you!

1100
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:56,820
- Where is it?
- La cocina.

1101
01:10:56,862 --> 01:10:58,196
- Where?
- La cocina.

1102
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,075
Get in. You fucking move, you little fucking prick,
and I'll kill you!

1103
01:11:02,117 --> 01:11:06,747
<i>I'm fucking telling you,
don't you dare fucking move, you little cunt!</i>

1104
01:11:06,788 --> 01:11:08,874
- Stay there!
- I've got it! Sweet!

1105
01:11:14,254 --> 01:11:17,674
See you all in the port, five minutes. And lively.

1106
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,927
Come on, we're on. Come on.

1107
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:24,848
# ADAM AND THE ANTS:
Kings Of The Wild Frontier

1108
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:34,274
- You look like you need some sleep, my friend.
- Whatever. Got the money?

1109
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:35,776
Hang on.

1110
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:44,284
Come on, lively.

1111
01:11:46,453 --> 01:11:48,246
Es mierda.

1112
01:11:48,288 --> 01:11:50,123
- What?
- He says washing powder.

1113
01:11:50,165 --> 01:11:52,542
What are you talking about, washing powder?

1114
01:11:52,584 --> 01:11:55,087
Fuck you, you cunt!

1115
01:11:55,128 --> 01:11:57,506
I'll fucking do you right round the canister!

1116
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,007
<i>Go on, fuck off!</i>

1117
01:12:00,634 --> 01:12:03,762
# I feel beneath the white

1118
01:12:03,804 --> 01:12:06,807
<i>Just when I felt
things couldn't get worse, they did.</i>

1119
01:12:06,848 --> 01:12:09,476
<i>We couldn't even flog a fucking ounce of Persil.</i>

1120
01:12:09,518 --> 01:12:12,187
<i>We'd no more Rolexes and Porsches left to sell.</i>

1121
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:14,523
<i>There was only one thing for it.</i>

1122
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:17,025
I don't know how much of this I've got left in me.

1123
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:19,069
Shut up, you little cunt. You're all right.

1124
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:22,406
<i>All we need to do is get a grand together
and we're back in business.</i>

1125
01:12:22,447 --> 01:12:26,576
I've got these Algerians sweet up in Cádiz.
We'll go to work with them.

1126
01:12:27,494 --> 01:12:30,205
<i>Oh, I'm fucking sick of running around!</i>

1127
01:12:30,247 --> 01:12:32,541
<i>Fucking gyp for a few poxy parking tickets.</i>

1128
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:33,959
<i>Look, Frankie.</i>

1129
01:12:34,001 --> 01:12:35,585
It's Nora and Shirley.

1130
01:12:35,627 --> 01:12:37,129
So?

1131
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:38,797
Don't you remember?

1132
01:12:38,839 --> 01:12:40,382
Remember what?

1133
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:43,760
Remember when Shirley said
she'd give you a grand to fuck you?

1134
01:12:43,802 --> 01:12:45,137
<i>No way, Charl.</i>

1135
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:47,639
Charl!

1136
01:12:51,143 --> 01:12:52,728
Hello, girls.

1137
01:12:52,769 --> 01:12:54,730
How are you doing?

1138
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,356
- Bloody hell.
- What happened?

1139
01:12:56,398 --> 01:12:58,692
I've been decorating my new place.

1140
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:03,530
Listen, Shirl, I'm really sorry
about what happened to Ronnie.

1141
01:13:03,572 --> 01:13:05,157
I bet you are.

1142
01:13:06,283 --> 01:13:08,035
Look, it's Frankie down there.

1143
01:13:08,076 --> 01:13:10,996
<i>- You remember him, don't you?
- Jesus, he looks terrible.</i>

1144
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:12,873
Looks like a fucking pikey.

1145
01:13:12,914 --> 01:13:15,292
<i>He's OK,
he's been helping me decorate.</i>

1146
01:13:15,334 --> 01:13:17,961
Still got the look, though, ain't he?

1147
01:13:18,003 --> 01:13:20,297
I'll be back in a minute, all right? Don't move.

1148
01:13:20,339 --> 01:13:23,175
- What's he on?
- He's off his fucking trolley.

1149
01:13:23,216 --> 01:13:25,969
Listen, we could be on here.
Get in the bar and have a wash.

1150
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:27,596
Fuck off, Charl, no way.

1151
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:31,391
Listen, boy, there's a fucking grand at stake.
Now, get in there now!

1152
01:13:31,433 --> 01:13:35,020
Charl, I'm not... I'm not fucking
brassing myself off to them wretches.

1153
01:13:35,062 --> 01:13:37,147
- You fucking are!
- I ain't.

1154
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:38,774
If you don't, I'll shoot you.

1155
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:41,401
Now, get in there now! And wash your cock.

1156
01:13:42,611 --> 01:13:44,154
And get a semi.

1157
01:13:50,744 --> 01:13:52,829
So you're all right, girls?

1158
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:56,416
- What are you doing around here?
- Been in Gib getting fags.

1159
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:59,378
Yeah. Good earner, the salmon.

1160
01:14:01,713 --> 01:14:03,048
Here, listen.

1161
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:05,926
Do you remember
when you used to like my little Frankie?

1162
01:14:05,968 --> 01:14:08,387
- Yeah, yeah, he was a nice kid.
- No, but I mean...

1163
01:14:08,428 --> 01:14:13,016
<i>- Remember when you used to really like him?
- He was gorgeous. Looks fucked now, though.</i>

1164
01:14:13,058 --> 01:14:14,226
Fucked?

1165
01:14:14,267 --> 01:14:16,853
I wouldn't say that. He's still got the rogue smile.

1166
01:14:16,895 --> 01:14:18,814
He needs a good bath, if you ask me.

1167
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:22,025
Listen.

1168
01:14:25,195 --> 01:14:27,656
Do you wanna fuck him,
the pair of you, for a grand?

1169
01:14:27,698 --> 01:14:29,825
- Eh?
- Eh?

1170
01:14:29,866 --> 01:14:32,744
<i>- You said you'd give a grand to fuck him.
Fucking hell.</i>

1171
01:14:32,786 --> 01:14:35,205
That was years ago, man.

1172
01:14:59,938 --> 01:15:01,440
Listen.

1173
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:05,277
Just put your fucking bag and keys
on the back seat and fuck off!

1174
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:06,987
Hurry up!

1175
01:15:07,029 --> 01:15:08,488
- Fuck off!
- What's going on?

1176
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,950
- What's it look like? Get the keys. Start the car.
- I'm sorry, girls.

1177
01:15:11,992 --> 01:15:14,369
You two really had it once, do you know that?

1178
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:17,122
<i>Look at the fucking state of you now!</i>

1179
01:15:18,206 --> 01:15:20,334
Just get in the fucking car!

1180
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:24,504
You fucking... You should be ashamed of
yourselves. You used to be so fucking cool.

1181
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:25,964
Shame on you, boys!

1182
01:15:26,006 --> 01:15:27,633
Fucking wankers!

1183
01:15:27,674 --> 01:15:31,845
- Fuck off back to your caravan, you pikeys!
- You fucking poofs!

1184
01:15:32,721 --> 01:15:34,348
- Shit cunts!
- Come on, come on.

1185
01:15:34,389 --> 01:15:36,475
What do you want?

1186
01:15:37,225 --> 01:15:38,810
Give him a Stuyvesant.

1187
01:15:38,852 --> 01:15:40,062
- What?
- Rothman.

1188
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:44,066
Rough man? Rough man? Fucking Rothman.
Give him a Rothman, the cunt.

1189
01:15:46,443 --> 01:15:48,820
Yeah, he'll be wearing a blue tracksuit.

1190
01:15:48,862 --> 01:15:50,322
Ta-da.

1191
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:53,158
Fucking mosquitoes are everywhere!

1192
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,203
Stop fucking driving me mad about mosquitoes.

1193
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:58,705
- You're going to Cádiz.
- Why aren't you coming?

1194
01:15:58,747 --> 01:16:01,583
It only needs one of us.
What's up? Are you fucking scared?

1195
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,543
I don't even know where Cádiz is.

1196
01:16:03,585 --> 01:16:06,254
It sounds like a load of bollocks to me,
sitting around,

1197
01:16:06,296 --> 01:16:09,675
<i>waiting for fucking Algerian sailors
with green hats,</i>

1198
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:11,593
bags of gear in run-down ports.

1199
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:13,011
Leave me out.

1200
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:35,784
Qué gillipollas.

1201
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,871
Cerveza.

1202
01:16:56,888 --> 01:16:57,931
Sss-ss!

1203
01:17:53,153 --> 01:17:54,821
<i>A funny thing.</i>

1204
01:17:54,863 --> 01:17:57,991
<i>It's a lot quieter on the way down
than the journey up.</i>

1205
01:17:58,033 --> 01:18:00,911
<i>No-one wants you around
when you've got nothing left.</i>

1206
01:18:00,953 --> 01:18:04,957
<i>I wanted out so badly
but I couldn't just walk away with nothing.</i>

1207
01:18:23,308 --> 01:18:24,476
Freeze!

1208
01:18:25,978 --> 01:18:27,229
Jesus!

1209
01:18:27,271 --> 01:18:28,605
Charl.

1210
01:18:28,647 --> 01:18:30,732
What's happened to you?

1211
01:18:32,067 --> 01:18:35,946
You all right, Sonny?
You look like you've gone right to the front.

1212
01:18:35,988 --> 01:18:38,073
I took your old bar on, Charl.

1213
01:18:38,115 --> 01:18:39,783
Done it up like I said.

1214
01:18:39,825 --> 01:18:41,910
It's really cracking on.

1215
01:18:41,952 --> 01:18:43,537
Where's Frankie?

1216
01:18:43,578 --> 01:18:46,873
He's on his way back from Cádiz.
You seen any of the others?

1217
01:18:46,915 --> 01:18:50,294
- I don't see anyone. Not after what happened.
- What about my Sammy?

1218
01:18:50,335 --> 01:18:52,838
<i>You hear things,
but no, I ain't seen him in years.</i>

1219
01:18:52,879 --> 01:18:54,381
<i>I just keep my nut down.</i>

1220
01:18:54,423 --> 01:18:57,175
If it weren't so hot,
I'd say come down there for a drink.

1221
01:18:57,217 --> 01:18:58,385
Yeah?

1222
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:00,971
Maybe I will.

1223
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:04,182
- They still want you here. I'd give it a wide.
- Tell you what.

1224
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:06,727
We'll have a reunion party.

1225
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:09,605
<i>- What for?
- What do you mean, what for?</i>

1226
01:19:09,646 --> 01:19:12,524
I can pull a crowd like
you've never seen before, son.

1227
01:19:12,566 --> 01:19:14,651
I'm not saying that.

1228
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:17,070
I don't know, Charl. It's just...

1229
01:19:17,112 --> 01:19:18,989
<i>I don't know, Charlie.</i>

1230
01:19:19,031 --> 01:19:21,491
Yeah, yeah. That's what we'll do.

1231
01:19:21,533 --> 01:19:25,078
<i>We'll get the old firm back for a night.
Be fucking blinding.</i>

1232
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,205
It's changed down there, Charl.

1233
01:19:27,247 --> 01:19:30,334
I don't mean no offence,
but you can't just steam in.

1234
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,461
No offence?

1235
01:19:32,502 --> 01:19:35,464
I ain't just fucking steaming in, boy.

1236
01:19:35,505 --> 01:19:37,049
That club's still mine.

1237
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:39,217
Well, legally it's mine, actually.

1238
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:42,387
Hark at him, all the long words now.

1239
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,265
Come on, son, it'll be blinding.

1240
01:19:45,307 --> 01:19:47,351
<i>One little night.</i>

1241
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:49,436
For old times' sake.

1242
01:19:50,062 --> 01:19:52,064
Listen, you go and sort out the balloons,

1243
01:19:52,105 --> 01:19:54,524
and I'm gonna put the word out that I'm back.

1244
01:19:55,275 --> 01:19:56,777
Who to?

1245
01:19:58,528 --> 01:20:00,614
Fucking everyone!

1246
01:20:00,656 --> 01:20:03,033
Just like the old days, eh?

1247
01:20:04,076 --> 01:20:06,411
Yeah, like the old days.

1248
01:20:08,288 --> 01:20:12,334
I nearly got my throat cut in Cádiz, Charl.
Don't that tell you anything?

1249
01:20:13,418 --> 01:20:15,295
Listen...

1250
01:20:15,337 --> 01:20:17,214
Get loads of balloons, pink ones.

1251
01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:20,217
I like them fucking massive ones
with "party" written on them.

1252
01:20:20,258 --> 01:20:23,261
<i>Don't buy the kiddy ones,
they're a waste of money.</i>

1253
01:20:23,303 --> 01:20:26,765
Oh, and er... find out where Sammy lives.
I want to surprise him.

1254
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:41,822
<i>The good thing about losing everything
was there was nothing else to lose.</i>

1255
01:20:41,863 --> 01:20:45,409
<i>I had one last plan,
one last person who could help me.</i>

1256
01:20:46,368 --> 01:20:48,453
<i>Whether she liked it or not...</i>

1257
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:50,580
<i>we had unfinished business.</i>

1258
01:20:55,002 --> 01:20:57,087
So it's not just a rumor.

1259
01:20:57,129 --> 01:20:59,214
What?

1260
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:01,341
<i>You do look like shit.</i>

1261
01:21:02,384 --> 01:21:04,011
Thanks.

1262
01:21:04,845 --> 01:21:06,930
<i>How would you know?</i>

1263
01:21:06,972 --> 01:21:09,182
I always ask after you.

1264
01:21:09,224 --> 01:21:11,226
If that's true, why did you fuck me over?

1265
01:21:11,268 --> 01:21:13,895
You didn't need me to fuck your life, Frankie.

1266
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:16,023
You did that yourself.

1267
01:21:29,536 --> 01:21:31,121
Frankie...

1268
01:21:48,096 --> 01:21:49,848
I can't work you out.

1269
01:22:04,529 --> 01:22:06,073
I've got to go.

1270
01:22:06,114 --> 01:22:08,200
Sammy'll be wondering where I am.

1271
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,455
Is that it?

1272
01:22:13,497 --> 01:22:15,582
Read it.

1273
01:22:37,312 --> 01:22:39,398
Right, let's have a look at you.

1274
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,651
Fucking hell, look at the state of you.

1275
01:22:42,693 --> 01:22:44,569
Come here.

1276
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,863
That's it.

1277
01:22:46,905 --> 01:22:48,615
That's better.

1278
01:22:50,325 --> 01:22:51,576
Right.

1279
01:22:51,618 --> 01:22:53,704
You look terrific.

1280
01:22:54,705 --> 01:22:56,373
What about me?

1281
01:22:57,124 --> 01:22:59,209
Ream, Charl.

1282
01:22:59,251 --> 01:23:01,461
You look ream.

1283
01:23:02,546 --> 01:23:04,006
Yeah.

1284
01:23:04,047 --> 01:23:05,841
Have a look at this.

1285
01:23:05,882 --> 01:23:07,968
Look at that.

1286
01:23:09,344 --> 01:23:10,762
Got it?

1287
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:16,893
We're still the bollocks.

1288
01:23:17,728 --> 01:23:19,813
Come on, let's get out there.

1289
01:23:30,741 --> 01:23:32,826
# SLY FOX: Let's Go All The Way

1290
01:23:36,455 --> 01:23:38,540
# Let's go all the way

1291
01:23:41,627 --> 01:23:43,920
# We can make a better way

1292
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:48,925
# Let's go all the way

1293
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:54,765
# Let's go all the way

1294
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:01,104
Listen, have you got the gun sorted out?

1295
01:24:01,939 --> 01:24:04,733
Just make sure it's empty, all right? All right.

1296
01:24:17,788 --> 01:24:21,041
<i>Maybe I should have driven across the border
there and then.</i>

1297
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,585
<i>Gone through the slips while I still could.</i>

1298
01:24:23,627 --> 01:24:26,213
<i>But there was one thing left I had to take care of.</i>

1299
01:24:26,254 --> 01:24:30,968
<i>And if the plan was right, I was going to enjoy it
more than the first time I got high.</i>

1300
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:07,087
Did someone order a cunt?
Cos one's just showed up.

1301
01:25:08,297 --> 01:25:11,341
Listen, I've got a bit of work.

1302
01:25:11,383 --> 01:25:13,343
<i>Do you want in?</i>

1303
01:25:13,385 --> 01:25:15,429
Why shouldn't I just kill you?

1304
01:25:15,470 --> 01:25:17,556
Cos I've got a drop lined up.

1305
01:25:22,269 --> 01:25:24,771
<i>- What sort of drop?
- A large one.</i>

1306
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:26,690
White.

1307
01:25:26,732 --> 01:25:28,317
Why come to me?

1308
01:25:29,234 --> 01:25:32,029
You're the only one
that knows what they're doing.

1309
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:34,489
Go and wait by the gate.

1310
01:25:41,204 --> 01:25:43,415
Carly, get me a pistol.

1311
01:25:43,457 --> 01:25:45,542
<i>Something I can hide.</i>

1312
01:25:51,423 --> 01:25:54,384
It's got a full clip. What do you want it for?

1313
01:25:55,427 --> 01:25:57,304
Never mind.

1314
01:25:57,346 --> 01:25:59,389
Give us a kiss.

1315
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,666
Frankie, listen.

1316
01:26:25,707 --> 01:26:29,878
I know we ain't got along too well
over the years, had our ups and downs,

1317
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,216
but I really appreciate the fact that
we can do a bit of business together now.

1318
01:26:34,257 --> 01:26:37,260
To be honest,
you was the first person I thought of.

1319
01:26:37,302 --> 01:26:39,596
You're the only one I can trust.

1320
01:26:39,638 --> 01:26:41,807
I really appreciate that.

1321
01:26:41,848 --> 01:26:43,850
You're a good kid.

1322
01:26:43,892 --> 01:26:46,561
I hope this is the start of something new for us.

1323
01:26:46,603 --> 01:26:48,730
How much did you say there was?

1324
01:26:48,772 --> 01:26:50,899
It'll be worth the walk.

1325
01:27:14,464 --> 01:27:16,550
We ain't got to get in there, have we?

1326
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:18,677
That's where it's coming.

1327
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,221
It's other people's shit and piss.

1328
01:27:22,389 --> 01:27:24,474
They won't mind.

1329
01:27:52,711 --> 01:27:56,048
Here you are, get ready for them.
They're coming.

1330
01:27:56,089 --> 01:27:57,132
Look.

1331
01:28:14,942 --> 01:28:16,526
There must be more.

1332
01:28:26,912 --> 01:28:29,122
I don't believe it, Sam, this is it.

1333
01:28:29,164 --> 01:28:31,041
<i>Is this what it's come to?</i>

1334
01:28:31,083 --> 01:28:33,335
I've sniffed more than this in one day.

1335
01:28:33,377 --> 01:28:35,796
<i>We had it all once, Sam, and it's come to this.</i>

1336
01:28:35,837 --> 01:28:37,381
We really fucked it!

1337
01:28:38,256 --> 01:28:41,551
<i>Not me, boy. You fucked it.</i>

1338
01:28:45,013 --> 01:28:45,931
Bitch!

1339
01:28:49,643 --> 01:28:52,854
<i>Get out of the water. Drop your weapons.</i>

1340
01:28:56,108 --> 01:28:58,193
<i>Give yourselves up.</i>

1341
01:28:59,611 --> 01:29:01,363
<i>Hands in the air.</i>

1342
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:36,625
<i>The maddest thing about crime is
it's like a drug. You never know when to stop.</i>

1343
01:30:37,334 --> 01:30:40,462
<i>As much as I wanted the fairy-tale ending
with her...</i>

1344
01:30:41,797 --> 01:30:43,882
<i>... I wanted it all for myself as well.</i>

1345
01:30:55,602 --> 01:30:58,647
You might want to check that,
what with my track record.

1346
01:30:59,398 --> 01:31:01,441
I just did.

1347
01:31:01,483 --> 01:31:04,194
What for? You can't kill me.

1348
01:31:04,236 --> 01:31:06,822
You're a fucking loser like the rest of them.

1349
01:31:07,823 --> 01:31:12,452
Trust me, if you don't pull the trigger,
I'll be seeing you again.

1350
01:31:13,203 --> 01:31:15,414
You wish, bitch.

1351
01:31:16,164 --> 01:31:18,083
# BLONDIE: Call Me

1353

my old man wrote from prison,</i>

1354
01:31:38,312 --> 01:31:41,148
<i>about staying away from crime, women
and drugs?</i>

1355
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:43,775
<i>What a load of bollocks that turned out to be.</i>

1356
01:31:44,526 --> 01:31:46,612
<i>I tried the lot and won,</i>

1357
01:31:46,653 --> 01:31:49,114
