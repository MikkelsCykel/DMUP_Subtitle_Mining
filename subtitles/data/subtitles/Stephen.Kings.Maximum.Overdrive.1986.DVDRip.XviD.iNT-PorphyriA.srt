00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,356
Honey, come on over here, sugar buns!

2
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,032
This machine just called me an asshole!

3
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:51,835
I knock.

4
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,220
Jesus Christ, do you
know how to play this game?

5
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,052
Sure!

6
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:01,720
Well, then, why don't
you make your last draw?

7
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:58,562
The bridge is going up!

8
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:01,363
It can't be! That light was green!
- Stop!

9
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,036
What the fuck!

10
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,011
Look out!

11
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,346
Far out!

12
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:24,227
It's gonna bump!

13
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:55,796
The light's green. The
cross bar never went down.

14
00:05:56,809 --> 00:06:00,177
You goddamn stupid asshole!

15
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,967
Can't you see we've
got a situation here?

16
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,255
So, you get Mickey mantle
over to the baseball game?

17
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:39,467
You go on and joke all you want.

18
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:44,131
He hit three balls over the fence.
Once of 'em must've gone 250 feet.

19
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,599
Holy God, look at that thing!

20
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,309
I'll get it.

21
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,828
Handy, you son-of-a-bitch! I thought
you was down in Texas.

22
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,792
No, that was last week.

23
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:15,994
You like that?

24
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:19,709
That's some rig, alright.
- Give her a big drink.

25
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:23,176
I gotta have some coffee.
- Right.

26
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,099
Hey, men.
- Handy.

27
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,353
This damn thing!

28
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:44,234
What's the matter?

29
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,570
Well, this thing was workin'
just fine a few minutes ago...

30
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,031
...and now I can't get
pea-turkey on it.

31
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,035
Do you wanna bring me a coffee when
you get done jerkin' on that thing?

32
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,331
Robinson.

33
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:04,917
Robinson, get in here, boy.

34
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:06,748
I got eggs on!

35
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:09,714
I don't give a lady bug!
I want you in here now!

36
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:13,298
Wanda, shut that radio off and
mind them eggs for Billy!

37
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:29,393
Your mama!

38
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:45,380
Steve Gayton, Mr. Hendershot,
Duncan Keller's had an accident.

39
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:47,721
<i>Shit! What happened to him?</i>

40
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,466
He got diesel in his eyes.
I'll be damned if I know how.

41
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:54,222
Is that all? Flush
his eyes. Leave me alone.

42
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,646
I got me some talkin' to do in here. I
gotta wipe everybody's ass around here.

43
00:09:59,362 --> 00:10:03,656
Shitty job, but I reckon somebody's
gotta do it. Ain't that right, Bubba?

44
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,067
No. Lemme, lemme get this straight now.

45
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,738
You want me to work for nine hours...

46
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,165
...and only clock in for eight?

47
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,659
I know you've been to college, boy.

48
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,203
Screw that... not this kid.

49
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,123
You know what that
star means, don't you?

50
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,423
You ain't that obtuse, are you?
Parole, boy!

51
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:30,511
Your ass belongs to me or it
belongs to the state of North Carolina.

52
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,101
You've got one hell of a
racket goin' here, ain't you?

53
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:40,814
Put that back in the rack
for me on your way by, would you?

54
00:10:44,694 --> 00:10:46,105
Thank you, Bubba.

55
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:51,986
Shit!

56
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,202
Wanda, honey, you want me
to get that cup of coffee myself?

57
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,490
Bill!

58
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,582
It's getting' outta hand in here!

59
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:08,250
You ain't talkin' about me,
are you honey?

60
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:14,880
Jesus Christ!

61
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:24,062
Those eggs comin'
pony express or what?

62
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:26,725
Just a minute, Sir!

63
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,488
It's biting me! Make it stop!
- What is?

64
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,657
That knife! That knife!

65
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,123
Quick, quick a rag!
Somebody give me a rag!

66
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:50,837
That knife go rabid on you,
sweet thing?

67
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,088
It turned it motor on and it bit me.

68
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,798
Short circuit, maybe.
- There it goes again!

69
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:05,181
It's on again!

70
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:08,802
It's still goin'!

71
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,679
Look at that sucker! Nail it!

72
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,436
Now what?

73
00:13:43,983 --> 00:13:45,478
Safe!

74
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,236
Come on, sodas! I'm buyin'!

75
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,744
You guys can help me
pick stuff up, y'know?

76
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:09,410
No sodas!

77
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,389
What the hell?

78
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:41,864
Shit!

79
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:53,083
Coach, are you okay?

80
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:57,584
Come on, coach!

81
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:52,803
You'd better give up, sugar pie.

82
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,594
I haven't been able to get something
since half an hour or so.

83
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,473
I must have a broken antenna
or something.

84
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,691
<i>By the moment the information...</i>

85
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,352
How far you goin'
up the road, sugar pie?

86
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:10,859
It depends on how long you
can keep your hands to yourself.

87
00:16:11,786 --> 00:16:13,742
What's that, sweet thing?
I didn't quite catch it.

88
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:19,740
I said, I don't really know.
- Just driftin', huh?

89
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:26,330
I know what it's like. I've been
driftin' myself now for about 10 years.

90
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:29,421
When I started in this business,
about eight years ago...

91
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:31,919
Right after I got outta the army...
- I got somethin'.

92
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,252
I bet you did.

93
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,837
<i>...our microwave facilities
broke down.</i>

94
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:38,633
<i>Reports of strange occurrences
are pouringing over wire services.</i>

95
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:41,717
<i>We'll have further
bulletins as they come in.</i>

96
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:44,512
<i>But for the moment, let me
repeat this urgent message.</i>

97
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:47,223
<i>If you are near a major highway...</i>

98
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,686
<i>...get away at once!
Get away at!</i>

99
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:56,321
Shit!
- What's wrong there, sweet thing?

100
00:16:58,787 --> 00:16:59,901
Go in there.

101
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,368
If you don't get your hand off my
leg you're gonna be wipin' your ass...

102
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,785
...with a hook the next time
you take a dump.

103
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:07,378
I swear I never heard no
talk like that when I was a boy.

104
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,669
What the hell are you doing, girl?
What's the matter with you?

105
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:25,763
Lordy, Lordy, girl!
You goin' crazy or somethin'?

106
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,061
Did you hear anything that man said?

107
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,228
Are you... are you on something?

108
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:38,978
Oh, Jesus!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

109
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:42,324
Don't you go walkin'
away from me like that!

110
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,618
You come back here, girl!

111
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:47,283
Come back here and listen to me!
- Sweeten my shorts!

112
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:51,369
I swear, sometimes I think this old
world forgot what good manners is!

113
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,951
Here I go, give you a
ride in my brand new car...

114
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,915
...and look at the
garbage comin' outta your mouth!

115
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:00,543
Do you know what I think?
I think it's a damn!

116
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:04,217
Look at what that
stuff does to people!

117
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,881
The whole civilization is
about to make them fall.

118
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:10,301
You think the newspapers
are any better?

119
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:16,437
You know it ain't newspapers that are
gonna save this world or even TV!

120
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,976
I'm tellin' you right here and now as
far as I said, all that's...

121
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:23,273
...from the son, Jesus!
- It ain't full yet!

122
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:39,375
Shepherd, I shall not want!

123
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:44,547
Jesus, what the hell happened here?
- I don't know.

124
00:18:58,146 --> 00:18:59,937
What in the dickens
is goin' on around here?

125
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:01,642
That's a damn good question, isn't it?

126
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,480
That was your rig, wasn't it, Handy?
- Yeah.

127
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:07,319
Well then, who was drivin' it?
- I don't know.

128
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:10,025
But he must've been
a hot-wire champion.

129
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,400
Hell's bells!

130
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:34,715
We gotta get some gas.

131
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:37,803
Well, that's good 'cause
I gotta go to the ladies.

132
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,171
Can I come in and watch?

133
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,798
No, you cannot come in and watch.

134
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:43,560
Ouch! Shoot!

135
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:57,740
Did you see?
- What, honey?

136
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,904
Never mind.

137
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:23,587
Oh, Jesus!

138
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,311
Curt!

139
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,183
Curtis!

140
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,274
Is he dead?

141
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:20,233
Great God!

142
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:46,005
I need some ethyl.

143
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,972
Curt, I don't like this!

144
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:12,150
Curtis!

145
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:22,455
Are you dead?

146
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:25,453
Shit!

147
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:42,510
My God.

148
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,676
Get in right now!

149
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:27,973
Go! Go! Go!

150
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:41,944
The other way! The other way!

151
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,280
Come on, honey!

152
00:23:46,451 --> 00:23:49,615
You stop that yelling! You know
I can't drive when you shout at me!

153
00:24:12,016 --> 00:24:14,589
Boy, ain't this a no
count piece of shit!

154
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,887
You do what I said with that body?

155
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,689
Got him downstairs, sure.

156
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:25,599
Pretty crispy, Mr. Hendershot.
What happened?

157
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,694
Fucked if I know, Bubba.

158
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:31,650
Fucked if I know.

159
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,927
So, anybody in there?

160
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,015
No, not now.

161
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:35,807
You're cute.

162
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:40,895
Yeah? Am I?

163
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,481
Not that cute.

164
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:45,986
Well, maybe I'll grow on you.

165
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:52,277
Look at that. There's nothing!

166
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:56,995
Did you ever see that much nothing
at ten fifteen in the morning, hero?

167
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:06,666
Name's Bill.

168
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:10,040
Hi, Bill. Brett.

169
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:46,367
<i>Although microwave relays...</i>

170
00:27:46,544 --> 00:27:48,667
<i>...was knocked out
since nine o'clock this morning...</i>

171
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:52,503
<i>...this frightening mechanical revolt
appears to be occurring everywhere.</i>

172
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:55,760
<i>Europe, London, New Delhi,
Moscow...</i>

173
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,591
<i>The reports we have
are the same.</i>

174
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,676
<i>Machines apparently
operating themselves...</i>

175
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,886
<i>...are under the direction of
an agency we don't understand...</i>

176
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,470
<i>...are going on a
homicidal rampage.</i>

177
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,632
<i>Some cities are waking more
slowly than others.</i>

178
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,006
<i>Only one thing is
completely certain this morning.</i>

179
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,549
<i>And that is... no
machine is to be trusted.</i>

180
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,595
<i>Unplug all the electrical appliances.</i>

181
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,137
<i>If you have a truck or car...</i>

182
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:51,460
Let me tell you right now,
boy and girl.

183
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:54,168
That this beautiful American
truth way Bible...

184
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,582
...with fine git edge an full page
color pictures can be yours for...

185
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,133
...9,95. Wait a minute before you say
anything, let me tell you something.

186
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:02,632
This Bible has everything in it.

187
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:06,845
From the creation of this beautiful
world of ours to the fall of mankind.

188
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:10,218
Look, Duncan, just,
hang on a little longer, alright?

189
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:12,769
I gotta find my boy. Christ!
What's goin' on out there?

190
00:31:12,941 --> 00:31:15,097
Look, man. You can't even see!

191
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:17,105
I can see just fine.

192
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:20,403
I don't wanna pop you one, Joe.
You keep yapping' at me, I'm goin'!

193
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:25,068
Duncan? Duncan!

194
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:26,274
What's he doin'?

195
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,492
You really goin' after Deke, man?
- Yeah.

196
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:30,996
Look, how many fingers do you see?

197
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,541
Eight, twelve?

198
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:36,247
Alright, so I got a little double
vision. But it's clearin' up, Bill.

199
00:31:37,464 --> 00:31:38,838
I gotta find my boy.

200
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,164
I gotta!

201
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:44,125
Anything could be goin' on there.

202
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:45,916
Christ sakes!

203
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,421
You leave without punchin' out...

204
00:31:51,225 --> 00:31:53,633
...and you ain't never gonna
have to punch in again, Bubba.

205
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,299
Good!

206
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:58,598
You leave me along, fat fuck!

207
00:31:58,774 --> 00:32:00,317
No, leave him alone!

208
00:32:02,402 --> 00:32:03,601
Or what?

209
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:06,985
Or I'll knock your teeth in, Bubba.

210
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,582
Duncan, look out!

211
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,877
Oh God!

212
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:41,261
It'll give you
protection in time of danger.

213
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:45,940
It'll give you health in time of
sickness and fondness leviticus.

214
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,356
It just...

215
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,112
Oh, sucker!

216
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:58,451
Son-of-a-bitch! Out my way, bitch!

217
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:01,115
Fucker!

218
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:04,241
I'm gonna tear 'em up, boy!

219
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:16,001
Where the hell are you goin',
drunk son-of-a-bitch?

220
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,506
Get back inside, you idiot!

221
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,588
God dammit, you snot bag!
Come on out!

222
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,640
Come on! Get outta here!
- Let me go!

223
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,558
You wanna rock and roll with me?

224
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,106
Bastard!

225
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:33,021
Right here, you, prick!

226
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:36,561
You overgrown! Scum ball! ¡By God!

227
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:45,653
Get outta the way, you crappy asshole!

228
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:41,087
This is Bubba Hendershot at Dixie Boy.
Anybody read me out there?

229
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:44,162
Come on in, Rusty!

230
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:47,628
No one. No one in the cab
of that mother fucker at all.

231
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:50,472
Horse puck!
- What we gonna do now?

232
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:57,271
I don't know.
- This is Bubba Hendershot...

233
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:00,971
...at the Dixie Boy! God dammit,
Rusty, come on in, boy!

234
00:35:01,857 --> 00:35:03,315
Spread it on the ground next to him.

235
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:06,062
Hurry up, man!

236
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,152
Jesus, he's starting to draw flies.

237
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:17,234
What the hell are you doing in there?

238
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:18,488
Changing.

239
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:21,740
That salesman had his hands
all over me and he's dead now.

240
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:24,836
I don't like the smell of him on me.
I don't like it.

241
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:28,370
Jesus!

242
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:36,635
For chrissake, don't just stay there.
He's dripping all over my floor.

243
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:39,297
Get him outta here!
- Come on, man. Come on.

244
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:45,388
What the hell are you
guys looking at?

245
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:50,644
Nothing.
- That's right. Nothing.

246
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:52,729
Well then, go look
at it somewhere else.

247
00:35:58,492 --> 00:35:59,690
Okay.

248
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:32,149
Goddamn things got no right to
be running through this depot.

249
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,318
Where are they going, Curtis?

250
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:14,988
I don't know.

251
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:19,486
Greensboro, maybe. Maybe Charlotte.

252
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:23,278
Why?

253
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:25,371
Don't know.

254
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:31,380
Try the radio again.

255
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,942
I think I've just loaded my pants.

256
00:38:55,362 --> 00:38:56,311
Curt.

257
00:38:57,531 --> 00:39:00,817
Curtis, it's coming after us!

258
00:39:20,343 --> 00:39:22,715
My God, Curtis. It's gonna bump us!

259
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:36,103
Mom, please talk to me!

260
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:02,252
Hang on!

261
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:17,428
Curtis, I knew I never should
let you drive again.

262
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:26,225
Curtis, make him stop following us!

263
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:51,382
Curtis, what is going on?
- I don't know!

264
00:40:56,974 --> 00:40:59,975
But I know, we call the
police from the truck stop up there.

265
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:39,508
My God!

266
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,059
When we get to that truck stop
everything will be all right. Oh, yes.

267
00:41:49,104 --> 00:41:51,014
What are you doing?

268
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:54,096
Do you see that gap?

269
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:58,315
The next time it comes around
I'm gonna shoot right through it.

270
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,022
No, you don't!
They'll gang up and squash us!

271
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,479
I can do it!

272
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:06,404
All so we can be inside
where they are?

273
00:42:07,203 --> 00:42:09,196
What do you think is gonna
happen to us if we stay out here?

274
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:14,495
I'm scared.

275
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,370
Me, too.

276
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:23,749
Billy! Come here
and look at these fools.

277
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,966
Now what?
- They're dead.

278
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:31,847
Yeah, maybe not.
- Don't go out there, man.

279
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:34,057
Don't, Joe!
- Eat this.

280
00:42:35,354 --> 00:42:36,635
Hang on tight!

281
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:03,666
Curtis, I'm upside down. I'm stuck.

282
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,626
Where are you going?
Will you get me out of here?

283
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,207
I'm caught in this goddamn seatbelt.

284
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,879
I told you not to use the seat
belts. I told you a thousand time.

285
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:16,387
I said, watch out!
Curtis, will you help me?

286
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:20,516
Watch that thing, will you? That thing
looks sharp!

287
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:24,186
He's not my Curtis.
Where is my Curtis? Shit!

288
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:27,981
Goddamn, asshole! Curtis,
will you help me?

289
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:29,565
Help me!

290
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,157
Alright, Bubba!
Stick this one up your own cheek!

291
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:47,754
Fuckin' truck's gotta be dee-po'ed.
That one's deep po'ed for sure.

292
00:43:48,547 --> 00:43:50,955
Reload me, Joey.
Come on, reload me, boy.

293
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:01,213
And I want that shit, Bubba!

294
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,848
Come on! Run!

295
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:11,809
Honey, you're bleeding
like a stuck pig.

296
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:12,850
Where'd you get all that stuff?

297
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,067
We got a bunch of that stuff down.
- Shut up, Joey.

298
00:44:17,616 --> 00:44:19,903
Found it in my Christmas
stocking, Bubba.

299
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,607
Get inside. Come on, let's get inside.

300
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:24,002
How are the love birds?

301
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:27,426
Heart rates are
slowin' down a bit, I think.

302
00:45:28,388 --> 00:45:29,336
That's good.

303
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:31,503
Mother's helper?

304
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:37,728
A girl hitchin' her way down
to Florida needs some protection.

305
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,475
That's what you're doing'?
- Yeah.

306
00:45:44,484 --> 00:45:48,696
I was doing it before the machines
went into maximum overdrive.

307
00:45:58,206 --> 00:45:59,368
I'm scared.

308
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,049
If I put my arm around you...

309
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,131
...would you stick me with that thing?

310
00:46:18,057 --> 00:46:20,215
You don't stick a
person with a strap razor.

311
00:46:20,935 --> 00:46:22,133
It's more like...

312
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,429
And I wouldn't...

313
00:46:38,411 --> 00:46:39,523
Okay?

314
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,994
Holy cow!

315
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:36,410
Joey?
- Yeah?

316
00:47:38,547 --> 00:47:39,710
Get up here.

317
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,291
It's over, man.

318
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,502
Does he really got a lotta
fire power down in the cellar?

319
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,222
You heard him tell me
to shut up, didn't you?

320
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:53,811
Come on, Joey, this is serious.

321
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,101
He's got a lot.

322
00:47:58,567 --> 00:47:59,598
Grenades?

323
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:01,189
Well.

324
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:04,606
What else? Flame
throwers, rifles, what?

325
00:48:07,157 --> 00:48:09,315
You're gonna get us in an
awful lot of trouble, man.

326
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:14,987
In case you didn't realize it, boy,
we're already in trouble.

327
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,788
Talk to me, Joey.

328
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,871
Everything. He's got everything.

329
00:48:25,884 --> 00:48:27,377
Now, go and leave me alone, Billy!

330
00:48:30,888 --> 00:48:32,131
Holy shit!

331
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,838
You think he stole all this?

332
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:39,768
No, I think he bought it,
cheap like a guy like him does.

333
00:48:40,938 --> 00:48:42,135
Buys things cheap?

334
00:48:42,648 --> 00:48:45,649
Buy cheap and sell dear.
It's the American way.

335
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:53,319
Jesus Christ!
This is cute, isn't it?

336
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:56,824
You find any money on him, Bubba?

337
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,493
I don't now what to make of this, boy.
You're bright, I know you are.

338
00:49:06,002 --> 00:49:07,793
You keep on bein' obtuse.

339
00:49:08,254 --> 00:49:10,709
We don't wanna steal anything.
We just wanna get outta here alive.

340
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,378
You messin' again, Bubba,
who ain't oughta be messin'.

341
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:18,676
Sometimes even college
boys don't learn their lesson...

342
00:49:18,848 --> 00:49:20,971
...until they had their
chops busted a few times, do they?

343
00:49:21,476 --> 00:49:24,181
You know what's goin' on
outside or are you blind?

344
00:49:25,104 --> 00:49:28,471
You tell the little road twit
about your illustrious career?

345
00:49:29,273 --> 00:49:33,401
He's a blood-thirsty criminal, alright.
Regular John Dillinger.

346
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:34,767
Goddamn you!

347
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:38,857
Couple o' charlotte cops caught him
in this little bitty grocery store.

348
00:49:39,157 --> 00:49:43,238
With a sack o' money in his hand,
thumb up his ass, big grin on his face.

349
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:46,071
You wanna get outta here, boy.
One call, I get you outta here!

350
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:49,165
Oh yeah? Who you gonna call?
The North Carolina state police?

351
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,451
Now listen. I won't play any
goddamn games with you, Hendershot.

352
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:54,130
I just wanna get the hell outta here.

353
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:58,503
I'm warnin' you, boy.
- No, man, I'm warnin' you!

354
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:08,632
This thin's over,
your ass is grass, boy.

355
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:11,807
Do you hear me?

356
00:50:14,232 --> 00:50:15,228
Joey!

357
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:20,902
Goddamn you, Joey! I told
you to keep an eye on the keys!

358
00:50:21,364 --> 00:50:22,692
I owed a guy some money.

359
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:27,400
I was about twenty at the time.

360
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,579
Not real bright about most things.

361
00:50:31,747 --> 00:50:33,657
It's all right.
- No, it's not.

362
00:50:37,795 --> 00:50:39,503
What gets to me is his stupidity.

363
00:50:44,677 --> 00:50:47,843
Cops put that spotlight on me
and I just froze like a rabbit.

364
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,048
It's all right.

365
00:51:57,492 --> 00:51:59,780
I'll tell you one thing.
- What's that?

366
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,996
You sure make love like a hero.

367
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,848
Look at that light.

368
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,429
Do you know what I think?

369
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:34,147
What?
- I think it's the comet.

370
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,936
We've been in its tail for
almost twelve hours.

371
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:41,819
And if it is that comet that's making
everything go crazy...

372
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,404
...then all we gotta do is
stay alive for the next seven days.

373
00:52:46,703 --> 00:52:48,113
No problem.

374
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:06,176
I got an idea.

375
00:53:19,317 --> 00:53:20,348
Can you sail?

376
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:23,727
A little. Hobie cats
and things like that.

377
00:53:24,071 --> 00:53:26,064
Good deal. I used to crew big ones.

378
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,230
Sailboats, no motors.

379
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,245
No motors?

380
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:35,161
Where would we go?

381
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:37,746
I'm thinkin' about this
place called Haven.

382
00:53:38,169 --> 00:53:41,168
It's an island about
six miles off the coast.

383
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:46,130
And there aren't any motor vehicles
allowed on the place. None whatsoever.

384
00:53:46,717 --> 00:53:47,915
None?

385
00:53:49,928 --> 00:53:51,208
You know...

386
00:53:52,014 --> 00:53:55,382
...you are not only a hero...

387
00:53:56,643 --> 00:53:58,267
...you are a genius.

388
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:33,043
The whole goddamn
world's goin' to hell.

389
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:37,670
They can't! We made them!

390
00:54:37,846 --> 00:54:40,847
Look, honey. You've gonna hurt
yourself. Come on, sweet thing.

391
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:44,431
Don't you 'sweet thing' me!
- Now, Wanda June, baby, just let...

392
00:54:44,603 --> 00:54:48,221
They can't! We made them!

393
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:57,608
You can't! We made you! Do you hear?

394
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:03,324
Where's your sense of loyalty?
You things!

395
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:10,333
We made you! We made you!

396
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:15,712
Made you! We made you!

397
00:55:16,006 --> 00:55:17,833
Wanda!
- We made them!

398
00:55:18,008 --> 00:55:19,586
Wanda!
- We made them!

399
00:55:33,481 --> 00:55:36,766
Not the dark. Please God, don't...

400
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:45,155
I'm scared. Please
don't let us be in the dark!

401
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:57,449
Man, stop with them damn spoons.

402
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:00,043
Safer than the juke box.

403
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:01,748
I like spoons.

404
00:56:04,842 --> 00:56:07,463
Man, this is one piece of shit.

405
00:56:07,761 --> 00:56:09,339
Shit!

406
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:13,636
Damn trucks ain't never
gonna let us outta here.

407
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:15,014
I believe it.

408
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,817
Place your bets.
- I don't usually play for peanuts.

409
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:32,988
Come on.

410
00:56:35,203 --> 00:56:37,776
I gotta eat.
- Deal, woman.

411
00:56:41,377 --> 00:56:42,490
Hit me.

412
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:47,788
There's lot less of them.

413
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,291
Yeah.

414
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,757
Looks like they're running dry.

415
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:57,180
Think they're pushin' them in back.

416
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,143
Maybe tomorrow
it'll be our world again.

417
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:04,851
I don't know.

418
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:07,847
Was it ever?

419
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:10,852
I hate those fuckin' trucks.

420
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:13,854
I never did like trucks anyway.

421
00:57:15,241 --> 00:57:16,651
Holy shit!

422
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:18,948
What was that?

423
00:57:20,913 --> 00:57:24,031
God, that's that Bibles'
salesman I rode in with.

424
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:25,623
There's some guy out there?

425
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:30,617
Sweet Jesus, help me!

426
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:37,130
Help me!

427
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:45,931
Let's go get him!
- No, you don't!

428
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:49,104
You let some of those other big
strong men go out and get him.

429
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:51,472
I didn't sign on here to be no hero.

430
00:57:52,691 --> 00:57:53,472
Yeah!

431
00:57:54,401 --> 00:57:56,476
Wait a second! Wait a second! Wait up!

432
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:00,982
Just like the old joke, you can't
get there from here.

433
00:58:01,574 --> 00:58:03,780
We gonna stand around
and listen to him do that?

434
00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:06,493
Y'know, I think there
might be a way to get to him.

435
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,669
Now, the shower drain runs into
the ditch where the guy is.

436
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:09,088
Will we fit?

437
00:59:09,387 --> 00:59:11,629
One way to find out.
- You boys are crazy.

438
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:15,884
Curt? Curtis! Curtis!

439
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:19,551
What are you doin'?

440
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:22,477
I'll be right back.
- You ain't goin'!

441
00:59:22,898 --> 00:59:24,441
There's a man layin'
hurt out there, honey.

442
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:27,728
There's gonna be a man hurt layin' here
if you don't quit this foolishness.

443
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,861
If it was your man out there, you'd
want someone to go, wouldn't you?

444
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:32,438
Well, it ain't. You're not goin'.

445
00:59:32,783 --> 00:59:33,732
I'm goin'!

446
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:37,656
Don't make me a widow
on my wedding day, Curtis.

447
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:39,242
Okay.

448
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,245
Just scoot right across.

449
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:47,041
Pick up your feet and try not to...
- I can handle it.

450
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:52,215
You boys are just as crazy as a couple
of rats in a plugged-up shithouse!

451
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:57,219
You are without a doubt one of the
biggest fuck heads I ever met.

452
00:59:58,514 --> 00:59:59,629
Wish me luck.
- Yeah.

453
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:01,723
You ready? Let's do it.

454
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,958
Good thing that one was outta gas.

455
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:38,748
What makes you so sure that it was?

456
01:00:41,178 --> 01:00:43,384
I don't think we need to
worry about that right now.

457
01:01:15,043 --> 01:01:16,417
Okay.

458
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:26,424
Oh man, are you ready? One, two, three.

459
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:37,304
Bombs away!

460
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:48,858
Think it'll hold?
- Fucked if I know.

461
01:02:11,635 --> 01:02:12,549
You okay?
- Yeah.

462
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,425
Okay. You wanna grab that bag?
- Thanks.

463
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:20,845
Oh, Jesus. This sucker weighs a...

464
01:02:22,647 --> 01:02:24,306
Oh, boy!

465
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:32,021
Great smell, huh?

466
01:02:33,905 --> 01:02:35,316
You okay?
- Yeah.

467
01:02:41,997 --> 01:02:43,905
I wonder how many
people have peed in this.

468
01:02:49,504 --> 01:02:52,173
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

469
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:54,372
How's it taste?

470
01:03:07,853 --> 01:03:10,178
Shit! I'm sending' you a friend.
- Shit!

471
01:03:11,857 --> 01:03:13,482
Get outta here!

472
01:03:57,607 --> 01:03:58,686
Mister?

473
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:33,513
Help me!
- How?

474
01:04:34,182 --> 01:04:38,595
Pull me! Pull me!
- I can't! You're too heavy!

475
01:04:38,937 --> 01:04:40,562
Get me out of this ditch...

476
01:04:41,064 --> 01:04:44,848
...or by Jesus I'll kill you!

477
01:04:52,114 --> 01:04:55,780
Shit! What a great time! I wish I could
do that every day. What a blast!

478
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:57,825
¡Bill! Bill!

479
01:04:59,205 --> 01:05:01,695
Bill, help me!
- Jesus! That's Deke!

480
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:04,705
Help me!

481
01:05:05,169 --> 01:05:06,995
Come on!
- Please, help me!

482
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:14,132
Stop pulling me.

483
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:16,337
He's dead!
- No he isn't!

484
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:17,593
¡He's dead!

485
01:05:18,015 --> 01:05:19,806
He's dead! He's dead!

486
01:05:21,975 --> 01:05:23,968
Let's go. Come on, dammit!

487
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,138
Bill, you okay, bud?

488
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:31,557
Yeah, I'm okay. Will
you your ass, for chrissake?

489
01:05:39,951 --> 01:05:40,947
Okay.

490
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:48,456
Let's go.
- Bill?

491
01:05:53,254 --> 01:05:56,919
Bill, is my dad okay?

492
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:01,840
Come on.

493
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:07,091
Let's go partner.

494
01:06:10,729 --> 01:06:13,482
I think that truck got 'em.
That's what I think.

495
01:06:14,024 --> 01:06:15,566
I think they're dead.

496
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:18,599
No, they're all right.

497
01:06:19,195 --> 01:06:23,274
Then, where are they?
- There they are! They just came up!

498
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,407
That ain't no salesman.
That's Duncan's kid.

499
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,579
Go, go!

500
01:06:44,384 --> 01:06:46,542
Way to go, Billy!
- Hello, boy.

501
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,631
You ain't gonna be satisfied until you
get 'em right in here with us.

502
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,138
Cigar, Joey.

503
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,854
Mr. Hendershot, did you
see he nailed that big one?

504
01:06:59,023 --> 01:07:00,932
Bill, are you okay?
- Yeah.

505
01:07:01,108 --> 01:07:02,651
How'd you find the kid?

506
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,812
Bill, where's my dad?

507
01:07:08,532 --> 01:07:12,113
Duncan got scrubbed by
on of them big boys out there.

508
01:07:13,118 --> 01:07:16,404
Touch break, kid.
- You unbelievable shithead!

509
01:07:24,296 --> 01:07:25,327
Is it true?

510
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:29,706
Is it true?

511
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:34,092
Yeah, it's true.

512
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:42,676
No!

513
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:47,263
No, no. Hang on, now.

514
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:50,851
Hang on, Deke.
- Mr. Hendershot.

515
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:57,660
Just a little lesson from
the road twitch.

516
01:08:00,454 --> 01:08:01,653
Hold on, Deke.

517
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:07,385
Bill?

518
01:09:08,056 --> 01:09:09,052
Bill!

519
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:12,471
Bill, wake up!
There's something out there.

520
01:09:12,769 --> 01:09:15,640
There's something out there.
You gotta see this.

521
01:09:16,565 --> 01:09:17,940
Come on! Wake up!

522
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,031
It's right up here.

523
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:59,014
What the fuck is goin' on here?

524
01:10:06,986 --> 01:10:08,396
Now what?

525
01:10:53,237 --> 01:10:54,780
Holy God!

526
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:56,233
Alright!

527
01:10:57,323 --> 01:10:59,232
Alright, God dammit!

528
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:22,090
You want a war?

529
01:11:22,973 --> 01:11:24,052
You got one.

530
01:11:24,306 --> 01:11:26,464
Man, I wouldn't do that.
- Shut up, Bubba.

531
01:11:26,892 --> 01:11:28,967
Shit! Get down!

532
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,853
How do you like that, chickenshit?

533
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:10,507
Jesus Christ!

534
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:20,604
It stopped, man.

535
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:43,460
You sons-of-bitches!

536
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:13,149
Wanda, no!
- You sons-of-bitches!

537
01:13:13,323 --> 01:13:17,948
Don't go.
- We made you!

538
01:13:18,243 --> 01:13:22,537
Don't you understand?
You can't do this!

539
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,539
We made you!

540
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,264
¡Wanda, Wanda! That's
Wanda June out there, dammit!

541
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:43,596
Deke!

542
01:13:44,102 --> 01:13:46,176
Deke, goddammit, you're
gonna get killed. Stay down.

543
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:49,472
It's right there. If it wants
to waste us, it will.

544
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:10,076
Now what is it doing?

545
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,039
It's morse.

546
01:14:13,544 --> 01:14:14,741
Bullshit!

547
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:18,835
No, really. I should know. I got a
merit badge in it this spring.

548
01:14:19,758 --> 01:14:21,252
Well, what's it sayin', kid?

549
01:14:24,929 --> 01:14:26,637
Give me a pen.
I can't keep up with it.

550
01:14:46,825 --> 01:14:49,149
Incredible, they want us to feed them.

551
01:14:49,326 --> 01:14:50,322
Feed 'em?

552
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:53,455
Fuck 'em. Let 'em starve!
Half of them's outta gas already.

553
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,701
Let 'em starve, it won't take long.

554
01:15:01,881 --> 01:15:05,214
We can't fill 'em anyway.
We ain't got no power.

555
01:15:08,343 --> 01:15:09,292
Shit!

556
01:15:13,389 --> 01:15:15,881
I'll be damned. I'm
gonna turn on the pumps.

557
01:15:16,768 --> 01:15:19,473
Hope none of them left home
without their American Express cards.

558
01:15:22,774 --> 01:15:24,566
Bill, wait!

559
01:15:29,364 --> 01:15:30,360
Wait!

560
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:34,946
It's not a good idea. It's like Neville
Chamberlain giving in to the Nazis.

561
01:15:36,243 --> 01:15:37,524
Come here.

562
01:15:38,829 --> 01:15:39,825
Okay.

563
01:15:40,456 --> 01:15:42,283
Now, you see that one, right?
- Yes I do.

564
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,166
Okay. Now look,
here's the way I figure it.

565
01:15:44,335 --> 01:15:46,078
The big guys,
they're heavy weights, okay?

566
01:15:46,253 --> 01:15:49,207
They crash in here, they won't break
the floor and open the cellar.

567
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:51,416
But that one, that bastard ain't
no reason why he couldn't...

568
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:54,635
...call in a truck full of napalm and
hose this place down.

569
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,097
Just take care of yourself, okay?

570
01:15:58,807 --> 01:16:01,014
What are they gonna do?
Run me down?

571
01:16:01,894 --> 01:16:04,217
Shit, that'd be like a junkie tryin' to
run down his connection.

572
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,001
Alright, you bastard!

573
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,378
Tell all your friends the main
line's open.

574
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,467
Got the best shit on the
east coast, practically uncut.

575
01:17:34,977 --> 01:17:36,388
You got that, fuck face?

576
01:18:05,923 --> 01:18:07,547
This could be a very long day.

577
01:18:35,492 --> 01:18:36,606
Served, guy.

578
01:19:16,655 --> 01:19:20,238
Shut up, already! You ain't
don' so bad here! Here!

579
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:23,236
There! Suck on that!

580
01:19:28,832 --> 01:19:30,409
I'll take over.

581
01:19:33,628 --> 01:19:34,707
Thanks.

582
01:19:37,631 --> 01:19:39,292
I hope they choke on it.

583
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:51,520
Sorry, guys.

584
01:20:53,325 --> 01:20:55,698
It was fun while it
lasted, but we're all out.

585
01:21:18,598 --> 01:21:19,594
What?

586
01:21:20,183 --> 01:21:21,179
What do you want?

587
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:34,650
What?

588
01:21:34,947 --> 01:21:37,154
What's it doin'?
- I don't know.

589
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:49,348
Billy, come on, I'll take over here.

590
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:50,969
He's all done.

591
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:53,142
They don't understand.

592
01:22:54,645 --> 01:22:55,641
What's that, Billy?

593
01:22:56,396 --> 01:23:00,229
How it is to get tired.
How a man gets tired.

594
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:05,102
Why should they? Come on.

595
01:23:05,278 --> 01:23:10,236
If you need any help, call me.
- I will. Come on, man.

596
01:23:13,995 --> 01:23:15,703
We've been puttin'
stuff down in the cellar.

597
01:23:16,623 --> 01:23:18,366
Now the kid said there's
a big sewer pipe down there.

598
01:23:18,541 --> 01:23:20,748
He couldn't get in because of
the wire and shit.

599
01:23:20,919 --> 01:23:22,413
But we can use it to get outta here.

600
01:23:28,718 --> 01:23:29,998
Looks like the coffee break's over.

601
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:32,511
His master's voice.

602
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:37,380
Go on in and lay down now.
- All right.

603
01:23:49,779 --> 01:23:51,273
It isn't the comet, you know?

604
01:23:51,947 --> 01:23:53,572
It's the broom.
- What?

605
01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:55,648
Brooms.

606
01:24:01,246 --> 01:24:04,745
Imagine you're a race of aliens, right?

607
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:09,538
And you're looking
for a new place to live.

608
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:17,334
You're lookin' for a planet like we
look for a new place to live.

609
01:24:17,512 --> 01:24:19,006
A new house or something...

610
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:22,135
So here's Earth.

611
01:24:24,227 --> 01:24:26,303
Only it's like this big old house...

612
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:30,887
...and it's polluted...

613
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,485
...dirty and smoky.

614
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:40,486
Grease on the walls,
soot in the chimney...

615
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:48,655
And they send their
interstellar cleaners...

616
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,494
...sending their broom.

617
01:24:56,964 --> 01:24:58,588
Sweep us all up.

618
01:25:01,385 --> 01:25:02,962
That's what it is, a broom.

619
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:07,256
They use the machines
to sweep us right up.

620
01:25:23,824 --> 01:25:25,363
Mister!

621
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:26,986
Mister!

622
01:25:30,828 --> 01:25:32,026
Come over here.

623
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:43,286
How are you doing?

624
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,580
Tired and scared.

625
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,005
I've got this plan.

626
01:25:52,266 --> 01:25:53,545
Come on with this thing already.

627
01:25:54,809 --> 01:25:55,803
Bitch!

628
01:25:59,604 --> 01:26:02,309
We never gonna get out here.
Really.

629
01:26:02,482 --> 01:26:03,681
Cool, champ!

630
01:26:04,943 --> 01:26:08,359
Little human business to take care of,
some you wouldn't understand.

631
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:14,574
When I said run, you run, okay?

632
01:26:15,162 --> 01:26:17,735
What you gonna do?
- Don't worry, just run, okay?

633
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,076
What you gonna do?

634
01:26:23,959 --> 01:26:25,039
Run!

635
01:26:35,847 --> 01:26:38,633
I ain't never seen a hero with
his ass in the air like that.

636
01:26:44,521 --> 01:26:45,435
Hi, baby.

637
01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:01,201
I bet there's spiders down there.

638
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:04,405
I hate anything with
more than four legs.

639
01:27:04,707 --> 01:27:05,655
I can't do this!

640
01:27:05,832 --> 01:27:08,786
I'm just gonna keep...
Oh, don't drop me now!

641
01:27:09,794 --> 01:27:11,502
I just gotta see Curtis if you drop me.

642
01:27:23,181 --> 01:27:25,506
What, Curtis?
- Just stay down.

643
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:27,967
I wish we could get outta here!

644
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:38,820
Holy shit!

645
01:27:41,741 --> 01:27:44,231
Stay down, Bubba. Holy shit!

646
01:28:47,049 --> 01:28:49,172
Jesus is coming and he is pissed.

647
01:29:07,735 --> 01:29:10,521
Can we get outta here?
- Yeah, it's time to get outta here.

648
01:29:11,237 --> 01:29:12,518
Let's go, gang! Let's go.

649
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:15,230
Let's go.

650
01:29:48,272 --> 01:29:49,386
¡My God!

651
01:29:50,483 --> 01:29:52,689
That son-of-a-bitch is goin' up again.

652
01:30:02,577 --> 01:30:04,451
God almighty!
- Move it!

653
01:30:04,661 --> 01:30:06,072
Yeah.
- Come on, let's go!

654
01:30:06,246 --> 01:30:08,321
Come on, go, go!

655
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:05,754
How far, Bill?
- To the Marina?

656
01:31:07,468 --> 01:31:09,260
About a half a mile.

657
01:31:09,429 --> 01:31:15,016
<i>Humans here, humans here,
humans here, humans here...</i>

658
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:19,977
<i>...humans here, humans here,
humans here, humans here...</i>

659
01:31:20,148 --> 01:31:26,020
<i>Humans here, humans here.
- For my dad, shit head son-of-a bitch!</i>

660
01:31:35,035 --> 01:31:36,233
I don't want this anymore.

661
01:31:48,507 --> 01:31:50,416
I got him!
- Curt!

662
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,589
Curtis!

663
01:32:13,071 --> 01:32:16,274
Hurry up, you guys!
Come on, get in the boat!

664
01:32:22,663 --> 01:32:24,738
Right there is the one
I was thinkin' about.

665
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:27,954
We better hurry up.
It's getting light.

666
01:32:56,818 --> 01:32:59,226
Bill, where's Brad?

667
01:33:25,094 --> 01:33:26,886
Adios, mother fucker!

668
01:33:54,037 --> 01:33:56,326
What happens with it? Mother's helper!

669
01:33:59,709 --> 01:34:01,916
Come here! Somebody
help me with these things!

670
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:20,804
You think we're gonna be all right?

671
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:25,809
Deke, I know
everything's gonna be all right.

672
01:34:52,424 --> 01:34:56,421
Curtis, when can we get off this boat?
You know I get seasick.

673
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:01,005
I think I'm gonna whoops my cookies!

674
01:35:02,005 --> 01:35:12,005
