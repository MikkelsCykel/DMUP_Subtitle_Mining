1
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,007
My job takes me to a lot of places.

2
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:29,544
It's got its down sides.

3
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,745
I sleep alone. I eat alone.

4
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:35,055
I'm used to it, though.

5
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,387
I'd like to meet someone.

6
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:41,589
But it's tough when you live
out of a suitcase.

7
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:47,400
I go where I'm told...
do what I'm told.

8
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:51,172
I shouldn't complain.
The work is steady.

9
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:55,542
The money's good,
but it's not for everyone.

10
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:38,298
My name's Joe.

11
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,841
This is what I do.

12
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:32,994
You're late.

13
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:37,926
Sorry, Mr. London.
They closed Chechov bridge.

14
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:49,468
You're leaving?

15
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,772
I need the phone.

16
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,826
I can help with the bags.

17
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,691
No, I can handle it.

18
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:18,831
If you ever come back,
I can, I can use the money.

19
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:20,274
Thank you.

20
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,135
Goodbye.

21
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:43,692
I was taught four rules...

22
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,868
One, "Don't ask questions".

23
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:51,328
There is no such thing
as right and wrong.

24
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,042
Two, "don't take an interest in people
outside of work".

25
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:58,610
There is no such thing as trust.

26
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:02,077
Three, "Erase every trace".

27
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:05,481
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.

28
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,750
Four, "Know when to get out".

29
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,853
Just thinking about it.
Means it's time

30
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:18,263
before you lose your edge,
before you become a target.

31
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:38,343
So you look for the right opportunity.

32
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,578
Nothing too risky.

33
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,921
Get the money
and disappear forever.

34
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:47,323
This is it.

35
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,821
Four hits, one location.

36
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,365
The lastjob.

37
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,995
Purpose of your visit to Bangkok,
Mr. Vincent?

38
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,231
Holiday.

39
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,410
Bangkok.

40
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,977
It's corrupt,
dirty and dense.

41
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,415
All my clients have one thing
in common.

42
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,754
They feed off the people.

43
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,815
There's big money in misery.

44
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,552
Where there's money,
there's competition.

45
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,459
And the guy paying me
usually wins.

46
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,231
How will we know when he's arrived?

47
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,270
We'll know when he arranges the pick-up.

48
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:10,877
You're sure he's reliable?

49
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,205
The Russians swear by him.

50
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:20,784
How do you swear by...

51
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,415
a man you've never met?

52
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,095
We don't know him. He doesn't know us.

53
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:30,296
It's better for us that way.

54
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,929
It always starts the same way.

55
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,267
Just like I was taught.

56
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,839
Secure a safe location.

57
00:09:43,077 --> 00:09:46,046
Somewhere off the beaten path
where you have privacy.

58
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:51,515
But you stay invisible too long, the human race
starts to look like another species,

59
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,983
so you venture out, you observe,

60
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,756
and then you return to
your invisible world,

61
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:00,092
like a ghost.

62
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,674
Hey, Larry Check out the pussy here.

63
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,149
- Check out these girls.
- Hey, girls, what's up?

64
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,650
Hello, gentlemen, ah.
How are you?

65
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,016
- First time in Bangkok?
- Yeah.

66
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:29,284
Rolex? Good one if you want. Yeah, yeah,
Look. Good. Rolex.

67
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:31,848
Watch out, Larry. How much you want
to bet it's counterfeit.

68
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:33,788
Two thousand Baht only. Two thousand.
It looks good. Good.

69
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:35,830
- No. Thanks. No, thanks.
- No, no. No Rolex?

70
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:37,762
Never mind. Never mind.
You want girls?

71
00:10:37,832 --> 00:10:39,561
- I can get you girls.
- No.

72
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,101
No girls?
How about boys?

73
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,396
- You like boys?
- Nooo!

74
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,733
- You don't like boys, no?
- No. Hey,

75
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:46,740
Hey, how about you,
huh, cowboy?

76
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,639
Five thousand Baht, new car
smell satisfaction money back.

77
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,804
Super-rubber-pussy-guarantee, huh?

78
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,280
Whatever happens in Bangkok
stays in Bangkok.

79
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:57,078
You wanna find garbage?
Go to a garbage dump.

80
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,312
I look for three qualifications.

81
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:03,655
They have to speak a little English,
they have to want to make money,

82
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:07,220
and, above all they have
to be disposable.

83
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:12,699
Do you wanna make some money?

84
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:17,126
I have work in town.
I need some help.

85
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,771
What work?

86
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:21,300
Pick things up,
drop things off.

87
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,943
Maybe some translation.

88
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,974
About a month's work.
Two thousand a day.

89
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,554
- Dollars.
- Baht.

90
00:11:34,555 --> 00:11:36,420
Bullshit. Huh.

91
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:45,464
Five thousand, huh?
Forty five hundred.

92
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:48,294
Four thousand.

93
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:52,373
Two thousand, nine hundred
and fifty-two fifty, heh?

94
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,034
What you, what you say?
Come on!

95
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:57,241
We'll round up.
Three thousand.

96
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:59,241
You get paid at the end of the week.

97
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:00,638
No deal.

98
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:02,148
Ah, oh, okay, okay.

99
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:05,482
How about half, half now,
half at end of the week.

100
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:09,651
What's your name?

101
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:11,015
Kong.

102
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:12,652
Kong?

103
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,758
You can keep that in the wallet
you stole.

104
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,535
You come alone,
or you don't get paid.

105
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:31,276
Yes boss.

106
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:10,276
- Take off the shades.
- Huh?

107
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,716
Glasses. Off.

108
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,454
Keep that with you at all times.

109
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,564
- I have good phone.
- Now you have two.

110
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:28,964
You answer whenever it rings.

111
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,334
If I call and you don't answer,
you don't get paid.

112
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:40,576
Time is very important.

113
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:43,675
If I tell you to be somewhere

114
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:47,249
and you are a minute late...

115
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,081
you don't get paid.

116
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:52,154
Do you understand?

117
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:53,523
Birdshit foreigner

118
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:55,721
- In English.
- I understand!

119
00:13:57,165 --> 00:13:58,655
You know the Caribbean club?

120
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:00,333
High class ass.

121
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:03,929
Ask for a dancer named Aom.
You give her this.

122
00:14:04,072 --> 00:14:06,597
You make sure the X is
facing up like this.

123
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:08,539
She's gonna give you a package.

124
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,739
Don't open it.

125
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:11,810
What's in it?

126
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,674
It doesn't concern you.

127
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:15,609
Then you go pick it up.

128
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:17,917
I'll find someone else.

129
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,386
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
I, I do it. I do it. I do it.

130
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,185
You come straight back here.

131
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,318
You don't stop for anything.

132
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,085
What if I have to piss?

133
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:34,293
If you ask me one more question...

134
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:37,235
Then I won't get paid.
I know that.

135
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:43,239
- Okay, I go now, ah?
- Hey!

136
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:45,944
Take the cell phone.

137
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,348
Duck fucker.

138
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,425
Excuse me.
Which dancer is Aom?

139
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:35,352
That one right there.

140
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,159
Thank you very much.

141
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:18,135
What do you want?

142
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:01,909
Fuck a Duck!

143
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:27,836
- You late, huh?
- Gimme the case.

144
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:33,379
You don't get paid for today.

145
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:35,539
- Why not?
- You ran from the police.

146
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:38,108
You told me not to stop.
I, I do what you said.

147
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,380
Don't stop, no stop for nothing,
not even for piss!

148
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:43,389
From now on,
I don't want anymore police.

149
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:45,589
You understand?

150
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:25,258
The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.

151
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,832
But the eyes never change.

152
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:32,338
I was taught to start with the eyes.

153
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,540
I'm Kong.

154
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:38,957
Heroin?

155
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,631
Give him what he needs.

156
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,078
No, wait, wait, wait.

157
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,556
The elephant.

158
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:09,490
The ah, the nose, you see?

159
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:12,896
Pointing down... bad luck.
No good.

160
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:15,198
Bad luck for you.

161
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,767
Goodnight.

162
00:23:41,615 --> 00:23:44,413
Yeah, I'm checking on
a wire transfer.

163
00:23:46,286 --> 00:23:51,451
Account code
six-five-one, four-three, four-six.

164
00:23:56,063 --> 00:23:57,030
Thank you.

165
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:36,560

169
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:47,479
Do you speak English?

170
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:34,785
How many?

171
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:39,859
Eh, one.

172
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:48,931
In, oh, in the morning?
In the morning.

173
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:51,503
One...

174
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:54,179
Bef? Before bed.

175
00:26:07,494 --> 00:26:09,689
Two hundred and fifty Bath, sir.

176
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,169
Thank you.

177
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,678
Oh, I have it.

178
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:56,234
Excuse me.

179
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,508
How much are these?

180
00:26:57,578 --> 00:26:59,705
Those are 20,000 Bath.

181
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:03,982
20,000?

182
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:50,661
I really love it

183
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:18,952
Where's my money damn it?

184
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:17,975
You're late.

185
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,411
I'm sorry, boss.

186
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:21,646
Don't be sorry.
Be on time.

187
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:24,288
What happened to your face?

188
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,094
Some ass holes tried,
tried to mug me.

189
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:31,330
Like twenty of them.

190
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,630
But I kicked their asses.

191
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:40,470
I'm so sorry, boss.

192
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:43,267
So sorry.

193
00:29:43,944 --> 00:29:46,003
They... they take...

194
00:29:48,682 --> 00:29:50,081
It's been opened.

195
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:53,810
Not me. It's them.
They broke it.

196
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,184
But I wouldn't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

197
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:00,887
I don't let them have it.

198
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:05,762
There's a beer in the refrigerator.

199
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,390
It'll take down the swelling.

200
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:10,428
Yes, boss.

201
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:17,937
He's a bad man.

202
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:19,534
Who?

203
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,574
The man in the case.

204
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,279
You're going to kill him?

205
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:32,555
Can you teach me?

206
00:30:32,726 --> 00:30:34,785
- Teach you what?
- Everything.

207
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,423
I could help you.

208
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:53,601
Please?

209
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,144
Show, show me.

210
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:34,720
Again.

211
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:38,987
Again.

212
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:41,392
Again.

213
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,860
Again.

214
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:48,397
Again.

215
00:31:56,243 --> 00:31:57,175
Again.

216
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:03,847
Good.

217
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:19,198
That was your first lesson.

218
00:32:26,606 --> 00:32:28,233
Why didn't I kill him?

219
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,077
Maybe it's because,

220
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:35,109
and this is strange,

221
00:32:36,183 --> 00:32:39,016
somehow,
when I looked into his eyes,

222
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,547
I saw myself,

223
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,557
so I became his teacher.

224
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:50,525
The best way to defend yourself is to know
when something's about to happen.

225
00:32:50,997 --> 00:32:54,023
So, you have to learn
to read your surroundings.

226
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:56,231
See that man in the red jacket?

227
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:02,664
What man?

228
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,681
You're living in a city of mirrors.

229
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:16,654
Store windows, glass office buildings,
polished steel,

230
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:20,052
eyes in the back of your head.

231
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:24,329
Aaah!

232
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:29,235
Eyes in the back of my head, huh,
boss, huh?

233
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:30,391
I got you now, boss.

234
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,936
I'm not your boss.
I'm your teacher.

235
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:35,732
So I call you

236
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:51,617
How is he bad?

237
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,291
This man?

238
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:56,521
He hurts many country girls.

239
00:33:56,896 --> 00:34:00,161
From the north
He buys them from their parents?

240
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:03,532
Same thing like devil,
ah, this guy.

241
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,269
SHERATON HOTEL

242
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:25,534
leader Pramod Juntasa was found dead
in his pool last night.

243
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,240
Mother fucker,
he got what he deserved.

244
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:50,953
How many people have you killed?

245
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:53,797
I don't think about that.

246
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:57,169
Do the police know who you are?

247
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:04,466
No one knows who I am.
No one knows where I am.

248
00:38:06,913 --> 00:38:07,937
I know.

249
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:16,484
- How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

250
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,059
Four. Two letf.

251
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,208
Um, I...

252
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:49,913
Can you, can you help me?

253
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:54,079
Could you tell her that I wanna
take her to dinner?

254
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,010
Oh! Right.

255
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:44,431
It's ah... hot.

256
00:40:59,252 --> 00:41:01,186
Tom Yam Kung

257
00:41:08,194 --> 00:41:09,422
That's just...

258
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:20,567
Just eat it?

259
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:27,578
It's cooling it down.

260
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,860
It's hot again.
It's really hot.

261
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:57,575
Ha, the whole thing.

262
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:02,813
Yeah, that's better.

263
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:07,374
Oooh!

264
00:42:22,635 --> 00:42:26,867
Now, you don't pull the trigger.
You squeeze it.

265
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:13,542
- It's yours.
- Oh!

266
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:16,952
Congratulations.

267
00:44:04,904 --> 00:44:07,429
It's best if he doesn't know us.

268
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:12,210
But we should know more about him.

269
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:19,171
Where? Where...?

270
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:23,874
Okay...

271
00:45:57,316 --> 00:45:59,147
- Boss?
- Yeah.

272
00:45:59,418 --> 00:46:02,512
I just left the club.
I think somebody's following me.

273
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:07,782
Be at the Chao Praya ferry station
in twenty minutes.

274
00:46:07,994 --> 00:46:08,858
Okay, boss.

275
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:11,020
- Wait for my call.
- Done, boss.

276
00:46:14,367 --> 00:46:15,959
Okay, listen carefully.

277
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:19,903
Open the case.
Sixty-five, thirty-two, fifteen.

278
00:46:20,006 --> 00:46:22,406
You put the cell phone in the case,
and leave it.

279
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:23,305
Got it.

280
00:46:39,158 --> 00:46:41,023
I found it first. Let go.

281
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:50,226
- Give it to me.
- Let go. I found it first.

282
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:58,172
I found it first.

283
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:13,382
The case has returned.

284
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:35,209
Yes.

285
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:36,709
Put your boss on.

286
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:49,289
Yes.

287
00:47:49,462 --> 00:47:50,929
We had an arrangement.

288
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:54,729
If I see your people again,
I'll kill your wife.

289
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:04,935
We'll try again.

290
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:50,049
Thank you.

291
00:48:53,192 --> 00:48:55,558
Ah, you, what, what is your work?

- Bank, banker, yes.

295
00:49:08,674 --> 00:49:11,438
He said he's a banker

296
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:16,071
Rain.

297
00:50:21,947 --> 00:50:23,141
Rain.

298
00:50:25,918 --> 00:50:29,479
Is you?
Your, your name means rain?

This is your name.

300
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,082
- Bad man?

302
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:18,319
Where's Damnoen Saduak?

303
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:21,523

00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:31,837
We leave early.

306
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:37,265
Dock the boat up on the right.

307
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:32,127
Hey, Mr... You buy something?

He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

318
00:59:13,078 --> 00:59:14,375
Thai people love him.

319
00:59:17,215 --> 00:59:18,739
He's a very good man.

320
00:59:20,652 --> 00:59:23,120

FIFTY COINS - FIFTY WISHES

322
01:02:04,015 --> 01:02:07,576
I am happy together with you.

323

Four Know when it's time to get out.

324
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:09,226
Three. Erase every trace.

325
01:05:13,404 --> 01:05:14,234
Boss?

326
01:05:16,741 --> 01:05:20,973
Two... Don't take an interest
in people outside of work.

327
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,458
One... Don't ask questions.

328
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,726
He's a very good man.

329
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:45,860
Same like you...

330
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:42,188
Political assassination wasn't in the contract.

331
01:06:42,694 --> 01:06:44,457
So, there are two ways to go.

332
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:47,790
Refuse the job and walk away now,

333
01:06:48,433 --> 01:06:52,199
or, do the job and walk away rich.

334
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,069
The truth is almost anyone one can take out a politician.

335
01:06:59,577 --> 01:07:01,204
That's not the hard part.

336
01:07:01,713 --> 01:07:04,409
The hard part is getting away with it.

337
01:07:16,194 --> 01:07:17,627
He wants more money.

338
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:27,162
It's a big job. There's risk.

339
01:07:32,277 --> 01:07:33,767
Yes. He knows who we are.

340
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,370
If he were caught,

341
01:07:38,883 --> 01:07:40,373
it could lead back to us.

342
01:07:41,886 --> 01:07:43,376
What about the messenger?

343
01:07:45,356 --> 01:07:46,914
We should erase every link.

344
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:48,993
The girl too.

345
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:51,393
Just to be safe.

346
01:07:54,299 --> 01:07:55,596
I'll take care of it.

347
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:07,803
- I'd better go.
- He can wait.

348
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:10,941
He's counting on me.

349
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:45,983
Kong!

350
01:08:50,888 --> 01:08:52,515
Be here tomorrow at six P.M.

351
01:08:55,693 --> 01:08:56,591
Lastjob?

352
01:08:57,495 --> 01:08:58,393
Yeah.

353
01:08:58,629 --> 01:09:00,927
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

354
01:09:02,433 --> 01:09:03,661
See you tomorrow, boss.

355
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,965
Call him. Or we do to your sister...

356
01:09:41,806 --> 01:09:43,103
what we did to you.

357
01:09:47,812 --> 01:09:48,710
Call.

358
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:10,063
Aom!

359
01:10:21,312 --> 01:10:22,279
Kong!

360
01:10:36,928 --> 01:10:38,088
Where is he staying?

361
01:10:48,806 --> 01:10:49,636
Aom!

362
01:10:57,348 --> 01:10:58,975
Tell me where he is staying.

363
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:01,243
Or I'll cut her tits off.

364
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:48,009
He fight bad guys and help the poor.

365
01:13:48,919 --> 01:13:50,147
Thai people love him

366
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:03,210
When the nightmare becomes real,
you don't hesitate.

367
01:17:03,314 --> 01:17:05,942
You don't think
You just run.

368
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:08,410
Anyone in the way goes down.

369
01:17:08,586 --> 01:17:11,267
It's pretty simple.
You are the target now.

370
01:17:11,302 --> 01:17:13,948
Leave the country,
or you are going to die.

371
01:18:53,023 --> 01:18:54,388
Where is Kong?

372
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:56,987
Where is Kong?

373
01:18:57,494 --> 01:18:59,121
Why the fuck you care?

374
01:19:00,898 --> 01:19:02,058
He's my student.

375
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:08,199
Where is Kong?

376
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:11,202
Surat.

377
01:19:12,643 --> 01:19:13,871
He's with Surat.

378
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:20,540
...exactly which direction everybody's running
doesn't seem to be running away

379
01:19:24,455 --> 01:19:25,683
Still no answer.

380
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:28,085
Maybe he killed them.

381
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,225
He's only one man.

382
01:21:07,624 --> 01:21:11,060
This is taking too long. When will he show up.

383
01:21:38,388 --> 01:21:40,083
There he is!

384
01:21:40,858 --> 01:21:42,689
Let's go.

385
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:58,099
What's that noise?

386
01:22:06,683 --> 01:22:10,119
Where is he? Do you see him?
I can't see anything.

387
01:26:31,014 --> 01:26:33,107
Kong, where is he?

388
01:28:11,448 --> 01:28:12,745
I had to tell them.

389
01:28:21,124 --> 01:28:22,557
Take her to the street.

390
01:28:23,126 --> 01:28:24,616
I cleared the way.

391
01:28:25,195 --> 01:28:26,628
I got one more job.

392
01:28:27,197 --> 01:28:28,221
Surat?

393
01:28:28,999 --> 01:28:30,557
He's very bad.

394
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:46,244
Don't wait. Just go.

395
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:53,641
Shoot him.

396
01:29:54,818 --> 01:29:55,910
Shoot him.

397
01:30:09,699 --> 01:30:14,068
Get off!
Go and fight!

398
01:30:14,237 --> 01:30:15,261
Shoot him!
