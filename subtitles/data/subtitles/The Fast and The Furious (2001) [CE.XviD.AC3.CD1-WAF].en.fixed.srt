00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:02,624
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's comin' your way.

2
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,959
Look for "Rodgers"
on the side of the truck.

3
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,465
Don't forget
my share of the deal.

4
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,702
Shit!

5
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,072
- Tuna on white, no crust, right?
- I don't know. How is it?

6
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,208
Every day for the last three weeks
you've been comin' in here...

7
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,515
and you've been askin' me
how the tuna is.

8
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,077
It was crappy yesterday...

9
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:53,182
it was crappy the day before,
and guess what.

10
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,250
- It hasn't changed.
- I'll have the tuna.

11
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,421
- No crust?
- No crust.

12
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,653
Thank you.

13
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,069
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't workin', brother.

14
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,505
It's your fuel map.
It's got a nasty hole.

15
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,169
- It's why you're unloading in third.
- I told you it was third.

16
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,077
I lengthen the injector pulse
another millisec...

17
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,082
and just tune the NOS timer,
you'll run nines.

18
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,891
What's up with this fool?
What is he, sandwich crazy?

19
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,894
No, V. He ain't here
for the food.

20
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:38,590
Chill out, bro.
He's just slingin' parts for Harry.

21
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:42,031
- I know what he's slingin'.
- He's tryin' to get in Mia's pants.

22
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,535
- What's up, guys?
- How you doin', Mia?

23
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,037
How you livin', girl?

24
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,968
Hey, Dom.
You want somethin' to drink?

25
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,784
Ah, he's beautiful.

26
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,447
I like his haircut.

27
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,455
Vince.

28
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,322
Vince!

29
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,986
- What?
- Can I get you anything?

30
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,733
You look good.

31
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,368
Thanks a lot, Mia.
See you tomorrow.

32
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,873
Sure.

33
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,810
- Tomorrow?
- Oh, I love this part.

34
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:32,606
Try Fatburger from now on.

35
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:35,116
You can get yourself a double-cheese
with fries for 2.95, faggot.

36
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:38,313
- I like the tuna here.
- Bullshit. No one likes the tuna.

37
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:39,946
Well, I do.

38
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,968
Jesus Christ, Dom!
Would you get out there?

39
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,666
I'm sick of this shit!
I'm not kidding, Dom!

40
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,503
Get out there!

41
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:05,446
- What'd you put in that sandwich?
- That's really funny.

42
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:08,272
All right.

43
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,433
- He was in my face.
- I'm in your face.

44
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,005
Relax! Don't push it!
You embarrass me!

45
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,813
Get over there!

46
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:41,043
Jesse, give me the wallet.

47
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:47,345
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

48
00:08:47,423 --> 00:08:49,084
- Is that what you are?
- No, man.

49
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,991
Don't come around here again.

50
00:08:53,596 --> 00:08:56,394
Hey, man,
you know this is bullshit.

51
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,526
- You work for Harry, right?
- Yeah, I just started.

52
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:01,433
You were just fired.

53
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,242
Hey, Dominic, I appreciate
what you did in a big way.

54
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,584
Dominic, I owe you.

55
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:24,190
Brian, you're messin'
with my business.

56
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,194
When Dominic drives,
he's golden.

57
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:29,493
Kids pour in here, want everything
he has, every performance part...

58
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,192
and they pay cash!

59
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:34,202
- What did Dominic say?
- You don't wanna know.

60
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,671
- What did Dominic say?
- He wants you outta here.

61
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,765
- He wants me outta here?
- Yes!

62
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:43,539
- And what did you say to Dom?
- What do you think I said?

63
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:46,480
I told him,
"Good help is hard to find."

64
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,518
Relax.

65
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,557
I need NOS.

66
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,820
- I need NOS.
- No.

67
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,590
My car topped out at
140 miles per hour this morning.

68
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:02,597
Amateurs don't use
nitrous oxide.

69
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:05,930
I've seen the way you drive.
You got a heavy foot.

70
00:10:06,002 --> 00:10:08,766
- You'll blow yourself to pieces.
- I need one of these.

71
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,806
One of the big ones.

72
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:13,205
Actually, no.
Let's make it two.

73
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:16,210
And, Harry,
I need it by tonight.

74
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:30,146
Hey, hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

75
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:38,156
Sweet ride.
What you runnin' under there, man?

76
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:43,229
- Making me find out the hard way?
- Hell, yeah.

77
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:46,860
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

78
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:49,427
I got a last name too,
but I can't pronounce it, so...

79
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:50,995
Brian Spilner.

80
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:53,668
Typical white boy name.
Know what I'm sayin'?

81
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,876
See that over there?

82
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:01,747
That's mine. It's my baby. But
I ain't cuttin' her loose tonight.

83
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,877
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm goin' legit.

84
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:06,421
Tryin' to get on the NI RA circuit.
You heard about that?

85
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:07,922
Hell, yeah.

86
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,084
- So what's up with you, man?
- I'm just waitin' for Toretto.

87
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,594
Shit. Better get in line.

88
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:16,757
- This yours?
- Yeah. I'm standin' next to it.

89
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,735
That's funny. You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

90
00:12:20,803 --> 00:12:22,896
And one of the things
Edwin knows is...

91
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,440
it's not how you
stand by your car.

92
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:27,976
It's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

93
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,810
Oh, shit.
Here they come. It's on.

94
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,739
- Dom, how you doin'?
- Hey, Camille.

95
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,741
You been doin' yoga?

96
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:06,805
You did?
Of course you did. Monica.

97
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,817
I smell skanks.

98
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:16,086
Why don't you pack it up before
I leave tread marks on your face?

99
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,957
- Letty, I was just talkin'.
- Whatever.

100
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,156
Okay, Hector.

101
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,426
Yeah? What's up, man?

102
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,993
- What's up?
- Edwin.

103
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:29,697
- How we doin' this tonight?
- One race.

104
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:32,468
Two-G buy-in.
Winner takes all.

105
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:35,443
- Hector, you're gonna hold the cash.
- Why Hector?

106
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:37,502
He's too slow
to make away with the money.

107
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,175
- Good luck, guys.
- Wait. Hold up.

108
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:47,154
I don't have any cash, but I do
have the pink slip to my car.

109
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:50,852
You just can't climb in the ring
with Ali 'cause you think you box.

110
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,828
He knows I can box.

111
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,989
So check it out.
It's like this.

112
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:59,228
I lose, the winner takes my car,
clean and clear.

113
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:03,068
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

114
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:04,470
Respect.

115
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,377
To some people,
that's more important.

116
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,870
That your car?

117
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,418
I see a cool-air intake.

118
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,217
It's got a NOS-fogger system
and a T-four turbo, Dominic.

119
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,417
I see an AIC controller.

120
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:26,359
It has direct port
nitrous injection.

121
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:29,393
Yeah, and a stand-alone
fuel management system.

122
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,718
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

123
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,662
You see that shit?

124
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:40,897
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up, period.

125
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:43,863
What do you say?
Am I worthy?

126
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,738
We don't know yet.
But you're in.

127
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,402
Let's go.

128
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,278
What the hell's
goin' on around here?

129
00:15:56,346 --> 00:16:00,282
Street's closed, pizza boy.
Find another way home.

130
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,942
Goddamn street racers.

131
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:04,953
Log on 22, code three.
Tension is high.

132
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,955
They've blocked the street.

133
00:16:52,702 --> 00:16:54,135
Edwin...

134
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:59,364
this is yours,
whether you win or lose.

135
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:02,570
But if you win,
you get her too.

136
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,380
You're gonna win.

137
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,383
I'm gonna win.

138
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,705
We had a reported homicide, 187,
at Barakian Liquor.

139
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:06,833
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it.

140
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,378
We're good to roll.
I repeat, good to roll.

141
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:11,380
- Let's race!
- Right.

142
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,314
Go!

143
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,838
Hell, yeah!

144
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,355
Damn, that guy's fast.

145
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:05,659
Let's go!
"Menage a"!

146
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:35,155
No! Monica!

147
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,213
Shut up!

148
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:48,933
Let's go now, baby!

149
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:03,376
- Here's what you want, right here.
- There you go.

150
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:05,614
You were racin'
a bunch of skateboards.

151
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,625
My sister holds the money.

152
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:12,126
Count it.

153
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,060
And you're my trophy.

154
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,859
Hey, Monica!
What's up, baby?

155
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:23,371
What's your problem, nigga?
You didn't win.

156
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,300
Fuck you, then!

157
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:43,916
- Was that fun?
- Got a problem there, huh, buddy?

158
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:53,659
- What are you smilin' about?
- Dude, I almost had you.

159
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:58,268
You almost had me?

160
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:01,934
You never had me.
You never had your car.

161
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:07,975
Granny shifting,
not double-clutchin' like you should.

162
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,485
You're lucky that hundred-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

163
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:16,022
Almost had me?

164
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,029
Now me and the mad scientist
gotta rip apart the block...

165
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,930
and replace
the piston rings you fried.

166
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,668
Ask any racer, any real racer.

167
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:39,201
It don't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

168
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,077
Winning's winning.

169
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:51,055
Available units, we have reported
street racing along Hawthorne...

170
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,389
Oh, shit! We got cops!

171
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,722
Go!

172
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:09,333
Dom, get in the car! Go!

173
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,984
Toretto, stop right there!

174
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,843
Get in!

175
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,158
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

176
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:48,099
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

177
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:51,763
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keepin' your car.

178
00:25:53,173 --> 00:25:55,835
You drive like you've done this before.
What are you, a wheel man?

179
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,745
You boost cars?

180
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:03,209
- No. Never.
- Ever done time?

181
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:06,514
Couple of overnighters.
No big deal.

182
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:09,886
What about the two years
in juvie for boostin' cars?

183
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:14,823
Tucson, right?

184
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:18,626
Yeah, I had Jesse run a profile
on you, Brian Earl Spilner.

185
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:22,931
He'll find anything on the Web,
anything about anybody.

186
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,937
So why bullshit?

187
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,407
So what about you?

188
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,574
Two years in Lompoc.

189
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:36,973
I'll die before I go back.

190
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,384
- Oh, great.
- What?

191
00:26:47,694 --> 00:26:50,322
It's gonna be a long-ass night,
that's what.

192
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:55,960
Follow us.

193
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,986
I thought we had an agreement.

194
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:51,251
You stay away, I stay away.

195
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:53,987
Everybody stays happy.

196
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,154
We got lost, Johnny.
What do you want me to tell you?

197
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,666
- Who's "we"?
- My new mechanic.

198
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,428
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

199
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:04,527
The guy in the snakeskin pants,
that's his cousin, Lance.

200
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:08,234
So when are you gonna give me
a shot at that Honda 2000 of yours?

201
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:11,004
- This your ride?
- It was. It's his now.

202
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:13,171
No, it's not.
I haven't taken delivery.

203
00:28:16,016 --> 00:28:18,382
Then it's nobody's car.

204
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,852
Somebody put in the wrench time.

205
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:26,819
- What do you think, Lance?
- It's an amazing machine.

206
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:28,657
Yes, indeed.

207
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:32,565
Let's go.

208
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:36,861
I'll see you
in the desert next month.

209
00:28:36,937 --> 00:28:38,904
Be ready to have
your ass handed to you.

210
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,834
You're gonna need more
than that crotch rocket.

211
00:28:40,906 --> 00:28:42,931
I got somethin' for you.

212
00:28:56,788 --> 00:28:58,255
What the hell was that about?

213
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:01,258
Long story. I'll tell you later.
Let's get outta here.

214
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,553
NOS!

215
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,196
So, what the hell
was that all about?

216
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,931
It's a long story.

217
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:49,064
We got a 20-mile hike.
Humor me.

218
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,871
A business deal that went sour.

219
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:56,004
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleepin' with his sister.

220
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:29,808
Yo, Spilner.

221
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:32,816
You want a beer?

222
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:36,278
Oh, shit.

223
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:03,373
We were all there, right?
Falling behind.

224
00:31:03,448 --> 00:31:05,882
- With all that nitrous.
- Yeah.

225
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:15,650
Yo, Dom. We were just about
to go lookin' for you, brother.

226
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,691
- Where were you?
- There were mass cops there.

227
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:27,567
They came in from every direction.
Their shit was orchestrated.

228
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:30,130
- This your beer?
- Yeah, that's my beer.

229
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:35,169
Yo, Einstein.
Take it upstairs.

230
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,342
You can't detail a car
with the cover on.

231
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,341
Can't even get that right.

232
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:42,852
You all right?

233
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,349
Am I all right?

234
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:48,415
It was just a question.

235
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:54,325
Yo, Dom! Why'd you bring
the buster here?

236
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,390
'Cause the buster
kept me out of handcuffs!

237
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:59,232
He didn't just
run back to the fort!

238
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:01,772
The buster brought me back.

239
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:11,214
You can have any brew you want...
as long as it's a Corona.

240
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:14,308
- Thanks, man.
- That's Vince's, so enjoy it.

241
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:16,754
You...

242
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,229
Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?

243
00:32:26,297 --> 00:32:28,925
Yeah, upstairs.
First door on the right.

244
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:46,283
He's got no call
bein' up in here.

245
00:32:46,351 --> 00:32:49,081
- You don't know that fool for shit!
- He's right, Dom.

246
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:51,850
Vince, there was a time
when I didn't know you.

247
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:54,414
That was in the third grade!

248
00:32:56,861 --> 00:32:59,022
Yeah, so, what girls are here?

249
00:32:59,097 --> 00:33:01,930
- You name it. You want mine?
- You need to shut the f...

250
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:05,862
- You don't have anything?
- You look a bit tired.

251
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,996
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

252
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:09,664
Look at all our guests.

253
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:13,006
How about we go upstairs
and you give me a massage?

254
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,046
Crazy lady.

255
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:27,524
You know you owe me
a ten-second car, right?

256
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,193
Ouch.

257
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:33,592
Oh, shit.

258
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:40,204
Did you wipe the seat?

259
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:46,539
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Would you cut the shit already?

260
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:48,044
Come on!

261
00:33:49,514 --> 00:33:52,176
Come on.
Let's go get me a drink.

262
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:55,252
Come on, man.
We were just about to get along.

263
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:04,926
- So, what do you want?
- Anything, long as it's cold.

264
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:09,156
My brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

265
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:11,794
Yeah, he's a complicated guy.

266
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:13,803
Yeah? What about you?

267
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:19,275
- I'm simpler.
- You're a shitty liar.

268
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,879
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

269
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,111
- But there's a problem.
- What's that?

270
00:34:27,185 --> 00:34:29,915
You need to get some sleep.

271
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:34,357
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

272
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:37,155
Come on. I'll take you home.

273
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:02,316
Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.

274
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:05,982
Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.

275
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:09,754
Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.

276
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:12,955
Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.

277
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:17,667
What'd I do?

278
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:20,670
Shut up.
He's clean, Sarge.

279
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:33,610
Damn! Muse, will you
take these things off?

280
00:35:33,685 --> 00:35:36,210
- Shit. You put 'em on so tight.
- I like realism.

281
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:39,154
- You like realism.
- You never know who's watching.

282
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:47,450
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than that last place you confiscated.

283
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:51,761
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

284
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:54,461
See? Even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

285
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,507
Here he is, fresh from
Toretto's hot rod heaven.

286
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,510
That was an $80,000
vehicle, officer.

287
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,173
- Wait. You tell him what happened?
- He knows what happened.

288
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,615
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
- The kid's givin' me attitude?

289
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:13,882
That doesn't speak very well
for police-FBI relations, Tanner.

290
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:17,049
- I walk in, the guy's already givin'...
- All right, all right.

291
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,355
We'll talk, okay?
Let's talk about it.

292
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,726
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please.

293
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:25,493
- Come on.
- Regular or decaf, Sarge?

294
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,162
Decaf, I think.

295
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:32,138
Four hijackings in two months,
and we don't have anything.

296
00:36:32,207 --> 00:36:34,641
DVD players and digital cameras alone
are worth a million-two...

297
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:37,337
which brings the grand total
to six million plus.

298
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:40,540
We're in the political
crosshairs now, Brian.

299
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,742
That's why you're undercover.

300
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:46,719
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you wanna know something?

301
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,155
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

302
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,318
- What does the truck driver say?
- He gave us the same M.O.

303
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:56,590
Three Honda Civics,
precision driving...

304
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:59,827
the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

305
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:02,495
Lab says the skid marks
came back the same:

306
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,504
Mashamoto ZX tires.

307
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:07,063
So we know that it's somebody
in the street racing world.

308
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,200
We don't make this case soon...

309
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:11,677
the truckers will take matters
into their own hands.

310
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:14,374
I tell 'em we're close.

311
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,383
You gonna make me a liar?

312
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:18,385
Look, what do we know?

313
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,115
We all know this world revolves
around Toretto, right?

314
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:24,124
I'm not sayin' that he's necessarily
the one that's poppin' these trucks...

315
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:26,922
but I can guarantee the both of you
that he knows who is.

316
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,293
- It's just a matter of time until...
- You want time?

317
00:37:29,364 --> 00:37:32,891
Buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

318
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,363
Just get me something I can use.

319
00:37:37,538 --> 00:37:39,563
Is Harry cooperating?

320
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:43,475
Yeah, like a guy who's gonna do time for
receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

321
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:45,535
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

322
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:48,673
He's scared of him, but he doesn't think
he's jackin' trucks in his spare time.

323
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,184
- He's too controlled for that.
- Wait.

324
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:54,449
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

325
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,322
but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

326
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:01,157
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

327
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:03,163
Do not turn your back on him.

328
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:06,433
Hey, Tanner.
I'm gonna need another car.

329
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,138
What about parts and service?

330
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,299
- Hold off on that.
- What should I do with this?

331
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:21,279
All right,
what the hell is this?

332
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:23,283
What do you got there?

333
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:26,786
- This is your car.
- My car?

334
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:30,312
I said a ten-second car,
not a ten-minute car.

335
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:34,452
You could push this across
the finish line, or tow it.

336
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:37,958
Couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

337
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,492
No faith.

338
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,162
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

339
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,467
- This is a garage.
- Pop the hood.

340
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,303
- Pop the hood?
- Pop the hood.

341
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:51,377
TwoJZ engine.

342
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:54,142
- No shit.
- And what did I tell you?

343
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,547
- I retract my previous statement.
- You know what?

344
00:38:56,617 --> 00:39:01,247
This will decimate all
after you put about 15 grand in it...

345
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:04,723
or more, if we have to
overnight parts from Japan.

346
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,090
We'll put it
on my tab at Harry's.

347
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,594
Yes!

348
00:39:08,663 --> 00:39:12,827
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

349
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,893
There's a show in the desert called Race
Wars, and that's where you'll do it.

350
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:21,704
Tell you what. When you're not workin'
at Harry's, you're workin' here.

351
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,974
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

352
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,144
you don't belong near a car.

353
00:39:27,179 --> 00:39:28,242
You don't belong near a car.

354
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:34,087
He owns you now.

355
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,911
Tell me what you think about this.

356
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:03,239
Koni adjustables.

357
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:05,543
Gonna save us about two pounds.

358
00:40:05,615 --> 00:40:09,016
And they're gonna give us better
traction for the hole shot.

359
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:10,780
All right?

360
00:40:10,854 --> 00:40:13,254
This is your basic
layout of the car...

361
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:17,851
and that's pretty much what
it could look like when it's finished.

362
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:19,862
Red, green.

363
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,057
Man, you should be goin'
to MIT or somethin'.

364
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:24,066
Yeah, right.

365
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:27,035
No, I got that...
Oh, what's it called?

366
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:31,267
- That attention disorder...
- ADD?

367
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,037
Yes, that shit. Yeah.

368
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:38,078
You know, I was good
in algebra and, like, math...

369
00:40:38,148 --> 00:40:39,809
and shit.

370
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,874
Everything else I failed.

371
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:44,819
Dropped out of school.
I don't know.

372
00:40:44,888 --> 00:40:48,016
It's just somethin' about engines...

373
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:51,891
that calms me down, you know?

374
00:41:11,648 --> 00:41:14,640
- I'm outta here.
- Come on, dog.

375
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:17,414
Vince, get over here
and give us a hand.

376
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:19,819
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

377
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,463
- Mia!
- All right already.

378
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,973
- The chicken's dry.
- I'm comin' out already.

379
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:47,648
Hey, hold up.

380
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:50,880
Because you were the first
out of everybody here...

381
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:53,821
to reach in to get the chicken,
you say grace.

382
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:01,330
Dear heavenly, uh...

383
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:02,831
Spirit.

384
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,833
Spirit. Thank you.

385
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:08,997
Uh, thank you for providing us
with a direct port...

386
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:11,006
nitrous, uh, injection...

387
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:16,034
four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

388
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:19,240
and, um, titanium valve springs.

389
00:42:19,315 --> 00:42:21,180
- Thank you.
- Amen.

390
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:23,811
- Not bad.
- Amen.

391
00:42:23,887 --> 00:42:27,152
He was prayin'
to the car gods, man.

392
00:42:28,158 --> 00:42:30,490
- These are the best.
- What do you want?

393
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:32,852
- Practice.
- Thank you, girl.

394
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:34,556
Look who it is.

395
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:36,394
Old Coyotes 'R' Us.

396
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,593
I thought you weren't hungry,
pumpkin.

397
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:42,034
- You know, I gotta eat.
- He's always hungry.

398
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:43,868
All right, sit down.

399
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,782
How you doin', Mia?

400
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:07,721
- Jesse, hand me that chicken.
- Let's eat some grub.

401
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:11,767
- Want some of that chicken?
- Did you rent a movie or somethin'?

402
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:19,940
Need a hand?

403
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:23,910
No, I'm good. You can go join
the boys watchin' the movie.

404
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,413
Well, the cook doesn't clean
where I come from.

405
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:27,948
I'd like to go there.

406
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:34,655
I think we should
go out sometime.

407
00:43:34,723 --> 00:43:36,918
No, I don't date
my brother's friends.

408
00:43:38,026 --> 00:43:39,584
That sucks.

409
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:42,653
- I guess I'll have to kick his ass then.
- I'd love to see that one.

410
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:46,497
No, I would... I would pay
to see that one, actually.

411
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:01,915
Wash my car when you get done.

412
00:44:01,983 --> 00:44:04,247
- What was that?
- No, Mia.

413
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,810
I'm talkin' to the punk.

414
00:44:06,888 --> 00:44:09,322
And wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

415
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:12,189
I'm puttin' you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

416
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,355
Is this thing broken?

417
00:44:17,432 --> 00:44:19,457
What's wrong with this thing?

418
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:24,696
V, what was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

419
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:26,866
The one with
the peccadillo and the...

420
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:30,173
- Red candles and the wooden table?
- Yeah, the plantain too.

421
00:44:30,245 --> 00:44:32,770
- What was it called?
- Cha Cha Cha.

422
00:44:32,848 --> 00:44:34,475
Yeah, that's it.

423
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:37,876
Well, you can take me there.

424
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:41,116
Friday night at 10:00.
Is that good for you?

425
00:44:41,189 --> 00:44:44,522
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Good.

426
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:53,667
- There's no popcorn?
- Make your own goddamn popcorn!

427
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:10,210
All right.
Now that's valet parking.

428
00:45:14,222 --> 00:45:16,053
- Harry.
- What's up, dog?

429
00:45:16,124 --> 00:45:18,354
Excellent, brother.
Come on in, man.

430
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:20,986
- Check it. It's yours.
- What do we got here?

431
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,490
- Hired some new help, huh?
- Don't even think about it.

432
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,626
- What's up, Hector?
- How you feelin'?

433
00:45:27,702 --> 00:45:30,102
Pretty good.
What do you need?

434
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:34,107
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

435
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:38,175
Why don't you look that over.

436
00:45:38,246 --> 00:45:40,771
- When do you need this stuff by?
- Tomorrow. Today.

437
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,282
- Now.
- Right.

438
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,716
White boys work fast,
don't they? Beto.

439
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:49,218
That's right.

440
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:53,355
You said you need
three of all this?

441
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:56,788
Yeah, three of everything.
What do you think about that?

442
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:59,197
Check this out.

443
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,226
He moans like a cop.

444
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:19,127
Brian, this is
one of those times...

445
00:48:19,205 --> 00:48:21,730
when you need to be very clear
about what you say.

446
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:24,207
Nod if you understand me.

447
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,903
Nod!

448
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,774
Sit up.

449
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:37,452
Tell me what the hell
you're doin' down here.

450
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:40,651
Oh, shit.
What I'm doin'.

451
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:49,064
I owe... I owe you
a ten-second car.

452
00:48:50,603 --> 00:48:54,061
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

453
00:48:57,376 --> 00:49:01,676
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be runnin'...

454
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:04,307
three Honda Civics
with Spoon engines.

455
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:07,147
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

456
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:10,848
and he ordered
three T-66 turbos...

457
00:49:10,923 --> 00:49:15,155
with NOS,
and a MoTeC system exhaust.

458
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:19,997
So, what are you saying?

459
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,464
You're gonna go around
and check everybody's shit out...

460
00:49:24,537 --> 00:49:26,505
one garage after another?

461
00:49:28,874 --> 00:49:29,806
Yeah.

462
00:49:32,745 --> 00:49:35,737
Because Dom, you know...

463
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:37,749
I can't lose again.

464
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,244
He's a cop.

465
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,182
He's a cop!

466
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,858
You a cop?

467
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:57,326
Let's go for a little ride.

468
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,672
Walk!

469
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:22,727
All right, kid, stand watch.

470
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:58,729
There's no engines.

471
00:50:59,798 --> 00:51:02,392
What are they plannin' on racin' with?
Hopes and dreams?

472
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:04,834
I don't know, but I know
they're sneaky as shit...

473
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:07,236
and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

474
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:14,010
What?

475
00:51:22,488 --> 00:51:24,547
Dom, we got a wolf pack.

476
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,582
It's Johnny Tran, and he's
comin' your way really fast!

477
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:30,288
All right, we got company.

478
00:51:30,362 --> 00:51:32,193
Spilner!

479
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,716
Come on. Move!

480
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:01,657
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

481
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:06,323
Do you see anything wrong here?

482
00:52:10,936 --> 00:52:13,302
- We got no engines, do we?
- No!

483
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:15,135
- Do we?
- No!

484
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:21,808
Nissan SR-Twenty motors will pull a
premium one week before Race Wars, huh?

485
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,643
Yeah, probably.

486
00:52:23,716 --> 00:52:27,152
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

487
00:52:28,387 --> 00:52:30,321
What are you feelin', Lance?

488
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:33,783
Forty weight?

489
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,793
Fifty weight?

490
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,795
A forty weight sounds nice.

491
00:52:53,412 --> 00:52:56,506
Where are they, Ted?
Where are they?

492
00:52:56,582 --> 00:52:58,106
- Enough!
- Where are they?

493
00:52:58,183 --> 00:53:00,208
They're in a warehouse.

494
00:53:00,285 --> 00:53:02,150
They're in a warehouse, man!

495
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:20,903
Kiss my shoes?

496
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:36,519
Let's go get our engines.

497
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,352
My superiors are flying in
from D.C. Day after tomorrow.

498
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:42,121
I want somethin' to show.
Now, we have a top-echelon fence...

499
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:44,628
with a lube hose in his mouth,
automatic weapons...

500
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:47,324
a jacket full of priors
on every one of these Asian punks...

501
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:50,698
a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

502
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:54,170
Why not move on Tran now, see where
we are when the dust settles?

503
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,265
Because all we have is behavior.
Let me get some hard evidence...

504
00:53:57,342 --> 00:53:59,242
because what we have now
is circumstantial...

505
00:53:59,311 --> 00:54:02,678
What we have is probable cause
and truckers arming themselves...

506
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:05,080
for some
good old vigilante mayhem.

507
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:16,080
