<i>(man) I was eating a tomato</i>

2

<i>(man) Papa spoke languages,</i>

6
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:21,193
<i>He was an adventurer.</i>

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:26,181
<i>But Mummy was</i>
<i>such a gifted person socially.</i>

8
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:29,058
<i>She was a master</i>
<i>of the understatement,</i>

9
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:31,168
<i>an adventuress.</i>

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,839
<i>And he was cold and dark,</i>

11
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:41,911
<i>and she was warm and light.</i>

12
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:47,935
<i>And I was "little Tony."</i>

13
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,659
<i>- (phone ringing)</i>
- Bye. Your mummy loves you.

14
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:53,881
<i>I was the steam</i>
<i>when hot meets cold.</i>

15

<i>(phone continues ringing)</i>

<i>(woman) Midge? Well, hello.</i>

17
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:02,054
The reason that I called, darling,
is that Aschwin,

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,780
Prince Aschwin Lippe -

19
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:05,967
his brother is Prince Bernhard -

20
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,804
well, Aschwin thought it would be lovely
to meet at the Stork Club tonight.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,640
He so wants to know you and Joost,
and asked if I could...

22
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,213
Well, of course.

23
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,321
Shall we say... 10:30?

24
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:21,544
Is that too Continental?

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,498
<i>(laughs)</i>

26
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:30,560
Be as catty as you want, but Tony
can hear every word you're saying.

27
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:33,668
Can you imagine
the world he's growing up into?

28
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:37,926
Brooks and I will see you tonight.

29
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:42,645
Brooks...

30
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:44,641
darling.

31
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,702
I gather that
you're making commitments for me.

32
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:55,652
Sans permission,
sans consultation.

33
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:02,903
Prince Aschwin de Lippe, please.

34
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,742
You may say
Barbara Baekeland is calling.

35
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,773
Don't get difficult,
not tonight, darling.

36
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,842
Please forgive the intrusion
and the damnably short notice,

37
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,682
but we are having supper
with Midge and Joost van den Heuvel,

38
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:18,480
and they would so like
the pleasure of your company.

39
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,472
They'll be delighted.

40
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,276
As will I.

41
00:02:23,314 --> 00:02:26,000
As will Brooks.

42
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:29,952
Thank you, darling.

43
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:36,627
<i>People say now that I must have hated</i>
<i>them because of what... transpired...</i>

44
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,275
We won't be back too late,
I promise.

45
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:44,032
<i>... but everything that happened</i>
<i>happened because of love.</i>

46
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,449
Do I...

47
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:50,516
Do I look like a monkey to you?

48
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:55,542
Then why on earth should I get dressed up
in a fucking monkey suit just to eat?

49
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,726
You don't have to wear your tux.
And no need to be vulgar.

50
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,604
- In front of the b-o-y?
- Just wear your uniform.

51
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,249
- I will not.
- You look so handsome in your uniform.

52
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,858
The war is over.
Had you not heard?

53
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:10,198
You have a right.
You won the war.

54
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:15,147
I mean, you volunteered,
so you have a right to wear your uniform.

55
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:18,409
Your father looked so handsome,
so dashing.

56
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,365
So dashing.

57
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:26,044
Is the little paragon coming with,
or do you plan on leaving him here alone?

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,808
Nini will be here at nine.

59
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:31,530
In that case,
I'm glad that I shall be dining out.

60
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:38,436
<i>(Tony gurgles)</i>

61
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:42,388
Tone. Tony, Tony...

62
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,342
Mother, do you think
we should call him "Antony"?

63
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,023
"Antony" will be his full name,
his formal name, his name to the world.

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,895
And "Tony" will be his name as a child...
and among intimates.

65
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,351
When I refer to him,

66
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:00,727
when I am asked
if I have a photograph, do I say...

67
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,029
You say, "This is Tony."

68
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:06,559
And they will say,
"What an angel!"

69
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,247
Oh, yes.

70
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:09,973
An angel.

71
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,930
What an angel.

72
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:15,268
- What an angel you are.
<i>- (Tony gurgles)</i>

73
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:18,683
- We may be out late.
- "Shall."

74
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,054
Oh, yes... your mummy loves you.
<i>(kissing and cooing)</i>

75
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,308
Barbara.

76
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:34,528
Good night, Tony.
You are in good hands.

77
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,600
Enjoy the Stork Club.

78
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,631
And you may stay out
as late as you wish.

79
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,585
Fuck!

Mr. and Mrs. Baekeland.
Right this way, ma'am.

82
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,749
She's gorgeous.

83

<i>(whispering)</i>

84
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,987
Hello.

85
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,174
Wonderful to see you.

86
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,361
How do you do?

87
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,694
- I'm Barbara.
- Simone.

88
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:34,188
How do you do?

89
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:40,288
Why, it was with Dieter that Brooks
went on his great adventure, in Peru,

90
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:42,245
in the Villa...

91
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:47,041
<i>(sighs)</i> Darling, you know
I'm not at my best with geography.

92
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:49,611
Brooks, help me. Villa?

93
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:54,100
Darling, don't press. Maybe your husband
doesn't feel like in midst of dinner.

94
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,863
Brooks, please,
if you don't feel like performing...

95
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,858
- Vilcabamba.
- Ah.

96
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,618
Dieter and I,
we went to the Vilcabamba in Peru.

97
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:06,876
So tell us, man,
what was your "little adventure"?

98
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,987
It was nothing.

99
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,363
Well, I lie.
It was something.

100
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:18,003
I was intrigued by a 400-year-old mystery -
what became of Manco Inca.

101
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,151
I wanted to find the ruins
of the lost city.

102
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:24,909
This is actually true.
Give him a dirt road and he'll go up it.

103
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:27,403
<i>(man)</i> That's very good.

104
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,246
- Would you, Simone?
- Oh, I don't know.

105
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,778
Your husband asked you a question.

106
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:49,195
This seems... unfair.

107
00:06:49,272 --> 00:06:51,919
This seems...
<i>(cherry plops into drink)...</i> tedious.

108
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,835
- Hmm... but would you?
<i>- (husband)</i> Yes, would you?

109
00:06:55,679 --> 00:07:00,551
Would I eat a pound of human flesh
for $10 million?

110
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,968
No, I would not.

111
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,112
I <i>have</i> eaten horse flesh, you know.

112
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:11,064
There is a difference between eating
the <i>cheval</i> and eating the <i>chevalier.</i>

113
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:15,284
Brooks, for $10 million,
would you sleep with Simone?

114
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,466
- For $10 million, would you...
- Don't, Barbara.

115
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:21,922
Please, don't be tedious.

116
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:29,096
Would you go home with the first person
you met going through a nightclub door?

117
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,437
Yes, I would.

118
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,158
So... shall we get on with our drinks?

119
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,573
Brooks, Barbara,
have you ever been to the Engadin?

120
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:41,373
Oh, I was practically born in Gstaad!

121
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,366
She practically loves
the ski instructors.

122
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:46,361
<i>(Barbara laughs)</i>

123

<i>(man)</i> Thank you for coming this evening.

124
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:00,825
<i>(Barbara)</i> Bye.

125
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,741
<i>(Brooks)</i> Barbara.

126
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,389
You said you'd go home
with the first person you met

127
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,115
- at a nightclub.
- No...

128
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:12,297
So I thought I might go home
with the first person...

129
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:13,448
Hello!

130
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:17,323
Hello, I'm awfully thirsty.
Would you buy me a drink?

131
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,625
Aschwin, Simone.

132
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:21,428
- Barbara!
- Brooks.

- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Quite all right.

139
00:08:57,032 --> 00:09:00,831
- I must have...
- You fell asleep. Quite natural.

140
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,898
It's late.
It got late, you fell asleep.

141
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:09,310
- I trust your evening was...
- Oh, we had a fine time.

142
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,921
I can hold down the fort.

143
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:13,991
- Where's Barbara?
- She's returning separately.

144
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,446
- May I get your coat?
- I'll just go.

145
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,170
- And was the prince there?
- Excuse me?

146
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,971
The prince.
The prince of Amsterdam.

147
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,352
- Ah.
- Was he there?

148
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,227
I think you're thinking of Prince Bernhard,
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.

149
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:30,910
He was Count Lippe-Biesterfeld, of course,
before he married Juliana.

150
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,289
The man with whom we dined,
Aschwin Lippe,

151
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:36,243
is just Aschwin Lippe,
younger brother -

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,238
a prince in title, but not in any way...

153
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:41,998
- Oh, because Barbara said...
- "Barbara said"!

154
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,204
Decent man, nonetheless.

155
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,892
I see.

156
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:57,000

Hey, kid.

Oh, what a life.

00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:52,171
Thirsty? Hm? Thirsty boy?

165
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,703
Tony a thirsty boy?

You are an angel.

173
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,447
- Where's Papa?
- He went to visit Durán.

174
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,670
What shall we do today?

175
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,665
Ah. Well...

176
00:11:56,742 --> 00:12:01,998
tonight we're going to l'Hippo
with Marcel and his wife Teeny.

177
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:04,952
- You remember them.
<i>- Ceux-là ne me plaisent pas.</i>

<i>En anglais, s'il vous plaît.</i>

179
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:09,978
- Doesn't sound like much fun for a kid.
- You don't have to come.

180
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,973
- But when you leave me alone...
- Tony.

181
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,237
...I feel no bigger than a lima bean.

182
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:17,997
Oh... you won't be alone.
You'll be with Clothilde.

183
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,184
Maybe since I'll be with
boring Clothilde,

184
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:23,637
we can balance it out with something
more fun during the day?

185
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:26,169
Ah... I see where this is going.

186
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,006
- I need time to paint.
- I'd like to go on the Ferris wheel.

187
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,730
- Really?
- And for lunch, I'd like some ice cream.

188
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:33,727
Ah!

189
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,643
But you had ice cream for breakfast.

190
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:42,206
<i>- (laughs)</i>
- Please don't tell Papa.

191
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:45,506
I won't.
It will be our secret.

192
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,808
As will the aspirins
you're going to fetch...

193
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:50,685
From the bathroom,
next to the sink.

194
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,519
Your mother
has a shocking hangover.

195
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,546
Mummy...

196
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:03,999
I shall cure you.

197
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,314
- Ha!
- Oh!

198
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,860
Ha!

199
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,198
OK! OK, OK.

200
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,270
I concede, I resign.

201
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,342
Well, sir, I'm pretty expert.

202
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:40,140
So there's no embarrassment
in losing, if that's a concern.

203
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,933
- Do you love me?
- Of course.

204
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,923
Will you still love me when my hair is gray
and my tits are sagging?

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,034
Well, of course.

206
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:57,175
- Do you remember the dog?
- What dog?

207
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:01,011
- Which dog?
- The one we had in Italy.

208
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,006
Giotto.

209
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,037
I remember when Giotto died.

210
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:08,032
- He was old.
- No, he wasn't.

211
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,296
In dog years.

212
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:13,058
- We still have his collar.
- I know.

213
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:16,089
- Somewhere.
- I know where.

214
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:20,463
Leo was famous.
Not like you're famous, of course.

215
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,420
Well, I'm not...

216
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,684
For heaven's sake.
You won the Premio Nadal.

217
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:28,367
You know Picasso, you know Camus,
you know Malraux, you know Dali.

218
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:31,091
Pilar knows them.
I just write.

219
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,889
What I'm saying, Carlos,
is that Leo's fame, like yours,

220
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:38,380
was a function of achievement,
came from what he did.

221
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:40,375
So Leo's stroke of genius

222
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:45,171
was the notion that the formaldehyde
might stabilize the phenol, give it strength.

223
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:49,046
But they never mixed. Leo thought,
"Let's try putting it under pressure."

224
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:53,228
Poof! Long chain molecules,
Bakelite, plastic.

225
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,873
The telephone, bracelets,
radios, records,

226
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,556
coffins, submarines,
the housing for the atom bomb -

227
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:03,319
the world as we know it today.

228
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:07,155
- That was your father?
- No, that was my grandfather.

229
00:15:07,194 --> 00:15:11,184
My father is a <i>crapule.</i>
My grandfather decidedly was not.

230
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,327
- What does Papa do?
- How do you mean?

231
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:18,972
- Well, François at the...
- At the <i>école?</i>

232
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:25,264
- François asked me...
- You can tell him, "My father writes.

233
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,605
"My father explores.

234
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:31,787
"My father has
a very refined knowledge of mathematics."

235
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,899
Oh.

236
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:37,388
And you can tell him that your mother
was almost a movie star.

237
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:39,307
<i>(men grunting)</i>

238
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:43,028
Do you find my wife attractive?

239
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,637
Most men do.

240
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,786
But what she doesn't...

241
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:50,203
what Barbara doesn't realize...

242
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,272
is that women find me...

243
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:58,145
you know...

244
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,140
attractive.

245
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,782
Some people's fathers,
some people's mothers,

246
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:09,578
they have to go to an office or a factory
or a store, I guess, every day.

247
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,573
But we are fortunate...

248
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,752
because what we do
is what we love.

249
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:19,400
What does François' father do?

250
00:16:20,436 --> 00:16:23,045
- He works.
- Ah, well, we worked.

251
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:27,418
I mean, Father worked, Nini worked.
There was no other way.

252
00:16:27,495 --> 00:16:32,137
I kind of had to raise myself,
and then I worked, too - at Filene's.

253
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:35,053
Then when I could, I left.

254
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,355
I just left.

255
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:42,305
Nini wanted what was best for me -
only what was best for me.

256
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:44,185
"Find the mon," she'd say.

257
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:49,479
She meant "man," I guess,
and she meant "money."

258
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:54,122
The rich, they don't have
pet names for money.

259
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:56,884
Did you know Leonardo da Vinci
wrote backwards?

260
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,071
So you could only read it in a mirror.

261
00:17:04,135 --> 00:17:05,593
<i>(speaking Spanish)</i>

262
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:22,436
<i>- Entrez.</i>
- Hi.

263
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,393
Carlos!

264
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:28,536
Pilar!
My, you're looking swell!

265
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,611
<i>Gracias.</i>

266
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:33,754
Mrs. Baekeland, permit me
to introduce Monsieur Souvestre.

267
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:37,284
Jean-Pierre,
I am so happy to meet you.

268
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,241
Please, come in.

269
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:44,842
I have been dying to ask you
about Marcel Proust,

270
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,298
your biography of whom
I have yet to read

271
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:51,134
as my French reading skills
are not what they will be.

272
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,590
It is not necessary
to apologize for that.

273
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,815
Brooks reads the language
like a native.

274
00:17:55,892 --> 00:17:59,038
And our Tony is mastering it every day
at the <i>école bilingue.</i>

275
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,990
But for poor <i>moi,</i> I must confess,
it's been a struggle, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

276
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:04,716
Understood.

277
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:08,131
What was I saying?
Oh... yes.

278
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:11,814
Jean-Pierre,
was Proust truly a homosexual?

279
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:14,039
<i>Qu'est-ce que tu penses?</i>

280
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:20,485
So you met Carlos here in Paris?

281
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:25,511
I was at the Sorbonne, the adoring
graduate student writing about his work.

282
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:31,304
But then... we woke up one morning
and none of that seemed to matter.

283
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,299
I think I knew he was serious

284
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:37,635
when he introduced me
to Marcel and Teeny Duchamp.

285
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:40,704
Oh! I ran into them today,
at I'Équipe.

286
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:43,620
They said they might
stop over... later.

287
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,231
<i>Je peux lui telephoner?</i>

288
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:48,493
You may be assured
they were only being polite.

289
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,281
I don't want to be impolite, but
M. Souvestre has the early day tomorrow.

290
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:58,161
He's off to Vittel.

291
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:02,688
It is regrettable,
but what Mrs. Durán says is the truth.

292
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:06,985
<i>Un petit café</i> for the road?
And you've yet to meet Tony.

293
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,402
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

294
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,014
<i>(in French)</i>

295
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:21,910
<i>Monsieur Souvestre, permettez-moi</i>
<i>de vous présenter mon fils, Tony.</i>

296
00:19:21,987 --> 00:19:24,289
Did I get it right?
Did I get the order right?

297
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:27,703
The younger is presented to the older,
the less distinguished to the more so.

298
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,504
Exception: a gentleman
is always presented to a lady.

299
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:36,451
Exception to the exception: unless the man
is a president, a cardinal or a sovereign.

300
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,676
So, then, it's right.

301
00:19:38,753 --> 00:19:41,208
Well, everyone, this is Tony.

302
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,050
Say hello.

303
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,160
<i>Buenas noches,</i>
<i>señor y señora Durán.</i>

304
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,810
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

305
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:50,224
<i>Bonsoir, M. Souvestre.</i>
<i>Enchanté de faire votre connaissance.</i>

306
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:53,370
<i>- (Jean-Pierre) Bonsoir.</i>
- Told you his French is better than mine.

307
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:56,018
Perhaps you'd like to read something.

308
00:19:57,054 --> 00:19:59,893
Perhaps Tony would prefer
to get his sleep.

309
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,617
Especially as M. Souvestre
has an early start.

It was gracious of you to volunteer.

You are welcome, señora.

314
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,581
Your mother's a bit tired, as are we.

344
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:41,734
François.

I know where he's from.

348
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,390
When you left, and then when Mummy left,
I didn't want to be alone,

349
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:59,383
so I called François,
and he came over.

350
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,915
We listened to the radio.
It was Boulez -

351
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:05,330
one of those poems by René Char,
which Boulez set to music.

352
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:07,440
I rather like Boulez,
don't you, Mummy?

353
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:10,049
I know that some consider him
atonal and all that,

354
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:14,461
but I think they just don't know
how to listen, or what to listen for.

355
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:16,993
Your friend leaves.

356
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:20,906
Now.

357
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,585

00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:26,935
Tony?

362
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:29,161
Do you have a cigarette for me?

363
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:33,074
Black.

364
00:26:33,151 --> 00:26:35,261
I like black tobacco.

365
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,678
But sometimes I yearn for the brown.

- You know how they are.
- What?

367
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:14,318
- Fussing, always making a fuss.
- Not all women.

368
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:16,428

I don't need to tell you.

374
00:27:33,156 --> 00:27:35,573

377
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,500
Well, thanks.

378
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:52,224
I mean, your mother was an actress.

379
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:56,406
In some ways, <i>is</i> an actress.
Will mostly likely be...

380

Mummy can be histrionic,
but she's not...

381
00:27:59,092 --> 00:28:01,970
Don't defend her.
You needn't defend her.

382
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:04,233
You love her, as do I,
but for the moment,

383
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:07,226
we're sitting here,
Brooks and Antony, two men.

384
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,782
Had she been on time,
we'd never have had this discussion.

385
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,361
Do you think she gets stoned?

386
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:32,701
Well, she's Spanish.

387
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,579

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,262

00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:22,429
Paging, please, Mr. Baekeland -
to Aviaco.

467
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,731
Your party is waiting.

468
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:31,215
Boarding time's at 1:30, no?

469
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:34,323
Let me see.

470
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:40,423
Yeah, it's 1:30.

471
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:46,831
Come, darling.

472
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:49,593
Coward!

473
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:53,046
<i>¡Cobarde!</i>

474
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,386
<i>¡Cobarde!</i>

475
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:58,609
That's right, that's you
I'm talking about you, little <i>puta.</i>

476
00:37:58,686 --> 00:38:00,451
You little whore!

477
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:05,170
<i>- Aún no estamos embarcando.</i>
<i>- Señor, por favor.</i>

478
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,472
You are truly disgusting,
do you know that?

479
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,505
You and your little Spanish cunt.

480
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:13,380
<i>- (whispers)</i> You're speaking too loudly.
- I am speaking of a cunt, half your age.

481
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,063
She looked at Tony, looked at you,
thought for about five seconds,

482
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:20,286
and said to herself,
"Ha! That's where the money is."

483
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:21,783
<i>¿Entiendes?</i>

484
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:24,967
You go on about your grandfather
and the life of the fucking mind.

485
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,883
I go away for one week,
and what do you do? <i>(sniffing)</i>

486
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:31,374
Something very intellectual.
Very intellectual indeed.

487
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:35,441
Oh, does he fuck you up the ass?
<i>¿Por el culo?</i>

488
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:38,050
That's what he likes, you know.

489
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:40,083
He thinks it's very manly.

490
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,265
I think... quite the opposite.

491
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:47,450
She bats her eyes at you and says:

492
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:49,560
"Oh, Brooks, you...

493
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,435
"you big man, you."

494
00:38:53,512 --> 00:38:57,962
And you honor the great
Baekeland tradition by fucking her.

495
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,183
<i>(softly)</i> OK... fuck her.

496
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:05,943
Fuck her. I understand.

497
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:08,014
But leave me?

498
00:39:08,436 --> 00:39:11,391
Break my heart?
Break Tony's?

499
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:14,422
He never broke Tony's heart.

500
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:17,951
And neither did I.

501
00:39:18,028 --> 00:39:21,941
Much of what you've just said
is an amalgam of paranoia and spite.

502
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:26,507
Sell yourself to yourself any way you like,
but in your heart, you know.

503
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:29,078
So does everyone else.

504
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:31,073
Also...

505
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:34,986
you're a little old for this,
don't you think?

506
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,687
<i>¿No lleva equipaje?</i>

507

00:40:10,437 --> 00:40:12,355

<i>(propeller airplane overhead)</i>

514
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:10,634
You are a very nice man.

515
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:16,811
<i>Un... hombre... encantador.</i>

516
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,368
<i>Jake was like a devil...</i>
<i>or a magician.</i>

517
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,783
Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.

518
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:22,380
<i>He wore little bones and things</i>
<i>on his vest - these certain little bones.</i>

519
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:29,286
<i>(Barbara)</i> Tony! Jake!

520
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:33,161
- You might have knocked.
- I did.

521
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,233
<i>(kicks phonograph</i> / <i>music stops)</i>

522
00:42:36,882 --> 00:42:39,606
I went to the airport today,
to pick up Sam.

523
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:42,676
Who should I see but your father?

524
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:45,668
We had a word or two,
I can tell you that.

525
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:49,006
You <i>can</i> tell me,
you <i>are</i> telling me.

526
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:51,769
- Don't get harsh with me.
- I'm sorry.

527
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:55,528
Are you defending him?
Are you taking his side?

528
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,524
You must have had a long drive.

529
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,555
Sit down and let me pour you
something to drink, OK?

530
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:21,925
So I told Sam
you'd be joining us for dinner.

531
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,956
I'll see you around nine.

532
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:30,634
How can you live in this shithole?

533
00:43:51,736 --> 00:43:55,380
<i>Sam was often called a walker-</i>

534
00:43:55,457 --> 00:43:59,064
<i>one of those homosexuals who escort</i>
<i>wealthy women to dinner or to the opera</i>

535
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,366
<i>when their husbands are not able.</i>

536
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:05,164
<i>But Sam's devotion to Barbara</i>
<i>was never about the money.</i>

537
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,850
<i>In fact, he liked us more</i>
<i>when there was less of it.</i>

538
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:10,804
Do you remember how it was
with Maxime de la Falaise?

539
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:13,336
There was a difficult period.

540
00:44:13,413 --> 00:44:17,058
I helped her, as much as I could -
a few of us, we did what we could -

541
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:19,551
and now, well...

542
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:23,426
no one remembers
the sad period now, do they?

543
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,529
These are the facts we have to face.

544
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:33,632
One - we are dealing with
an insecure and capricious crowd

545
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:38,236
who, given any doubt or hesitation,
will always follow the money.

546
00:44:39,195 --> 00:44:41,497
In this case, meaning Brooks.

547
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,902
Second, and this is in your favor...

548
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:52,470
you were,
to any sensible observer,

549
00:44:52,547 --> 00:44:56,038
the charm and vivacity of the couple.

550
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:59,031
So, we must make that work
to your benefit.

551
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:02,906
- I'm so glad you're here.
- It's my pleasure.

552
00:45:02,982 --> 00:45:05,668
Pop across to Cadaqués
for a day or two.

553
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,888
<i>You need to be proud, not embarrassed,</i>
<i>to be seen in public.</i>

554
00:45:09,965 --> 00:45:13,610
<i>And that will give people permission</i>
<i>to be seen with you.</i>

555
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:15,068
<i>Hola. Un café...</i>

556
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:19,557
Let us think
who are those, you know,

557
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,741
from whom others take their cue?

558
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:26,079
Someone like Pilar Durán
would be terrific.

559
00:45:26,118 --> 00:45:30,491
<i>And then, of course,</i>
<i>we need a doyenne to seal it.</i>

560
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:33,446
<i>You do, of course,</i>
<i>know Teeny Duchamp?</i>

561
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,402
<i>Teeny Matisse Duchamp?</i>

562
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:39,853
And I shall, naturally,
make sure that the word gets out.

563
00:45:40,582 --> 00:45:43,881
<i>As will others.</i>
<i>(chuckles) As will others!</i>

564
00:45:47,603 --> 00:45:49,598
You've got to start painting again.

565
00:45:49,636 --> 00:45:53,588
- The difference between...
- An artist and a divorcée.

566
00:45:53,665 --> 00:45:55,775
So you understand.

567
00:45:56,772 --> 00:45:58,537
That's for starters.

568
00:45:58,614 --> 00:46:01,530
Some of it will, I've no doubt,
be emotionally unpleasant.

569
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:03,870
Oh, please.
Where <i>is</i> he?

570
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:06,479
Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, Barbara.

571
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:09,472
He's just... being Tony.

572
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:17,836
Mummy,
what I don't understand is Brooks.

573
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:21,404
Of all the places
Brooks would want to go for the season,

574
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:24,780
why choose a place right near us,
and then not want to see us?

575
00:46:24,857 --> 00:46:27,888
Why would Blanca want to go to Mallorca
when she hates me so much?

576
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:29,960
She doesn't hate you.

577
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,871
- And Brooks?
- He doesn't hate you either.

578
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:39,935
- Then why won't he...
- I've given up trying to understand him...

579
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:43,426
explain him, justify his ways.

580
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:46,918
Men do...
This is something you know very well.

581
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:49,181
Men do what... what men do.

582
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,059
Mummy?

583
00:46:53,402 --> 00:46:56,279
I think he's writing us a letter.

584
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:59,502
I think he is writing us a letter,

585
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:03,070
but in another alphabet,
in Baekeland writing...

586
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:04,797
no one else can read.

587
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:08,173
- 'Cause the thing with Brooks is, he...
- Oh, please.

588
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:10,129
Mummy, don't be angry.

589
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,007
I'm not angry.

590
00:47:15,386 --> 00:47:17,304
I love you.

591
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:20,143
Mummy, I love you.

Well, she'll be all right.

597
00:47:51,565 --> 00:47:54,136
Well, she'll always be Barbara.

<i>(chuckles)</i> Yeah.

And... what of you?

600
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:02,692
What of life in the world
of Tony Baekeland?

601
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:04,687
<i>Ça va.</i>

602
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:08,523
<i>"Ça va"?</i>

<i>"Pas mal"?</i>

No, no, no, no!

00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:14,585
That isn't good enough by half.

606
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:17,156
Tony takes care of Jake.

607
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:19,535
Tony takes care of Barbara.

608
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:21,798
Someone must take care of Tony.

609
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:38,839
What I would like to do, ideally,
is to place you with a gallery.

610
00:49:38,915 --> 00:49:42,023
Or, failing that,
with a private dealer -

611
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,016
and that is something
I know I can do.

612
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:55,451
You shouldn't have done that.

613
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,518
Sam...

614
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:03,278
you should not have done that.

615
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:10,069
He's your child,
and he will always be your child,

616
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:13,982
but he is a grown man
with his own life and his own choices.

617
00:50:14,059 --> 00:50:16,016
You don't know
what you're talking about.

618
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:19,929
- Tony is who Tony is.
<i>- (plate shatters)</i>

<i>Dear Papa,</i>

622
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,341
<i>I don't know any other way to say this</i>
<i>but straight out.</i>

623
00:51:12,146 --> 00:51:14,563
<i>Would you please</i>
<i>come back to Mummy?</i>

624
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,172
<i>She's so unhappy.</i>

625
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,318
<i>She needs you...</i>

626
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,503
<i>but is too full of pride to ask.</i>

627
00:51:26,227 --> 00:51:30,025
<i>Do you remember our dog</i>
<i>whom you named Giotto?</i>

628
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:34,015
<i>The dog is gone,</i>
<i>but the collar remains.</i>

629
00:51:34,974 --> 00:51:38,542
<i>For all the times we've moved,</i>
<i>I've taken it from place to place.</i>

630
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:41,573
<i>It's never gotten lost,</i>
<i>not even once.</i>

631

<i>I do not know why you fear me.</i>

632

<i>I do not fear you.</i>

633
00:51:53,851 --> 00:51:58,148
<i>Sometimes I have a bloody mind</i>
<i>and I don't know what to do about it,</i>

634
00:51:58,225 --> 00:52:01,984
<i>but I fight it with everything I've got.</i>

635
00:52:03,135 --> 00:52:05,859
<i>With my best love, Antony.</i>

636

<i>(whispers)</i>
Everything is going to be all right.

640
00:54:49,378 --> 00:54:52,869
<i>My mummy told me,</i>
<i>ever since I was seven:</i>

641
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:55,171
<i>"Hold your head up high."</i>

642
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:06,988
<i>A very strange thing</i>
<i>is when your charm ceases...</i>

643
00:55:08,945 --> 00:55:12,820
<i>and, for one reason or another,</i>
<i>you become gloomy.</i>

644
00:55:17,616 --> 00:55:23,256
<i>And people cease to understand you</i>
<i>when you need understanding the most.</i>

645
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:36,416
<i>I now realize that,</i>
<i>for many years,</i>

646
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:38,794
<i>I have been living a totally false life.</i>

<i>(bottle clinks</i> / <i>rolls on the floor)</i>

<i>Anyway...</i>

649
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:53,796
<i>for Mummy's sake, I've decided</i>
<i>to make a new person of myself.</i>

650
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:18,937
We'll be bored rigid without you.

651
00:58:20,241 --> 00:58:24,461
- It's harder to get people to come...
- Than it was in Cadaqués? I know.

652
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,457
I know.

653
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,679
It's time.

654
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:35,703
It's time.

<i>(engine starts)</i>

656
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,329
I'm glad he's gone.

657
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,489
<i>I'm not sure, Papa,</i>
<i>you would want to know this,</i>

658
00:59:15,566 --> 00:59:19,364
<i>but she used sleeping suppositories,</i>
<i>six or seven of them,</i>

659
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:22,242
<i>so that she wouldn't</i>
<i>change her mind - couldn't.</i>

660
00:59:23,201 --> 00:59:27,459
<i>I remember she told me that her father,</i>
<i>my grandfather, had killed himself,</i>

661
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:32,370
<i>so I fear that...</i>
<i>all this ran very deep within her.</i>

662
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:36,092
<i>It was a miracle,</i>
<i>that I came home that night</i>

663
00:59:36,169 --> 00:59:40,542
<i>instead of staying out till morning,</i>
<i>as is my custom.</i>

664
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:44,763
<i>And a miracle that when I did come home</i>
<i>she was still alive.</i>

665
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,866
<i>Taking care of Mummy</i>
<i>had been your job.</i>

666
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:54,777
<i>But when you left, Brooks,</i>

667
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:58,268
<i>taking care of Mummy</i>
<i>became my inheritance.</i>

668
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,220
Barbara?

669
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:57,544
Hi.

670
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,654
We just missed each other.

671
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:02,225
<i>À l'hôpital?</i>

672
01:01:02,302 --> 01:01:04,450
They told me
that you had been there.

673
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:08,057
This... must be very hard for you.

674
01:01:12,584 --> 01:01:15,078
Your music? Your writing?

675
01:01:15,155 --> 01:01:16,574
That!

676
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:19,682
Carlos thinks very highly of you -
always has.

677
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:23,058
- And I'm sure he'll...
- Have you seen Brooks?

678
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:26,204
Carlos saw him.

679
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:34,031
I don't think that Brooks
is liking me very much these days.

680
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:39,402
- He said I was a <i>crapule.</i>
- Oh, please!

681
01:01:39,479 --> 01:01:43,699
To Brooks, <i>everyone</i> is a little shit.
Everyone in the whole wide world.

682
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:47,805
Including me, including you.
Including even Carlos, for God's sake!

683
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:49,800
But not Leo.

684
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,982
Not the sainted grandfather.

685
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:01,693
<i>- (Barbara)</i> What was it he said?
<i>- (Tony)</i> Who?

686
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:04,609
Hemingway, I think.
Or the other one...

687
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:07,525
- Fitzgerald?
- Yes. It was one of them.

688
01:02:07,602 --> 01:02:11,438
- Who said?
- What it is I'm trying to remember!

689
01:02:12,398 --> 01:02:13,856
God!

690
01:02:13,932 --> 01:02:16,349
I'm turning into Nini.

691
01:02:16,388 --> 01:02:19,342
<i>Monsieur, encore.</i>
<i>Merci bien.</i>

692
01:02:20,263 --> 01:02:22,526
I know.
It was about Paris, I think.

693
01:02:22,565 --> 01:02:26,210
"If you're tired of Paris,
you're tired of everything."

694
01:02:27,092 --> 01:02:29,164
I remember.

695
01:02:29,241 --> 01:02:32,003
"To say that one is tired of Paris

696
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,919
"is in fact to say
that one is tired of life."

697
01:02:36,684 --> 01:02:38,449
Something like that.

698
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:43,359
<i>Mummy hoped that with a new place</i>
<i>would come better things for us,</i>

699
01:02:43,436 --> 01:02:46,275
<i>and she was right -
<i>but not completely so.</i>

700
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:50,726
<i>But still,</i>
<i>Paris was a step up in the world.</i>

701
01:02:50,803 --> 01:02:54,716
<i>It was in Paris that I started</i>
<i>writing backwards in my notebook</i>

702
01:02:54,793 --> 01:02:57,517
<i>so that no one could</i>
<i>read my thoughts.</i>

703
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:01,929
<i>But Mummy seemed to be able</i>
<i>to read them anyway,</i>

704
01:03:01,967 --> 01:03:05,804
<i>as if she were inside my head,</i>
<i>looking out.</i>

705
01:03:11,751 --> 01:03:14,283
<i>My great-grandfather Leo once said:</i>

706
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,010
<i>"One of the uses of money is</i>

707
01:03:16,048 --> 01:03:20,422
<i>"that it allows us not to live with</i>
<i>the consequences of our mistakes. "

708
01:03:21,342 --> 01:03:25,064
<i>But I fear that, in this,</i>
<i>Leo was wrong.</i>

709
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:29,515
<i>(Barbara)</i> Tony?

710
01:03:29,553 --> 01:03:32,354
Do you know
what I would really love?

711
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,883
What would you really love?

712
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,878
What do you think?

713
01:03:39,912 --> 01:03:42,329
- This is so good.
- I'm glad.

714
01:03:43,288 --> 01:03:45,820
It's exactly what I wanted.

715
01:03:45,897 --> 01:03:48,775
Well, then I'm all the more glad
I was able to obtain it.

716
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:52,343
Is there a better ice cream
in the whole world?

717
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:56,832
- Is it Thursday?
- Yes, it is.

718
01:04:00,131 --> 01:04:02,165
I have dinner with Ethel tonight.

719
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:04,889
- Ethel de Croisset.
- I'll make other plans.

720
01:04:04,965 --> 01:04:07,498
- She won't mind if you tag along.
- I don't want to impose.

721
01:04:07,574 --> 01:04:11,603
I don't like what happens
when you "make other plans."

722
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,288
Mummy... please.

723
01:04:15,401 --> 01:04:18,701
The afternoon
of the longest laundry?

724
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:21,616
- I don't do that anymore.
- Mmm... Hm!

725
01:04:23,688 --> 01:04:25,837
What does the G stand for?

726
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,942
- What, dear?
- The G.

727
01:04:31,323 --> 01:04:34,009
"George" - like his father.

728
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:40,071
Do my wrists, would you?

729
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:46,286
<i>(magazine drops on the floor)</i>

730
01:05:41,381 --> 01:05:43,299
That was lovely.

731
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:46,177
And now...

732
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,013
I need some privacy.

733
01:05:53,811 --> 01:05:56,305
Scoot, so that I can get dressed.

734
01:06:04,554 --> 01:06:06,664
Teeny. I'm so sorry.

735
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:12,419
<i>Mummy always said that I should be</i>
<i>furious with you for stealing my girl.</i>

736
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,529

01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:17,253
<i>"Mummy, he didn't hurt me.</i>

738

<i>"He hurt you."</i>

739
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,781
<i>Still, Papa,</i>
<i>you should have come back.</i>

740
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:26,116
<i>I thought that one day</i>
<i>you'd wake up and know that, too.</i>

741
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,648
<i>But you never did.</i>

742
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:33,636
<i>And something else</i>
<i>I want you to know:</i>

743
01:06:33,674 --> 01:06:36,667
<i>Giotto's collar has disappeared,</i>

744
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:40,695
<i>and I will not be able to sleep</i>
<i>until we find it.</i>

745
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:40,164
<i>(Barbara)</i> Not the formal opening dinner -

746
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:44,538
that's me and 17 of the dealer's
closest friends getting pissed at Regine's.

<i>(woman snickers)</i>

This is different, more <i>intime.</i>

749
01:07:48,067 --> 01:07:52,556
I was thinking that after the vernissage
I would gather together a small group -

750
01:07:52,595 --> 01:07:56,354
you and Mishka, of course,
and Ethel de Croisset and the Duráns

751
01:07:56,431 --> 01:08:00,268
and Bill and Rose Styron,
if they are still in town.

752
01:08:00,345 --> 01:08:03,107
Not buyers -
not... not a business thing.

753
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:05,102
- Thank you.
- People you love,

754
01:08:05,179 --> 01:08:07,212
and who I know would love each other.

755
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:10,512
I can't begin to tell you
how much Tony adores London.

756
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:14,080
I believe it's brought about
a sea change in him.

757
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:17,149
Do you remember, in Paris,
how down he could get,

758
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,490
how... pulled within himself?

759
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:21,485
And then, in the morning,
how agitated?

760
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:23,787
Well... that's still Tony,
of course.

761
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:27,585
But in London he eats,
he walks, he even shops.

762
01:08:27,662 --> 01:08:30,884
This morning we stayed in bed until 11
reading the newspapers.

763
01:08:30,961 --> 01:08:33,493
For him, that's unheard of.
For me, paradise.

764
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,675
- Oh, thank you.
- It's a pleasure.

765
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:42,088
What do you think, Mishka,
of a small dinner following the vernissage?

766
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:44,581
What's not to like?
It sounds like a great idea.

767
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:46,960
Well, I was thinking
I might have it here.

768
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,413
I thought it might add
a note of class to my own little works,

769
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:52,562
which they in no way,
on their own merits...

770
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,245
Of course you can have
your little dinner over here.

771
01:08:57,895 --> 01:09:00,465
I don't know how to thank you.

772
01:09:01,923 --> 01:09:04,532
Tony will be thrilled.

773
01:09:05,338 --> 01:09:07,103
<i>(sighs)</i>

01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:11,476
<i>(door shuts)</i>

775
01:09:11,553 --> 01:09:14,469
Well? Where is it?

776
01:09:17,884 --> 01:09:19,955
Where is it?

777
01:09:19,994 --> 01:09:21,912
Where did you put it?

778
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:25,365
It is not my responsibility
to keep track of your objects.

779
01:09:25,442 --> 01:09:27,360
But it's not anywhere.

780
01:09:27,437 --> 01:09:30,967
Missy Harnden
is the soul of graciousness.

781
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:34,458
When I mentioned that there would be
a vernissage after the opening,

782
01:09:34,535 --> 01:09:39,446
she offered to host a little dinner...
<i>chez</i> Harnden.

783
01:09:39,484 --> 01:09:41,479
I'm so happy for you, Mummy.

784
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:44,625
I like the way you've been dressing lately.
Is that from Gieves?

785
01:09:44,702 --> 01:09:48,385
No. Actually, it's from Anderson,
from Anderson & Sheppard.

786
01:09:48,462 --> 01:09:51,531
- Did you just walk in?
- No. You might just walk into Gieves,

787
01:09:51,608 --> 01:09:55,445
but you're not going to walk into Anderson -
you get walked into Anderson.

788
01:09:55,521 --> 01:09:58,207
In my case,
by Timothy Chalmers.

789
01:09:58,245 --> 01:10:02,312
Have you been seeing a lot
of young Timothy Chalmers?

790
01:10:04,346 --> 01:10:07,415
I don't think he's the kind of person
you want to learn from,

791
01:10:07,492 --> 01:10:09,870
if what you want to learn
is how to be a man.

792
01:10:12,172 --> 01:10:16,201
- What do you mean?
- I don't think Timothy likes women much.

793
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,887
Oh, he's English, is all.

794
01:10:19,692 --> 01:10:22,685
He's the kind of person
that does things for people -

795
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:26,291
in the way that Missy Harnden
does for you.

796
01:10:26,368 --> 01:10:28,670
I hope you haven't incurred
any obligation.

797
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:32,430
Mother, we're talking about
an introduction to a tailor, a clothier.

798
01:10:32,507 --> 01:10:36,689
Well, I very much like
this material... this fabric.

799
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:42,635
- What would you call it?
- It's a worsted, I should think.

800
01:10:42,712 --> 01:10:44,899
It's much nicer than
your other worsted.

801
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:47,508
Well, that's Anderson.

802
01:10:51,537 --> 01:10:53,455
This is interesting.

803
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:58,558
Barbara... please.

804
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:03,277
You don't seem to mind it.
Part of you doesn't seem to mind it.

805
01:11:03,353 --> 01:11:07,574
I suppose I don't... mind.

806
01:11:07,651 --> 01:11:10,758
- You might even enjoy it.
- I might.

807
01:11:10,835 --> 01:11:13,444
Ah, I'm finding some buttons here.

808
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:18,470
- How many?
- Five.

809
01:11:18,547 --> 01:11:20,849
- They do them with five.
- That's five.

810
01:11:22,498 --> 01:11:24,417
That's four.

811
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:27,409
That's three.

Are you sure
you didn't put it anywhere?

832
01:15:18,338 --> 01:15:22,136
Why do you care so much
about this thing?

833
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:25,589
For the same reason that
anyone cares about anything -

834
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:29,311
for its value,
its sentimental value.

835

We are talking about a dog collar...

836
01:15:31,536 --> 01:15:34,567
We are talking about a collar
that belonged to Giotto,

837
01:15:34,644 --> 01:15:37,943
- a dog I loved, and a dog that died!
- Inside voice, please.

838
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,591
Now the dog is gone,
but we still have the collar,

839
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:43,622
and we have moved
and moved and moved,

840
01:15:43,698 --> 01:15:45,425
and we have never lost it!

841
01:15:45,502 --> 01:15:47,420
Oh, Tony, please.

842
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,595
Go look for it.

Go!

You are not a fucking baby!

848
01:17:05,112 --> 01:17:07,223
You hid it.

849
01:17:08,681 --> 01:17:14,244
You hid it in the cupboard. At the very back
of the cupboard, with Nini's silver.

850
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,889
- I did no such thing.
- Then how did it get there?

851
01:17:17,965 --> 01:17:20,728
Well, maybe you put it there
for safekeeping,

852
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:23,068
and then you forgot.

853

Everything's gonna be all right.

<i>- (dishes clatter)</i>

855

After we fought this morning
you wrote something on a piece of paper.

856
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,830
And I was so angry...

857
01:18:12,906 --> 01:18:17,549
that when you went out for lunch
I just had to tear it up.

858
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:21,846
We didn't fight this morning. We stayed in
and read the papers, remember?

859
01:18:24,647 --> 01:18:27,946
You wrote it
in that backwards writing.

860
01:18:28,368 --> 01:18:30,363
But I'm not stupid.

861
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:34,353
I know that you think
I'm not smart, but I'm...

862
01:18:35,005 --> 01:18:38,612
smart enough to know that
