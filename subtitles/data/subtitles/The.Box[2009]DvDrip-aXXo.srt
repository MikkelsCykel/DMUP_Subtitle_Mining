Quarter to 6.

If we find water beneath the surface...

Yes.

158
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,223
And you found the button unit
inside the box?

159
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,827
Is that what you call it?

160
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,394
A button unit?

161
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,297
Yes, we do.

162
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,101
Please don't let my appearance
frighten you.

163
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,239
I assure you I'm not a monster.

164
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,534
I'm just a man with a job to do.

165
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:57,705
May I come in?

166
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,205
Sure.

167
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,723
Can I offer you anything?

168
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:13,828
STEWARD: Oh, no, thank you.
I never have much of an appetite.

169
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:16,355
Shall we sit down?

170
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,630
So...

171
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,507
are you trying to sell me something?

172
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,875
Yes, in a way.
I do have an offer to make.

173
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,680
What are you offering?

174
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:39,254
A financial opportunity.

175
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:41,355
Let me explain.

176
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,289
In this envelope, there is a key.

177
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,623
I'll show you.

178
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:53,196
This key opens the glass dome
to the button unit.

179
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,702
Voilà.

180
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:05,878
Now, if you push the button,
2 things will happen.

181
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:12,053
First, someone, somewhere in the world,
whom you don't know...

182
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,449
will die.

183
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,448
Second...

184
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,627
you will receive a payment...

185
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:24,064
of 1 million dollars.

186
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,892
Tax-free.

187
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,909
The payment will be delivered to you
by me...

188
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,674
.in cash.

189
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:42,112
Just as you see here.

Oh, and Mrs. Lewis, please permit me...

191
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:56,320
to present to you this crisp
10O-dollar bill as a gift...

192
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:59,990
in exchange for your kindness
in allowing me into your home.

193
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,707
NORMA: You're gonna give me
this 10O-dollar bill...

194
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,806
even if I say no?

195
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:13,180
That is correct.

196
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:17,975
Are you for real?

197
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:21,182
Oh, I assure you, Mrs. Lewis...

198
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:24,985
this offer is quite real.

199
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:28,862
Well, who do you work for?

200
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:33,832
Guarantee of payment
comes with 3 restrictions, I'm afraid.

201
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:37,229
1, I am not permitted...

202
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:41,866
to disclose any information
about the identity of my employers.

203
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:47,744
2, you are not permitted to discuss
the details of this with anyone...

204
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,714
except your husband, of course.

205
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:54,822
3, you have 24 hours.

206
00:17:56,925 --> 00:18:00,725
You have until 5:00 tomorrow
to make your decision.

207
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:02,557
At which point...

208
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:07,168
I shall return and
retrieve the button unit.

209
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,304
It will be reprogrammed...

210
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:14,670
and the offer will be made
to someone else.

211
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:19,709
It's been a pleasure meeting you,
Mrs. Lewis.

212
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:35,063
-It's a new prosthesis for her foot.
-You got it.

213
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,755
But I'm using
the new GE Silastic polymer...

214
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,629
they're developing for the pilot chairs
for the shuttle.

215
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:42,268
WENDELL: Nice, pal.
-Thank you.

216
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:45,270
Hey. What happened to her foot?

217
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:52,842
When she was 17,
her brother dropped a barbell on her foot.

218
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:56,416
She thinks one of her toes is broken,
so she goes to the hospital.

219
00:18:56,585 --> 00:18:59,383
The doctor sets her in a chair,
turns the x-ray machine on...

220
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,080
then goes to check on another
patient down the hall.

221
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,755
And he forgets all about Norma.

222
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,054
Leaves the x-ray machine running.

223
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,228
Oh, Jesus, that's....

224
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,026
-That's not good.
-No.

225
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:16,062
The tissue in 4 of her toes was
completely destroyed by the radiation.

226
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,301
They had to amputate 4 of her toes?

227
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,368
Yep. Then they had to go in
and get skin from her inner thigh...

228
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,205
to cover the front of her foot.

229
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:29,009
This is back in 1958, so they didn't
have the skin-graft techniques they do now.

230
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:33,280
And she had to sit like this,
the same position...

231
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:37,585
full body cast, for a month,
waiting for it to heal.

232
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,818
Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot.

233
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,461
Oh, yeah. Her family sued and they won.

234
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,998
-What was the settlement?
-10,000 dollars.

235
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:50,265
If this sucker works,
she can start jogging again.

236
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,168
WENDELL:
I hope so.

237
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:58,002
That's a nice thing you're doing
for Norma.

238
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:59,775
Thank you, sir.
