1
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,665
<i>One female in her late thirties
and three minors.</i>

2
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,473
<i>Multiple stab wounds
and blunt-force trauma.</i>

3
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,310
<i>What about the ex-husband? Court said
the wife had a restraining order against him.</i>

4
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,750
Dylan Bennet. He spent the night
with a bottle of Jack Daniel's.

5
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,686
<i>- It was his first Christmas without
his family. - All the more reason.</i>

6
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,655
<i>Well, you didn't see him
when he ID-ed his family.</i>

7
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,419
<i>Looked like he'd
been hit by a freight train.</i>

8
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,657
<i>Seeing his kids like that. All the blood.
Yeah, it was definitely a nightmare for him.</i>

9
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,427
<i>If this guy did it, he gets my vote
for a goddamn Academy Award.</i>

10
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,197
Let's say the stepfather,
this Grady Edwards did it.

11
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,101
- What do we got on him?
- Nothing.

12
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,400
Said he was from Kansas.

13
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,475
<i>Except we can't find a match
in any database.</i>

14
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,874
<i>And he stopped the newspaper
to have time to disappear.</i>

15
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,139
And we think
he might have done this before.

16
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,216
<i>Three years ago in New Jersey,
a wife and three kids.</i>

17
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,878
<i>Gunshot wounds to the back of the head.
The stepfather disappeared.</i>

18
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,289
<i>Lived in a rented room
where he met the victims.</i>

19
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,551
<i>Both rooms were owned by older women.</i>

20
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,559
<i>One of the women
who lives in New Jersey said,</i>

21
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:05,028
<i>"He's a wonderful man,
always paid his rent on time and in cash. "</i>

22
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,429
<i>So, of course,
she never asked him for any identification.</i>

23
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,559
<i>No, he's smart. The Toyota Land Cruiser
that we found abandoned?</i>

24
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,969
<i>Paid for in cash. No driver's
license required for registration.</i>

25
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,735
<i>No credit cards, no anything. Which means...</i>

26
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,609
<i>- No photo ID required.
- Always a divorced or widowed situation.</i>

27
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,375
I'm telling you, this guy's a monster.

28
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,979
Even if this is your guy,

29
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,114
<i>it's been six months.
He could be anywhere by now.</i>

30
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,192
Mom, Beth says I can't get these.

31
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,998
- Sean, we're not getting these.
- Hey! You two stop arguing.

32
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,972
Why does she always get to pick
the kind of cookies we get? It's not fair!

33
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,977
Life is not fair. Life is about the woman
getting to pick the cookies.

34
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,347
Sorry, they get
a little out of control sometimes.

35
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,314
They're just kids.

36
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,854
But the sooner you figure out the cookie
deal, the easier your life's gonna be.

37
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,353
I'm just saying.

38
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,857
It's a woman's world
and we're just guests here.

39
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,359
Wise man. I'd say your wife is very lucky.

40
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,454
I'm not married anymore.

41
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:17,059
I still wear it, but I lost my wife
and daughter in an accident last year.

42
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,071
- Drunk driver.
- God, I'm so sorry.

43
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,231
It's okay.

44
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,170
- I could use a little help, though.
- Sure.

45
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,575
Where is the peanut butter?

46
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,978
I just moved to Portland
and I don't know this store yet.

47
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,845
- It's actually two aisles over.
- This way? Thank you.

48
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,319
You're so welcome.

49
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,615
Remember what I told you.

50
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:46,956
What?

51
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,419
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were following me.

52
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,150
No. Hey.

53
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:25,296
I'm not usually this forward,
but I'm recently divorced and...

54
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,935
I'm taking my kids for pizza,
so I thought maybe you might want to go.

55
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,032
- Pizza?
- The truth is,

56
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,704
I'm just dying for some adult conversation.

57
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,714
Well, I'm not usually this easy.

58
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,311
David Harris.

59
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,146
Susan. Susan Harding.

60
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,390
- It's very nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

61
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,465
I still can't believe she didn't come
to the airport.

62
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,200
I told you, she had some things to do.

63
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,144
- A little help here.
- Yeah.

64
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,681
At least you have me.

65
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,317
So, have you met this guy?

66
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,518
Yeah, a couple of times. You know,
when I came by to say hi to your mom.

67
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,822
- He seems cool.
- Okay, but she's only known him since,

68
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,694
- what, like, after Christmas?
That's so fast. - Well...

69
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,628
Come on, give it a chance. You know?
Before you do something stupid.

70
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,933
- Like what?
- I don't know. Like,

71
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,304
irritating your mom
and getting sent back to military school.

72
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,778
I'm just saying, it seems like
she's rushing into things. Don't you think?

73
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,110
I think it's her business what she does
with her personal life.

74
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,978
And she tends to screw that up, mostly.

75
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,781
Come on, Michael, chill on this one, please?
No fights with your mom.

76
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,015
- Okay.
- Okay. I got something to show you.

77
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,089
Surprise!

78
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,360
Well, this is a surprise.
This is a surprise. Thank you.

79
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,965
- I'm so happy to have you home.
- Hey, Michael. What's up?

80
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,939
- Hey. Sean. Holy crap, you're huge.
- Thanks.

81
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,533
- I missed you. Come here.
- Beth. I missed you, too.

82
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,408
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Aunt Jackie.

83
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,845
- Leah, hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

84
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,918
Let me look at you.
Your hair's gotten longer.

85
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,954
- Yeah. They ease up on you after a year.
- You look so...

86
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,547
So much like a man. I was expecting a boy.

87
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:32,219
That's what the military does. Builds men.
Good, strong men.

88
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,526
Michael, this is David. David, Michael.

89
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,262
- Is that a regulation cut?
- No.

90
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,706
It wasn't real military.
It was just a school for screwups.

91
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,176
Well, good to finally meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

92
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,659
Everything seems to be going great.

93
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,457
- Sean and Beth love him.
- What's not to love?

94
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,999
- Yeah, he's almost too good to be true.
- Don't start, Jackie.

95
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,625
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I like him.

96
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,564
Do you think I'm crazy to be engaged
to someone I've only known for six months?

97
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,234
You've always been crazy.
That has nothing to do with him.

98
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,841
He seems a little crazy, too, about you.

99
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,346
- Everyone have enough to eat?
- Yeah...

100
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,283
I would like to propose a toast.

101
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,690
First of all, I want to thank
Susan and Sean and Beth,

102
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:36,353
who, in a very short time, have taken me in
and made me feel at home.

103
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,831
This is... It's a dream come true for me.

104
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,263
Thank you.

105
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:47,566
And to Michael.
Your return makes us complete.

106
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,542
Family is the most important thing.
Without it, we have nothing.

107
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,176
- Welcome home, Michael.
- Hear, hear.

108
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,414
Hear, hear, Michael.

109
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,984
I think I'm a little nauseous after that.

110
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,380
Stop it.

111
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,823
- You want something to drink?
- No, no, no, I got this.

112
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,589
We have a surprise for you, too.

113
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,753
- Really?
- Jackie pulled a few strings

114
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,230
and she can get you a job
working with her as a real estate agent.

115
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,393
- I couldn't.
- Wait a minute. Of course you can.

116
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,233
Okay? Just follow me around
and I'll get you all set up.

117
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,240
It's a great opportunity for us
and she really went out of her way.

118
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:28,143
Well, I can't say no to my bride-to-be
or her sister, can I?

119
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,181
- Thank you, Jackie.
- Don't thank me. Thank her.

120
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,580
Because she's the one who convinced me
to get you off the road

121
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,950
- so she can keep an eye on you.
- Did you?

122
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,224
Thank you.
I'm gonna go have a word with your son.

123
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,863
God, I hope Michael takes to him.

124
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,925
He will.
He's just been blindsided by the divorce.

125
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,503
He'll bounce back.

126
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,467
Michael. Give me four minutes.
Meet me in the basement.

127
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,377
So, what'd he say?

128
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,711
He said he wants me
to meet him in the basement.

129
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,683
- In the basement?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,545
Why?

131
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,680
I don't know.
Well, I guess I'm about to find out.

132
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,724
Those two are mine.
But you're welcome to use the others.

133
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,758
What's all this for?

134
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,067
Well, I'm a bit of a wannabe carpenter.

135
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,198
I built these storage cabinets myself.

136
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,076
And I'm working up in the attic right now
on some termite damage.

137
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,143
I think we need a real toast.

138
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,841
Just the guys.

139
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,245
This is where I keep the good stuff.

140
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,115
There we go.

141
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,020
Now, don't let your mom know
I've got a tequila stash.

142
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,326
I've worked my ass off
trying to convince her I'm perfect.

143
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:32,393
I know this must be a bit of a shock,
your mom and me getting married and all,

144
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,539
but I want you to know, I want us

145
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,975
to be a real family.

146
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,510
Because without it, we have nothing?

147
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,312
Okay. Touché.

148
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,911
So I get a little corny sometimes,
but I meant what I said.

149
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,012
You just let me handle your mother,

150
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,092
and I'm gonna make sure you stay right here,
where you belong.

151
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,525
No more military school.

152
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,621
We're gonna put this family back together,
you and me,

153
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,132
- father and son.
- Stepfather.

154
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,464
Stepfather

155
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,035
and son.

156
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,637
That's smooth, isn't it?

157
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,711
So your mother tells me
you're one hell of a swimmer.

158
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,181
Yeah, I do okay.

159
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,244
You know, I used to swim in competition.
In college, at U of O.

160
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,017
Your senior year is gonna be very important.

161
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,457
You could maybe get
a college scholarship swimming.

162
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,822
You should be training this summer.

163
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,556
It's kind of hard to train
in a backyard pool.

164
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,462
Maybe. But I hear your old school
has a summer swim program.

165
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,024
It does, but I can't use that pool anymore.

166
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,637
That's the past.

167
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,834
Here is to the future.

168
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,811
Remember, I have to go see
my grandparents tomorrow.

169
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,645
- Yeah, that's right.
- But I'll be back the day after. I'm sorry.

170
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,585
No, that's all right. I mean, it's the day I get
back, but that's fine. I'll call someone else.

171
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,657
Shut up. I'm sorry.

172
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,989
Listen, I want to get my license.

173
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,390
So, can you take me by the DMV?

174
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,529
- Maybe. I'll think about it.
- Why not?

175
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,369
I kind of like having you
dependent on me, actually.

176
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,596
All right, get in the car.

177
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,866
- Good night.
- Good night.

178
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,475
- Good night, Leah.
- Bye.

179
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,377
Glad you're home, Michael.

180
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:26,777
Thanks, Aunt Jackie. I'm so glad to be home.
Thank you for coming.

181
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,798
Do you think David meant what he said
about getting your mom to let you stay?

182
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,165
He said he was gonna make it happen,
so we'll see.

183
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,563
Sweet. Bye.

184
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,938
A lot for one day, huh?

185
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,912
No, no, it was... It was nice. Thanks.

186
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,511
I'm trying too hard. You can say it.

187
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,452
Look, Michael, I know it's difficult
to come home to another man in the house.

188
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,326
I just need you to try and get along, okay?

189
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,663
Mom, can we just hold the lectures, please?
I've been home for two seconds.

190
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,702
Okay.

191
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,466
He's a really good guy.

192
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,774
And he cares about me and we're
trying to start a new life together.

193
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,005
- And you don't want me to mess that up.
- Well, that's not fair.

194
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,638
No, no, no, I get it. I'll try not to
inconvenience you and your new life.

195
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,842
- Michael.
- I'm sorry. I...

196
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,310
I'm pretty tired, Mom.

197
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,980
Okay. Okay.

198
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,184
Good night.

199
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,325
Maybe he should stay there his senior year.

200
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:55,135
- But his place is here with his family.
- Yeah, but you don't know what he was like.

201
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,836
The kids he was hanging out with, the lying.
His temper was out of control.

202
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,442
Believe me, I want him here
more than anything in the world.

203
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,521
I just hope he's ready.

204
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,222
You're right.

205
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,557
Are you ready?

206
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,362
Well, it depends.

207
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,969
Are you ready for it?

208
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,475
- That smells good.
- Hey.

209
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,274
- How was work?
- Work was great. These are for you.

210
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,114
- Thank you.
- Michael.

211
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,943
- What's this?
- Your locker key to the boys' gym

212
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,544
at your old high school.

213
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,683
The swim team starts training
first week in July.

214
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,586
Wait, how did you swing this?

215
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,165
I had a little chat with Mrs. Rivers,
the athletic director,

216
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,461
a very open-minded woman.

217
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,058
David, that was so sweet.

218
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,229
Yeah, that's incredible.

219
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,829
It's just a probationary period for now.

220
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,071
There's no guarantee they'll let you back
in the fall. But we'll work on that later.

221
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,772
- It means a lot. Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

222
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,150
So, what are we having here?

223
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,279
Okay, I just think it's so cool that he
actually did what he said he was gonna do.

224
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,823
I know. I know.

225
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,984
See, I told you
everything was gonna work out.

226
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,822
<i>Yeah, maybe you're right.</i>

227
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,990
- Hey, we still going to the DMV tomorrow?
- Yeah. I'll be by around 10:00.

228
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,060
<i>- Yeah, that sounds good.
- All right.</i>

229
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,294
<i>- Good night.
- Night.</i>

230
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,373
Hey, Sean, turn that down, please!

231
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,987
Yes!

232
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,849
Sean, turn that down now! I mean it!

233
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,661
Your mother said to turn it down!

234
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,289
Do you think it's a good idea
they're so passionate at their age?

235
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,689
They've known each other
since grade school.

236
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,318
She's a good influence on Michael.

237
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,693
You should stop being so old-fashioned.

238
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,896
I think it's so lucky
that your mom met David.

239
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,563
Why is that?

240
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,541
He is gonna be your ticket
to staying here with me.

241
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,412
Maybe I don't want to stay here with you.

242
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,346
Maybe you want to go back
to an all-boys military school.

243
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,746
Maybe.

244
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:36,387
- But I like looking at you.
- That's why we make a good couple.

245
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,360
Because I like you looking at me.

246
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,735
You okay, Sean?

247
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,415
Yeah, I'm okay.

248
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,379
- You sure, buddy?
- This is great.

249
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,250
I've missed family dinners like this.

250
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,621
You've missed them?
Does that mean you were married before?

251
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,524
David lost his wife and daughter
in an accident.

252
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,961
Yeah, a drunk driver.

253
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,228
I had no idea. I'm sorry, David. I'm sorry.

254
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,307
I guess that's why
family is so important to me, Michael.

255
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,238
Well, family is important.

256
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,868
We haven't always had
such great experiences as a family.

257
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,845
- Hey, it wasn't all Dad's fault.
- No, I didn't say it was.

258
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,041
But, you know, our family wasn't that bad.

259
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,642
I saw on TV this woman who drove off
a bridge with her three kids in the back seat.

260
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,222
That is so not dinner-table conversation,
young lady.

261
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:41,486
- They all drowned.
- That kind of thing really gets to me,

262
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,220
that someone could do that
to her own children.

263
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,488
It makes you wonder, though, what it takes

264
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,654
to make someone do something so sick.

265
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,289
- Okay. Can we change the conversation?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

266
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,833
Dad!

267
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,733
Maybe they disappointed her.

268
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,435
Dad!

269
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,012
- Hey, how are you? Let me take this.
- I'm good. Thanks.

270
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,014
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi, Dad.

271
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,049
- Aren't you gonna say hello to him?
- No.

272
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,418
- Shotgun!
- What?

273
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,683
There's no way you're getting shotgun.

274
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,227
- Hey. Hey, work it out, guys. Work it out.
- Hey.

275
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,625
Back on Sunday. They're going to camp.

276
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,425
- We have a million things to do.
- I know they're going to camp.

277
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,126
I'm only in town a couple days.
I'm taking the kids to a Blazers game.

278
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,897
They can spend the night with me
at the hotel. I'll have them back tomorrow.

279
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,565
- Where's the co-ed girlfriend?
- That's over.

280
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:33,466
Actually, she was working for a Ph. D. She
wasn't that much younger than you were.

281
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,207
She just took a little better
care of herself, that's all.

282
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:41,276
- Is Michael home?
- He doesn't want to see you.

283
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,187
- Those his words or yours?
- His.

284
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,381
"Your check is late" are mine.

285
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,523
Just make sure you don't spend any
of the money on my replacement in there.

286
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,723
It's not necessary to replace you, Jay.
You're not missed.

287
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,897
Good to see you, too, Susan.

288
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,334
You guys ready?

289
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,267
Everything okay?

290
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,501
He's just always such an ass.

291
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,609
So, Michael, Jackie has me covering
an open house in the afternoon,

292
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,344
but let's you and me have lunch tomorrow.
What do you say?

293
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,353
That'd be really nice.

294
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:20,286
- Yeah, that'd be good.
- Great.

295
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,794
Hey, Mrs. Cutter, how are you?

296
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,496
I'm fine, Susan.

297
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:37,064
There was a police sketch...

298
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,217
I can assure you it's not David.

299
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,949
Don't worry. It's so not him.

300
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,025
Okay. If you see it,
come over and let's talk about it.

301
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,855
- Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Cutter.
- All right.

302
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,069
- You all right?
- Yeah.

303
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,401
That was Mrs. Cutter. She's known
in the neighborhood as "The Cat Lady. "

304
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,340
Stopped by with one of her gazillion cats.

305
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,912
- They make my allergies go crazy.
- What'd she want?

306
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:20,242
<i>Wanted to tell me that she had seen
this story on America's Most Wanted</i>

307
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,083
about this killer and that
the police sketch looked just like you.

308
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,623
It was all I could do
not to laugh in her face.

309
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,317
You know Erica Harmon, right?

310
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:32,055
Okay, so a couple years ago,
she tells Erica Harmon's husband

311
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,894
that Erica is having an affair because
she sees this man sneaking into their house

312
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,969
every morning just after he leaves.

313
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,663
- And was she?
- Well, yeah.

314
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,967
- Well, there you go, then.
- Well, it wasn't any of her business

315
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,736
and she told the entire neighborhood
before she told him.

316
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,280
Great. This'll make me a hit
with the neighbors, huh?

317
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,373
I gotta go.

318
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,282
I think I'd rather be the mystery man
sneaking into Mrs. Harmon's house.

319
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,519
- What's she look like?
- Stop it.

320
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,059
Hey, where are you having lunch?
Because I need to drop Michael off.

321
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,791
There's a diner across from the office

322
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,265
and I'll bring him home
on my way to the open house.

323
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,926
Have a great day.

324
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,508
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, sleepyhead.

325
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,213
- Want something to eat?
- Yes, please.

326
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,949
Okay.

327
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,653
- Where's David?
- You just missed him.

328
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,798
Good morning, Mrs. Cutter.

329
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,405
Okay, anybody got a sweet tooth?

330
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,674
- Do you want dessert?
- No, no.

331
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,114
- You sure? Some more tea? Anything?
- No. No, I'm fine.

332
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,913
- All right. Just the check, please.
- No problem.

333
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,784
- Thank you for lunch, by the way.
- Absolutely. So...

334
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,954
What I really wanted to talk to you
about was...

335
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,096
Well, I need a favor.

336
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,098
Well, what kind of favor?

337
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,997
I'd like you to be my best man.

338
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,233
- Me?
- I'd really be honored if you would.

339
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,397
There's no one else I'd rather have.

340
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:26,238
I know sometimes I get a little carried away
with the whole family thing,

341
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:29,745
but, you know, truth is,
I'm really happy you're home.

342
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,078
And like I said,
I'm gonna make sure you stay home

343
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,879
and this family stays complete. Right?

344
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,111
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

345
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,482
So,

346
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,125
- what do you say?
- Well...

347
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,097
I know it would make
your mother very happy.

348
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,763
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

349
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,666
That's great. That is great!

350
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,467
You know, without sounding
too sentimental, I want to tell you,

351
00:27:56,574 --> 00:28:00,203
meeting your mother that day
in the supermarket changed my life.

352
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,437
It was hard, you know,

353
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,947
after what happened
to my wife and daughter.

354
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,714
My little Michelle was my whole world,
my whole life.

355
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,482
Watching her grow up was everything.

356
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,659
You'll understand what I'm talking about
when you have kids of your own.

357
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,991
Not that you and Kelly should be
rushing into anything. Okay?

358
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,826
No, no, no. Don't worry.

359
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,526
You got years to go if you're smart.

360
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,306
When it happens,
I think you'll see what I mean.

361
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,932
They're everything.

362
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,340
Lisa would have turned 11 next week.

363
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,917
- Who's Lisa?
- My daughter.

364
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,914
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

365
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,216
I'm sorry.
I thought you said her name was Michelle.

366
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,452
Did I?

367
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,561
It's Lisa-Michelle.
You must have heard it wrong.

368
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,026
I'm sorry.

369
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,202
Yeah. 11 next week.

370
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,864
Damn it!

371
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,412
Excuse me.

372
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,944
Excuse me!

373
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,847
- Hi!
- Hi!

374
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,082
- Hello, there.
- We're the Baldwins.

375
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,350
We called about the house.

376
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:23,188
Mrs. Baldwin. Mr. Baldwin.
Good to meet you. I'm David Harris.

377
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,819
- Mrs. Baldwin, do you have any children?
- Three girls.

378
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,830
Three girls? You're gonna love this place.

379
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,202
Stay here. Finish your dinner.

380
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,981
Okay. I'm coming.

381
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,550
All right. Yeah.

382
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,419
Come on. Come on, baby. Come on.

383
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,889
Yeah. Let's see who it is.

384
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,670
Midnight? Midnight?

385
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,841
Where is that cat? Where is he? Midnight?

386
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,373
Where is that Midnight?

387
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,313
Come here. What are you doing?

388
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,984
What's the matter?

389
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,616
So, are you?

390
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,043
Am I what?

391
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,219
Gonna be his best man.

392
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,823
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I said yes, so...

393
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,794
What?

394
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:57,370
I'm about to get another father.

395
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,339
You know,
and I can't talk to the one I have now.

396
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,512
Well, maybe you should start.

397
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,139
What's wrong?

398
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,410
- Didn't you close your door?
- Yeah.

399
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,986
Beth? Is that you?

400
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,185
Sean? Sean?

401
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,157
No, there's no one here.

402
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,263
What?

403
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,625
Jesus, David.

404
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,929
Hey, come on. Where you going?

405
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,002
- I better go home.
- You don't have to leave.

406
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,073
No, it's okay.

407
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,303
Were you just watching us?

408
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:09,072
Doing what? I just got home from work.

409
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:13,010
I'm gonna take a shower
and get ready for dinner.

410
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,481
You and Kelly have been together
for a long time.

411
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,888
All I'm saying is,
I just want you to be careful.

412
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,359
She seems like a very nice young woman.

413
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,295
Which is why a young man should be
more discreet with his affections.

414
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,799
- Meaning what? What does that mean?
- People might get the wrong idea about her.

415
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,891
You wouldn't want that, now, would you?

416
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,368
What do you suppose people think
about you

417
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,666
- moving in with my mother?
- Michael.

418
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,401
Excuse me. Apologize.

419
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,841
- No. For what?
- Being disrespectful.

420
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:44,881
It's okay. It's okay. It's healthy to have
open family dialogue, right?

421
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,108
Yeah.

422
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,845
How was your day?

423
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:53,182
It was busy.

424
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,186
Was Mrs. Cutter here today?

425
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,788
No. It's probably from the house
I was showing. They have cats and...

426
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,893
Sean. Beth...

427
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:08,335
Hey. If you ever lay a hand on one of my kids
again, it'll be the last thing you ever do!

428
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,667
What are you talking about?

429
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,174
- This bastard tried to choke Sean.
- I didn't choke anybody.

430
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,267
Sean says you put your hand
around his neck and it hurt.

431
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,245
His mother told him to turn down his video
game and he wasn't listening to her.

432
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,145
I was just trying to show him
a little discipline.

433
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,184
From what I've seen,
that's lacking a bit in this family.

434
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,946
If you ever touch my family again,

435
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,851
- I will kill you! I swear to God!
- Stop it.

436
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,787
- Come on...
- This is not your family anymore, Jay.

437
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,222
- What do you even know about this guy?
- Stop.

438
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,350
- What do you know about him?
- Stop it!

439
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,620
I know he's not sleeping with his secretary!

440
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,854
You don't know a goddamn thing!

441
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,193
- I'll call the police if you don't leave!
- Not a goddamn thing!

442
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,266
You heard what I said.
You touch my kids again,

443
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,358
you got some big trouble coming.

444
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,403
Oh, my God.

445
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,672
I'm so sorry.

446
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,640
It's okay. Come here.

447
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,234
I'm so sorry.

448
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,846
He had no goddamn right grabbing Sean
like that. No goddamn right!

449
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,510
You can't do this anymore! Come on.
Calm down, please.

450
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,420
Dad, here.

451
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,150
You dropped this. It fell out of your pocket
when you were going at it.

452
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:06,955
Thanks.

453
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,598
You stopped me from doing
something really dumb in there.

454
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,569
Yeah, I probably did.

455
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,341
I don't like this guy.

456
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,444
I don't trust him.
I mean, what do you know about this guy?

457
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,138
Not any more than you, really.

458
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:28,882
You got taller.

459
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,714
Yeah, well, you know, it's been a year.

460
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,519
Hey, hey, come on.

461
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,425
- Talk to me for a second, will you?
- What do you want?

462
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,557
I don't know. I want to talk to you.
Your mom says you don't want to see me.

463
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,136
Is that true?

464
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,876
I don't know, Dad.
You know, I'm not the one who left.

465
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,444
I left your mom. I didn't leave you.

466
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,412
You kids are the most important thing
in the world to me.

467
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,245
Well, yeah, yeah, you have a funny way
of showing that.

468
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:04,617
Hey, I know. I screwed up. I feel really bad
about that, but I'd like to make it up to you.

469
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,792
What, you're not gonna see me?
You're not gonna talk to me?

470
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,825
No.

471
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,920
Are you okay, Sean?

472
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,824
Yeah.

473
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,902
I guess I shouldn't have told Dad.

474
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,505
- Well, what...
- No, it wasn't your fault, Sean.

475
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:28,703
I shouldn't have done what I did.
It wasn't right.

476
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:33,040
I'm not your father.

477
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,983
Maybe someday, but...

478
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,046
This is all new to me again.
I'm gonna make mistakes.

479
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,827
And I just hope
you can forgive me when I do.

480
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,261
Can you do that?

481
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,133
I promise,

482
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,301
it'll never happen again, okay?

483
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,601
Friends?

484
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,972
- Friends.
- Yeah. All right.

485
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,202
I shouldn't have done it.

486
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,847
It's just that

487
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:43,084
I see a family without a father and I know
how easy it can all fall apart.

488
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,751
If I'm ever gonna be a part of you,
I need to gain their respect.

489
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,761
And trust.

490
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:56,526
I don't know how you were raised, David,
but my family never used physical force.

491
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,568
It's not okay with me.

492
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,329
Sure.

493
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,540
You're right.

494
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:42,368
I can't keep... I can't... I
can't... I got to make this work...

495
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,050
It's all right. It's all right.

496
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,458
I'll tell her I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...

497
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,372
Thanks.

498
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,167
- David.
- Yes. Something wrong?

499
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,003
No. No, in fact, everything's great.

500
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:53,550
Your enthusiasm with the buyers
at the Reeves' open house made the sale.

501
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,811
Great.

502
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,116
- We need these filled out.
- What are they?

503
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:00,190
Social Security, payroll insurance,
workman's comp.

504
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:04,091
And we need a picture ID. Personnel said
that they gave you the forms to fill out,

505
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,221
- but they just never got them back.
- No, no, I never got anything.

506
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,196
Don't worry about it. We need them, though,

507
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,860
so we don't have to keep paying you
under the table.

508
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,369
- I'll get all this done right away.
- Great.

509
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,039
It just wasn't something
I enjoyed doing, that's all.

510
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,949
Well, I don't understand,
because Jackie said you were a natural.

511
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,611
Real estate is just not me.

512
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,281
Well, what does that mean?
That you want to go back on the road again?

513
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:36,518
- I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.
- No, wait. I...

514
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,522
I thought you enjoyed family.
I mean, dinners like...

515
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,864
I know how much you hate me being gone,
but it's what I know best.

516
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,031
Let me get on your computer
and look around.

517
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,873
Maybe I can find something
that doesn't require much travel.

518
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,682
- Dude, you better turn it down.
- Are you worried about David?

519
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,487
He's not gonna touch you, all right?
I'll make sure.

520
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,455
I'm just useless.

521
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,099
Hey. I'm walking out the door right now.
Okay, see you.

522
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,467
How's it going?

523
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,475
Couple of things down in Eugene.

524
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:31,275
Okay, well, I'm gonna go meet Jackie
and Leah for a drink and plan the wedding.

525
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,714
- Would you like to come?
- I don't think so.

526
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,478
When I'm done with this,
I'm gonna go for a run.

527
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,678
Okay.

528
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,055
David...

529
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,727
I didn't mean to make such a fuss
about your work and all.

530
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,027
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to do.

531
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,195
I

532
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,974
want you to be as happy as I am.

533
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,208
Have fun.

534
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,315
- Susan's not here.
- How about the kids?

535
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,388
Beth's at a friend's. Sean and Michael
are upstairs playing video games.

536
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,148
Look...

537
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,827
I'm sorry about the other night.

538
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,262
I made an ass out of myself.
It's just when Susan and I fight...

539
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,975
I was headed to the airport.
I wanted to say goodbye to the kids and...

540
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,012
Well, I'd like to apologize to you

541
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,604
for being a jerk.

542
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:17,949
Apology accepted.
Come on in and say goodbye.

543
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,791
Hey, Michael tells me you used to swim
for the Ducks?

544
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,023
A long time ago.

545
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,827
- Yeah? What year?
- '92.

546
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:33,164
Really? I went to U of O myself.

547
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:38,363
- I got to grab that. Excuse me.
- Sure. Sure.

548
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:45,809
- Hello.
- Hey.

549
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,043
Jay had left a message on my cell phone

550
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,916
saying he was gonna stop by there
to say goodbye to the kids.

551
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,479
<i>- Did he come yet?
- No. Not yet.</i>

552
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,651
<i>Okay, well, if he does,
will you just stay out of the way?</i>

553
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,590
All right. I'll see you later then.

554
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,667
Hey, you want to hear something funny?

555
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,534
I called the alumni office

556
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,905
and they told me they only had four guys
named David Harris

557
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,240
graduate in the last 30 years.

558
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,076
And two of them are dead
and one graduated in '87.

559
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,850
And the other one was that
All-American running back.

560
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,250
You remember him?

561
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:29,091
Of course, he's a little darker
than you are, wouldn't you say?

562
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,254
So...

563
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,694
It's just...
It seems like you might have lied to Michael

564
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,165
about college and swimming.

565
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,204
And now it's got me wondering

566
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:45,537
just, you know,
what else you might've lied about.

567
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,253
Hey, look, I told Michael
that I would do some checking on you

568
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,883
and, to be honest, I'd like some answers.

569
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,092
Hey. You hear me?

570
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,326
Yep.

571
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,071
- What?
- I heard something.

572
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,655
What was it?

573
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,955
I don't know. It's nothing.

574
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,002
I don't understand.
I'm kind of confused, because...

575
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,365
About?

576
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,598
Well, the feedback
from the buyers was great.

577
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:53,472
He just felt that it wasn't
what he thought it was gonna be.

578
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:54,669
You're okay with him on the road?

579
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:58,179
He's gonna try to find something
where he doesn't have to travel that much.

580
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,048
And I just want him to be happy.
If he's happy, I'm happy.

581
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:06,249
There you go. I just want to get his bags.

582
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,324
- Pop the trunk?
- You got it.

583
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,597
<i>This is Jay Harding. Leave a message.</i>

584
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,567
Hey, Dad. It's me.

585
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,632
Where are you? Call me. Bye.

586
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,159
David!

587
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,196
Yeah, what do you need, Michael?

588
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,471
Nothing.

589
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,646
You know when you asked me
at Michael's party

590
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,883
if I thought you were rushing into things?

591
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,155
I'm thinking now that maybe you are.

592
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,424
I mean, how much
do you really know about David?

593
00:48:54,531 --> 00:49:00,197
The same day that I ask him for details
about his past, he just up and quits.

594
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,364
- You don't find that strange?
- No, I don't.

595
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,670
You know what I want to do?
I want to go to Vegas

596
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,079
- and have one of those 10-minute weddings.
- Nice.

597
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:16,349
David wants to have a church wedding.

598
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,911
That's great. What church? I mean,
do you even know what religion he is?

599
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,322
I don't care what goddamn religion he is.

600
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,689
Okay, you're starting
to sound just like Jay.

601
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,361
He's accused me of not knowing anything
about David. You know what I do know?

602
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,233
David has been good to me.

603
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,035
He's good to the kids. They love him.

604
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,906
He's made my life worth living again.
I mean, I...

605
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,607
For the first time in a long time,

606
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,183
I'm looking forward
to the future with a smile.

607
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:53,280
I just wish everybody would be
happy for me. Is that too much to ask?

608
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,189
No, it's not.

609
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:59,820
Personally, I'm with you. Hey, I'd have
my teeth cleaned in Vegas if I could.

610
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:01,861
Right?

611
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:06,458
- Go! Go! Go! Watch it! Wow!
- I just missed that car.

612
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:07,969
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

613
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,834
- Hey, Mom.
- How'd it go with Jackie and Leah?

614
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,103
We decided we should go to Vegas.

615
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,972
- I'll be right back.
- Where's Michael?

616
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:19,538
He's in his room.

617
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,618
I think he's a little upset
that his father never showed.

618
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,422
That is so typical of Jay.

619
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,582
- Honey?
- Yeah.

620
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,326
I have a confession to make.

621
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:39,566
I accidentally broke the crystal vase
that was in the living room.

622
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,843
That's okay.

623
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:51,107
It was a wedding gift from Jay's sister.
I never liked it anyway.

624
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,875
You didn't?

625
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,611
- Or her.
- Then I don't feel so bad.

626
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,184
You don't think it's a little weird

627
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:07,320
that I ask for some background information,
and suddenly,

628
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,296
he doesn't want to sell real estate anymore?

629
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,333
Not necessarily.

630
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,835
I like David. He's a gentleman.

631
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:16,497
He always picks up the tab.
Jay was so cheap.

632
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:20,667
Do you know what I do think is weird,
though? He always pays in cash.

633
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,870
Who doesn't want the miles?

634
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,478
You know, I never thought
I would ever say this,

635
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,618
but I think I'm gonna give Jay a call.

636
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:42,755
I mean, if he's not buying this either,
then maybe it's worth checking into.

637
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,196
Hey. He didn't show up?

638
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:53,935
No.

639
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,313
I'm so sorry.

640
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,848
- That's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

641
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,510
He's never been there for you
like a father should be.

642
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,745
And part of that's my fault

643
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,448
because I never should have allowed it
to go on as long as it did.

644
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:11,851
That's why David's so important to me.
Because he cares about you kids.

645
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,658
He wants you to be here
and be part of your lives.

646
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:16,755
He's so perfect, isn't he?

647
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,994
Take those off.

648
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,605
I thought you'd be able to see
how happy David makes me.

649
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,371
He is part of this family now.

650
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,936
I want him in my life and our lives
and you need to understand that.

651
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,245
- Do you understand that, Michael?
- Yeah. I understand. Okay?

652
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,917
Okay.
