[Narrator] Legend has it,
in the mystic land of Prydain,

2
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:31,125
there was once a king
so cruel and so evil...

3
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,000
that even the gods
feared him.

4
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,500
Since no prison
could hold him,

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:40,875
he was thrown alive
into a crucible of molten iron.

6
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,083
There, his demonic spirit
was captured...

7
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:48,375
in the form
of a great Black Cauldron.

8
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,333
For uncounted centuries,

9
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:53,833
the Black Cauldron
lay hidden, waiting,

10
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,708
while evil men
searched for it,

11
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,708
knowing whoever possessed it
would have the power...

12
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:03,875
to resurrect an army
of deathless warriors...

13
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,458
and, with them,
rule the world.

14
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:41,958
[Man] There's something wrong.
I can feel it in my bones.

15
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:44,500
- [Bones Cracking]
- The Fairfolk know it too.

16
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,875
- You don’t see any of them around.
- [Meows]

17
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,208
The Horned King,

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,042
that black hearted devil.

19
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:57,875
- [Continues Meowing]
-What's he waiting for?

20
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,583
Yes, yes, cat.
I know you want your breakfast,

21
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,917
but, just now,
thinking is more important.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,917
[Sighs, Gasping]

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,125
Taran,
the pot is boiling over!

24
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:15,583
-[Pot Boiling]
-Oh, Dallben. I was just thinking.

25
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:19,292
What if the war's over,
and I never had a chance to fight?

26
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,208
Hmm, and a good thing too.

27
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,542
War isn’t a game.
People get hurt.

28
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,000
But I'm not afraid.
Ouch!

29
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,042
[Chuckling]
Yes, there you are.

30
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,000
If the Horned King
ever returns,

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,958
you'll have a great deal more
to worry about...

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,542
than a burned finger.

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,458
No, no, no, cat. That is not for you.
It's for Hen Wen.

34
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,375
Hen Wen, Hen Wen.
It's always Hen Wen!

35
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:48,542
And one day, my boy,
you may learn why.

36
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,708
Now, no more dreaming.
You have chores to do.

37
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,917
Yes, sir.

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,292
[Sighs]
He's so anxious...

39
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:02,500
and so blind
to the dangers ahead.

40
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,083
Look, cat. You're in luck.

41
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,375
Just enough left for you.

42
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,292
Hmm.

43
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,625
- [Quacking]
- Dallben doesn't understand.

44
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not a little boy
anymore.

45
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:22,250
[Squawking]

46
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:28,000
I should be doing heroic deeds
for Prydain, not waiting
hand and foot on a spoiled--

47
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,583
Hey!

48
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,125
[Chuckles]
Oh, all right, Hen.

49
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,542
I didn't mean it.

50
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,625
You'd better eat it.

51
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,250
Dallben made it
especially for you.

52
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:50,917
Is this to be my life ?
Pampering a pig ?

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,167
I'm a warrior
not a pig keeper.

54
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,000
Dallben thinks I'd be afraid,
but I wouldn't.

55
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,875
All I need is a chance,

56
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:03,167
and I could be
a famous warrior.

57
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,500
Look at me, Hen!
I can do it! Ha!

58

[Taran Laughing]

60
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,083
Even you're afraid.

61
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:18,583
-[Quacking]
-Do you challenge me ? Run, you cowards.

62

[Squawking]

63
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,500
-There you are.
- [Bleats]

64
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,083
His Majesty,
the Horned King.

65
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,000
So we meet at last.
Ha!

66
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,750
[Laughing] Even the Horned King
shakes with fear.

67
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,708
See, Hen? Everybody runs
from the famous Taran of Caer Dallben!

68
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,625
[Laughing]

[Groans, Coughing]

70
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,833
Prydain's finest warrior...

71
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:51,792
draws his last... breath.

72
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,042
Dallben.

73
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:06,667
Hmm, not quite the blade
for a hero.

74
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,875
[Stammering] I was--
It's just that we were--

75
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,333
Hen Wen got dirty.

76
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,292
[Dallben] Oh, I see.

77
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,458
Another dream, Taran ?

78
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:21,917
But, Dallben, won’t I ever be anything
but an assistant pig keeper?

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She's a special pig, Taran.

80
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:28,625
- [Snorting]
- [Chuckles]

81
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:31,125
Now, give her a nice bath.

82
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,125
Well, Hen,
it looks as though...

83
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,333
I'll still be an assistant pig keeper
when I'm as old as Dallben.

84
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,000
[Laughs] You like that, don’t you ?

85
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,542
[Laughing] Now for the part
you like best.

86
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:59,250
Hey, come on, Hen.
I haven’t finished scrubbing your ba--

87
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,250
- [Squealing]
- Hen, what’s the matter?
Calm down, Hen.

88
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,500
- [Continues Squealing]
-Stop it, please! What's the matter?

89
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:08,042
- Hen Wen--
-Taran, what’s going on ?

90
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,000
I-I don't know.

91
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,958
There's something wrong
with Hen Wen.

92
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,375
What? Quickly, lad.
Bring her inside.

93
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:27,667
-[Taran] What's that for?
- Put Hen Wen down.

94
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,292
I never use her powers
unless I have to,

95
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,208
but now I must.

96
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:38,125
- ''Powers'' ?
-Taran, what you are about to see,

97
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:42,083
you must never reveal to anyone.

98
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,500
Hen Wen, from you,
I do beseech...

99
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:50,167
knowledge that lies
beyond my reach,

100
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,375
troubled thoughts
beyond your heart.

101
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,375
Pray you now
those thoughts impart.

102
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:17,000
[Dallben Sighs] The Horned King.

103
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,417
- [Gasps]
-Shh-shh-shh. Don't interfere.

104
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,250
He is searching.

105
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,708
The Black Cauldron!

106
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:44,833
-So that's it.
- ''The Black Cauldron'' ?

107
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,750
[Dallben] An awesome weapon, Taran.

108
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,958
It's been hidden
for centuries,

109
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,375
but if the Horned King
should find it...

110
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,458
and unleash its power,

111
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,917
nothing could stand
against him.

112
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,833
[Taran] That's Hen Wen.

113
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,750
[Dallben] He knows.

114
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:06,583
Stop! Enough!
You must leave here at once.

115
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,542
Take Hen Wen
to the hidden cottage...

116
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,458
at the edge
of the forbidden forest.

117
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,417
Hide there and never bring her out
until I come for you.

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,000
''Hide'' ? But why?

119
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,792
Only I knew the secret
of Hen Wen's power,

120
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,500
but now the Horned King
has discovered it.

121
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:29,292
We must make sure he never uses
it to find the Black Cauldron.

122
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,625
I'm not afraid
of the Horned King.

123
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,167
Then you are a very foolish lad.

124
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,500
Untried courage is no match
for his evil.

125
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,417
Just remember that.

126
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,333
Now, off you go,
my boy,

127
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,292
and take care
of yourself.

128
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,333
Good-bye, Dallben.

129
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,083
I won't fail you.

130
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,875
So much, so soon...

131
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,958
to rest
on his young shoulders.

[Thunder Rumbling]

Oh, yes.

Yes, my soldiers.

135
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:12,125
Soon the Black Cauldron
will be mine.

136
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:17,750
Its evil power will course
through my veins,

137
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:23,042
and I shall make you...

138
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:26,000
Cauldron born.

139
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,708
Yes. Yes. Oh, yes.

140
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,375
Then you will worship me!

141
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,750
Me.

142
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:43,750
Oh, my soldiers.

143
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,333
How long
I have thirsted...

144
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:50,333
to be a god...

145
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,375
among mortal men.

146
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,667
[Taran] Gosh, Hen Wen.
I never knew...

147
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,542
you could create visions
and things like that.

148
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,667
I thought you were just
an ordinary pig.

149
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,917
I had no idea
you were so... special.

150
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,625
Dallben's going to be glad
that he put his trust in me.

151
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,708
Just you wait and see.

152
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,417
Now, don't go
wandering about.

153
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,292
And don’t you worry.
Keep close to me,

154
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,542
and no one
will do you any harm.

155

Not while I'm around.

get close to you, Hen.

Over there!

00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,958
Stop him!

- [Eilonwy] Taran!
- There they are!

Taran, do something!

00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:58,083
- [Gasping]
- Use the sword!

481
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:09,667
[Fflewddur] Make way! Make way!

482
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,792
Stand aside. I command you!
Get out from under my feet!

[Whimpering]
Let me go, you brute!

[Taran] Run, Princess! Run!

Stay up!
Please, stay up!

487

Why didn’t you tell me
you had a magic sword ?

488
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,625
[Wheezing, Sighs]

489
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:47,792
I'll say it wasn't my fault.
That's it.

490
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:52,042
That's it. I always get blamed
for these things.

491
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:55,292
[Panting]
I'll just tell him,

492
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:59,083
and if he gets mad...
[Groaning]

493
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:01,000
I’ll just
straighten him out.

494
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:05,417
That's it. I'm not going
to be kicked around for this.

You bring news of the pig ?

498

No, not exactly, sire.

499
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,250
[Stammering]
Oh, it's the pig keeper.

00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:39,333
He's-- Ooh, he's--

501

He's... escaped.

Good.
He'll find his pig.

507
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,208
Send the gwythaints
to follow that boy.

Oh, yes, sire!

Oh, yes!

They're almost finished, Fflewddur.

517
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:56,667
Hmm, it's not too good,
but it will hold for awhile.

518
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:59,417
Yes, I shall sing
of your deed.

519
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,250
It would be better to sing
of our heroic escape.

520
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,333
Weren’t you a bit frightened,
Fflewddur?

521
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:08,708
A Fflam frightened ?
[Laughs]

522
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:11,417
-The word is not in my vocabulary.
- [Strings Vibrating]

523
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,625
But in this case,
well-chosen, my dear.

524
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:17,833
- I wasn’t afraid.
-Ouch! Not afraid?

525
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:20,458
Why, we were running
for our lives.

526
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,542
Well, I got us out
of the castle, didn't I ?

527
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:25,625
You ? I'd say it was
the sword's magic.

528
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:28,625
But it takes a great warrior
to handle a sword like this.

529
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,833
But still,
it is a magic sword.

530
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:34,875
Ha! What does a girl
know about swords anyway?

531

''Girl'' ? Girl ?

532
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,750
If it weren't for this girl,

533
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:42,250
you would still be
in the Horned King's dungeon.

Here now,
Princess Eilonwy, Taran.

At least I don't keep
talking about it forever.

I didn’t mean to interfere, you know.

We are going to have
to work together.

And we'll find your pig.

I'm sure it's important.

Thank you for getting me
out of the dungeon.

Oh, but we couldn't have
done it without you.

Well, really.

Who is your pungent,

He's no friend of mine.

568
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:51,958
He's just a coward
and a thief.

Saw piggy's tracks.

Good. Hmm.
Yes. That should work.

[King Eidellig] I thought I told you
to fix the whirlpool.

I fixed it. I did fix it!
It was perfect!

Evidently, not completely perfect.

to keep them out.

around here my fault?

[Taran] Oh, Hen!

Thank goodness you're--
[Laughing]

631
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:50,375
Tell me. Is the burning and killing
still going on up there ?

00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,458
You refer
to that-that-that-that...

the Horned King.

Will no one
ever stand up to him ?

635
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:03,083
We've seen him, and if he finds
the Cauldron, he'll kill us all.

636
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,292
Oh, no, no.
He'll never find it.

637
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:08,833
No, no.
It's safely hid in Morva.

638
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:14,167
- ''Morva'' ?
-Well, at least I think it is.

-[Doli] Really?
Is that one of my new jobs,

641
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:22,625
remembering where
the Cauldron was last seen?

642
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:24,583
[Doli Laughing] Gee!

643
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:28,167
Oh, he'll know right where it is.
You'll see.

644
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,042
If we could get to the Cauldron
first and destroy it--

-Oh, this isn't right, Taran.
- But don’t you see ?

646

it will stop the Horned King.

-Yep.

-Why, you can take them.
-What?

651
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,625
Do you mean we're trusting
our lives to- to- to him?

652
00:45:55,708 --> 00:46:00,125
-And what is wrong with me ?
- [Stammering] Oh, nothing.

Maybe we should
have a look.

If I can just
get this door open.

How will we ever find the Black Cauldron
in a place like this ?

Nothing! That's the point.
Don’t you see ?

We'll end up with both the sword
and the Cauldron. [Chuckles]

It's decided then.

785

what funny little ducklings.

788
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:48,042
Don’t they know the Black
Cauldron is indestructible ?

789
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,250
Now, listen carefully.

790
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:54,417
The Black Cauldron
can never be destroyed.

791
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,917
Only its evil powers
can be stopped.

792

Then there is a way.
But how?

793
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:04,375
A living being must
climb into it...

794

of his own free will.

He will climb
into the evil Cauldron.

However, the poor duckling
will never climb out alive.

Don't forget we had
an agreement.

Yes. You said we could
have the Cauldron.

802
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:27,375
Of course we said
you could have the Cauldron.

do anything with it.

Good-bye!

Doli's right.
It's-It's my fault.

I'm nothing...

Look, you are somebody.

You must believe
in yourself.

I've ignored you.

You did come for the Black Cauldron,
didn’t you?

842
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:46,625
Good. Then climb in!
[Laughs]

and a broken-down minstrel.

Gurgi is sorry he always
runs away when there's trouble.

Oh, no.

944
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:34,583
How-How-How horrible.

945
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,833
Poor sire.

Oh, we can't
get through.

I-I'll try
to open the gate.

-[Orgoch] Why is the duckling so sad?
-[Sobbing]

Yes. He's got
what he wanted,

01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:33,125
and he's still
not satisfied.

Just what do you think
you're up to, ladies ?

Oh, we have business
with your little hero.

Hero ? Gurgi was the hero.

984
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:48,667
The only thing that mattered
to you was the Cauldron,

985
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,625
but now it's
no use to you.

986

-So we'll just take it
and be on our way.
-[Fflewddur Sputtering]

Stay your hand, ladies.
We never give anything away.

[Clears Throat]
We bargain. We trade. Remember?

989
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:12,000
Did-Did these old ears hear
the word ''bargain'' ? Hmm ?

990

Yes, madam,
those old ears heard right.

Ohh!

Oh, pull yourself together, madam.

[Orgoch]
A magnificent sword for a warrior.

997
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,625
I'm not a warrior.

998
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:52,208
I'm a pig boy.

999
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:54,292
What would I do
with a sword ?

Absolutely nothing.

-But I would trade...
- [Together] Yes ?

the Cauldron for Gurgi.

1003
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:08,542
- [Gasps] Dear!
- It's not possible.

1004
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,875
Justas I thought, ladies.

1005
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,875
You've got no real power!

I'm alive! [Laughing]
Gurgi's alive!

Look, look, look!
Touch me! [Laughing]
