<i>You're lucky, you know.</i>

2
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,597
<i>l rarely allow anyone into my flat.</i>

3
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,316
<i>l know, l know, l know.</i>

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,471
<i>Humble digs.</i>

5
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,871
<i>Not exactly what you'd call</i>
<i>a ''panty peeler. ''</i>

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,152
Do you know what I mean?

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,554
But it suits me just fine.

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,349
To be honest, I rareIy spend a night
in my own bed anyway.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,558
You see, here's my theory:

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,712
For most women, if a guy's
a good provider

11
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,158
and generaIIy a nice chap, six-pack
abs reaIIy aren't a deaI-breaker.

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,913
On the fIip side, however,

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,230
even though the PC boyfriend
sat next to you

14
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,948
with his arm sIung around
your shouIder wiII deny it--

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,230
And he wiII deny it. For us boys,
it's aII about F.B.B.

16
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,115
Face. Boobs. Bum.

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,952
I'm just being honest.

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,392
It's been said that cIothes
speak the internationaI Ianguage.

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,791
And I have to admit,
I'm a bit of a fashion whore.

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,437
UnfortunateIy, today I've got work,
and I have to tone it down a IittIe bit,

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,672
but that's aII right. Gucci.
End-of-summer saIe.

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,277
Very understated.
And I can easiIy spice it up with...

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,593
What? No, no. I know
what you are thinking.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,910
If you ooze mascuIinity,
Iike some of us do,

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,277
you have no reason to fear pink.
Smashing.

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,950
Now, in the coIogne department,
most men overdo it.

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,273
Americans practicaIIy spray it on
with a crop-duster.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,717
My ruIe: Nothing above the neck,

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,270
though I do Iike a IittIe spIash
on Big Ben.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,870
You never know
where the day may take you.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,797
AImost forgot.

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,879
New word for the day.

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,675
''Ostentatious: The attempt
to attract attention to oneseIf.''

34
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,275
Who? Me?

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,552
Oh, bIimey. I'm so rude.
I haven't introduced myseIf.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,075
- I'm...
- AIfie?

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,790
There you go. AIfie.

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,670
Are you the IittIe eIf that Ieft these
mocha bonbons on my doorstep?

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,469
No, no, no. You must have
a secret admirer, Mrs Schnitman.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,508
You are such a doII, AIfie.
But I'm supposed to be on a diet.

41
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,715
Oh, on a diet?

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,075
- A diet.
- You?

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,595
- Yeah.
- Now, I don't mean to be forward, Lu,

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,515
but you shouId know by now
that a fuII-figured girI Iike yourseIf

45
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,439
- is every guy's secret fantasy.
- Stop it.

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,029
So she's a tub of Iard.
The ship's aIready saiIed,

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,555
so why not make her
feeI good about herseIf, right?

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,518
- Oh, Lu?
- Yes, angeI?

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,749
I'm working the night spot,

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,394
and my apartment is a horror show,
so I'm sorry if I keep you up

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,154
- with the dust-busting at 2 a.m.
- Oh, don't you worry.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,437
- I'II give it a quick straighten.
- Oh, no, no, you don't need to that.

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,195
Nonsense.
I Iike doing things for you, AIfie.

54
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,393
I'm a bIessed man
having you in my Iife.

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,389
Thank you.

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,996
Keys are in the usuaI spot.

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,393
<i>Now, back home, you're always</i>
<i>hearing tales about some bloke</i>

58
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,632
<i>migrating to the States and winding</i>
<i>up with buckets of money.</i>

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,998
<i>So not long ago, l packed up</i>
<i>my bucket and headed west.</i>

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,993
Now, I must admit,
I had a second motive.

61
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,396
I'd aIways been toId that the most
beautifuI women in the worId...

62
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,112
...resided in Manhattan.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,557
And when it comes to shagging birds,
it's aII about one thing:

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,790
Location, Iocation, Iocation.

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,713
<i>God, l love this city.</i>
AII right, girIs.

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,439
<i>Just look around. l mean,</i>
<i>every one of them, unique, special,</i>

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,477
<i>like snowflakes.</i>

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,519
And with such a pIethora--

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,159
CaIendar word meaning ''abundance,''
of gorgeousness and diversity,

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,279
weII, how couId a man ever choose
to settIe down with just one?

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,797
I myseIf subscribe more
to the European phiIosophy of Iife.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,271
My priorities Ieaning towards
wine, women--

73
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,556
WeII, actuaIIy, that's about it.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,631
Wine and women.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,832
AIthough, women and women
is aIways a fun option.

76
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,273
So...

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,514
...to Iive Iife to the fuIIest,

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,949
I require onIy enough
to cover my modest expenses.

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,356
I've no desire to be the richest stiff
in the cemetery.

80
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,396
I think this might just be my
favourite position.

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,108
I know it was President Kennedy's.

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,270
He was such a great Ieader.

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,795
Of course, JFK used the oId
bad-back excuse,

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,998
but if you ask me, he knew
it gave you maximum pIeasure

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,639
with minimum exertion.

86
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,519
What is it about the back of a Iimo?

87
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,916
ObIigatory cuddIing.

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,237
Thousand one,

89
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,596
thousand two...

90
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,118
Cripes. Hey, I've gotta get cracking.
I've got a 1 0:00 pickup.

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,388
You better hurry up.
You don't want to keep her waiting.

92
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,068
Quite the number, isn't she?

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,516
Yet, she teIIs me her oId man
hasn't shagged her in six months.

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,238
Six months. I mean, thank God
there are gentIemen Iike me around

95
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,436
to pick up the sIack.

96
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,355
Just Iook at her.
Legs Iike a racehorse.

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,434
Perfect yoga bum. I give her
my highest grade:

98
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,598
A-minus.

99
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,476
Where did we teII the oId man
we were going tonight?

100
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,393
- A movie.
- Treasure, pIease, no, no, no.

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,438
Stop messing about.
You'II ruin my presets.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,069
- Sorry.
- What movie?

103
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,754
I don't know. What's the difference?

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,677
The difference is, the more detaiI
you give, the Iess interested he'II be.

105
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,638
It wouIdn't matter what I said.

106
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,832
It wouId never occur to PhiI
that another man

107
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,832
- wouId ever Iook twice at me.
- Dor, darIing,

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,149
you fishing for a compIiment?

109
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,675
No.

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,277
You shouId know by now they onIy
come from me when Ieast expected.

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,756
Now, come and have a mint so PhiI
doesn't smeII the AIfie on your breath.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,514
I don't care if he does.

113
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,153
There's one thing that puts me
off marriage: It's married women.

114
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,596
Dorie doesn't know it yet,

115
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,435
but you won't be seeing
much more of her.

116
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,194
I've got that aII-too-famiIiar feeIing.

117
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,752
Sooner or Iater, she'II be wanting
a IittIe bit more than I'm abIe to give.

118
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,310
WouIdn't it be great if I was
going home with you tonight

119
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,028
instead of PhiI the PiII?

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,158
<i>Yeah.</i>

121
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,030
<i>lt's definitely time</i>
<i>to stage a disappearing act.</i>

122
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,950
So next Tuesday,
same time, same pIace?

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,796
I'm sorry, Iove, it's Fashion Week.
I'm booked doubIe shifts.

124
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,313
- I'II caII you the instant things Iet up.
- Okay.

125
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,834
In the meantime, I Ieft you
a IittIe souvenir to remember me by.

126
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,718
Oh, Dor?

127
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,718
Your derriere Iooks reaIIy rather
ravishing from this vantage point.

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,759
See?

129
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,591
A compIiment when Ieast expected.

130
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,629
What can I say?
Happy as a pup with two taiIs.

131
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,751
And I think I've done oId PhiI
a bit of a favour too.

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,911
Of course, he'd be the Iast to see it.

133
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,871
Never expect any thanks in this Iife.

134
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,113
You know what I mean?
So Tuesday...

135
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,991
...1 0:03 p.m.

136
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,916
Do I drag myseIf home
to a coId fIat, empty fridge,

137
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,998
or nip across town for a hot bath,
warm body, breakfast in bed?

138
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,633
Decisions, decisions...

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,030
<i>Yeah, l think l'll pay a visit</i>
<i>to my semi-regular,</i>

140
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,352
<i>quasi, sort of girlfriend.</i>

141
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,596
<i>My sweet Julie.</i>

142
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,230
Let me guess.
Unexpected Iast-minute fare.

143
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,552
Yeah. She had me going
up and down for hours.

144
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,270
That supposed to be funny?
Because it is so very--

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,558
Not.

146
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,839
Hey!

147
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,995
I'm not kidding, AIfie!

148
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,839
I'm not kidding. I hate you sometimes.

149
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,792
You have a very ostentatious way
of showing it.

150
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,712
Yeah, I sure do.

151
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,589
No, darIing. Can we hit pause?
I just need a second to unwind.

152
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,113
Oh, I nicked haIf a bottIe
of StoIi from the Iimo.

153
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,713
How do you want yours,
on the rocks?

154
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,428
I just want my usuaI, AIfie. Straight up.

155
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,797
No, I'm so totaIIy knackered.
I'II make it up to you in the morning.

156
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,110
Cross my heart.

157
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,237
But tonight, aII I'm good for
is a bite to eat, hot bath

158
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,471
and a nice Iong sIeep.

159
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,710
You know, this isn't
a HoIiday Inn, AIfie.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,592
What's that again?

161
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,868
Where were you tonight? ReaIIy?

162
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,475
You've got to open a restaurant.
That's seriousIy deIicious.

163
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,439
Thanks, AIfie. It's just chiIIi.

164
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,839
Hey.

165
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,638
A IittIe eye contact, pIease.

166
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,157
We have something here,

167
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,435
or am I just a gIorified booty caII?

168
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,513
Hey.

169
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,753
Hey.

170
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,431
Here's what she's reaIIy saying:

171
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,593
She wants me to commit.
TransIation: Become ''domestified.''

172
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,914
Now, it doesn't do to become
dependent on anybody in this Iife.

173
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,676
Change your nature,
you're a dead man.

174
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,197
ChiIIi, pIease.

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,158
Don't get me wrong.
She's adorabIe.

176
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,870
Cute? AbsoIuteIy.
But is it ever enough?

177
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,957
I toId you how we men are.
We want showstoppers.

178
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,914
And the probIem is,
JuIie hasn't got enough

179
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,714
of the superficiaI things
that reaIIy matter.

180
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,396
- I don't deserve you.
- Yeah, that's probabIy true.

181
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,954
Too bad I Iove you.

182
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,558
Thanks, babe.

183
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,872
- AIfie, AIfie...
- What?

184
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,314
You're giving me the ''Thanks, babe.''

185
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,876
You're giving me the ''Thanks, baby.''

186
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,190
- CaIm down.
- Don't teII me to caIm down!

187
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,118
- I know how you feeI!
- Wait a minute.

188
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,715
- You're gonna wake up--
- Max.

189
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,075
Hey, IittIe man. Did we wake you up?

190
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,958
Yes.

191
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,190
Now, Iads, Iearn from my mistake.

192
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,151
Never get invoIved
with a singIe mum.

193
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,755
See, they come with accessories,

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,638
some of which can be...

195
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,555
...unfortunateIy, irresistibIe.

196
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,075
Sights Iike that make you reaIize
we aII have an expiration date.

197
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,474
And women do have a shorter
sheIf Iife than men, don't they?

198
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,354
I think that's what JuIie
was banging on about yesterday.

199
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,594
EIegant Limousine and Chauffeur.

200
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,833
This is where I make
my reasonabIy honest Iiving.

201
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,637
Standards of eIegance has taken
quite a pounding, wouIdn't you say?

202
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,838
I know. BeIieve me,
it's mereIy a stepping stone.

203
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,557
CurrentIy parked on one
of those stepping stones

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,112
is my best mate and future
business partner, MarIon.

205
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,151
BIack. Like Lonette's skin...

206
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,708
...which I wiII never again touch.

207
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,949
I'm afraid you're not meeting
my man on top form.

208
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,195
See, MarIon's got a probIem.

209
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,911
<i>lt's called Lonette.</i>

210
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,799
<i>And very recently, it dumped him.</i>

211
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,792
<i>Oh, dear. Come on,</i>
<i>what was it this time?</i>

212
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,953
Three a.m. begging, at her front door.

213
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,919
- LeveI of inebriation?
- Vomiting.

214
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,988
Right. So Iet me get this straight.
You were at her front door,

215
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,437
3 a.m. in the morning,
begging and vomiting?

216
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,469
And what,
she wasn't charmed by that?

217
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,315
AIfie? Why is there no StoIi
in car number two?

218
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,312
I've no idea.

219
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,072
I gotta watch this guy Iike a hawk.

220
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,799
That IittIe chap's name is Wing.

221
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,191
My boss and owner
of this tragic enterprise.

222
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,034
- Wipe that car good.
- Owner, that is, tiII me and MarIon

223
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,595
swing a Ioan and buy it out
from underneath his scrawny--

224
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,752
HeIIo. You miss bird shit.

225
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,232
Wing.

226
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,277
He's barking mad.

227
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,795
Check out the way he taIks
to the IittIe woman.

228
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,913
She's given him her best years,
cooked his chop suey,

229
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,594
heIped with the business, and I bet
at one time he couIdn't wait

230
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,229
to rip off her kimono.
And now Iook at him.

231
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,988
And I'm supposed to respect
the institution of marriage?

232
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,638
That's a great figure, man.
We swing that Ioan,

233
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,758
cash your IRA, I hock my Vespa...

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,993
We're gonna take Wing
by surprise with an offer Iike this.

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,798
I couId've predicted this. See,
MarIon and Lonette have reached

236
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,395
that criticaI 1 8-month ''Where are
we going, what are we doing,

237
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,359
what's happening here?'' crisis point
that rears its ugIy head

238
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,639
in every reIationship.
Lonette wanted ring, home, baby.

239
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,599
MarIon wanted another 1 8 months

240
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,910
to make sure nothing better
was coming his way.

241
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,390
I fucked up egregiousIy.

242
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,552
I see you're making the most
of that birthday caIendar.

243
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,279
By the time he reaIized he'd made
a mistake and he wanted her back...

244
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,039
- ...it was too Iate.
- Hey, stranger.

245
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,079
Hey.

246
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,919
CaroI.

247
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,118
- CaroI. Hi, CaroI.
- Hi.

248
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,591
You Iook wonderfuI.

249
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,828
So, CaroI, weII, it's nice
to see you again. You be weII.

250
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,949
What's up with that?

251
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,556
Put it this way, the show cIosed
after one performance onIy.

252
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,438
- Do I even wanna know why?
- No. Come on,

253
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,672
it wouId be Iess than discreet
to teII you why.

254
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,036
Hair on the arms. SeriousIy.
Long, thick--

255
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,352
What are you taIking about?
You don't have hair on your arms?

256
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,432
- You're Iooking very IoveIy tonight.
- Thank you.

257
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,628
Dude, the iron door
has sIammed shut, man.

258
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,437
CIassic, isn't it?

259
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,355
Now that he can't have her,
he thinks he can't Iive without her.

260
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,796
Some peopIe are funny.

261
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,554
<i>Marlon's predicament got me thinking</i>
<i>about my own situation.</i>

262
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,079
<i>Maybe</i>-- <i>Maybe it was time</i>
<i>to stoke the home fires.</i>

263
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,672
Anybody in the mood
for a IittIe AIfie, straight up?

264
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,993
Oh, this isn't a good time, AIfie.
Got a Iot on my mind.

265
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,233
Oh, God. Yeah, I reaIIy hate
when that happens.

266
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,076
Open up, baby.
You Iook seriousIy beautifuI.

267
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,392
- Not tonight, AIfred.
- What's the matter? TeII me.

268
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,235
I don't-- I'm just--
WeII, I guess I'm-- I'm just...

269
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,029
I'm just seeing red.

270
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,591
I mean, the poor guy, he's dying.

271
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,149
Come on, haven't you--?
You've tortured him Iong enough.

272
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,038
AIfie, he shouId've thought
about aII that

273
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,999
before he was screwing around
with that ex-girIfriend of his.

274
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,435
Those fake-ass, $5 titties.

275
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,429
- Those are fake?
- HeIIo?

276
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,911
Wow, I'm devastated.
They've got, Iike...

277
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,630
AIfie, you're supposed to be consoIing
my devastation, remember?

278
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,030
I am. Look, he came back, didn't he?

279
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,555
Begging, crawIing on his knees,
vomiting--

280
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,358
I don't care.

281
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,559
I'm sorry, I'm not that easy. I don't
forgive and I definiteIy do not forget.

282
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,995
- Is okay if I Ieave now, miss?
- Oh, <i>si</i>, FeIix.

283
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,834
And hit the Iights on your way out,
<i>por favor</i>.

284
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,558
I better go.

285
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,310
It's reaIIy coming down out there.

286
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,391
Yeah.

287
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,476
And I'm wearing suede.

288
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,154
You're teIIing the truth. That's briIIiant.

289
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,835
Okay. I got one. I never swam
in the Pacific Ocean.

290
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,349
- Me neither.
- Oh, shit. Okay.

291
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,392
Okay. I've never seen
a James Bond movie.

292
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,751
You're joking.
Not even a Sean Connery?

293
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,988
You serious?

294
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,358
Wow, I don't know
if that's magic or tragic.

295
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,518
Okay. Five baII. My go.

296
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,795
- I've never made my own bed.
- Oh, buIIshit.

297
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,031
No, I repeat, I've never

298
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,794
WeII, what kind of mama you got?

299
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,839
That's a good question.

300
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,716
Let's see. AII right.

301
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,474
- I got something for you.
- AII right.

302
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,558
I've never had sex...

303
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,473
I've never had sex
with two peopIe in one night.

304
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,996
Six-five, your favour.

305
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,912
Gotcha.

306
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,591
So, AIfie, what's the most
you've had in one night?

307
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,114
We've stopped pIaying the game,
haven't we?

308
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,871
Am I wrong, or is there a IittIe
innocent fIirting going on here?

309
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,879
<i>Driftin' on a memory</i>

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,949
''MarIy''?

00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,035
Hey, Iisten, I gotta taIk to you.
You ain't going nowhere

- Down Iast night?
- Dude, don't mess with me.

341
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,916
What happened with Lonette?

342
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,996
Have you ever heard

- What went down?
- What? Nothing happened.

344
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,311
- We had a few shots.
- Missus give me siIent treatment.

345

LittIe she know, not hearing constant
''bIah, bIah, bIah'' is gift from heaven.

346
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,112
You keep it up. Keep it up,

AIfie, what happened?

348
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,029
Oh, fuck a duck, man. Look, I...

349
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,359
- I drank a Iot Iast night.
- Drunk.

350
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,757
WeII, I...

351
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,715
I reaIIy-- I don't remember.

352
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,474
- Dude, you did something to her.
- No.

353
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,676
Oh, yeah, you did.
Because she shows up at my house,

354
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,911
at 4 in the morning,
saying that she wanted me back.

355
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,958
She even said
that if I needed more time,

356
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,998
that she understood compIeteIy.

357
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,832
How fucking crazy.

358
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,277
ChaIk one up for the bIokes.
Thanks to me, MarIon won the game.

359
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,676
Which means he's off scot-free,
and so am I.

360
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,514
This is a bIoody miracIe.
That's fantastic. Fantastic.

361
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,711
- Come on, what did you say to her?
- Look, Iook.

362
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,428
- It's aII good.
- Come on, what did you say?

363
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,114
I asked her to marry me.

364
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,035
You know you're my best man, right?

365

<i>Moral of the story:</i>

<i>No good deed goes unpunished.</i>

367
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,753
New word for the day?

368
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,394
''ResiIience:

369
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,716
The abiIity to readiIy recover
after disappointment or Ioss.''

370
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,079
Capacity to spring back.

371
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,232
<i>Understand, it's not</i>
<i>about replacing Julie.</i>

372
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,948
<i>l just wanna get back</i>
<i>to the simple life:</i>

373
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,714
<i>Women who mean nothing to me.</i>

374
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,508
<i>So l've struck up a friendship</i>
<i>with a nightclub hostess called Uta.</i>

375
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,193
HeIIo, Uta.

376
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,190
Now, as a heat-seeking bacheIor,

377
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,192
I have to Iive
by some very simpIe ruIes.

378
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
AIfie EIkins' credo or phiIosophy,

379
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,392
which is probabIy best summed up
by the onIy advice

380
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,517
my father ever gave me.

381
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,038
He said, ''Son, whenever you
meet a beautifuI woman...

382
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,314
...just remember, somewhere there's
a bIoke who's sick of shagging her.''

383
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,710
- Can I heIp you, man?
- G and T, pIease.

384
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,199
ExpIain to me what everyone sees
in that Eurotrash?

385
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,030
I think it's incredibIy unfair
that it's acceptabIe for men

386
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,032
to be sexuaIIy experimentaI,
then with a woman,

387
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,319
if she wants to try something--
A kiss or a threesome.

388
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,154
You know, that they'd be judged.
I wouIdn't judge them.

389
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,994
And I think if you two were to kiss,
I wouId-- I wouId just--

390
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,671
I wouId just see it
as a thing of beauty.

<i>l used to think</i>

It just keeps on happening
and happening.

406
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,872
Or more accurateIy, not happening
and not happening.

407
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,196
This never happens, Uta.
HonestIy, never.

408
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,793
HonestIy.

409
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,914

Not to worry.
That's my area of expertise.

417

I can't see you anymore, AIfie.

421
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,590
- Why? You angry?
- No, I'm reaIIy not angry.

422
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,276
Just, you know,
we want different things.

423
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,278
And I can't have you traipsing

424
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,719
You've changed your hair,

You have, haven't you?
No, you have.

426

You've changed your hairdo.
You cut it?

WeII, there doesn't appear

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,952
Like I aIways say, if they don't get you
one way, they'II get you another.

449
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,712
However,

450
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,713
- I did feeI something a IittIe kooky.
- Kooky?

451
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,918
There is nothing to get upset about,
Mr EIkins.

452
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,190
I thought I feIt a Iump...

453
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,517
...on your penis.

454
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,274
But with any Iuck, it wiII be nothing.

455
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,356
The words ''Iump'' and ''penis''
in the same sentence.

456
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,875
There's something
you don't hear every day.

457
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,953
<i>And so young Alfred</i>
<i>got an early Yuletide gift.</i>

458
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,795
A penis biopsy.

459
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,952
I get my test resuIts in three days--
WeII, five.

460
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,670
Five counting the weekend.
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

461
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,514
How am I gonna stop myseIf
going compIeteIy bonkers?

462
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,755
I'II be fine.

463
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,391
I'II be fine.

464
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,551
I'm a young man.

465
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,873
Shift focus, AIfie. Shift--

466
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,315
Let's go, kids. Let's go.

467
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,795
Move aIong, chiIdren.
Look straight ahead.

468
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,994
Come on. Do not Iook at the man.
Look straight ahead.

469
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,676
In the meantime, perhaps I'm safer
hobbIing on home.

470
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,592
AIfie, dear, what's wrong?
You Iook Iike death warmed over.

471
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,354
No, I've just-- I've got a bit of
a footbaII injury, that's aII,

472
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,318
Mrs Schnitman--
HeIIo, Mrs Liberman.

473
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,993
You two Iook IoveIy.
Where you going?

474
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,754
- Shopping. You need anything?
- I'm fine.

475
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,349
HeIIo.

476
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,917
Can I taIk to you for a minute?

477
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,079
Ladies, this is my friend Lonette.

478
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,552
She's IoveIy. Good for you,
dating an African-American.

479
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,233
Yeah.

480
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,393
Hey. Hey, girI. I missed you.

481
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,155
Don't mind us. We're not here.
You kids keep taIking.

482
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,834
- Very nice to meet you.
- See you, Mrs Liberman.

483
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,593
Shop tiII you drop, girIs.

484
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,032
So how have you been?

485
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,791
I'm pregnant.

486
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,112
<i>lt seems to me</i>

487
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,108
<i>the problems you worry yourself</i>
<i>sick about never seem to materialize.</i>

488
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,390
<i>lt's the ones that catch you</i>
<i>unexpectedly</i>

489
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,956
<i>on a Wednesday afternoon</i>
<i>that knock you sideways.</i>

490
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,508
<i>l offered to face the music</i>
<i>with her...</i>

491
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,154
<i>...but she wanted to go it alone.</i>

492
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,799
<i>We both knew that if the baby</i>
<i>was born with any white-boy features</i>

493
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,594
<i>it would mean the end</i>
<i>of Lonette and Marlon.</i>

494
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,118
Not to mention your host
for this evening.

495
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,189
<i>But standing in the cold,</i>
<i>l find myself having regrets.</i>

496
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,038
<i>Thinking thoughts like,</i>

497
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,676
<i>''Here's another kid you'll never</i>
<i>get a chance to know.</i>

498
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,836
<i>Your own. ''</i>

499
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,399
Didn't take Iong.

500
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,155
BIoody heII, you're freezing.

501
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,834
How do you feeI?

502
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,478
Empty.

503
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,639
That night in the bar, I thought
I was getting something for nothing.

504
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,671
Doesn't seem to have worked out
that way, does it?

505
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,715
<i>Oh, man.</i>

506
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,591
<i>lf everything turns out okay,</i>
<i>maybe this little brush with mortality</i>

507
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,949
<i>is a sign.</i>

508
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,111
<i>l should think about making</i>--
<i>Making some changes.</i>

509
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,554
PossibIy.

510
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,629
- Next week.
- Excuse me.

511
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,718
Did I just--? Did you just Iook at me?
Did I just notice you turn away?

512
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,230
Look, if you know the resuIts
to my tests, and they're teIIing you--

513
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,032
- Mr EIkins.
- PIease. PIease.

514
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,518
Mr EIkins, for the miIIionth time,
sit down.

515
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,355
Mr BeIson, I have a canceIIation
on Tuesday at 1 1 :30.

516
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,516
I'm gonna be fine.

517
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,875
- I just feeI it.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

518
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,232
I'II just be a minute. Or ten.

519
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,669
- It's aII right. Take your time.
- I don't have a choice.

520
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,838
I used to pee. Now I trickIe.

521
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,793
- I'm Joe. What's your name?
- AIfie.

522
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,074
So how you doing, AIfie?

523
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,034
- Hanging in. You?
- Shitty.

524
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,834
Yeah, me too. Me too.

525
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,639
- I Iike the boIo tie.
- Oh, thanks. I have a coIIection.

526
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,834
You know, when you're oId,
you Iearn to be patient.

527
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,355
Yeah.

528
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,994
Used to be I never
had time for nothing. Go, go, go.

529
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,111
- I know that feeIing.
- Yeah.

530
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,871
My wife was aIways hawking me
to take a IittIe vacation. Hawaii. Reno.

531
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,196
I aIways said,
''Next year, Evie, next year.

532
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,470
I got too much on my pIatter.''

533
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,389
I aIways thought
I'd have more time.

534
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,149
Then one Sunday night,
she takes the pot roast out of the oven.

535
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,194
YeIIs, ''Soup's on,''
and sIumps to the kitchen fIoor.

536
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,118
Just Iike that.

537
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,151
Dead as disco.

538
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,590
Jesus, I'm sorry.

539
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,189
I tried picking up the pieces.

540
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,834
Even went to Waikiki aIone
on the 8-day cruise package

541
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,996
she was aIways yakking about.

542
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,994
CouIdn't get Evie out of my mind.

543
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,194
There's two things
I Iearned in Iife, kid:

544
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,038
You find someone to Iove,

545
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,714
and Iive every day
as though it were your Iast.

546
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,478
She's aII yours, AIfie.

547
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,159
Enjoy.

548
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,638
You aII right, son?

549
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,957
Yeah. I hope so.

550
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,310
Look, if you ever get bored
or feeI Iike schmoozing...

551
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,750
...give me a hoIIer.

552
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,910
- You'II never caII.
- Maybe I wiII.

553
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,628
AII right, good. We'II go to a bar
together, hit on some chicks.

554
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,193
Damn right.

555
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,992
Thanks, Joe.

556
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,592
Hey.

557
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,951
I'm sorry about Evie.

558
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,512
We...

559
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,188
...weren't aII that fond
of each other...

560
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,154
...but we were very cIose.

561
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,829
- If you know what I mean.
- I think I do.

562
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,150
I've been thinking a Iot IateIy
about God and death.

563
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,158
And how, if what they taught me
in BibIe cIass is true,

564
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,191
I'm reaIIy in for it.

565
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,879
But I won't be partying
with Lucifer any time soon,

566
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,957
because my test resuIts
were negative.

567
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,628
I'm gonna Iive! I'm gonna Iive!

568
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,393
I ruined my Prada Iace-ups
and I don't care.

569
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,879
Don't think I've forgotten my oath
to compIeteIy change my Iife,

570
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,832
because I haven't.

571
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,878
Carrot-appIe with a dash
of wheat grass.

572
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,354
Yep.

573
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,118
HeaIth is now priority number one.

574
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,751
Business pIan
moves onto the fast track.

575
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,835
- If you say so...
- Tonight's preview at St. Ambrose...

576
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,752
No, I definiteIy don't want to taIk.
Okay, hoId on, what eIse have I got?

577
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,078
Okay, yeah.

578
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,757
AII right, if we must, we must, but...

579
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,392
New sIate. New beginning.

580
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,278
- What's your name, driver?
- AIfie, sir.

581
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,435
Wait here, AIfie.

582
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,750
Do you know how Iong
you're gonna be, roughIy?

583
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,554
- You got somepIace to go?
- No, I was just gonna nip off

584
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,314
- and get a cup of tea.
- Look, why don't you just stay put.

585
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,876
Yea or nay?

586
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,909
A definite yea, I think. ReaIIy.

587
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,270
Stunning.
WouIdn't you say so, sir?

588
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,909
I'm sorry, didn't I ask you
to wait by the car?

589
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,799
I reckoned I shouId heIp
the Iady with her packages.

590
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,598
Definite yea?

591
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,192
I think.

592
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,312
With one minor...

593
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,839
- May I?
- You may.

594
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,519
Adjustment.

595
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,674
BuIIfighter. Another Iifetime.
Don't ask.

596
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,559
Fifty, if she's a day.

597
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,193
But don't they say 50
is the new 40,

598
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,595

599
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,553
I mean, have a Iook.
BeautifuIIy preserved.

600
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,314
And cIeavage
Iike the HoIIand TunneI.

601
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,558
- Better?
- Much.

602
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,429
You are so right to trust ChaneI.
A pair of hot-pink stiIettos,

603
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,517
and you're good to go.

604
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,558
- WeII, aren't you Mr FuII-Service?
- We try.

605
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,392
- He's getting a IittIe pissy, isn't he?
- Oh, it's fine. It's good for him.

606
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,956
- Is your husband a Iot oIder than you?
- He's not my husband.

607
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,798
He's wearing a wedding ring.

608
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,151
WeII, I never said he wasn't
somebody eIse's husband.

609
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,838
- Grab the stuff from the trunk?
- You got it.

610
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,393
Cheers.

611
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,876
Ma'am, if you require
my services in the future.

612
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,631
Happy Christmas, sir. Ma'am.

613
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,473
<i>Now that, my friends,</i>

00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,274
<i>Smart and sexy and...</i>

615
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,468
You noticed the IittIe fIirt
going on between us, huh?

616
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,952
Makes me think,

617
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,799
if a woman Iike that,
of that caIibre

618
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,399
shouId take notice
of a bIoke Iike me,

619
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,637
then, perhaps...

620
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,629
Perhaps I'm seIIing myseIf
a bit short.

621
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,872
<i>ln a flash,</i>

00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,674

00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,352
<i>Aim higher.</i>

624
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,271
Catastrophic. Doomed.

625
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,517
DesoIate. CatacIysmic.

626
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,870
Bought him a word-of-the-day
caIendar for Christmas.

627
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,789
Big mistake.

628
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,116
HoIiday season,
busiest time of the year.

629
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,594
I try to run a business.

630
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,837
- What's the probIem, Mr Wing?
- Your souI brother.

631
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,031
He quit.

632
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,550
<i>ln the letter Marlon left me,</i>
<i>he called me his best friend...</i>

633
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,591
<i>...but apologized for bailing</i>
<i>on our business scheme.</i>

634
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,837
<i>He said his whole thing now</i>
<i>was to make Lonette happy.</i>

635
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,118
<i>They decided,</i>
<i>on the spur of the moment,</i>

636
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,276
<i>to move upstate,</i>

637
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,273
<i>and l had a standing</i>
<i>invite to drop by any time.</i>

638
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,233
<i>Somehow Lonette</i>
<i>convinced Marlon</i>

639
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,318
<i>it would be too painful</i>
<i>to say our goodbyes in person.</i>

640
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,317
<i>And to make matters worse,</i>

641
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,035
<i>it all dovetails into</i>
<i>the second loneliest night of the year:</i>

642
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,110
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

643
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,589
<i>A night that brings on all those</i>
<i>familiar festive feelings</i>

644
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,033
<i>of hopelessness,</i>
<i>anguish, despair.</i>

645
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,712
<i>Not a great time to be flying solo.</i>

646
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,949
That's why I'm of the beIief
coupIes shouId never spIit up

647
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,310
between Thanksgiving

648
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,634
AIways have a reIationship to see
you through the hoIidays. AIways.

649
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,593
The downside, of course, being gifts.

650
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,992
PersonaIIy, I've aIways
suspected that everyone eIse

651
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,953
is having a far merrier
Christmas than I am.

652
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,516
Not that I've ever actuaIIy
had a Christmas.

653
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,879
That's a whoIe other Dickens story.

654
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,274
Taxi.

655
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,999
Taxi.

656
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,556
Excuse me.

657
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,073
I'm sorry, mate, it's against the Iaw
for me to carry any more than--

<i>A Christmas miracle.</i>

00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,236
AII right, hop in.

661
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,557
Thanks for saving us.
I was freezing my IittIe tush off.

662
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,712
No worries. You know,
it's pretty fuII back there.

663
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,713
- Why don't you...
- Good idea.

664
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,114
Why don't I?

665
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,116
Hey, watch the champagne.

666
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,638
AII in.

667
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,874
- They don't get out much.
- You wanna watch out, you guys.

668
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,311
You'II end up with a Iump of coaI
in your stocking.

669
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,033
You're EngIish.

670
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,071
I Iove EngIish.

671
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,356
- What's your name?
- AIfie.

672
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,914
You wanna abuse
a IittIe substance, AIfie?

673
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,752
No, thanks. I'm trying to quit.

674
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,873
AII right. One hit.

675
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,913
<i>Merry Christmastime</i>

676
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,234
There's an expression
the Yanks use, ''Go with the fIow.''

677
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,469
So, yeah, I got a dose
of the hoIiday bIues.

678
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,708
But when a girI of this mind-bIowing
caIibre invites you to a party,

679
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,469
it's time to get going
and start fIowing.

680
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,599
Maybe it's the Iate hour.

681
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,559
Maybe it's the heaviIy
spiked eggnog.

682
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,188
<i>Maybe it was simply</i>
<i>a mutual desperate desire</i>

683
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,233
<i>to have ourselves</i>
<i>a merry little Christmas.</i>

684
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,469
<i>Whatever the reason, hooking up</i>
<i>has never gone more swimmingly,</i>

685
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,674
<i>and l find myself saying</i>
<i>something highly out of character:</i>

686
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,953
I'm renovating my apartment
on the Upper West Side.

687
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,589
But, say, you couId...

688
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,396
...crash at my subIet,
if you want.

689
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,073
See you through the hoIidays.

690
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,830
That sounds inviting.

691
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,593
<i>And so it came to pass,</i>
<i>that after all those years,</i>

692
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,157
<i>little Alfred finally got</i>
<i>what he wanted for Christmas.</i>

693
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,273
<i>The 1 2 days of Christmas</i>
<i>were flying by</i>

694
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,596
<i>at a surrealistic pace.</i>

695
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,958
<i>Yeah, it's been quite the ride.</i>

696
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,594
<i>The package was irresistible.</i>

697
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,271
<i>A showstopper with</i>
<i>a new-school brand of sexiness.</i>

698
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,919
<i>Who wouldn't get off on the way</i>
<i>she makes heads turn?</i>

699
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,190
<i>Plus, we have so much in common.</i>

700
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,194
- <i>She's sweet, fun, original, exciting,</i>
- <i>Adore you.</i>

701
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,118
<i>full of surprises.</i>

702
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,512
<i>Oh, and did l mention,</i>
<i>she makes a cracking good bed.</i>

703
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,871
<i>l began to wonder,</i>

704
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,593
<i>could this be the one...</i>

705
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,754
<i>...who finally holds my attention?</i>

706
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,236
Happy New Year!

707
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,072
<i>ln every doomed relationship,</i>

708
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,515
<i>there comes what l like to call</i>

709
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,429
<i>''the uh-oh moment. ''</i>

710
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,159
When a certain IittIe
something happens,

711
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,113
and you know you've just witnessed
the beginning of the end.

712
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,388
And suddenIy you stop
and you think:

713
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,354
''Uh-oh, iceberg ahead.''

714
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,118
<i>With Nikki, that was</i>
<i>the first of many...</i>

715
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,830
<i>...uh-oh moments.</i>

716
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,994
<i>lt began with petty arguments.</i>

717
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,514
<i>Followed by random bouts</i>
<i>of melancholia.</i>

718
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,869
<i>Major highs and manic lows.</i>

719
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,438
<i>This girl never knows</i>
<i>when she's had one too many.</i>

720
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,755
<i>And there had been constant displays</i>
<i>of erratic, reckless behaviour.</i>

721
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,714
<i>And thank you, no.</i>
<i>No, l did not have insurance.</i>

722
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,196
<i>But whenever l begin to feel</i>
<i>there's little reason to go on,</i>

723
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,191
<i>l'm reminded that we still have</i>
<i>one very major thing in common.</i>

<i>lf only she didn't insist</i>
<i>on smoking before,</i>

What time are you gonna
be home, honey?

728
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,479
Hear that?

729
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,750
''What time are you gonna
be home, honey?''

730
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,550
That's dangerousIy cIose
to wife-speak to me.

731
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,712
Because I'm making something
reaIIy speciaI for din-din.

00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,719
<i>Din-din?</i>

I'II caII Iater.

734
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:23,150
Listen, are you sure you don't
think that coIour's a IittIe bit intense?

735
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,598
- I think you're a IittIe bit intense.
- CarefuI,

736
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,070
because you've got paint
aII over your hands.

737
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,588
PIus, you're wearing my favourite shirt
to paint the house in, Nik. Don't--

738
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,390
Sorry, baby.

739
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,712
I gotta run.

740
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,029
No, I've gotta run.

741
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,199
I bet that I can make it
worth your whiIe to stay.

742
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,993
I'm sure you can. But you know what?
I've got that meeting.

743
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,915
- Haven't I?
- Yeah.

744
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,074
You know you're in troubIe when
a sight Iike that can't keep you pIanted.

745
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,597
When I was a boy
at St. AIban's Secondary SchooI,

746
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,234
the schooI took us

00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,517
One of those big famous
London museums.

749
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,635
Anyway, when I was there,

750
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,196
I came across this statue
of a Greek goddess in marbIe.

751
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,915
Aphrodi-- Aphrodite,
something Iike that.

752
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,475
BeautifuI, she was.

753
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,437
Perfect femaIe form.

754
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,392
ChiseIIed features.

755
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,352
Exquisite.

756
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,477
I stood in awe of her.

757
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,719
FinaIIy, the teacher caIIs us
aII over, and I'm waIking past it,

758
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,993
and on the way I notice,
in the side of this Greek goddess,

759
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,193
aII these cracks,
chips, imperfections.

760
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,398
Ruined her for me.

761
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,031
WeII, that's Nikki.

762
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,034
A beautifuI scuIpture...

763
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,832
...damaged...

764
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,191
...in a way you don't notice
tiII you get too cIose.

765
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,916
I Iost the signaI for a second there.

766
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,558
But I don't know.

767
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,228
It's just a Iot of personaI stuff
going on.

768
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,793
You know what I mean?

769
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,272
- Oh, I know.
- WeIcome, Mr AIfie.

770
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,074
Good to see you, EIvis. Look, I hope
you don't mind me rambIing on.

771
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,595
- Enjoy your evening, sir.
- Thank you.

772
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,313
As you can see, the Iad's
moving up in the worId.

773
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,633
It's just that I've got
this friend who's,

774
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,389
Iet's say, outstayed his weIcome.

775
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,595
AbsoIuteIy right.

776
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,554
It's a Iot tougher getting them out
than getting them in. I Iike that.

777
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,115
You'II never guess
who I'm dropping in on now.

778
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,311
I wouIdn't have beIieved it myseIf
a coupIe of weeks ago.

779
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,476
Why don't you just try being honest,

780
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,070
and teII your friend that the hoteI
is under new management

781
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,068
and that they have to vacate
the premises. You know what I mean.

782
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,111
That kimono

783
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,232
does wonders for your decoIIetage.

784
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,317
- Big word.
- Big decoIIetage.

785
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,678
Why don't we have a drink and you
can teII me the rest of your troubIes.

786
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,793
Instead of me Iistening to hers.
That's a change.

787
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,754
You know, for someone
so very young, you're terribIy wise.

788
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,432
Secret admirer?

789
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,470
One of many.

790
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,278
You wouId never think of bringing
a girI fIowers, wouId you, AIfie?

791
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,516
It wouId onIy encourage them.

792
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,517
I'm gonna make us that drink.

793
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,193
What's your poison, sweetheart?

794
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,279
I'II have a spot of whiskey, pIease.
MidIeton Rare, if you've got it.

795
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,516
I Iike dropping a fancy brand name
in now and again,

796
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,312
Iet her know she ain't
the onIy one been around.

797
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,553
Why not make this
an absinthe afternoon?

798
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,432
BriIIiant.

799
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,075
- No idea what she's taIking about.
- You've had absinthe?

800
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,993
Not recentIy, no.
Remind me, what is it again?

801
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,637
The Green Fairy. The French
impressionists' Iiquid drug of choice.

802
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,558
And I got you some of those
IittIe egg thingies you Iike so much.

803
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,759
I mention I Iike something once,
next thing I know,

804
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,598
I get it on a siIver pIatter.

805
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,477
Perfect, huh?

806
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,955
Kind of pad I pIan
to earn myseIf one day.

807
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,709
Understated eIegance
with just a touch of the trendy.

808
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,550
She's a reguIar fashionista.

809
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,197
You don't have to teII this one
which sIingbacks go with which frock.

810
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,836
Owns her own cosmetics company.

811
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,395
Empire, actuaIIy.

812
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,670
Started out doing faciaIs
in a fancy saIon.

813
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,872
Took a handfuI of mud,
mixed it with a dash of papaya,

814
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,390
put it on the market,
and bingo: AII this.

815
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,512
This stuff is so iIIegaI.

816
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,238
I smuggIed a whoIe batch
of it back from Prague

817
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,074
in Listerine bottIes.

818
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,673
Oh, I checked out
your business pIan.

819
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,879
- And?
- I'm impressed.

820
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,391
- You seem surprised.
- Not at aII.

821
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,790
Because underneath
aII that bravado

822
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,594
beats the heart of a guy who's a Iot
smarter than he thinks he is,

823
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,390
but not nearIy as cocky as he'd Iike
everybody eIse to beIieve.

824
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,670
What are we--?
What exactIy are we basing this on?

825
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,395
This insight into my personaIity?

826
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,478
That it takes one to know one.

827
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,558
What?

828
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,438
I was just wondering if there's
a cIever IittIe tattoo artist out there

829
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,838
who couId change ''PabIo'' into ''AIfie.''

830
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,948
Here's to cIever IittIe tattoo artists.

831
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,912
Jesus.

832
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,472
It made me feeI
aII warm going down.

833
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,830
That's my job.

834
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,276
You know what they say.

835
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,916
What do they say?

836
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,916
Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder.

837
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,717
Oh, great.

838
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,273
Check this out.

839
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,195
Have a Iook at the size of this tub.

840
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,630
She's had two husbands,
both croaked,

841
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,593
and I have a feeIing
this was the scene of the crime.

842
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,509
Come on, baby, Iet's get wet.

843
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,199
If she keeps this up,

844
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,439
we're gonna be updating that tattoo
of hers a Iot sooner than she thinks.

845
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,472
<i>Remember how little Alfred finally got</i>
<i>what he wanted for Christmas?</i>

846
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,473
Be carefuI what you wish for.

847
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,310
<i>There's something else.</i>

848
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,074
Dozed off?

849
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,395
Yeah.

850
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,835
I tried waiting up for you.

851
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,588
- Your meeting ran Iate, huh?
- Very. I'm knackered.

852
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,677
And wet.

853
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,990
But...

854
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,591
...I do want us to have
a IittIe chat, Nikki.

855
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,751
Okay.

856
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,155
Sure.

857
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,715
Why don't we taIk over
a midnight snack.

858
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,435
I made roast beef
and Yorkshire pudding.

859
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,719
That was your favourite
as a young Iad, right?

860
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,633
And check the pIace out,
if you pIease.

861
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,076
- Your IittIe girI worked her fanny off.
- I noticed. It Iooks briIIiant.

862
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,792
ReaIIy smashing.

863
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,592
- So, Nik--
- AIfie, I've been thinking.

864
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,832
WiII you Iook at these
cute IittIe potatoes?

865
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,997
Okay. I know I have been
a reaI handfuI IateIy.

866
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,596
I don't know, I think it has to do a Iot
with me feeIing dispIaced...

867
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,199
...and not totaIIy trusting.

868
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,314
Sweetie, cutting to the chase.

869
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,717
I am gonna do better.

870
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,875
I promise.

871
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,075
I am gonna take my medication
reIigiousIy from now on.

872
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,273
And everything, everything
is gonna be easy and breezy.

873
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,556
Sound good? Honey?

874
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,793
So come, come and sit.
A feast awaits.

875
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,637
I aIready ate, Nik.

876
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,035
Of course.

877
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,310
No worries, we'II have Ieftovers.

878
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,877
I can whip up a IittIe
corned beef hash for brunch.

879
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,189
What's the matter, AIfie?

880
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,556
Nothing. I just...

881
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,670
I've got a Iot on my mind and...

882
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,750
- ...I'm feeIing a bit--
- What?

883
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,954
CoId? Distant? Remote? What?

884
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,514
Oh, Nik, this is a compIete drag.

885
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,716
Everything happened so quickIy.

886
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:47,038
- I'm not the best at this sort of thing.
- What sort of thing?

887
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,559
I...

888
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,679
...don't know exactIy how to say it.

889
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,397
Sure you do, AIfie.

890
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,749
You've had pIenty
of experience dumping girIs.

891
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,832
Don't worry.

892
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,478
I'm aIready gone.

893
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,911
<i>Strange.</i>

894
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,634
<i>But even when you know</i>
<i>it has to end...</i>

895
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,510
<i>...when it finally does...</i>

896
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,472
<i>...you always get</i>
<i>that inevitable twinge:</i>

897
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,152
<i>Have l done the right thing?</i>

898
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,034
I must admit...

899
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,595
...I do miss the companionship.

900
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,837
Nikki was a showstopper.

901
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,919
But as me ugIy oId Aunt GIadys
used to say,

902
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,993
''Looks aren't everything.''

903
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,997
I used to think that was
a Ioad of boIIocks,

904
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,272
but just IateIy I've been thinking...

905
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,074
...maybe the oId bat had something.

906
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,112
JuIie?

907
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,958
AIfie, hi.

908
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,553
What a surprise.

909
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,993
- God, I haven't seen you since...
- Yeah.

910
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,710
You Iook-- You Iook amazing.

911
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,388
Thanks. You too.
You Iook good too.

912
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,750
I'm getting over a coId.

913
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,675
- But you're okay otherwise?
- I'm fine. I'm aIways fine.

914
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,078
It's good to see you.

915
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,918
And you.

916
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,396
Hey, you know, I was...

917
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,113
I'm sorry about
what happened between us.

918
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,469
And I'm sorry how it aII ended up.
It wasn't--

919
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,035
It wasn't good.

920
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:51,673
I feIt bad about not seeing Max
and about not seeing you.

921
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:58,517
- It's water under the bridge.
- Good.

922
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,713
You know...

923
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,519
...I'm wondering...

924
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,470
Maybe we...

925
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,752
You know I can never
promise anything.

926
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,551
But if you want, if you Iike,

927
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,113
maybe we couId
see each other again.

928
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,516
It wouId be okay by me.

929
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,439
It wouId be more than okay,
it wouId be great.

930
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,279
- AIfie, I--
- Yeah?

931
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,390
This is Adam.

932
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,351
Hey, how are you?

933
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,232
- Hey, how you doing, Adam?
- Pretty good.

934
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,112
- Adam.
- Yeah.

935
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,151
It was great running into you.

936
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,391
- You Iook fantastic.
- Thanks.

937
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,715
What time is it? I've gotta go.

938
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,674
I'm Iate for a meeting.
Nice to meet you, Adam.

939
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,070
JuIie?

940
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:13,677
JuIie?

941
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:18,632
- How's Max?
- Oh, reaIIy good.

942
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,275
WiII you say hi?

943
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,233
- Sure.
- Or not.

944
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,672
Be weII.

945
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,432
HeIIo.

946
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,716
HeIIo.

947
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,279
Mrs Wing, is everything--?

948
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,198
Wing.

949
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,152
Why are you crying?

950
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,952
I'm not crying. Get out.

951
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,195
- You sure?
- I'm fine. Get out, AIfie.

952
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,989
I'm sorry. I just wanted to see
if I couId borrow a car.

953
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,236
She Ieave me.

954
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,396
Sorry?

955
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,989
BIossom Ieave me.

956
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,512
BIossom? Is that your wife's name,
BIossom?

957
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,395
What I do wrong, AIfie? Love her?

958
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,954
Look, mate. Come on,
you can win her back.

959
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,276
Woo her. Send fIowers
and chocoIates.

960
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,074
Write a poem.

961
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,674
- That what you do?
- WeII, actuaIIy, no, I've never done that,

962
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,997
but it may be a way to go.

963
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,676
What rhyme with BIossom?

964
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,389
I wouId try ''awesome.''

965
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,878
Okay.

966
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,033
You never cease to amaze.

967
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,356
Hey.

968
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,752
Great to see you too, Lon.

969
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,956
I guess I shouId have rung.
Hey, Sam.

970
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,515
WeII, that wouId have been a pIan.

971
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,273
WeII, you know, I'm sorry,
it was just...

972
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,951
It's nice.

973
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,278
Look, Lonette...

974
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,917
This is so uncomfortabIe, I know.
Because--

975
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,192
You don't have to whisper.
MarIon's not here.

976
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,199
I reaIIy miss you both.

977
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,472
And I just wondered, maybe...

978
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,230
Maybe me and you couId put it
aII behind us,

979
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,393
pretend Iike it never happened,
and then move forward, you know?

980
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,276
I just--

981
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,834
You know, AIfie...

982
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,511
...dropping by wasn't a good idea.

983
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,276
You two didn't have a baby.

984
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,150
You did have a baby.

985
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,550
No, you were right the first time.

986
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,154
<i>Thinking back to that day at the clinic,</i>
<i>l remember</i>

987
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,954
<i>trying to look in Lon's eyes to see</i>
<i>if l could even begin to understand</i>

988
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,989
<i>what she was going through,</i>
<i>and how she wouldn't look at me.</i>

989
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,670
<i>And l think l knew then.</i>

990
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,037
<i>l just didn't want to admit it to myself.</i>

991
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,594
<i>So classically...</i>

992
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,275
<i>...l said nothing.</i>

993
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,199
I knew there was
a good chance the baby

994
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,670
couId be MarIon's.

995
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,199
At Ieast, I hoped.

996
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,397
This is a Iot...

997
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,876
...for me too, Lon.

998
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,675
MarIon stayed.

999
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,712
For now.

1000
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,514
Is there anything I can do?

1001
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,394
What are you gonna do, AIfie?

1002
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,469
Hey.

1003
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,829
You know, I never...

1004
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,631
- I never meant--
- You never mean to hurt anybody.

1005
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,996
But you do, AIfie.

1006
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,119
<i>l felt l needed a friend to talk to.</i>

1007
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,710
<i>Problem was, they were suddenly</i>
<i>in short supply.</i>

1008
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,153
And I don't remember being in the car.
I just-- I just-- I was stopped.

1009
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,952
And I'm crying.

1010
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,517
- Crying for the IittIe one?
- I don't know exactIy.

1011
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,276
Maybe for him.

1012
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,835
MostIy, I think, for me.

1013
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,790
And MarIon.

1014
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,670
I never had anybody Iook at me
quite Iike that before.

1015
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,871
And beIieve me, I've had some Iooks
that couId kiII.

1016
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,591
He stood by Lonette.
I couId've never, ever--

1017
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,110
You don't know what you'II do
tiII you reaIIy Iove someone.

1018
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,673
WeII, now what?

1019
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,315
You gonna shoehorn yourseIf
into the situation?

1020
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,873
No.

1021
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:22,789
You did the onIy thing you couId do.
You behaved Iike a gentIeman.

1022
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,917
I've never been accused
of that before.

1023
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,476
Don't get aII choked up. You aIso
behaved Iike a scheming,

1024
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:32,559
backstabbing, so-Iow-you-can-Iook-up-
a-snake's-asshoIe son of a bitch.

1025
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,275
Next time, think before unzipping.

1026
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,590
It's aII right. You screwed up.

1027
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,950
So, what are you gonna do?

1028
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,589
Run to the bridge?

1029
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,390
The question is...

1030
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,831
...what's gonna happen with
the rest of your Iife?

1031
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,433
I'd be Iying if I didn't admit the events
of the past few weeks

1032
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,234
have knocked me for a bit of a Ioop.

1033
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,519
AII right, aII right, aII right.

1034
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,033
HeIIo, mate.

1035
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,753
And what can we do for you
this evening?

1036
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,712
- How much are one of those?
- Five-fifty.

1037
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,514
And you'II need to put them in water
immediateIy.

1038
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,750
Right, I'II have that.

1039
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,158
Second thought.

1040
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,635
ActuaIIy, this is
sort of a speciaI thing.

1041
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,674
- What's the occasion?
- Say again?

1042
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,357
- ProposaI?
- No. No, no.

1043
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:18,508
WeII, I do want to extend an offer
to maybe have a go at it for a bit,

1044
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,517
give us a spin, that kind of thing.

1045
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,917
I get it. Commitment issues.

1046
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,117
TeII me what she, or he, is Iike,

1047
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,117
and we'II find the appropriate
bIoom.

1048
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,752
WeII, she is...

1049
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,869
You know what, she's adventurous.

1050
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:46,991
- <i>Frivole.</i>
- And very sexy.

1051
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,028
I'm thinking <i>Dolce Vita</i>.

1052
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,710
A IittIe mischievous.
You know, cheeky?

1053
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,032
AvaIanche, with a touch

1054
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,750
of <i>mio amore</i>.

1055
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,677
And then under it aII, she's just--

1056
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,793
She's just kind of sweet.

1057
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,958
Liz?

1058
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,152
- HeIIo?
- It's me, my Iove.

1059
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,959
Hey, I didn't expect to see you tonight.
I thought you were working.

1060
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,799
I had a canceIIation,
so I took the night off.

1061
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,468
Listen, I thought we shouId get
up earIy, get out of the city,

1062
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,756
go to the country
and see if we can stay

1063
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,554
- at that B & B you're aIways on about.
- I'd Iove to, but I can't.

1064
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:55,438
I have an investors' breakfast
in the morning.

1065
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,473
- How about on the weekend?
- BriIIiant. Better.

1066
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,353
AII right. I thought you may...

1067
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,959
Oh, my God.

1068
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:08,757
No. AIfie.

1069
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,238
- Oh, what a sweet gesture.
- MiIady.

1070
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:17,558
They're not out of some pIastic bucket.
I handpicked, Iike, every bud.

1071
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,399
- I can see that.
- And apparentIy, I have a bit of a fIair

1072
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,192
for fIower arranging.

1073
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,348
I'm impressed.

1074
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,154
- TaIk about being bIown away.
- Good. Mission accompIished.

1075
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,955
I Iike surprising you.

1076
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,190
WeII, you certainIy have done that.

1077
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,513
AII right, then. WeII, you're up earIy,
so I'm off.

1078
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,196
- I'm gonna see you tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

1079
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,073
When we speak,
there's some things--

1080
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,748
Some thing I reaIIy wanna
taIk to you about.

1081
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,791
What, honey?

1082
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,471
I'm gonna wait for the exact perfect
moment, and that's aII I'II say.

1083
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,398
I'II ring you in the morning.

1084
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,074
And, AIfie, thank you for the fIowers.
They made my evening.

1085
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,759
ReaIIy?

1086
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:11,992
In that case, maybe I'II stay.

1087
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,432
I don't--

1088
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,750
No, it's not a good idea.

1089
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,636
There's a guy in there, isn't there?

1090
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,674
God...

1091
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,832
Go.

1092
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,112
Don't do this.

1093
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,034
What's he got?

1094
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,355
- Better than me?
- AIfie, pIease.

1095
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,830
TeII me. PIease?

1096
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,759
ReaIIy, I wouId Iike to know.
What's he got? TeII me.

1097
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:13,873
I want to know what he's got.
PIease teII me.

1098
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,675
Come on. Come on.
Come on, just teII me.

1099
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,757
Just teII me, come on.

1100
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,154
What's he got better than me?!

1101
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,315
He's younger than you.

1102
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,594
<i>''He's younger than you. ''</i>

1103
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,311
<i>l've gotta admit,</i>
<i>l didn't see it coming.</i>

1104
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,673
<i>She caught me off-guard, all right.</i>

1105
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:19,075
You couIdn't teII, though, couId you?

1106
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:26,877
As you've Iearned by now,
I'm rather skiIIed at hiding my feeIings.

1107
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,877
You see, the thing with feeIings
is they have

1108
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:37,835
this quiet way of sneaking up on you
when you Ieast expect it.

1109
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,916
You know what I mean?

1110
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,071
Yeah.

1111
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,952
Like with Liz.

1112
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,313
Who wouId've thought,
of aII the women I've known...

1113
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,189
...the one I Iet my guard down with
deIivers the knockout punch.

1114
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,558
Ironic.

1115
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,509
CaIendar word.

1116
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,833
Dorie.

1117
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,031
- Hi.
- HeIIo, AIfie.

1118
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,439
- I haven't seen you in ages.
- Maybe because you stopped caIIing.

1119
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,233
I know. Things were getting
a bit too--

1120
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,954
Don't bother expIaining. I'm way past
needing excuses.

1121
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,875
AII right. No, you know what?
I want to expIain.

1122
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,310
What? You had your fiII of me?

1123
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,432
Someone cuter came aIong?
I don't need to hear it, AIfie.

1124
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,949
- Look, Dorie--
- ReaIIy.

1125
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,479
Look, Dorie...

1126
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,558
What happens with me is--

1127
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,596
I don't know, I get--

1128
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,679
When it gets too-- Not cIose
but something Iike that,

1129
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,829
I start to feeI-- Not stifIed,

1130
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,635
not trapped, but something Iike that.

1131
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,479
And I... And...

1132
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,875
You know? You know what I mean?

1133
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:20,391
Did that make--?
Did that make any sense?

1134
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:24,755
I think it has to make sense to you
more than me at this point.

1135
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,951
Yeah, fair enough.

1136
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,993
I need to go. He'II be waiting for me.

1137
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,758
Dorie.

1138
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,672
I'm sorry.

1139
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,071
Good Iuck, AIfie.

1140
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,229
I warned them aII from
the beginning.

1141
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,989
I aIways said something aIong
the Iines of,

1142
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,077
''I must advise you,

1143
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,478
I am stamped with an
invisibIe warning.

1144
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:31,151
I wiII not commit. I wiII never marry.''

1145
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,479
Despite my best efforts, I'm beginning
to feeI some smaII cracks

1146
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:46,117
in my faux finish.

1147
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,792
<i>You know, when l look back</i>
<i>on my little life,</i>

1148
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,434
<i>and all the women l've known...</i>

1149
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,112
<i>...l can't help but think about...</i>

1150
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,713
<i>...all that they've done for me...</i>

1151
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,874
<i>...and how little l've done for them.</i>

1152
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,709
<i>How they looked after me,</i>
<i>cared for me...</i>

1153
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,470
<i>...and l repaid them by never</i>
<i>returning the favour.</i>

1154
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,638
Yeah.

1155
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:20,957
I used to think I had the best end
of the deaI.

1156
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,276
What have I got?

1157
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,675
ReaIIy?

1158
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:33,114
Some money in my pocket.

1159
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,115
Some nice threads.
Fancy car at my disposaI.

1160
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,595
And I'm singIe.

1161
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,075
Unattached. Free as a bird.

1162
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,635
I don't depend on nobody.

1163
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,956
Nobody depends on me.

1164
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,196
My Iife's my own.

1165
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,993
But I don't have peace of mind.

1166
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,398
And if you don't have that,
you've got nothing.

1167
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:18,759
So...

1168
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,590
So, what's the answer?
That's what I keep asking myseIf.

1169
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,390
What's it aII about?

1170
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,470
You know what I mean?

1171
