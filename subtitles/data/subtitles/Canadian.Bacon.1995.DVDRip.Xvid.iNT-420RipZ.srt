1
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:30,764
God bless America again

2
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:38,272
You must know the trouble that she's in

3
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:42,276
Wash her pretty face

4
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:46,280
Dry her eyes and then

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:54,655
God bless America again

6
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,657
You know

7
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:01,161
I wish God would bless America again

8
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,163
Like he did way back there

9
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,666
When it all began

10
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,067
He blessed her then

11
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,670
But we sort of took it for granted

12
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,172
And didn't ask again

13
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,059
So let's just kinda hold her hand now

14
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,460
That's all

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,564
In case she stumbles

16
00:01:20,564 --> 00:01:23,567
Let's don't let her fall

17
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,971
Let's go live to TV 10's Kelly Breen.

18
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,473
It's a big day in Niagara Falls, new York,

19
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:30,975
Where the presidential motorcade

20
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,577
Will pass by in a few moments.

21
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:36,096
The turnout is pretty much nonexistent,

22
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,196
Which is rather surprising.

23
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,099
This is the first time

24
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,202
A president has been here since 1901,

25
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,239
When William mckinley stopped by and was shot.

26
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:53,464
God bless America again

27
00:01:53,464 --> 00:02:00,854
You must know the trouble that she's in

28
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,858
Wash her pretty face

29
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:08,862
Dry her eyes and then

30
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:13,867
God bless America again

31
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,871
Ah-ahh

32
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,875
I don't understand everything I read and hear

33
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,245
About what's wrong with America

34
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,648
When you don't have a lot of book learning

35
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:31,251
There's many things you don't understand

36
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,637
But I know this much

37
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:36,640
She's like a mother to me

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,642
I love her with all my heart

39
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:42,146
And let me tell you this, mister

40
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:45,899
Everything I am or ever hope to be

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,902
I owe to her

42
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,804
Topping the president's
Agenda today will be a speech

43
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,307
At the recently closed Hacker defense plant.

44
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,527
Hacker was closed,
10,000 employees laid off

45
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,428
Due to the end of the cold war,

46
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:00,030
Which rendered useless

47
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,432
The military supplies they produced there.

48
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,434
The public is being encouraged

49
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,436
To not only hear the president,

50
00:03:05,536 --> 00:03:08,038
But also pick up on a bargain.

51
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:10,441
There are some good deals left on items

52
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,544
Ranging from missiles to light armament.

53
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,446
One of those laid-off employees this morning

54
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:17,331
Had quite an altercation.

55
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,550
This ex-Hacker employee

56
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,952
Is trying to deface the image of R.J. Hacker,

57
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,954
The chairman of that company.

58
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:27,941
He got away before he could be apprehended.

59
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:36,316
God bless America again

60
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:43,207
You must know the trouble that she's in

61
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:47,211
Wash her pretty face

62
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:51,215
Dry her eyes and then

63
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:58,972
God bless America again

64
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:06,847
Oh, please God bless America again

65
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,616
Shit!

66
00:05:05,155 --> 00:05:06,056
Meanwhile, in other news,

67
00:05:06,156 --> 00:05:08,058
Due to the record number of laid-off workers

68
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,060
jumping to their death in Niagara Falls,

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,564
The city council has just
Approved an incentive program.

70
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,065
Sheriff's deputies who talk
someone out of jumping

71
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,668
Will be getting $25.

72
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,069
If they go in to retrieve the body,

73
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,704
they'll be getting $50.

74
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:25,425
Jump!
Jump! Jump!

75
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,827
What'll this one make?

76
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,328
Uh...

77
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,431
The third one today.

78
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,433
Uh, ninth this week.

79
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:38,572
Man, are we racking up the grief bonus!

80
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,973
450 bucks,

81
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,592
and the week's not over yet.

82
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,944
Stick with me, Honey.

83
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,345
Things keep going like this,

84
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,276
we'll make what we

85
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:47,347
used to make at Hacker.

86
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:52,836
You know it.

87
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:57,958
What's this guy doing up there?

88
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,597
It's a free country.

89
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,100
He doesn't like it here,
he can swim to Canada.

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,603
A lot of work there.

91
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:13,724
Shut up and look at this.

92
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:14,758
Hey, isn't that--

93
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:17,361
It's our good friend,
Roy boy.

94
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,629
Jump!

95
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,631
No, no! He's wearing my good hat!

96
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:21,632
Let's help him out.

97
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,133
Great.

98
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,635
Don't jump, Roy boy,

99
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:31,241
don't jump!
Help is on the way!

100
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,395
Huh?

101
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,897
Nice shootin'!

102
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,649
All right!

103
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:41,001
Who did this?

104
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,754
Medic.

105
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,656
That was a beautiful thing you just did, Honey.

106
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:49,259
God, I love you.

107
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,259
Just kidding.
Ha ha ha!

108
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:53,261
Ha ha ha!

109
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,263
I was kidding.

110
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,972
Let me get this straight.

111
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,691
You shot me

112
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,227
because I didn't want to go on living?

113
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,729
Yeah. You want me to finish the job?

114
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,230
Relax, Honey.

115
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,232
Roy boy, would you please pipe down?

116
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,234
I was trying to make a statement

117
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,337
about our plight.

118
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,606
At least the plight of those
whose uncle ain't the mayor.

119
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,608
Don't you mention my uncle Jack.

120
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,710
You're thinking nepotism.

121
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,613
I took that test and passed it fair and square.

122
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,748
What about handing her a job?

123
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,249
I知 your buddy.

124
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,852
Don't you mention Honey like that.

125
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,620
Look, you guys,

126
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,622
My life has been complete hell

127
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,507
since Hacker laid me off.

128
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,110
We know how you feel.

129
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,112
We all feel the same way.

130
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,014
We've all made big changes in our life

131
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,515
since the plant closed down.

132
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,615
That's right.

133
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,520
If life hands you a lemon,
crush it into lemonade.

134
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,022
That's positive thinking.

135
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:54,374
Come on, smile.

136
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:58,128
Just what makes that little ol' ant

137
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,631
think he'd move that rubber tree plant?

138
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:03,633
Everyone knows an ant

139
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,035
can't

140
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,137
move a rubber tree plant.

141
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:07,537
'Cause he's got

142
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,039
Roy boy, sing!

143
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:10,540
High hopes

144
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,042
He's got

145
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,144
High hopes

146
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,662
He's got

147
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:20,767
High-apple-pie-in-the-sky hopes

148
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:23,520
So any time you're feelin' low

149
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,805
'Stead of lettin' go

150
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,774
Just remember that ant

151
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:31,778
Woops, there goes another rubber tree

152
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,781
Woops, there goes another rubber tree

153
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:38,285
Woops, there goes another rubber tree plant

154
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,285
Ker-plop!?

155
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,696
President here yet, Riley?

156
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,697
Officer Riley.

157
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,199
Oh, sure.
Sorry.

158
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,700
You fellas need any backup here,

159
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,202
Officer Riley?

160
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,586
I don't think so, sheriff.

161
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,205
Ok.

162
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:03,560
You finding a lot of
roadkill this year, sheriff?

163
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,711
We get to keep what we find.

164
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,213
Ha ha ha!

165
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,316
Ha ha.

166
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:09,966
Forgive me.
Where are my manners?

167
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,102
This is my woman deputy, Honey.

168
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,603
Honey's been a real asset

169
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:19,709
since she got her parole.

170
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,727
Next, I have an unused,

171
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,112
air-delivered, chemical weapon

172
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:25,081
guaranteed death within 3 minutes.

173
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:28,585
What do I hear for this
miracle of modern science?

174
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:29,986
Spread 'em, or i値l blow your brains out.

175
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:32,589
Ha ha ha!

176
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:33,990
Where the hell you guys been?

177
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,593
Pulling stiffs out of the Falls.

178
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,495
You promised I could pull
the stiffs out this time.

179
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:39,996
I need the money.

180
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,098
We never got the $50.

181
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:46,102
We stopped Roy boy from jumping off.

182
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,505
What you池e jumping off the Falls now?

183
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,006
I was making a statement.

184
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,508
Stop with the statement thing.

185
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:52,509
Get us a beer.

186
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:56,613
I do love an auction.

187
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:59,516
What do I hear for this beautiful, wire-guided,

188
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,518
uranium-tipped fire-and-forget thing?

189
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:03,019
Who'll give me $1,000?

190
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,521
1,000, 1,000, 1,000?

191
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,522
$500, then.

192
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,624
Have $500 anyone?

193
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:09,624
$500, my ass.

194
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,027
Come on,
ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,529
Built right here in Niagara Falls.

196
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:14,631
You can own one.

197
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,533
You built it.
You can own it now.

198
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,635
300, 300, 300, 4.

199
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,637
400, 400, 400, 400, 5.

200
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,139
Can we get out of here?

201
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:25,041
All these guns and white
people are making me nervous.

202
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,043
Ease off with that 'white people' stuff.

203
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:30,780
You got me looking at 'em funny.

204
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,283
I致e got 25, 26, 25, 26.

205
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:36,036
Sold! $25.

206
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:36,937
All right.

207
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:39,039
Here you go.

208
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,039
Next, we have...

209
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,697
Pardon me.

210
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,800
Out of the way.
Let me by.

211
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,303
Anyone!
Could I have $100, please?

212
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:55,805
Give me that microphone.

213
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,707
I reckon all of you know me.

214
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,810
I知 R.J. Hacker,
and I own Hacker dynamics

215
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,212
and Hacker aerospace,

216
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,713
Time-Hacker,

217
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:05,215
Hacker-upjohn,

218
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,717
and a bunch of others I don't even remember,

219
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,336
and you don't care.

220
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,338
You're upset because I closed this plant

221
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:14,324
and put you out on the street.

222
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:17,827
Well, I want you to know I知 upset, too.

223
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,837
In fact, I get choked up thinking about it.

224
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,213
Boo!
Boo!

225
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,722
Shit.

226
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:46,623
Pill-popping freaks.

227
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,124
Look at this trash.

228
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:50,226
Just garbage.
Human garbage.

229
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,629
Look. That's what we get for kicking butt

230
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:55,131
in every goddamn corner of the world.

231
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:58,311
Why do we have to be here at these closings?

232
00:11:58,735 --> 00:11:59,636
General, we're here

233
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,137
to show the people that we care.

234
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:02,488
Let's put on

235
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,741
a happy face, shall we?

236
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:07,394
Used to be that you had your Russian reds,

237
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,996
your Cuban red,
Hollywood red.

238
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,398
Here a red, there a red,
everywhere a red red.

239
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,500
E-i-e-i-o.

240
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,503
But it kept us on our toes.

241
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,005
We didn't know who to mistrust,

242
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,408
but we had to defend ourselves.

243
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:24,518
You had good jobs to put meat on the table.

244
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:27,914
But today we find ourselves being destroyed

245
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,517
not by the reds,

246
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,419
but by a bunch of shortsighted,

247
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,521
bleeding-heart,

248
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,773
penny-pinching Washington wimps.

249
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:38,174
Who is this guy?

250
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,276
R.J. Hacker, sir.

251
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,678
How about some credit?

252
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:43,680
I知 the only president who
hasn't gotten us into a war.

253
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,682
I think that's his point, sir.

254
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:48,184
You have yet to send our boys into battle.

255
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,286
Where nobody痴 bothering us.

256
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,789
Send them anywhere,
Sir.

257
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:53,909
Guaranteed 30-point

258
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,191
boost in the polls.

259
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,693
Well, I知 not going to start a war

260
00:12:56,793 --> 00:13:01,297
just to increase my popularity.

261
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,199
What can I do for 20 points?

262
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,701
...makes me want to commit acts

263
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:06,336
I cannot utter in public.

264
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:08,938
Here he is now--

265
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:11,941
The man that a thin majority of you

266
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:15,452
chose to be president of the United States.

267
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,827
Stu.

268
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,228
Little hard on the leader

269
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,230
of the free world,
don't you think?

270
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,333
It's just what he deserved.

271
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,236
This peace ain't all it's cracked up to be.

272
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,873
Especially if we keep laying
off thousands of voters.

273
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:45,875
What would you suggest we do?

274
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,677
To keep these

275
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,379
factories open

276
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,880
Should I call up the Russians,

277
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,850
see if they want to get back into it?

278
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,752
Don't you get sarcastic with me,

279
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:57,854
you little piss ant!

280
00:13:57,854 --> 00:14:00,356
You just had an idea that I liked!

281
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:02,258
I want you to follow up on it.

282
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:04,260
See to it that those Russkies

283
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,863
get back in the cold war mode.

284
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:10,867
If you don't, you'll go
right back where I found you.

285
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,870
Now, don't make decisions.
Just do it.

286
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,273
I want to thank you for that great welcome.

287
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:19,776
You provided the power to win the cold war

288
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,186
for the United States of America.

289
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,663
If we could take what we spent

290
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:27,267
on just one day of the cold war,

291
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,286
we could put our children
through school for the year.

292
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,772
Now's our chance to do it.

293
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,175
Time to turn off that war machine

294
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,926
and turn on our children.

295
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:40,029
Ha ha!

296
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:40,930
Turn...

297
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,900
Turn...on our children.

298
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,802
The time has come,
fortunately,

299
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,905
for us to beat our swords into plowshares.

300
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,907
Excuse me.
Do you work here?

301
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,308
You work here?

302
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,295
I want to get a copy of the speech.

303
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,197
A transcript or something?

304
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,198
And you are...?

305
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,699
Oh, I知 sorry.

306
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,302
Sheriff Bud Boomer,
Niagara county.

307
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,203
And your handle is?

308
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,704
What?
Your name?

309
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,205
Your name.

310
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,807
Stuart Smiley,

311
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,747
the president's national security advisor.

312
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,080
Stu, you're just the guy we wanted to see.

313
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,184
Can you give us a deal at
our sheriff's department?

314
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,587
We're looking for-- what do you call them?

315
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:24,190
The m-1640-millimeter grenade launchers--

316
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,192
Flash, fragmentation,

317
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,093
incendiary illumination,

318
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,595
and smoke.

319
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:29,596
To go, please.

320
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,698
Are we putting on a play?

321
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,083
It's for civil disturbances only.

322
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,587
'How many times...

323
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:41,090
'Must the cannonballs fly...'

324
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,492
You tell us.

325
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,494
'...before they're forever banned?'

326
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,995
Ugh.

327
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,598
'The answer, my friend...

328
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:53,102
'Is blowin' in the wind.

329
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,102
'The answer, my friend...'

330
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:01,878
O.k. I知 in command here.
Stay calm.

331
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:04,230
Get off me!

332
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,632
The sheriff has the eagle covered.

333
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,735
It's an honor to meet you.

334
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,637
I知 sorry I didn't vote for you.

335
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:11,638
I had to stay home.

336
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,139
The cable installers said they'd come--

337
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,140
Get off me.

338
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,141
Pardon?

339
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,643
Get off me!

340
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,745
I知 sorry. Sure.

341
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,745
Oh, god.

342
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,416
Good thing for you.

343
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:30,290
The president liked me.

344
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,292
Otherwise, you'd be in big trouble.

345
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,794
Right. You must be really important, Boomer.

346
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,045
You see cops last night?

347
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,547
I wouldn't miss it.

348
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,048
They kept the camera running

349
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,049
while they were

350
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,151
waling away on those guys.

351
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:44,153
Whack, whack,
Whack, whack!

352
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:47,156
Oh, it was awesome!
Ooh!

353
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:49,559
You think we're ever gonna be on cops?

354
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,661
Damn right we will.

355
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:52,562
Wait'll they see me

356
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,914
throwing myself on that grenade.

357
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,816
You threw the president on the grenade.

358
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,916
Well, whatever.

359
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:01,437
Morning, Mr. President.

360
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:02,939
Morning, sir.

361
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,941
I have the results from the overnight tracking.

362
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,043
Care to hear the damage?

363
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,444
Yeah. I can take it.

364
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:09,946
It's good news, sir.

365
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,448
Immediately after the assassination attempt,

366
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,335
we got a 15-point boost in the national polls.

367
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,553
Ok.

368
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,455
They dropped off considerably

369
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,341
once word got out that you were still alive.

370
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,801
But the initial massive gains the Dow Jones made

371
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:27,184
after the assassination bulletin

372
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:29,215
held for the entire business day.

373
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,600
That's good news.

374
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,602
According to this,
rumors that you were

375
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:34,103
clinically dead for 5 minutes,

376
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,205
and returned to life

377
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,608
boosted your rating with the religious right.

378
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,109
That's good.

379
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:44,213
But the voters felt that
your being alive or dead

380
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,482
had no real bearing on their daily lives.

381
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,484
You can take that a couple of ways.

382
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,586
With all due respect, sir,

383
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,622
enjoy your single term.

384
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:55,591
You know, it's not fair.

385
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,126
Every other president

386
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,128
had the Russians to blame for everything.

387
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,230
What have I got?

388
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,633
It is really too bad that the Russians

389
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,134
are no longer in the game.

390
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,636
They weren't much fun anyway.

391
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:09,105
Never got to kill any.

392
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:11,007
But without them,
you and your friends

393
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:12,508
would've had to get real jobs.

394
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:13,509
That isn't funny, Stu.

395
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:14,510
Stu's got a point.

396
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,012
What point, sir?

397
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:17,513
You got a point, too.

398
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:20,693
My point is that Russia is in such shambles,

399
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,519
they couldn't sissy-slap us if they tried.

400
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,621
Well, they still have

401
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:27,023
all those missiles lying around.

402
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:28,908
20,473, to be exact.

403
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,410
Are you kidding?

404
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,412
One of their breakaway republics, Kazakhstan,

405
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:33,913
is the third-ranking nuclear power

406
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:34,914
in the world.

407
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:35,915
Are you kidding?

408
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,667
Most Americans

409
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,669
don't know where Kazakhstan is.

410
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:41,170
My travel agent can't find it.

411
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,039
I can imagine why.

412
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:46,025
What do you want to do about Russia?

413
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,428
Let's find out who's in
charge over there this week.

414
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,929
Vladimir Krushkin.

415
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,431
Vlad. I like him.
That's good.

416
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,533
Let's ask him to come over.

417
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,035
We can have a summit thing.

418
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,304
Maybe we can work something out like before.

419
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,806
That's an excellent idea.

420
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,408
Super idea, sir.

421
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,309
We got a contingency plan.

422
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,310
Good.

423
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,410
We'll bring it right in.

424
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,973
Look at the treacherous bastards.

425
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,475
Once a commie,
always a commie.

426
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,976
Pretend you're not here.

427
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,076
Shut up,
Peanuts.

428
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,448
All right. Be nice.
This man's our only hope.

429
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,350
Mr. President,
welcome to our summit.

430
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,601
You look great.

431
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:48,454
Ha ha ha!

432
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,355
Let's eat.

433
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,857
Good. Right this way.

434
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:51,858
Have a good trip?

435
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,859
Wonderful.

436
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,463
Truly wonderful.

437
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,463
Mmm.

438
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:16,115
Mmm.

439
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,017
Mr. President,
we were wondering if, uh...

440
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,120
If you and I,
you know...

441
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,123
If we couldn't sort of get together and...

442
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,020
you know, mano y mano,

443
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,526
and...

444
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:30,630
and sort of work something out,

445
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,532
sort of mix it up the way we used to

446
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,384
in the good old days.

447
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:37,386
I don't mean a real war.

448
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,889
Just a little tension.

449
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:43,392
Sort of help people forget about things.

450
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:45,394
Ha ha ha!

451
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,296
Oh, Mr. President...

452
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:48,798
Please!

453
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:49,849
Is this why

454
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,300
you called us here?

455
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,153
We already gave up.
You've won.

456
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,055
We are too busy trying to perfect

457
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,658
universal indoor plumbing.

458
00:20:58,658 --> 00:21:00,059
That's right.

459
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,060
Indoor plumbing.

460
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,663
Maybe even a little...

461
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,665
central heating.

462
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,265
Big Buick

463
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,066
in every garage

464
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,684
would be nice.

465
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,186
A few cellular phones...

466
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,922
compact discs, mtv--

467
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:14,323
What is the name of that other channel?

468
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,074
VH-1.

469
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,677
Yes! VH-1!

470
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,179
I知 so sorry,
Mr. President.

471
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,682
We can't go back to the old days.

472
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:23,749
Please try

473
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,584
and understand.

474
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,553
Good day.

475
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:27,954
It's a trick,
Mr. President.

476
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:29,455
Damn right.

477
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,557
Can't we talk this over?

478
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,557
What is there to talk over?

479
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,460
You're in charge of the world now.

480
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,562
Don't be a sore winner.

481
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:37,964
I知 sure we could discuss this

482
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:38,965
like civilized men.

483
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,567
Civilized men?

484
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:45,571
Is that what we've both
been for the last 50 years?

485
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,361
Just a holy

486
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:47,473
Goddamn minute.

487
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,209
Your comradeship!

488
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,611
Throwing your weight around

489
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54,113
for half a century,
threatening the peaceful,

490
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,717
Western world, ng and decide one day

491
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,118
to tug the rope no more.

492
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,220
Do you?

493
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,371
Mr. President,
I知 so sorry for this.

494
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:04,473
Sorry for this?

495
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:05,848
You made us spend trillion $

496
00:22:05,948 --> 00:22:07,376
on submarines and missiles

497
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:09,879
and what did all this rubbish get us?

498
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:13,099
Bread lines and may day parades!

499
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,103
Don't chicken out on us now!

500
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,605
We need you. I need you.

501
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,391
You don't always get a second chance.

502
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:25,244
Attaboy, Stu!

503
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,145
You can't do that!

504
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,146
Get off him!

505
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:30,750
Get off him!

506
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,651
I知 very sorry,
Mr. President.

507
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,402
I知 very-- all right.

508
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,404
Get over there.
Get over there.

509
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,406
Sorry. I知 really,
truly sorry.

510
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,025
Maybe we could meet again.

511
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,526
How about Geneva?

512
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,527
We could meet at Geneva,

513
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,263
sort of neutral territory.

514
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,766
Goodbye, Mr. President...

515
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:52,638
and good luck.

516
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:56,642
Any more bright ideas?

517
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:59,011
What are we going to do for an enemy now?

518
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,982
Dead.

519
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:05,985
Dead.

520
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,488
Dead.

521
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,389
Dead.

522
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,390
I miss anything?

523
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,377
Nothing.

524
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:16,379
Also dead.

525
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:17,780
They're all dead.

526
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,282
You working from an old list?

527
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:22,385
They're what we're looking for.

528
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:24,887
This guy,
he's still alive.

529
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:25,788
But he's down in Florida

530
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:30,142
making license plates now.

531
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,661
She's reformed...

532
00:23:31,761 --> 00:23:33,896
and looking good.

533
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,898
You know,
we were thinking,

534
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:36,549
what could be

535
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,300
a bigger threat

536
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,019
than aliens invading from space?

537
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,672
Whoo-boy! Scare the shit out of everyone.

538
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:44,772
Even me, sir.

539
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:47,176
Is this the best you could come up with?

540
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:50,179
What about, you know,
international terrorism?

541
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,181
Sir, we're not going to reopen missile factories

542
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,283
just to fight some creeps

543
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:57,286
running around in exploding rental cars.

544
00:23:57,286 --> 00:24:00,423
Turn on the lights.

545
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:01,824
I知 sorry.

546
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:03,926
I知 appalled.

547
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:06,829
I知 surprised you left those
killer bees off the list.

548
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,932
How about...

549
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:11,932
How about Canada?

550
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,688
O Canada

551
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:20,559
Our home and native land

552
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,563
True patriot love

553
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:29,068
In all thy sons command...

554
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,470
Uhh! That's what I hate about coming here.

555
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,105
You got to listen to that song.

556
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,205
Check out the flag.

557
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,476
What is that,
a weed on there?

558
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,578
Give me a break!
Nice flag.

559
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,581
Let's go!

560
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,866
Let's go!
Drop the puck!

561
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:45,368
Let's go!

562
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,720
Come on!
Face off!

563
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,090
O Canada

564
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,095
We stand on guard for thee

565
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:56,728
Evening,

566
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,496
Ladies and gentlemen.

567
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,498
Welcome to hockey night in Canada.

568
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:02,001
Tonight the American team
visits our Canadian champions,

569
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,101
the Ontario Beavers.

570
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,504
Please enjoy the game,
and remember,

571
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,990
no bad language and no littering.

572
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:13,496
Here we go!

573
00:25:13,996 --> 00:25:16,015
Hey, Kabral,
how come you never see

574
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,017
any black guys playing hockey?

575
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,519
Do you think it's easy to just gradually

576
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,982
take over every

577
00:25:22,082 --> 00:25:23,522
professional sport?

578
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,024
Let me tell you something, man.

579
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,025
Brothers are starting to figure out

580
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,127
this ice thing.

581
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,127
Hope you enjoyed it.

582
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,515
Heh heh heh.

583
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:34,917
These Canadians ain't got a care in the world.

584
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,419
How about the way they cheat

585
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,920
at the world series?

586
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,789
That's our game, people!

587
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:43,392
That is true.

588
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,982
And another thing-- their beer sucks.

589
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,302
Eww!

590
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,071
Oh, boy!

591
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,572
Look at that!

592
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:17,560
That's footage never seen on TV.

593
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,961
Yowsah!

594
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,814
It's amazing.

595
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:22,648
How did you know that

596
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,582
was a nuclear facility?

597
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,436
They tricked us there.
That's a hospital.

598
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:27,686
But it's

599
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:28,337
a hell of a strike.

600
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:30,439
We've got technology

601
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,841
we've never been able to use.

602
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:32,952
A riot between

603
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:33,843
Americans and Canadians

604
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:35,344
broke out last night

605
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:38,697
at a hockey arena in Niagara Falls, Ontario.

606
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,599
Police estimate at least 60 people,

607
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,586
including an American sheriff,

608
00:26:43,586 --> 00:26:46,489
were detained overnight by Canadian authorities.

609
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:48,491
I want to call the American embassy.

610
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:52,595
All I said was,
'Canadian beer sucks.'

611
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,996
People!

612
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:57,600
People!

613
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,102
Can't we all just get along?

614
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:02,412
Boy, these Canadians are violent.

615
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:12,014
General, can I use your phone for a second?

616
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:18,370
Sure. Go ahead.

617
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,772
Yeah. Stu Smiley.

618
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:22,374
Give me central intelligence.

619
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,627
Yeah, Canada desk?

620
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:26,028
Timmy.

621
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:27,530
Hi, Stu.

622
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,031
What's up, Bill?

623
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:30,533
How you doing, Stu?

624
00:27:30,633 --> 00:27:32,535
Re-route the heroin through Cancun.

625
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:33,536
Hold on a second--

626
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:35,638
Yeah. Oliver Stone.

627
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:38,140
There's Gus.

628
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,542
What do you say, Stu?

629
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:41,644
Long time no see, huh?

630
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,647
It's like the plaza in here.

631
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:48,050
They've got me in a temporary
place here, that's all.

632
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,169
I see you're still proud of telling Kennedy

633
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,271
to send advisors to Vietnam.

634
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,672
You're damn right.

635
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,674
The whole Vietnam war was my idea.

636
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,776
Not ashamed of it one bit.

637
00:27:58,277 --> 00:28:00,179
If they had followed my
advice and gone nuclear...

638
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,419
I知 sure history

639
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,681
will vindicate you.

640
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,183
Would've wiped out the Koreans, too.

641
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,285
Then we wouldn't be driving

642
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,688
behind them shitty little
compacts with no pickup.

643
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,190
Those cars are built in South Korea.

644
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,191
They're our Koreans.

645
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,293
Like I care!

646
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,694
What have you got for me?

647
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,695
Anything, something?

648
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,696
You mean Canada.

649
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,198
Yeah.

650
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,801
We can't talk here. Let's go for a walk.

651
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,703
There a secretary hidden somewhere

652
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,940
to hold your calls for you?

653
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,842
Remember the big New York blackout?

654
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,812
Caused by a Canadian hydroelectric plant,

655
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,346
Niagara Falls.

656
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,848
The Canucks claim

657
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:39,451
that it was a faulty transmitter.

658
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,353
We had reason to suspect otherwise.

659
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,455
Why what do you mean?

660
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,857
These Canadians suffer

661
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,826
from a serious inferiority complex.

662
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:49,728
That's why they built this--

663
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:50,757
Canadian

664
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,231
National tower.

665
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,292
World's tallest

666
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:54,733
freestanding structure.

667
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,236
Our scientists can't figure out its purpose.

668
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,237
I値l bet theirs can't either.

669
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,340
Jesus.

670
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,242
Canadians are always dreaming up

671
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:06,845
a lot of ways to ruin our lives.

672
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,747
The metric system,
for the love of god!

673
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,249
Celsius!

674
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,351
Neil Young?

675
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,752
By god, you're right, Gus.

676
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,854
Of course!
It was crazy of us

677
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,756
to have been so blind for so long.

678
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,359
We thought,
they're just Canadians.

679
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,861
They're practically the 51st state.

680
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,264
We admired them-- clean streets, no crime,

681
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,265
no minorities.

682
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,766
How'd they do that?

683
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,268
No slavery.

684
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,368
God, they're smart.

685
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,273
Their entire government is run by socialists.

686
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,774
But it's not the real pinko stuff.

687
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,377
No! That's where you're wrong.

688
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,880
They've always had these tendencies.

689
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,532
'Capitalism must be destroyed in all forms.'

690
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:45,034
What's this?

691
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:47,036
We haven't been paying attention.

692
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,139
We think that,
oh, they're a little strange

693
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:52,589
With the socialized medicine stuff.

694
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:55,544
But do you know they provide
free college to anyone?

695
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,046
Free trains,

696
00:29:57,146 --> 00:29:58,547
free eyeglasses,

697
00:29:58,647 --> 00:29:59,548
free condoms?

698
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:01,050
Jesus.

699
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,652
Do your superiors know about this?

700
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:06,155
Ah, those gutless desk mammals.

701
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:07,556
Ever since I told them

702
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,658
the bay of pigs by 10:00,

703
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:12,161
they've treated me like dirt.

704
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:13,062
You've done a great job here.

705
00:30:13,162 --> 00:30:14,563
I値l make sure

706
00:30:14,663 --> 00:30:16,065
the president knows of your fine work.

707
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:19,334
Like I care!

708
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,235
Canada?

709
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:23,472
Did you say Canada?

710
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:28,477
The American people,
Mr. Smiley...

711
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:30,979
would never, ever buy this.

712
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,382
Mr. President,
the American people

713
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:35,984
will buy whatever we tell them to.

714
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,253
You know that.

715
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:41,857
Aren't you overlooking one major obstacle,

716
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:43,759
like how to get the average American

717
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,245
to hate and fear Canadians?

718
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,896
Hell, they're whiter than we are.

719
00:30:47,996 --> 00:30:50,999
Gentlemen, ladies,
allow me to clue you

720
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:53,502
to a few rude awakenings.

721
00:30:53,502 --> 00:30:56,905
For those that think Canada
is a mom-and-pop operation,

722
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,408
it's time to wake up and smell the snow.

723
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:01,510
Fact: Canada痴 now

724
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,513
the second-largest country in the world.

725
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:06,915
Fact: Canadians freely cross over our borders,

726
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,417
walking among us...

727
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:11,520
undetected.

728
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,522
How many of you knew

729
00:31:13,522 --> 00:31:15,040
that they eliminated the Miss Canada contest?

730
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,776
You're on to something here.

731
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:21,180
Remember the air force c-130
that crashed mysteriously

732
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,681
a few years ago?

733
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:25,284
And that just happened to occur

734
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,786
over Canada,
Mr. President.

735
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:30,289
My god.
That's shocking.

736
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,191
When did they get rid of Miss Canada?

737
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,409
A year ago.

738
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,913
Suppose something like that caught on down here.

739
00:31:37,913 --> 00:31:38,814
One week,
Mr. President.

740
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:40,916
Give me one week,

741
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:43,819
and I値l have Americans
Burning maple leaves so fast,

742
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,321
they won't have time to think
about their smog-filled lungs,

743
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:47,823
rising interest rates,

744
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:50,443
or their dwindling savings accounts.

745
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,431
One week, sir.

746
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:09,344
Good evening.

747
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:12,447
Edwin S. Simon reporting.

748
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:15,450
NBS news has obtained Pentagon documents

749
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,853
that show our neighbor to the north,

750
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:19,855
the sovereign nation of Canada,

751
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:21,857
has embarked on a military program

752
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:24,843
aimed at the United States.

753
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:28,714
Canada, known for ages as
a polite and clean country,

754
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:30,954
has, under a socialist majority,

755
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,252
undertaken a massive military buildup

756
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,621
on its border with the United States.

757
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,122
I don't like Canada.

758
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,358
It's freezing cold.

759
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,260
Canada owns more of the US

760
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,732
than any other country.

761
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,133
William Shatner.

762
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,635
Michael J. Fox.

763
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,735
Monty Hall.

764
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,138
Mike Myers.

765
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,240
Alex Trebek.

766
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,642
All of them Canadians.

767
00:32:56,742 --> 00:33:02,497
All of them here.

768
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:04,900
Is Canadian prime minister Clark MacDonald

769
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,252
a member of a satanic cult?

770
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:10,756
Most of Canada's vast military technology

771
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:15,260
has been built and supplied
by the United States.

772
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,990
The Canadian national tower in Toronto,

773
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,666
erected to transmit nuclear attack warnings

774
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,668
from radar stations in northern Canada,

775
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:26,271
is now solely in Canadian hands.

776
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,174
It is the height of 6 American football fields,

777
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,777
Or 5 Canadian football fields--

778
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:34,680
as if Canadian football really counts.

779
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,783
What would be the psychological motivation

780
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:42,287
to erect a huge,
long, rigid shaft?

781
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,073
First, there is no Canadian culture.

782
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:48,677
I致e never read any Canadian literature.

783
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:50,579
And when have you heard anyone say,

784
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,319
'Honey, let's stay in and
order some Canadian food'?

785
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:57,452
Congress is also asking intelligence agencies

786
00:33:57,552 --> 00:34:01,056
to investigate why the Canadians maintain

787
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:04,059
a threatening lead in Zamboni technology.

788
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,561
Think of your children

789
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:09,221
pledging allegiance to the maple leaf.

790
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,067
Mayonnaise on everything.

791
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:16,071
Winter-- 11 months of the year.

792
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:18,071
Anne Murray...

793
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:19,474
All day...

794
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:23,962
Every day.

795
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:27,833
Holy shit.

796
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,835
We're right on the border.

797
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:32,721
We're the first line of defense.

798
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:35,101
We have to get everyone organized.

799
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,125
All right, people!
Do not panic!

800
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:39,225
I repeat, do not panic!

801
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:40,746
I知 in complete control.

802
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,248
Now, Honey, Kabral,
Roy boy, and myself--

803
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,851
we'll guard the hydro plant.

804
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:48,854
Snake, you guard Ed's gun shop.

805
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,255
Dell, the bowling alley.

806
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,357
The rest of you,

807
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:56,361
guard this bar with your lives.

808
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,763
Yeah.

809
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:02,367
All right, people.

810
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,619
Let's move out.

811
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,624
Fighting soldiers from the sky

812
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:11,626
fearless men

813
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:14,379
Who jump and die

814
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:17,382
Men who mean

815
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:20,519
just what they say

816
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,021
The brave men

817
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:26,274
of the green beret

818
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,894
Silver wings

819
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:31,897
upon their chest

820
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,399
These are men

821
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:37,152
America's best

822
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:40,155
100 men

823
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:43,158
will test today

824
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:46,161
but only 3

825
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:48,914
win the green beret

826
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,666
Put silver wings

827
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,803
on my son's chest

828
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:57,556
Make him one

829
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:00,058
of America's best

830
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,428
He'll be a man

831
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:06,064
they'll test one day

832
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,067
Have him win

833
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:15,607
the green beret

834
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,008
Now, who would've thought--

835
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:20,612
America against the scary Canadians.

836
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,614
Heh heh heh.

837
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,015
Boy, I知 good.

838
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,619
I知 going to let you in on a little secret.

839
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,121
Mmm!

840
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,121
Mmm...christ.

841
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,032
The American public's attention span

842
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,034
is about as long as your dick.

843
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,536
You have got to give Americans

844
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,638
something real.

845
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,039
Something they can get their teeth into,

846
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:48,499
something that

847
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:49,040
will make them cry

848
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,643
'Bloody murder!'

849
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:52,308
Americans

850
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:53,545
will not go to war,

851
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:55,647
even a cold war,

852
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,649
unless they truly believe

853
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:02,153
that their very lives are threatened.

854
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,688
What do you have in mind?

855
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,291
Back in the early 1960s,

856
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,294
my old buddy Lyndon Johnson says,

857
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,197
'Boys, why don't we just
bomb one of our own ships

858
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,199
'and blame it on the north Vietnamese?'

859
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:17,802
We did. We shelled a US Navy ship

860
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,571
in the gulf of Tonkin.

861
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:20,930
At least, that's

862
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,030
what we told everybody

863
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,576
as far as I know,
that damn boat

864
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:29,180
was out in the middle of lake Erie. But...

865
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,180
24 hours later

866
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,686
the US Senate voted 98 to 2

867
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:38,690
to send troops to Vietnam.

868
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,591
That's an amazing story.

869
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,193
That's the truth,

870
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:48,700
and it can still work.

871
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,700
Like maple syrup,

872
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:55,206
Canada's evil oozes over the United States.

873
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,710
How long will we remain silent to the screams?

874
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,210
Oh, that is stunning.

875
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,114
Everyone knows what it's like

876
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,116
to get syrup on your fingers.

877
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,719
This guy's ingenious.
I mean--

878
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,620
Mr. President,
Canadian prime minister!

879
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,223
Ha ha ha!

880
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,223
Clark?

881
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,227
How's Claire?

882
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,130
You were just watching on NBS, really?

883
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,131
I don't know what to think.

884
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:20,682
Looks

885
00:38:20,782 --> 00:38:21,633
like you people

886
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,985
are planning something nasty.

887
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:25,387
Mmm mmm mmm.

888
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:26,888
Ha ha. What?

889
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:31,626
If you feel that way about it, goodbye.

890
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:34,379
I like this.

891
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,780
I think now may be the time

892
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,148
to turn up the heat.

893
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,250
What do you mean?

894
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,152
Well, what if--I知 just spitballing here--

895
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,654
That's ok.
Go ahead.

896
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,156
A Canadian hit squad,
i.e., trained professionals,

897
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,258
who looked like Canadians,

898
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,661
were photographed sabotaging
an important installation

899
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,763
inside the US.

900
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,665
Let's go there with a strike force,

901
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,166
knock out their infrastructure

902
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,168
quicker than you can say,
'collateral damage.'

903
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,670
No.
No.

904
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,171
Why not?
Yeah, why not?

905
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,274
A war with Canada would be over in days.

906
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,676
Remember Grenada?

907
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:05,677
They didn't even wake Reagan up.

908
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:07,777
Didn't have to.

909
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:11,282
All we found were rich
American med school rejects

910
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:12,684
and a couple of Cuban construction workers.

911
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,185
That's liberal bullshit.

912
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,186
Cuba had a division in there.

913
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,288
What about Panama?

914
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,690
Right. Listen to this.

915
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,504
A few days

916
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:20,191
of blasting

917
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,193
Def Leppard over loudspeakers,

918
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,293
And Noriega ran out weeping.

919
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,196
And Iraqha!

920
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,698
Ha.

921
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:29,451
They were supposed to have this big, bad army.

922
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:30,952
They had the biggest cannon,

923
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,052
invented by a Canadian.

924
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:34,456
72 hours after we invade,

925
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:35,957
they're begging for a big mac.

926
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:36,958
They stopped

927
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:37,959
a hundred miles short of Baghdad.

928
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:39,461
We just sat there

929
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:42,564
waving our dicks at the desert.

930
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,966
Mr. President, do you want more of that,

931
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:48,069
or 50 years of cold war prosperity

932
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,972
because Joe Schmoe American is scared shitless

933
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:57,078
the world's going to end
before the next commercial?

934
00:39:57,579 --> 00:39:59,481
Well, I think I like Mr. Smiley's approach.

935
00:39:59,581 --> 00:40:02,083
No, no.
I really like it.

936
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:03,985
Here's what we're going to do.

937
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:06,085
We'll get some special ops.

938
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,989
We'll disguise them as Canadians

939
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:09,491
and let them blow something up.

940
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:11,591
But nothing valuable, ok?

941
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:12,994
No casualties, all right?

942
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:14,496
There will be no casualties,

943
00:40:14,596 --> 00:40:16,596
and Canada gets the blame.

944
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,865
Come on.
Step on the gas!

945
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,266
Double time.
Double time.

946
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,366
We're just minutes away

947
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,771
from blowing this hydro plant to kingdom come.

948
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,871
Ha! I知 back!

949
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:06,781
You got them down there?

950
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:09,050
Wait till those s.o.b.s back at Langley

951
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,654
see this on the nightly news.

952
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:14,656
Freeze! The both of you!

953
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:17,792
Don't move.
Don't anybody move.

954
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:18,693
Honey, Canadians on the east wing.

955
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:20,195
Bring the boys, quick!

956
00:41:20,295 --> 00:41:21,196
Who the hell are you?

957
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:23,298
Who the hell are you?

958
00:41:23,298 --> 00:41:25,300
Get out! Go on!

959
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,701
Look what we found!

960
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,702
Get your hands up there.

961
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,804
Come on! Hey, spread 'em!

962
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,806
Come on.
Let's go! M!

963
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:34,209
Under the articles of the
fifth Geneva convention,

964
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,211
and with the powers invested in me by--

965
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:38,713
Would you please shut up?
We're American!

966
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:40,813
Who plays quarterback

967
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:41,716
for the St. Louis Cardinals?

968
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,818
I have no idea.

969
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,220
There ain't no more St. Louis Cardinals!

970
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,572
They moved to Phoenix!

971
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,474
Wait. Give us another one.

972
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,475
Sorry. Time's up!

973
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,578
Cuff 'em!
Frisk these Canucks!

974
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:54,979
Then call the CIA,

975
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,082
the FBI, the D.A.,
and the A.S.P.C.A.,

976
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,984
and call Channel 5.

977
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:04,589
You're going to be on TV.

978
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,991
The nation remains stunned today

979
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,994
after the capture of secret Canadian agents

980
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,497
who were attempting to blow
up the hydroelectric plant

981
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:15,099
in Niagara Falls, New York.

982
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:16,501
The Canadians were apprehended

983
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,103
by Niagara sheriff,
Bud B. Boomer.

984
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,004
Move! Move! Move!

985
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,106
Right.

986
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,508
Our correspondent,
Charles Jackal,

987
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:25,009
Who is rejoining us

988
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:27,011
after a stint at the Betty Ford clinic,

989
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,113
kicks off our team coverage.

990
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,367
Chuck, it's great to have you back.

991
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:35,370
And it's great to be back.

992
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,372
I want to apologize

993
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:38,273
for the hurt I may have caused that night

994
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:40,875
to so many of you,

995
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,277
especially those who were standing

996
00:42:42,377 --> 00:42:45,380
too close to the curb.

997
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,882
You know who you are.

998
00:42:47,882 --> 00:42:51,886
Forgive me.

999
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:53,655
Ed, it's a startling revelation.

1000
00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:55,657
Canada, getting ready to invade,

1001
00:42:55,757 --> 00:42:58,259
has amassed 90%
of its population

1002
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:00,411
along its border with the United States--

1003
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,414
The longest unprotected border in the world,

1004
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,916
stretching from the Atlantic ocean

1005
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:10,655
to that other one.

1006
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,056
You'll be pleased to know, sir,

1007
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,659
that the Hacker Hellstorm

1008
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:17,562
was delivered to and installed
in Toronto yesterday.

1009
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:19,063
Good work.

1010
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,163
Good work, boy.

1011
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,567
When I found you,

1012
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,669
I said to myself,

1013
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,571
'I can make something

1014
00:43:26,671 --> 00:43:28,072
'out of that sniveling little sneak.'

1015
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,925
Yes, sir.

1016
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:35,930
Sir, what exactly is the Hacker Hellstorm?

1017
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,051
I知 just curious since I sold it and all.

1018
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:43,054
Well, that's fair enough, Stu.

1019
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,457
The Hacker hellstorm is a devastating weapon,

1020
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,559
a destabilizing weapon.

1021
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,062
And it is capable

1022
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,463
of launching all the missiles

1023
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:53,965
in the United States

1024
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:55,350
at once.

1025
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,851
Really?

1026
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,954
But the Canadians will never, ever use it.

1027
00:43:59,954 --> 00:44:01,956
How can you be so sure?

1028
00:44:01,956 --> 00:44:05,960
Because I didn't give them the operating codes.

1029
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:07,362
Really?

1030
00:44:07,462 --> 00:44:09,364
They think it gives them an edge

1031
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:12,967
on high-tech weather forecasting.

1032
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:14,369
Uh-huh.

1033
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:21,092
So the Hellstorm is harmless, yes?

1034
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,094
Ah, Stuey.

1035
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:27,515
Ha ha ha!

1036
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:29,515
Honey!

1037
00:44:37,525 --> 00:44:42,530
Honey!

1038
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:46,534
What the...

1039
00:44:46,534 --> 00:44:50,038
Holy shit.

1040
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:52,038
What the hell?

1041
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:58,079
Honey?

1042
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:00,932
Shh!

1043
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,434
Kabral...

1044
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,336
What does this look like to you?

1045
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,838
Got me.

1046
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,207
I never saw a white one that size.

1047
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:12,310
It's the Canadian national tower.

1048
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:12,985
Maybe I better

1049
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:13,711
carry the guns.

1050
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,213
Where we going?

1051
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,714
Boomer's got a special mission for us.

1052
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,216
Says Canadians are too clean

1053
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:19,217
for their own good.

1054
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,218
We're crossing over.

1055
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,320
To Canada?

1056
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,322
Yep. We're going in tonight

1057
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,042
to kick

1058
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:26,724
some Canadian butt.

1059
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,824
Can we go to the tower?

1060
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,826
No. I don't think so.

1061
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:39,524
Cut the engine.
It's making too much noise.

1062
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:42,490
What did you say?

1063
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,093
We have to be very quiet.

1064
00:45:45,093 --> 00:45:46,995
We're all going to have to paddle.

1065
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:49,095
Get those oars in the water.

1066
00:45:49,097 --> 00:45:51,232
Go on. Put your back into it.

1067
00:45:51,232 --> 00:45:56,487
Nice and easy. There you go.

1068
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,217
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Canada.

1069
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:12,870
This'll drive them crazy!

1070
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:16,370
There is no more heinous
crime than this in Canada.

1071
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,775
Are you sure we're in Canada?

1072
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,277
Do you smell anything?

1073
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:22,233
No.
Exactly.

1074
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:24,032
Canada!

1075
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:25,533
Hey, those look like my socks.

1076
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:26,534
That isn't garbage!

1077
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:28,036
That's my laundry.

1078
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:29,537
Roy boy, you idiot!

1079
00:46:29,637 --> 00:46:31,639
Pick this up!

1080
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:32,391
You stupid jerk,

1081
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:33,291
what are you doing?

1082
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,393
My good stuff.

1083
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:35,771
Hello?

1084
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:36,678
Who goes there?

1085
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:38,179
Freeze!

1086
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:39,681
Johnny Canuck!

1087
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:42,283
Leave the park immediately

1088
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:43,434
and go back to where you came from.

1089
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,037
Scatter!

1090
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:49,907
Everybody back to the boat!

1091
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,809
Sir, you can't end your
sentence with a preposition.

1092
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:52,810
Oh, really?

1093
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:54,912
Ha ha ha!

1094
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,915
Whoo whoo whoo!

1095
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,418
Well, what would you say?

1096
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,320
Well, I guess I'd say either,

1097
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,322
'Go back from where you came,'

1098
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:05,823
or the preferred Queen's English,

1099
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,926
'Go back, thee,
from whence thou came.'

1100
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,928
Hee hee hee!

1101
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:14,432
Oh, man,
that was close.

1102
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:19,937
We were staring death right in its face!

1103
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,937
So, uh,
where's, uh, Honey?

1104
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,951
Oh, man,
we forgot Honey!

1105
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,353
I left Honey behind!

1106
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,455
We left a man behind.

1107
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,457
Boomer left a man behind!

1108
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,859
The marines never leave a man behind.

1109
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,861
Chuck Norris never left a man behind.

1110
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,364
Wesley Snipes never leaves a man behind!

1111
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:47,865
She's all alone behind enemy lines.

1112
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,967
I got to think!

1113
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:51,869
She's going to be fine.

1114
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,069
She's a survivor.
She's strong!

1115
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,460
Hope she doesn't kill anybody.

1116
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,520
We interrupt our regularly-scheduled program

1117
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:14,625
and go live to the president
of the United States.

1118
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:18,029
We have just learned that
the Canadian government

1119
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:21,132
is holding an American citizen hostage.

1120
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,533
I have communicated

1121
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,136
with the Canadian prime minister

1122
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:29,006
our demand that this hostage, this woman,

1123
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,509
uh, hostage Honey,

1124
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:35,012
must be released now!

1125
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,414
Oh, my god. Honey!

1126
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,514
To facilitate this,

1127
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:43,521
I've ordered our armed forces on alert,

1128
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:46,524
and I've ordered them to prepare to engage

1129
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:51,028
in operation Canadian Bacon.

1130
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,432
And I want to say to prime minister MacDonald,

1131
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:57,034
'Surrender her pronto,

1132
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:01,539
'or we'll level Toronto.'

1133
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:02,940
God bless America.

1134
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,442
God bless America.

1135
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:09,046
God bless you,
Mr. President.

1136
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,549
Oh, Honey.

1137
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:16,053
And, Honey,
I miss you

1138
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:21,559
and I'm bein' good

1139
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:26,564
and I'd love to be with you

1140
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:30,067
if only I could

1141
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,069
This just got in.

1142
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:36,073
We have received amateur
videotape of hostage Honey.

1143
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,475
Roy boy, Kabral, quick!

1144
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:38,976
Huh?
Honey!

1145
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:39,977
Boomer!

1146
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,080
Traitor!
You Benedict Arnold!

1147
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,615
You took off and left me here...

1148
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,718
Oh, she's pissed.

1149
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,120
You think?

1150
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,121
I'll rip out every bone in your body!

1151
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,873
She's mad at you,
Boomer.

1152
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:53,491
Boomer, you hear me?

1153
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:55,993
She is being held at mountie headquarters

1154
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,596
in Niagara Falls,
Canada.

1155
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:01,186
Sources in the intelligence community

1156
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,001
speculate that Canada may be preparing

1157
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,104
to terminate her,

1158
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,006
which would certainly be in keeping

1159
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,008
with what we know about the Canadians.

1160
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,510
Terminate?

1161
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,112
This is no less than an act of war.

1162
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:18,115
There's a time to think and a time to act,

1163
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:24,121
and this, gentlemen,
is no time to think.

1164
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,524
We'll have one more round,
and then we'll go.

1165
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,025
Chester!

1166
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,026
Another round.

1167
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,629
Same thing.

1168
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,030
Gives Honey a chance to cool off a little bit.

1169
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,132
Yeah,
we know.

1170
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,132
Yeah.

1171
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:06,380
Come on.
Out of the way.

1172
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,782
There's not a locked door in the whole country.

1173
00:51:07,882 --> 00:51:09,882
Let's go!

1174
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:33,674
I don't want to have to drop first blood,

1175
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:34,809
but I will if I have to!

1176
00:51:34,909 --> 00:51:36,911
I mean it, I'll hurt you.

1177
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:37,812
Everybody down on the ground,

1178
00:51:37,912 --> 00:51:39,914
and no one will be hurt!

1179
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:42,666
The elk, the beaver, and the moose

1180
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,169
are man's best friends.

1181
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,171
All right, pops,

1182
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:50,291
who's in charge?

1183
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:52,576
Uh, just the two of us,
just Ruthie and me.

1184
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,195
No other personnel in the whole building?

1185
00:51:54,295 --> 00:51:56,680
No. We're the night shift.

1186
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,682
Excuse me, ma'am,

1187
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,334
there's not another control room?

1188
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:02,203
No, dear, this is it.

1189
00:52:02,303 --> 00:52:04,303
Thank you.

1190
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:05,336
Um, Boomer, maybe

1191
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:06,707
we better just go, huh?

1192
00:52:06,807 --> 00:52:08,209
Stand your ground, soldier!

1193
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:10,309
Oh, brother.

1194
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:12,813
Now, let me get this straight.

1195
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:16,317
You're telling me that you two are responsible

1196
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:17,218
for supplying all the electricity

1197
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:19,570
to your entire nation?

1198
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,971
That's about the size of it.

1199
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:23,574
Oh, dad.
Tsk tsk tsk.

1200
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,359
Does he ever like to brag.

1201
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:27,459
Heh heh heh.

1202
00:52:27,828 --> 00:52:29,230
Put those needles down,
nice and easy,

1203
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,981
where I can see them.

1204
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,483
Spread out!

1205
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,984
Find the power source

1206
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:36,114
for the mountie headquarters.

1207
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:44,094
I'm going to ask you one more time.

1208
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:47,097
Where is the power switch

1209
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:49,884
to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police headquarters?

1210
00:52:49,984 --> 00:52:52,386
You're going to tell me sooner or later.

1211
00:52:52,486 --> 00:52:54,989
Now, we can do it my way,

1212
00:52:54,989 --> 00:52:56,891
which is very nice right now,

1213
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:58,993
or we can do it their way,

1214
00:52:59,493 --> 00:53:01,663
which you're not going to like.

1215
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:16,877
Heh heh heh.

1216
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:20,881
You Canadians are so sneaky.

1217
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:22,283
Don't touch that.

1218
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:24,635
You'll black out most of Canada!

1219
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,036
Ha ha ha!

1220
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,538
Yeah, right.

1221
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:29,640
What do we look like, jerks?

1222
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,642
Please!

1223
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,043
You screwed up now.

1224
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,593
I'll be the judge of that!

1225
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,288
All right. Let's move out.

1226
00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:46,190
And you, don't tell anybody we was here.

1227
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,292
Come on!

1228
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,412
Ow!

1229
00:53:51,412 --> 00:53:53,914
You know, I could get to like this.

1230
00:53:53,914 --> 00:53:59,803
Really?

1231
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,806
On these screens here, Mr. President.

1232
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:04,208
What is this?
What's happening?

1233
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:04,981
All of Canada

1234
00:54:05,081 --> 00:54:05,960
is going dark, sir.

1235
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,562
What do you make of this?

1236
00:54:08,562 --> 00:54:10,965
I'll tell you,
but you'll dislike it.

1237
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:11,966
Mr. President,
prime minister MacDonald,

1238
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:12,967
calling from Ottawa.

1239
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:16,070
Yes--

1240
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:20,074
Clark, hi.

1241
00:54:20,074 --> 00:54:23,577
Now, why would we want to cut off your power?

1242
00:54:23,577 --> 00:54:25,579
No. What--calm down.

1243
00:54:25,579 --> 00:54:28,082
Calm--

1244
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,483
No. If we were up to something,

1245
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:30,985
we would have mined your harbors.

1246
00:54:31,085 --> 00:54:33,087
Damn right.

1247
00:54:33,087 --> 00:54:33,988
What?

1248
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:38,092
Who?

1249
00:54:38,092 --> 00:54:40,594
Yeah, I see. Yeah.

1250
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:42,496
We'll check this out,
and we'll get back to you.

1251
00:54:42,596 --> 00:54:43,998
Goodbye!

1252
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:46,000
You're not going to believe this.

1253
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,502
That same goddamned sheriff from Niagara Falls,

1254
00:54:48,602 --> 00:54:51,605
that--that--that hero...

1255
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:54,108
Bud Boomer...

1256
00:54:54,108 --> 00:54:55,876
he's the one responsible for the blackout.

1257
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:58,479
Boomer. Oh, sir.
That's bullshit!

1258
00:54:58,479 --> 00:55:00,981
This is a Canadian trick.

1259
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:01,631
Blame us,

1260
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,883
get world sympathy

1261
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:03,884
and make it impossible

1262
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:04,885
for our night-attack bombers

1263
00:55:04,985 --> 00:55:06,387
to locate their cities

1264
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:07,388
and destroy their inhabitants.

1265
00:55:07,488 --> 00:55:08,889
God, sir,

1266
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:11,509
that's the oldest trick in the book!

1267
00:55:22,247 --> 00:55:26,751
'Thank you for sleeping so quietly.

1268
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:31,256
'I love you...

1269
00:55:31,256 --> 00:55:37,512
'even though you're a criminal.

1270
00:55:38,012 --> 00:55:42,016
'Thank you for keeping your cell clean.

1271
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:43,284
'I...

1272
00:55:43,384 --> 00:55:49,023
'miss you.'

1273
00:55:49,023 --> 00:55:50,792
Welcome to Canada.

1274
00:55:50,892 --> 00:55:53,528
Hold it right there,
Canuck.

1275
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:56,147
Who are you?

1276
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:58,149
I'm your worst nightmare.

1277
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,551
I'm a citizen

1278
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:01,436
with a constitutional right to bear arms.

1279
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:03,538
Heh heh heh!

1280
00:56:03,538 --> 00:56:05,440
Take the pelts.
Take whatever you want.

1281
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,042
We don't want your stinking pelts.

1282
00:56:08,543 --> 00:56:10,562
Have some fudge.
Just leave me alone.

1283
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:12,063
Didn't you hear him?

1284
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:15,166
We're your worst nightmare.

1285
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:17,166
My worst nightmare

1286
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:20,171
involved a pack of rabid wolves.

1287
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:22,807
I was stuck somewhere in the Yukon,

1288
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:25,310
and there were tall,
skinny rabbits,

1289
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,480
and they were drinking heavily.

1290
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:30,682
Just shut up!

1291
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:33,184
We want your prisoner.
Where is she?

1292
00:56:33,184 --> 00:56:35,720
I don't know what you're talking aboot, eh.

1293
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,822
'Aboot?' it's 'about!'

1294
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:39,822
What we're talking about!

1295
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:40,387
And enough of

1296
00:56:40,487 --> 00:56:41,226
that 'eh' business.

1297
00:56:41,326 --> 00:56:43,828
Learn to talk right,
understand?

1298
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:46,231
We got ways of making you
pronounce the letter 'o.'

1299
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:48,333
I want my Honey!

1300
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,734
Now, get the keys for the cells now.

1301
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:50,985
Now!

1302
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:52,353
Easy.

1303
00:56:52,453 --> 00:56:54,455
Easy.

1304
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:56,958
O.k., Mr. Canuck,

1305
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,860
Mr. two-time world series winner.

1306
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,463
Hey, watch that fancy move!

1307
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,053
See, this is all the prisoners we have.

1308
00:57:05,466 --> 00:57:07,466
This man was arrested

1309
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:10,371
for putting regular gas into an unleaded tank.

1310
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:12,373
Where do you think you're going?

1311
00:57:12,473 --> 00:57:14,876
I'm going over to show you the next guy.

1312
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:17,478
Easy. One step at a time.

1313
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:18,880
This man was arrested

1314
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,134
for being in

1315
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:24,235
too many bad moods.

1316
00:57:24,235 --> 00:57:25,136
I got you covered.

1317
00:57:25,236 --> 00:57:26,137
I got you covered.

1318
00:57:26,237 --> 00:57:28,239
I got you covered, buddy.

1319
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:30,241
This man raided a company,

1320
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:32,143
merged it with his conglomerate,

1321
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:34,145
and then fired all the employees.

1322
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:35,647
Get away from the bars, you scum!

1323
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:36,648
Boomer!

1324
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:39,751
Hold on, Jack.

1325
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:42,153
Now, you tell us where Honey is.

1326
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:43,154
Let me paint a picture

1327
00:57:43,254 --> 00:57:44,656
for you, buddy.

1328
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:47,258
She's petite,
extremely beautiful,

1329
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:50,261
and heavily armed.

1330
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:52,163
Wait. You mean the litterbug.

1331
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:54,265
They took her to the capital

1332
00:57:54,265 --> 00:57:57,302
to give her a free mental health examination.

1333
00:57:57,402 --> 00:57:59,904
Good. The capital, Toronto.

1334
00:57:59,904 --> 00:58:03,908
No. The capital of Canada is Ottawa.

1335
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:05,910
Ha ha ha!

1336
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:08,913
Yeah, right.

1337
00:58:08,913 --> 00:58:10,315
Do we look that stupid?

1338
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:12,417
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1339
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:14,319
Ha ha ha!

1340
00:58:14,419 --> 00:58:15,820
Ottawa!

1341
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,821
Ha ha ha!

1342
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:18,690
Nice try, Dudley.

1343
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,191
All right, boys!

1344
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,293
We're going to Toronto...

1345
00:58:22,293 --> 00:58:23,695
Ha ha ha!

1346
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:25,795
The capital.

1347
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:34,689
Do you want some water?

1348
00:58:34,689 --> 00:58:35,590
Mm-hmm.

1349
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,091
Mm-hmm.

1350
00:58:37,191 --> 00:58:39,310
Too bad.

1351
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:42,814
Gentlemen...

1352
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:44,365
Let's, uh,

1353
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:45,717
take the truck.

1354
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:47,218
Ha ha ha!

1355
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,219
Ha ha ha!

1356
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:51,823
Let's go!

1357
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:54,826
Hey, Boomer?

1358
00:58:54,826 --> 00:58:56,826
Yeah? What's wrong?

1359
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,330
I got an idea.

1360
00:58:59,831 --> 00:59:00,732
Oh, yeah.

1361
00:59:00,832 --> 00:59:02,650
Oh, yeah.

1362
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:04,152
Mr. President,

1363
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:05,653
I think we should look on the positive side.

1364
00:59:05,753 --> 00:59:07,753
What we have

1365
00:59:07,755 --> 00:59:09,657
is a brave but misguided group of Americans

1366
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:11,757
who've gone into Canada

1367
00:59:11,759 --> 00:59:13,161
and kicked some serious Canadian butt.

1368
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:14,162
Well, we've got to do something.

1369
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:23,404
We could send in the omega force.

1370
00:59:23,905 --> 00:59:27,408
Isn't that a bit drastic?

1371
00:59:27,408 --> 00:59:31,913
Sir, the helms amendment and nsc order 725

1372
00:59:32,413 --> 00:59:33,815
both specifically prohibit

1373
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:35,817
the use of omega force against Caucasians.

1374
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:38,035
That's right.

1375
00:59:38,536 --> 00:59:41,439
I guess if I were the
president's male secretary,

1376
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:44,792
I might read the helms amendment that way.

1377
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:47,044
What choice do we have, sir?

1378
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:50,448
We have to take this sheriff out immediately

1379
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:52,450
before this turns into a shooting war

1380
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:56,053
instead of the cold war that we wanted.

1381
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:57,455
Mr. President...

1382
00:59:57,555 --> 00:59:58,956
Hey! Hey!

1383
00:59:59,056 --> 01:00:02,059
Sheriff Boomer has become a national idol

1384
01:00:02,059 --> 01:00:04,962
at a time when our people lack true heroes,

1385
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:07,062
yourself excluded, sir.

1386
01:00:07,064 --> 01:00:09,350
It would seem wise not to lose him.

1387
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:13,454
General, the president should see this, sir.

1388
01:00:13,454 --> 01:00:15,857
Enraged by the imprisonment of hostage Honey,

1389
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:18,476
and inspired by their hero Bud Boomer,

1390
01:00:18,576 --> 01:00:21,329
US Citizens from coast to coast

1391
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:23,731
are taking actions against
Americans of Canadian birth

1392
01:00:23,831 --> 01:00:26,834
and suspected Canadian sympathizers.

1393
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:28,870
Some Americans in other border towns

1394
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,770
have followed sheriff Boomer into Canada

1395
01:00:32,223 --> 01:00:35,843
with the hope of liberating that country.

1396
01:00:35,843 --> 01:00:37,245
Everything I see

1397
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:38,279
or read about

1398
01:00:38,379 --> 01:00:39,247
these Canadians

1399
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:41,349
just makes me want to puke!

1400
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:42,250
USA, USA

1401
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:45,253
It's time we put America back in north America.

1402
01:00:45,353 --> 01:00:47,855
God bless Bud Boomer!

1403
01:00:47,855 --> 01:00:49,855
USA, USA

1404
01:00:49,857 --> 01:00:51,859
Oh...christ.

1405
01:00:51,859 --> 01:00:55,363
Mr. President, I believe we have no choice

1406
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:58,366
but to remove Bud Boomer judiciously...

1407
01:00:58,366 --> 01:01:01,869
Ah...

1408
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:06,757
Now.

1409
01:01:06,757 --> 01:01:12,263
Well, it's an idea.

1410
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:14,265
Send in omega force!

1411
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:40,839
Spread your tiny wings and fly away...

1412
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:48,047
Go fish.

1413
01:01:56,674 --> 01:01:58,676
Welcome to Canada.

1414
01:01:58,676 --> 01:01:59,577
Who are you?

1415
01:01:59,677 --> 01:02:01,078
Uhh!

1416
01:02:01,178 --> 01:02:03,180
Uhh!

1417
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:08,436
That was totally unnecessary.

1418
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:10,936
Where is Boomer?

1419
01:02:10,938 --> 01:02:13,441
I had an amazing hand.

1420
01:02:13,441 --> 01:02:16,944
Where is he?

1421
01:02:16,944 --> 01:02:18,944
Toronto.

1422
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:29,590
We're coming, Honey.
We're coming.

1423
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:35,096
Hey, Boomer, how come you
never let me drive, man?

1424
01:02:35,096 --> 01:02:36,998
Just don't--don't start with me, all right?

1425
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:39,478
The black cat never gets to drive.

1426
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,002
It's not because you're black.

1427
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:41,771
Lots of black guys

1428
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:42,503
drive all the time.

1429
01:02:42,603 --> 01:02:44,605
For example.

1430
01:02:44,605 --> 01:02:46,007
What's his name?
Danny Glover

1431
01:02:46,107 --> 01:02:48,009
In driving Miss...
What's her name?

1432
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:50,011
Danny Glover didn't drive Miss Daisy.

1433
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,613
He drove Mel Gibson.

1434
01:02:52,613 --> 01:02:54,015
He didn't drive Mel Gibson.

1435
01:02:54,115 --> 01:02:56,017
That's Eddie Murphy drives Mel Gibson.

1436
01:02:56,117 --> 01:02:57,518
Eddie Murphy drives Nick Nolte.

1437
01:02:57,618 --> 01:02:59,020
He does not.

1438
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,373
Hey, guys,
I drove once.

1439
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,026
Oh, jeez.

1440
01:03:05,126 --> 01:03:06,527
Oh, jeez.

1441
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:08,629
Oh, jeez.

1442
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:10,629
Maybe it's not us.

1443
01:03:10,998 --> 01:03:12,033
It's not us.

1444
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:13,034
Pull over!

1445
01:03:13,134 --> 01:03:14,652
Pull over!

1446
01:03:14,752 --> 01:03:17,755
It's us. He wants us.
All right.

1447
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:24,261
We're pulling over.

1448
01:03:24,261 --> 01:03:26,163
All right, fellas.
Just act normal,

1449
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:28,048
all right?

1450
01:03:28,148 --> 01:03:29,667
Act normal,

1451
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:30,668
not normal for us.

1452
01:03:30,768 --> 01:03:31,488
Normal for

1453
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,588
regular people.

1454
01:03:37,775 --> 01:03:38,676
Good day.

1455
01:03:38,776 --> 01:03:40,778
Hi.

1456
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:43,931
May I see your license and registration, please?

1457
01:03:44,031 --> 01:03:44,682
There you go.

1458
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:46,784
Thank you.

1459
01:03:46,784 --> 01:03:48,786
Oh, Americans!

1460
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:50,571
Welcome to Ontario,
A sportsman's paradise.

1461
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:52,790
Isn't it, though?

1462
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:56,010
Please get out and step away from the vehicle.

1463
01:04:05,186 --> 01:04:07,188
O.k...

1464
01:04:07,188 --> 01:04:08,589
What is wrong with this picture?

1465
01:04:08,689 --> 01:04:10,091
Um...

1466
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:12,191
Uh...

1467
01:04:12,193 --> 01:04:12,593
No snow tires.

1468
01:04:12,693 --> 01:04:14,462
No.

1469
01:04:14,562 --> 01:04:15,685
I was driving on the

1470
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:16,964
wrong side of the road.

1471
01:04:17,064 --> 01:04:17,965
I can explain that.

1472
01:04:18,065 --> 01:04:19,600
I am not used to your rules up here.

1473
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,203
That's not it.

1474
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:24,855
This writing on the side of your vehicle.

1475
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:27,458
Oh! How did that get there?

1476
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,359
Those kids at the garage,

1477
01:04:28,459 --> 01:04:29,727
I just--

1478
01:04:29,827 --> 01:04:31,829
Whatever.

1479
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:33,230
My concern is the sensibilities

1480
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,732
of a certain distinct

1481
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:36,734
and viable part of Canadian society--

1482
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,235
Les Quebecois.

1483
01:04:38,335 --> 01:04:39,236
Huh?

1484
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:41,338
You know,
wine drinkers.

1485
01:04:41,338 --> 01:04:42,740
Pea-soup eaters.

1486
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,241
French Canadians.

1487
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:46,343
Oh, yeah.
Those guys. Sure.

1488
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:48,245
If you wish to avoid prosecution,

1489
01:04:48,345 --> 01:04:51,248
I'd advise that you comply
with our language laws,

1490
01:04:51,348 --> 01:04:54,351
which specifically prescribe

1491
01:04:54,351 --> 01:04:57,855
that all signs be in both English and French,

1492
01:04:58,355 --> 01:04:59,256
Canada's 2 official languages.

1493
01:04:59,356 --> 01:05:00,758
O.k.

1494
01:05:00,858 --> 01:05:02,860
I do have to fine you.

1495
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,261
That'll be $1,000 Canadian

1496
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:07,364
or $10 American if you'd prefer.

1497
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:10,868
Oh! No. I'll pay the American there. Yeah.

1498
01:05:10,868 --> 01:05:12,870
There you go, buddy.

1499
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,872
Here you are, $10.

1500
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:15,773
Thank you very much.
There's your receipt.

1501
01:05:15,873 --> 01:05:17,158
Thank you.

1502
01:05:17,258 --> 01:05:19,760
And now...

1503
01:05:21,762 --> 01:05:23,762
In French,
if you please.

1504
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:49,156
Dr. Wall, Dr. Wall,
please pick up line 5.

1505
01:05:49,657 --> 01:05:53,294
All doctors participating

1506
01:05:53,294 --> 01:05:56,197
in today's house calls,
please report to the lobby.

1507
01:05:56,297 --> 01:05:58,297
'Get well soon

1508
01:05:58,299 --> 01:06:00,201
'From prime minister Clark MacDonald.'

1509
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:02,820
Anyone in need of a free triple bypass,

1510
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,822
please sign the bonus slip in your room.

1511
01:06:04,922 --> 01:06:06,824
'Get well, get well,
feel good.'

1512
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:11,428
This is...

1513
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:13,931
'Best wishes,
Gordon Lightfoot.'

1514
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:16,934
Eww!

1515
01:06:16,934 --> 01:06:17,835
Ottawa!

1516
01:06:17,935 --> 01:06:21,572
Go, fifi!

1517
01:06:21,572 --> 01:06:22,215
So, we're up

1518
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:23,224
and around, are we?

1519
01:06:23,324 --> 01:06:26,193
And how are we feeling today?

1520
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:29,096
Aren't you two a little young to be doctors?

1521
01:06:29,196 --> 01:06:31,599
Oh, we're not doctors.
We're candy stripers.

1522
01:06:31,699 --> 01:06:32,600
Our universal health care system

1523
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,101
has determined

1524
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:35,102
that you don't actually need a doctor until...

1525
01:06:35,202 --> 01:06:37,705
2006.

1526
01:06:37,705 --> 01:06:39,707
Until then,
we're here to see

1527
01:06:39,707 --> 01:06:41,992
that you're comfortable and to give you, uh...

1528
01:06:42,092 --> 01:06:44,094
a kidney transplant.

1529
01:06:44,595 --> 01:06:46,714
No, that can't be right.

1530
01:06:46,714 --> 01:06:47,615
Check the paperwork.

1531
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:49,116
Ow!

1532
01:06:49,216 --> 01:06:50,618
Oh! Oh!

1533
01:06:50,718 --> 01:06:52,369
Oh, Douglas!

1534
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:53,871
Born

1535
01:06:53,971 --> 01:06:54,872
Born in the USA

1536
01:06:54,972 --> 01:06:56,373
I was

1537
01:06:56,473 --> 01:06:58,475
Born in the USA

1538
01:06:58,475 --> 01:06:59,877
I was

1539
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:02,479
Born in the USA

1540
01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:03,264
I was

1541
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:05,866
Born in the USA

1542
01:07:05,866 --> 01:07:07,268
I was

1543
01:07:07,368 --> 01:07:11,372
Born in the USA

1544
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:14,375
Born in the USA

1545
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:16,877
Dah, dah

1546
01:07:16,877 --> 01:07:18,877
Dah, dah, dah, USA?

1547
01:07:25,753 --> 01:07:27,755
If you catch a cold,

1548
01:07:27,755 --> 01:07:30,507
there's some aspirin in the cabinet.

1549
01:07:31,008 --> 01:07:35,348
And thanks for hanging on to my
American-made assault weapons.

1550
01:07:39,149 --> 01:07:41,051
Dr. Fred Einerschmidt to 2-b.

1551
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:42,169
Give me that.

1552
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:44,772
O...

1553
01:07:45,272 --> 01:07:46,173
- klahoma

1554
01:07:46,273 --> 01:07:48,776
O...

1555
01:07:48,776 --> 01:07:50,177
- klahoma

1556
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:51,679
O...

1557
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:52,680
- klahoma

1558
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,181
Hmm mm mm

1559
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:56,784
Dah dah dah dah dah

1560
01:07:56,784 --> 01:07:58,786
Oklahoma

1561
01:07:58,786 --> 01:08:00,788
Oklahoma

1562
01:08:00,788 --> 01:08:02,788
Oklahoma

1563
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:04,792
Okla...Oklahoma?

1564
01:08:21,308 --> 01:08:23,811
Hey, it's o.k.

1565
01:08:24,311 --> 01:08:26,311
It was just my toe.

1566
01:08:39,326 --> 01:08:43,330
All right.
That's enough, man.

1567
01:08:43,831 --> 01:08:46,233
You guys aren't thinking
about Honey at all, are you?

1568
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:48,335
I'm worried sick.

1569
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:50,335
Ever see the dirty dozen?

1570
01:08:50,337 --> 01:08:51,872
That was a cool movie.

1571
01:08:51,972 --> 01:08:53,240
Man, that was real cool.

1572
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,742
Lee Marvin...

1573
01:08:54,842 --> 01:08:55,743
Charles Bronson...

1574
01:08:55,843 --> 01:08:57,628
Ernest Borgnine.

1575
01:08:57,728 --> 01:08:59,730
Jim Brown.

1576
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:02,232
Uh, Telly Savalas,
Clint Walker.

1577
01:09:02,232 --> 01:09:03,250
Jim Brown.

1578
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,635
Trini Lopez!

1579
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:05,636
Cool.

1580
01:09:05,736 --> 01:09:08,639
Trini Lopez! Never could figure that one out.

1581
01:09:08,739 --> 01:09:10,641
What the hell was he doing in the dirty dozen?

1582
01:09:10,741 --> 01:09:12,142
If I was putting together

1583
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:14,144
a group of murderers and cutthroats,

1584
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:16,647
Trini Lopez would not be in the starting lineup.

1585
01:09:16,747 --> 01:09:18,015
That's why he dies first.

1586
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:18,766
Don't they all die?

1587
01:09:18,866 --> 01:09:20,267
No.

1588
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:21,518
Jim Brown dies.

1589
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:23,020
What do you expect?

1590
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:23,520
Of all the dirty dozen,

1591
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:25,022
this black guy's

1592
01:09:25,122 --> 01:09:26,523
supposed to sneak in behind enemy lines

1593
01:09:26,623 --> 01:09:29,126
and pretend he's a Kraut?

1594
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:31,028
That's not it, man.

1595
01:09:31,128 --> 01:09:34,131
It's just the black guy always dies.

1596
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:36,033
Think about it, man.
Unforgiven...

1597
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:37,534
Uh,
Alien...

1598
01:09:37,634 --> 01:09:38,535
Rocky IV...

1599
01:09:38,635 --> 01:09:39,536
The shining...

1600
01:09:39,636 --> 01:09:41,038
Star Trek II...

1601
01:09:41,138 --> 01:09:42,539
Forrest Gump..

1602
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:43,540
Witness...

1603
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,042
Annie Hall.

1604
01:09:45,142 --> 01:09:47,144
Not Annie Hall...

1605
01:09:47,144 --> 01:09:48,045
Night of the living dead.

1606
01:09:48,145 --> 01:09:50,647
That's the one!

1607
01:09:50,647 --> 01:09:52,549
And what about that brother in Jurassic Park?

1608
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:54,051
Oh, that was cool.

1609
01:09:54,151 --> 01:09:57,154
Two black guys died in that one. A twofer!

1610
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:59,556
You must be really pissed off at that one.

1611
01:09:59,656 --> 01:10:01,656
I'm telling you, man,

1612
01:10:01,658 --> 01:10:03,898
the black guy always dies first.

1613
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:16,173
Oh, aw, man.

1614
01:10:16,173 --> 01:10:17,074
Hey.

1615
01:10:17,174 --> 01:10:19,176
Don't worry,
Kabral.

1616
01:10:19,176 --> 01:10:21,176
You'll pass for Canadian.

1617
01:10:25,933 --> 01:10:27,933
You really do need help.

1618
01:10:27,935 --> 01:10:28,335
Oh, I need help?

1619
01:10:28,435 --> 01:10:30,437
Yeah.

1620
01:10:30,437 --> 01:10:32,840
Knock it off with this dirty dozen stuff.

1621
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,341
Did anyone see Dirty Dancing?

1622
01:10:34,441 --> 01:10:35,476
Whoo!

1623
01:10:35,576 --> 01:10:37,578
Ha ha ha ha!

1624
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:42,583
That was a good movie.

1625
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,352
Welcome to the Hacker Hellstorm,

1626
01:10:45,452 --> 01:10:49,957
Your one-stop program for
total nuclear destruction.

1627
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:56,463
Please enter your pin code now.

1628
01:10:56,463 --> 01:11:01,718
You have reached the Hellstorm
communications center.

1629
01:11:01,718 --> 01:11:04,121
Please choose your missile launch sites

1630
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:06,223
from your on-screen menu.

1631
01:11:13,363 --> 01:11:15,365
Establishing contact...

1632
01:11:15,365 --> 01:11:19,369
with all US launch sites.

1633
01:11:19,369 --> 01:11:21,371
American missiles...

1634
01:11:21,371 --> 01:11:26,126
now under the control of the Hacker Hellstorm.

1635
01:11:26,126 --> 01:11:30,747
Countdown ready to commence.

1636
01:11:30,747 --> 01:11:33,500
Hellstorm activated.

1637
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:36,003
Thank God for technology.

1638
01:11:36,003 --> 01:11:39,640
12 hours to launch.

1639
01:11:51,268 --> 01:11:52,669
Any word from omega force,

1640
01:11:52,769 --> 01:11:53,670
like where they are?

1641
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,770
Hell, they--

1642
01:11:56,273 --> 01:11:57,174
What the hell is that?

1643
01:11:57,274 --> 01:11:59,409
It's def-con 4, sir.

1644
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:01,812
Just remind me.
What is def-con 4?

1645
01:12:01,912 --> 01:12:03,313
Defense condition 4, sir.

1646
01:12:03,413 --> 01:12:04,815
A nuclear attack is imminent

1647
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:05,816
or the opposite.

1648
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:06,817
I'm not quite sure.

1649
01:12:06,917 --> 01:12:07,818
Imminent, Stu!

1650
01:12:07,918 --> 01:12:08,819
There you go,
imminent.

1651
01:12:08,919 --> 01:12:10,921
Well, can't we stop this?

1652
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:12,823
The siren, sir,
or nuclear exchange?

1653
01:12:12,923 --> 01:12:15,042
Either one!

1654
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:17,945
Uh, sir, our missile silos in southern Utah

1655
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:20,145
have somehow become activated.

1656
01:12:20,547 --> 01:12:21,448
Well, who ordered that?

1657
01:12:21,548 --> 01:12:22,699
It wasn't me, was it?

1658
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:24,201
No. I didn't order that.

1659
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:26,303
Can't you stop this?

1660
01:12:26,303 --> 01:12:27,204
General Panzer,

1661
01:12:27,304 --> 01:12:28,205
where are those missiles aimed?

1662
01:12:28,305 --> 01:12:31,808
Well, sir, uh...

1663
01:12:31,808 --> 01:12:35,312
those icbms in southern Utah are, uh,

1664
01:12:35,312 --> 01:12:37,814
directed at, uh,

1665
01:12:37,814 --> 01:12:39,216
at Moscow, sir.

1666
01:12:39,316 --> 01:12:40,717
What?

1667
01:12:40,817 --> 01:12:43,820
Why would you aim missiles at an--an ally?

1668
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,223
Sir, it seems that nearly all of our missiles

1669
01:12:46,323 --> 01:12:48,825
are directed at targets

1670
01:12:48,825 --> 01:12:50,227
in the former Soviet republics.

1671
01:12:50,327 --> 01:12:51,728
Why the hell is that?

1672
01:12:51,828 --> 01:12:53,828
With all due respect, sir,

1673
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:54,176
your boys

1674
01:12:54,276 --> 01:12:54,731
in intelligence

1675
01:12:54,831 --> 01:12:56,833
never could decide

1676
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:57,083
who was

1677
01:12:57,183 --> 01:12:57,734
a big enough threat

1678
01:12:57,834 --> 01:12:59,236
to point those babies elsewhere.

1679
01:12:59,336 --> 01:13:00,737
Let me say, sir,

1680
01:13:00,837 --> 01:13:01,668
if one of

1681
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:02,739
our birds land

1682
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:04,841
in the Russkies' backyard,

1683
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:07,347
plenty will

1684
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:11,231
be landing in ours.

1685
01:13:11,231 --> 01:13:13,734
I have just arrived here

1686
01:13:13,734 --> 01:13:17,237
as part of the pentagon press corps.

1687
01:13:17,237 --> 01:13:20,641
There are some things we will
not be allowed to show you.

1688
01:13:20,741 --> 01:13:24,244
But you can rest assured
that you will be getting

1689
01:13:24,244 --> 01:13:27,748
all of the information you need to know.

1690
01:13:27,748 --> 01:13:30,250
I am standing here--

1691
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,250
in the middle of--

1692
01:13:32,252 --> 01:13:36,757
and it is--

1693
01:13:36,757 --> 01:13:41,762
for those of you with sons
and daughters up here,

1694
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:43,762
I can only say that--

1695
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,171
and that's about the only thing

1696
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:56,143
that has been going wrong at this point.

1697
01:13:56,143 --> 01:13:57,544
The activation order

1698
01:13:57,644 --> 01:13:58,266
appears to be

1699
01:13:58,366 --> 01:13:59,179
coming from Canada.

1700
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:00,681
How can Canada

1701
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:02,182
activate our missiles?

1702
01:14:02,282 --> 01:14:03,684
Oh, shit.
The Hacker Hellstorm.

1703
01:14:03,784 --> 01:14:04,551
The what?

1704
01:14:04,651 --> 01:14:06,653
The Hacker Hellstorm.

1705
01:14:07,154 --> 01:14:08,055
Sir, it's a program you canceled

1706
01:14:08,155 --> 01:14:08,806
when you tried to

1707
01:14:08,906 --> 01:14:09,556
balance the budget.

1708
01:14:09,656 --> 01:14:11,058
What is the Hacker Hellstorm?

1709
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:13,160
Vargo...

1710
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,562
It's an automatic nuclear response system, sir.

1711
01:14:15,662 --> 01:14:17,564
It initiates a nuclear counterstrike on its own.

1712
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:19,066
I never liked it.

1713
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:20,567
Took the fun out of Armageddon.

1714
01:14:20,667 --> 01:14:22,069
I'm glad they canceled the son of a bitch.

1715
01:14:22,169 --> 01:14:23,570
How did Canada get it?

1716
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:25,672
That's classified.

1717
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:27,672
Classified?

1718
01:14:27,674 --> 01:14:29,676
I'm--I'm the president!

1719
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:31,078
How did Canada get it, Stu?

1720
01:14:31,178 --> 01:14:33,628
I want to talk to Hacker right now!

1721
01:14:39,853 --> 01:14:41,255
It's a vision.

1722
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:43,355
My eyes.

1723
01:14:53,116 --> 01:14:54,017
There it is, men.

1724
01:14:54,117 --> 01:14:55,519
Toronto.

1725
01:14:55,619 --> 01:14:59,122
It's beautiful.

1726
01:14:59,122 --> 01:15:00,908
It's like no other city I've ever seen.

1727
01:15:01,008 --> 01:15:04,011
It's like Albany...

1728
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:06,011
Only cleaner.

1729
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:27,899
The tower!

1730
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,061
That's Toronto, boys.

1731
01:15:38,161 --> 01:15:41,164
Cool.

1732
01:15:41,164 --> 01:15:43,300
Wow!

1733
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:46,453
Jeez, how do they clean all those windows?

1734
01:15:46,553 --> 01:15:48,553
Windex, dummy.

1735
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:56,580
Where did they get so many buildings?

1736
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,682
It's eerie.

1737
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:00,584
Where is everybody?
I don't like this.

1738
01:16:00,684 --> 01:16:03,437
Me neither.

1739
01:16:03,437 --> 01:16:07,691
There's a kid up there.

1740
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:10,694
Hey, hey, kid.

1741
01:16:10,694 --> 01:16:12,696
Kid, where is everybody?

1742
01:16:12,696 --> 01:16:13,981
The tower.

1743
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:15,482
The tower?

1744
01:16:15,582 --> 01:16:16,984
The Canadian national tower.

1745
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:19,236
Some crazy American woman's
there with a big gun.

1746
01:16:19,336 --> 01:16:21,838
Oh, thanks.

1747
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:24,241
Crazy American lady with a gun. Ha ha.

1748
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:25,242
It's Honey!

1749
01:16:25,342 --> 01:16:27,342
Come on, fellas, let's go.

1750
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,251
Attention, please.

1751
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:36,351
Attention, please.

1752
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,660
This is the Royal Canadian mounted police.

1753
01:16:39,723 --> 01:16:41,625
Would you come down from the tower, please?

1754
01:16:41,725 --> 01:16:44,127
If you say 'please' one more time,

1755
01:16:44,227 --> 01:16:46,257
I'm going to let you have it.

1756
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:53,770
No, no, no.
I got that part.

1757
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,272
What I don't understand

1758
01:16:55,372 --> 01:16:56,773
is how the Canadians

1759
01:16:56,873 --> 01:17:00,377
have a fully functional
and operational Hellstorm.

1760
01:17:00,377 --> 01:17:02,548
I thought what I sold them

1761
01:17:02,648 --> 01:17:03,780
was not usable.

1762
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,282
How the hell did I let you

1763
01:17:05,382 --> 01:17:07,384
Stuey...

1764
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:09,886
God almighty.

1765
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:11,288
Why do you bother your head

1766
01:17:11,388 --> 01:17:13,390
with this kind of crap?

1767
01:17:13,390 --> 01:17:15,792
Maybe it's because you're an only child.

1768
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:17,294
Or maybe it's because

1769
01:17:17,394 --> 01:17:19,396
you're becoming irrelevant.

1770
01:17:19,396 --> 01:17:21,298
Now, calm down,
for christ's sake.

1771
01:17:21,398 --> 01:17:23,400
Mm-hmm.

1772
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,801
The Canadians cannot launch any missiles.

1773
01:17:24,901 --> 01:17:27,404
Only I can,

1774
01:17:27,404 --> 01:17:29,406
because I have the codes,

1775
01:17:29,406 --> 01:17:31,406
All of them.

1776
01:17:31,408 --> 01:17:32,809
And I'm in control.

1777
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:34,911
So, easy.

1778
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,956
Missile countdown has started in

1779
01:17:37,056 --> 01:17:38,315
Wyoming and Montana.

1780
01:17:38,415 --> 01:17:39,816
All right.
I want an answer.

1781
01:17:39,916 --> 01:17:41,318
Does Canada have the power

1782
01:17:41,418 --> 01:17:43,938
to launch America's nuclear weapons?

1783
01:17:44,171 --> 01:17:48,675
The Hacker Hellstorm can do that and a lot more.

1784
01:17:48,675 --> 01:17:51,078
And if you hadn't canceled that program,

1785
01:17:51,178 --> 01:17:52,079
the technology would

1786
01:17:52,179 --> 01:17:54,181
still be in American hands.

1787
01:17:54,181 --> 01:17:56,583
So you sold control of American missiles

1788
01:17:56,683 --> 01:17:58,685
to a foreign country.

1789
01:17:58,685 --> 01:17:59,555
If you can call

1790
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:00,587
Canada foreign

1791
01:18:00,687 --> 01:18:03,190
or a country.

1792
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:05,092
When you canceled that program,

1793
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:06,093
you left me standing there

1794
01:18:06,193 --> 01:18:09,196
out of pocket $500 million!

1795
01:18:09,696 --> 01:18:11,098
I got to make up

1796
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:13,200
on a shortfall like that.

1797
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,703
After all the billions he's made on uncle Sam...

1798
01:18:16,703 --> 01:18:19,206
in a decent, God-fearing country,

1799
01:18:19,206 --> 01:18:21,108
I'd be allowed to beat the two of you to death.

1800
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:22,609
It's scum like you

1801
01:18:22,709 --> 01:18:24,478
that make a simple war all screwed up

1802
01:18:24,578 --> 01:18:27,214
and confusing.

1803
01:18:27,214 --> 01:18:30,984
It's people like us who keep
people like you in business.

1804
01:18:31,084 --> 01:18:33,487
We're now registering
missile activity in Nevada.

1805
01:18:33,587 --> 01:18:36,089
All right,
now I want to know

1806
01:18:36,089 --> 01:18:39,593
where exactly did you install this,

1807
01:18:39,593 --> 01:18:40,994
this Hellstorm thing?

1808
01:18:41,094 --> 01:18:44,598
Ever run an old possum up a tree, Mr. President?

1809
01:18:44,598 --> 01:18:47,188
He'll find the highest branch he can.

1810
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:12,507
Out of my way.
Out of my way.

1811
01:19:12,509 --> 01:19:13,410
Out of my way.

1812
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,911
Oh, I'm sorry.

1813
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:16,413
Excuse me.

1814
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:19,015
Out of my way.
Out of my way.

1815
01:19:19,516 --> 01:19:20,417
I'm sorry.

1816
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:22,519
Out of my way.
Out of my way.

1817
01:19:22,519 --> 01:19:24,519
I'm sorry.

1818
01:19:24,521 --> 01:19:26,523
All right.
You wait here.

1819
01:19:26,523 --> 01:19:29,113
I'll be right back.
Get out of my way.

1820
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:40,285
Oh...

1821
01:20:00,807 --> 01:20:03,710
Now, you know that I built Hellstorm number 1.

1822
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:05,812
But what you don't know

1823
01:20:05,812 --> 01:20:08,215
is that I also built Hellstorm number 2.

1824
01:20:08,315 --> 01:20:10,317
what's that?
What's 2?

1825
01:20:10,317 --> 01:20:13,320
It's to defend us against Hellstorm 1.

1826
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:15,097
Just in case an enemy

1827
01:20:15,197 --> 01:20:16,473
should ever acquire it.

1828
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:17,974
I don't want to say that it's pure genius,

1829
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:18,975
But--

1830
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:20,477
No, no.
It's insane!

1831
01:20:20,577 --> 01:20:22,829
It's business.

1832
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:25,232
And I can let you have it immediately,

1833
01:20:25,332 --> 01:20:26,733
but it won't be cheap.

1834
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:29,236
It won't be cheap?
How much will it be?

1835
01:20:29,336 --> 01:20:31,838
$1 trillion.

1836
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:33,840
$1 trillion!

1837
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,209
That includes the cost overruns.

1838
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:38,111
Mr. Hacker, you've got uncle Sam

1839
01:20:38,211 --> 01:20:40,213
by the cojones.

1840
01:20:40,213 --> 01:20:42,716
Don't you have any patriotism, sir?

1841
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:44,718
What about the Alamo?

1842
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:46,119
The halls of Montezuma,

1843
01:20:46,219 --> 01:20:48,221
the sands of Iwo Jima?

1844
01:20:48,221 --> 01:20:50,724
The guns of Navarone?

1845
01:20:50,724 --> 01:20:53,126
Didn't you ever fantasize about the duke

1846
01:20:53,226 --> 01:20:54,628
in the flying leathernecks?

1847
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:56,129
Huh?

1848
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:58,131
I mean, fantasize about being the duke,

1849
01:20:58,231 --> 01:20:59,182
not fantasize

1850
01:20:59,282 --> 01:21:00,133
about the duke.

1851
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:02,235
You know what I mean, sir?

1852
01:21:02,235 --> 01:21:05,035
30 minutes to launch.

1853
01:21:12,996 --> 01:21:16,132
Oh, god...

1854
01:21:16,633 --> 01:21:19,013
What have you got there?

1855
01:21:25,759 --> 01:21:27,160
Oh, my god...

1856
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,163
Mr. President, we have a
Situation uranus in Utah.

1857
01:21:30,263 --> 01:21:32,165
They bumped their birds up to t-minus 7.

1858
01:21:32,265 --> 01:21:33,667
This is terrible.

1859
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:35,168
I didn't understand a word of what he said.

1860
01:21:35,268 --> 01:21:36,670
He said the missiles will launch

1861
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:37,170
in 7 minutes.

1862
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,272
Oh, my god!

1863
01:21:39,272 --> 01:21:40,674
Mr. President,

1864
01:21:40,774 --> 01:21:41,675
you got 6 minutes and change.

1865
01:21:41,775 --> 01:21:42,676
This is a mistake

1866
01:21:42,776 --> 01:21:44,177
you do not want to make!

1867
01:21:44,277 --> 01:21:45,133
Negotiate with him.

1868
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,179
Give him what he wants.

1869
01:21:46,279 --> 01:21:47,681
I know. Just give me a second.

1870
01:21:47,781 --> 01:21:50,684
Gentlemen, I intend to put some shoe leather

1871
01:21:50,784 --> 01:21:53,286
between me and ground zero.

1872
01:21:53,286 --> 01:21:54,688
Call me, Mr. President,

1873
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:56,189
when you decide to give me the money.

1874
01:21:56,289 --> 01:21:58,191
Wait a second.
Hold on 1 second.

1875
01:21:58,291 --> 01:21:59,693
I don't understand something.

1876
01:21:59,793 --> 01:22:01,695
Why would the Canadians try to start a war

1877
01:22:01,795 --> 01:22:02,696
between us and the Russians?

1878
01:22:02,796 --> 01:22:04,197
I don't get that.

1879
01:22:04,297 --> 01:22:06,800
Hacker!

1880
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,436
Hacker! Hack--

1881
01:22:09,436 --> 01:22:12,088
Get me intelligence.
I need intelligence.

1882
01:22:12,188 --> 01:22:13,590
Canada's not launching those missiles.

1883
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,091
You are!

1884
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:17,594
Give me the money,
Then I'll turn it off.

1885
01:22:17,694 --> 01:22:22,198
Give me the goddamn codes!

1886
01:22:22,198 --> 01:22:26,453
You son of a bitch,
You're through!

1887
01:22:26,953 --> 01:22:28,471
Oh, my god!

1888
01:22:28,571 --> 01:22:31,324
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1889
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:35,078
Guards! Arrest Mr. Smiley!

1890
01:22:35,078 --> 01:22:37,080
Wait! I got the codes!

1891
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:41,985
Mr. Hacker?

1892
01:22:42,085 --> 01:22:44,087
Mr. Hacker?

1893
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:44,988
I think this old possum

1894
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:46,489
has bought the farm.

1895
01:22:46,589 --> 01:22:48,589
E-i-e-i-o.

1896
01:23:02,355 --> 01:23:03,256
Oh, excuse me.

1897
01:23:03,356 --> 01:23:04,257
Pardon me.

1898
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:06,142
Sorry.

1899
01:23:06,242 --> 01:23:07,143
Oh!

1900
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:09,243
Sorry!

1901
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:16,751
Stu, Stu, Stu,

1902
01:23:16,753 --> 01:23:18,154
It really pains me to see you this way.

1903
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:20,256
Ah, who am I kidding?

1904
01:23:20,256 --> 01:23:21,157
We'll torture him later.

1905
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:23,760
Get him out of here.

1906
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,760
What about the Russians?

1907
01:23:25,762 --> 01:23:28,212
Call Moscow.
We've got to warn them.

1908
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:30,667
Vladimir Krushkin-- he
was in briefly over lunch,

1909
01:23:30,767 --> 01:23:32,168
Countercoup, he was out,
then reinstalled again--

1910
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:33,198
As of supper,

1911
01:23:33,298 --> 01:23:35,298
he was still there.

1912
01:23:40,143 --> 01:23:43,146
Let me level with you, sir.

1913
01:23:43,146 --> 01:23:44,547
I would destroy any nation,

1914
01:23:44,647 --> 01:23:46,049
even my own,

1915
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:47,019
if my president

1916
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:48,051
gave the order.

1917
01:23:48,151 --> 01:23:50,653
So you just say the word, sir,

1918
01:23:50,653 --> 01:23:51,066
and we'll do what

1919
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:51,554
we should have done

1920
01:23:51,654 --> 01:23:53,056
in the first place.

1921
01:23:53,156 --> 01:23:56,159
We'll nuke the slimy Canuck bastards.

1922
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,161
We'll wipe their frigid,

1923
01:23:58,161 --> 01:24:00,261
Goddamned country off the map.

1924
01:24:00,663 --> 01:24:02,565
I can't kill America's neighbors.

1925
01:24:02,665 --> 01:24:03,566
I can.

1926
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:05,668
I summer up there.

1927
01:24:05,668 --> 01:24:07,070
I understand, sir.

1928
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:08,571
Mr. President,

1929
01:24:08,671 --> 01:24:09,572
We've lost contact with omega force.

1930
01:24:09,672 --> 01:24:11,674
Well, that's it.

1931
01:24:12,175 --> 01:24:14,177
Moscow is about to light up

1932
01:24:14,177 --> 01:24:15,078
hotter than a pig roast

1933
01:24:15,178 --> 01:24:16,079
on flag day.

1934
01:24:16,179 --> 01:24:18,181
That'll certainly guarantee

1935
01:24:18,181 --> 01:24:19,582
a retaliatory gesture against the United States.

1936
01:24:19,682 --> 01:24:23,570
No shit.

1937
01:24:27,574 --> 01:24:28,475
Get prime minister MacDonald

1938
01:24:28,575 --> 01:24:29,976
on the phone.

1939
01:24:30,076 --> 01:24:30,977
I'll give him anything he wants.

1940
01:24:31,077 --> 01:24:33,580
Got to.

1941
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:37,584
This is the Hacker Hellstorm
Weather forecasting center.

1942
01:24:37,584 --> 01:24:41,588
1 minute, 50 seconds to total annihilation.

1943
01:24:41,588 --> 01:24:44,090
Have a nice day.

1944
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:45,492
Mr. Prime minister,

1945
01:24:45,592 --> 01:24:49,596
I'm asking you to stop it.

1946
01:24:49,596 --> 01:24:51,848
Now pay attention to me, o.k.?

1947
01:24:51,848 --> 01:24:54,250
I'm talking about the Hacker Hellstorm.

1948
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:57,854
You got it,
and you've got to turn it off.

1949
01:24:57,854 --> 01:24:59,255
Clark, we can't turn it off.

1950
01:24:59,355 --> 01:25:01,355
Of course we've tried!

1951
01:25:01,357 --> 01:25:03,359
We can't turn it--

1952
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,261
He's putting his wife on.

1953
01:25:05,361 --> 01:25:06,262
Hi.

1954
01:25:06,362 --> 01:25:07,764
Uh...uh...

1955
01:25:07,864 --> 01:25:10,366
Ecoutez,

1956
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:12,368
vous avez gagne.

1957
01:25:12,869 --> 01:25:15,371
Uh...

1958
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:19,876
Fermez les 'rockettes',
o.k.?

1959
01:25:19,876 --> 01:25:21,878
About 2 years in high school

1960
01:25:21,878 --> 01:25:23,780
and about 4 years in college.

1961
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:27,750
Well, thank you.

1962
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,990
American missiles will launch

1963
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,090
in 1 minute and 30 seconds.

1964
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,923
Oh! Oh! When will it end?

1965
01:26:24,691 --> 01:26:27,694
Clark, are you listening to me?

1966
01:26:27,694 --> 01:26:30,697
Don't launch the rockets.

1967
01:26:30,697 --> 01:26:31,598
Our rockets!

1968
01:26:31,698 --> 01:26:33,099
Don't launch them!

1969
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:35,229
I'm giving up,
you understand?

1970
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:37,103
Whatever you want,
you've got it! You've won!

1971
01:26:37,203 --> 01:26:40,003
Don't play games with me,
Clark! You won!

1972
01:26:51,217 --> 01:26:53,836
Canuck central!

1973
01:26:53,836 --> 01:26:55,836
T-minus 15 seconds.

1974
01:26:57,473 --> 01:26:59,976
The Canucks and Hacker?

1975
01:26:59,976 --> 01:27:02,729
10 seconds to launch.

1976
01:27:02,729 --> 01:27:09,986
Prepare to launch.

1977
01:27:09,986 --> 01:27:12,786
Clark, please!
We're running out of time!

1978
01:27:26,502 --> 01:27:28,502
That's my Honey.

1979
01:28:04,657 --> 01:28:06,059
Boomer!

1980
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,159
Don't like heights.

1981
01:28:08,161 --> 01:28:13,416
We've got to get out of here.
Come on!

1982
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:19,422
Step on it.

1983
01:28:19,922 --> 01:28:23,702
Now, this is what I call a health care system.

1984
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:36,222
Look, Honey.

1985
01:28:36,322 --> 01:28:37,223
Home.

1986
01:28:37,323 --> 01:28:39,325
Home.

1987
01:28:39,325 --> 01:28:41,327
The US of A.

1988
01:28:46,949 --> 01:28:48,949
Whoo! Let's go.

1989
01:29:45,558 --> 01:29:48,060
Ha ha ha!
There it is!

1990
01:29:48,177 --> 01:29:50,177
Like I care!

1991
01:30:25,214 --> 01:30:26,616
We're going to be there any minute now!

1992
01:30:26,716 --> 01:30:28,716
Oh, yeah! Trust me.

1993
01:30:35,808 --> 01:30:39,312
Only in America

1994
01:30:39,312 --> 01:30:41,814
Can a guy from anywhere

1995
01:30:42,315 --> 01:30:44,817
Go to sleep a pauper

1996
01:30:44,817 --> 01:30:48,321
And wake up a millionaire

1997
01:30:48,321 --> 01:30:50,323
Only in America

1998
01:30:50,323 --> 01:30:51,724
A-woo

1999
01:30:51,824 --> 01:30:53,226
Can a kid without a cent

2000
01:30:53,326 --> 01:30:55,326
A-woo

2001
01:30:55,328 --> 01:31:00,833
Get a break and maybe grow up to be president

2002
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:04,337
Only in America

2003
01:31:04,337 --> 01:31:06,839
Land of opportunity, yeah

2004
01:31:06,839 --> 01:31:09,342
Could a boy who's nothing

2005
01:31:09,342 --> 01:31:15,848
Be something and be everything

2006
01:31:15,848 --> 01:31:19,352
Only in America

2007
01:31:19,352 --> 01:31:21,854
Can a kid who's washin' cars

2008
01:31:21,854 --> 01:31:24,357
Take a giant step

2009
01:31:24,357 --> 01:31:28,361
And reach right up and touch the stars

2010
01:31:28,361 --> 01:31:30,363
Only in America

2011
01:31:30,363 --> 01:31:31,764
A-woo

2012
01:31:31,864 --> 01:31:33,266
Could a dream like this come true

2013
01:31:33,366 --> 01:31:34,267
A-woo

2014
01:31:34,367 --> 01:31:36,369
Could a guy like me

2015
01:31:36,369 --> 01:31:39,372
Start with nothing and end up

2016
01:31:39,872 --> 01:31:44,877
Like you

2017
01:32:05,398 --> 01:32:08,901
Only in America

2018
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:11,404
Land of opportunity,
Yeah

2019
01:32:11,404 --> 01:32:13,906
Could a boy who's nothing

2020
01:32:13,906 --> 01:32:18,911
Be something and be everything

2021
01:32:19,412 --> 01:32:23,916
Be everything

2022
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:27,420
America

2023
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:30,423
America

2024
01:32:30,423 --> 01:32:33,426
America

2025
01:32:33,426 --> 01:32:36,429
America

2026
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:38,429
America?

2027
01:32:48,941 --> 01:32:53,446
Beneath its snowy mantle cold and clean

2028
01:32:53,446 --> 01:32:55,348
The unborn grass lies waiting

2029
01:32:55,448 --> 01:32:59,452
For its gold to turn to green

2030
01:32:59,452 --> 01:33:03,456
The snowbird sings the song he always sings

2031
01:33:03,456 --> 01:33:05,458
And speaks to me of flowers

2032
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:09,462
That will bloom again in spring

2033
01:33:09,962 --> 01:33:13,966
When I was young my heart was young then, too

2034
01:33:13,966 --> 01:33:15,868
And anything that it would tell me

2035
01:33:15,968 --> 01:33:19,472
That's the thing that I would do

2036
01:33:19,972 --> 01:33:23,976
But now I feel such emptiness within

2037
01:33:23,976 --> 01:33:26,846
For the thing that I want most in life's?

2038
01:33:26,979 --> 01:33:30,483
The thing that I can't win

2039
01:33:30,483 --> 01:33:34,487
Spread your tiny wings and fly away

2040
01:33:34,487 --> 01:33:36,657
And take the snow back with you

2041
01:33:36,989 --> 01:33:40,493
Where it came from on that day

2042
01:33:40,493 --> 01:33:44,497
The one I loved forever is untrue

2043
01:33:44,497 --> 01:33:46,497
And if I could

2044
01:33:46,499 --> 01:33:51,003
You know that I would fly away with you

2045
01:33:51,003 --> 01:33:55,007
The breeze along the river seems to say

2046
01:33:55,007 --> 01:33:57,410
That he'll only break my heart again

2047
01:33:57,510 --> 01:34:01,013
Should I decide to stay

2048
01:34:01,013 --> 01:34:05,518
Spread your tiny wings and fly away

2049
01:34:05,518 --> 01:34:07,688
And take the snow back with you

2050
01:34:08,688 --> 01:34:18,688
