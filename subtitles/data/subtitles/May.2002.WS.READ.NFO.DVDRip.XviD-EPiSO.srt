1
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:48,671
What's wrong
with my eye, Mama?

2
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:51,757
The doctor
says it's lazy.

3
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,884
But...

4
00:00:53,925 --> 00:00:56,303
we're going to make you
look perfect.

5
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,850
It itches.

6
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:06,687
Do you want make friends?

7
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:09,857
Then keep it covered.

8
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,993
Are you a pirate?

9
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:50,060
<i># Happy Birthday to you. #</i>

10
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,400
I've always said,

11
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,194
"If you can't find
a friend,

12
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,655
make one."

13
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,990
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

14
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,581
Now it's ruined.

15
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,173
Her name is Suzie.

16
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:25,342
Suzie was the first doll
I ever made.

17
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,636
She was my best friend.

18
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:29,596
And now she'll be yours.

19
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,767
No, no, no,
you can't take her out.

20
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,810
She's special.

21
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:44,777
What do you think
of my pirate patch?

22
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,867
I bet you're wondering
what I'm making.

23
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:00,750
Okay, I'll tell you.

24
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,337
I saw someone today.

25
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,423
A boy.

26
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,596
You know how
when you meet someone...

27
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,808
and you think
you like them,

28
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,643
but then the more
you talk to them

29
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:22,353
you see parts
you don't like.

30
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,815
Like that guy
on the bench.

31
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,372
And sometimes...

32
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,334
you don't end up liking
any parts at all.

33
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:52,923
But...

34
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,968
the boy I saw today
is different.

35
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,975
I like every part of him.

36
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,102
Especially his hands.

37
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:08,979
They're beautiful.

38
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,655
Don't be mad.

39
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:22,825
You've been my friend
my whole life.

40
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,831
And you see me,
you always have, but...

41
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,668
I need a real friend.

42
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:37,005
Someone I can hold.

43
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:46,472
I'm going to give you
some cardboard shades

44
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:48,432
you can wear over
your regular glasses

45
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,392
until the dilation wears off.

46
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,269
Will my contacts be ready
by Friday?

47
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:53,937
Should be.

48
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,565
You look awfully excited.

49
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,317
I have a date.

50
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,279
You're sure my eye won't cross
with the contacts?

51
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:05,156
Positive.

52
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,366
The contacts will pull
your good eye forward

53
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,159
just like
your regular glasses.

54
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,161
Your lazy eye just needs
a little help.

55
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:17,167
I need all the help
I can get.

56
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,460
This boy is perfect.

57
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,305
Oh, slick shades.

58
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:22,351
What the hell is a scupel?

59
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,562
- Scalpel?
- Oh!

60
00:06:24,603 --> 00:06:26,772
Your dog's going
to be fine, ma'am.

61
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:29,358
Scalpel!

62
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,195
Thanks for the heads up, doll.

63
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:38,199
Scupel.

64
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:45,164
Wait! Hold 'em up!

65
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:51,545
Moy, I need a big scupel
for German Shepard surgery tomorrow.

66
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,296
No forget it.
Prep it up for me.

67
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:05,850
Hey, May, hold up.

68
00:07:05,891 --> 00:07:08,227
I want to ask you something.

69
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:11,104
What are you going
to be for Halloween?

70
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:14,357
I've just been wracking
my brains, you know,

71
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,443
trying to come up
with something original.

72
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:18,153
Do you got any ideas?

73
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:23,991
You have a beautiful neck.

74
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:29,913
Thank you.

75
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,461
You should call me
one of these nights.

76
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:38,463
You know,
we'll hang out and...

77
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,049
eat some melons
or something.

78
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,636
Okay.

79
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,615
When I left for vacation,

80
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,075
my dog had four legs.

81
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,952
Okay?

82
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,745
Then I came back...

83
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:49,958
now she only has three.

84
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,378
You know,
I looked everywhere.

85
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,547
I can't find her leg.

86
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:57,298
What do I do?

87
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,425
May?

88
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:02,678
May, would you help
this gentleman?

89
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,847
You got to help me here, May.

90
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,766
I got a serious situation here, okay?

91
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,144
I got a dog,
it's missing a leg, okay?

92
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:13,105
I'm throwing it a stick
and nothing.

93
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,231
Nothing happens.

94
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,765
Hello?

95
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,375
Jesus, what are you doing?

96
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,130
Relaxing.

97
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,301
Doesn't it hurt?

98
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,137
No.

99
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:56,017
Ow!

100
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,936
You crazy bitch!

101
00:13:57,977 --> 00:13:59,938
Why did you do that?!

102
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,405
Actually...

103
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,783
I kind of liked it.

104
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,495
Do me again.

105
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,465
It was in the rose bushes.

106
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:32,259
You can't just...

107
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,177
sew it back on...

108
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:37,263
can you?

109
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,102
I could.

110
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,703
Hello.

111
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,925
You can use me...

112
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,178
I mean, mine.

113
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,561
Thank you.

114
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,026
- What's your name?
- May.

115
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,404
Nice to meet you.
I'm Adam.

116
00:15:51,373 --> 00:15:53,333
You want to smoke

117
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,751
a smoke with me?

118
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,924
You got to puff.

119
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,441
So, do you make
your own clothes?

120
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:22,276
Yes.

121
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,529
That's cool.

122
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:29,074
Thank you, Adam.

123
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,951
You're welcome, May.

124
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,912
I love your hands.

125
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,956
I think they're beautiful.

126
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,755
I used to be a hand model.

127
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,926
- I could see you doing that.
- I'm kidding, May.

128
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,644
Whoa!

129
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,998
Oh!

130
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,636
Well...

131
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:48,397
Race cars.

132
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,274
What's that?

133
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,568
Oh, yeah.

134
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,403
My, uh...

135
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:57,280
girlfriend bought me these.

136
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,453
Anyway.

137
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:15,213
You know, I meant,
my ex-girlfriend...

138
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:17,215
bought them for me.

139
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,765
Practice.

140
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,892
I'll see you around, May.

141
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,445
"Hey, see you around, right?"

142
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,782
I'm so sorry that...

143
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,159
I tripped in front of you

144
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,660
at the coffee shop.

145
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,414
Maybe we could...

146
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,626
we could do something.

147
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:08,887
"See you around."

148
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:11,890
"See you around, right?"

149
00:19:36,913 --> 00:19:38,915
Hello, happy!

150
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:44,754
Dr. Zarkizein needs you
to do a fecosam

151
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:46,630
on the miscitta.

152
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,841
Does that make
any sense to you?

153
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:51,843
Fecal exam on Miss Kitty.
No problem.

154
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:04,188
Oh, excuse me.

155
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,818
Hey!

156
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,653
What's up, May?

157
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,951
I was just about to...

158
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,496
about to have lunch.
Wow, you look great!

159
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,667
You hungry?

160
00:20:26,709 --> 00:20:28,794
I will cut.

161
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,006
And you pick.

162
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,221
Good choice.

163
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,308
So what do you do, May?

164
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:49,396
I work at the animal hospital.

165
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,398
And I sew.

166
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,360
Okay.
Animal hospital.

167
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:58,404
Some people think
it's kind of gross.

168
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:00,281
I love gross.

169
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,908
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

170
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,659
Disgust me, please.

171
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:11,208
Okay.

172
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,627
A couple of weeks ago,
this old man comes in

173
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:15,962
and says his dog is dying.

174
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,214
And he begs us to save it.

175
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:21,050
A 90-pound black Lab
named Seymour.

176
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:23,511
We take him in
and run some tests

177
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,679
and we find that he has
a twisted bowel.

178
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:28,724
And he needs
to be operated on immediately.

179
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,226
So, we shave Seymour's tummy,

180
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,061
we cut him open

181
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:35,397
and we take out a piece
of intestine about,

182
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,690
about the size of a hot-dog.

183
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:41,527
Everything went smooth,

184
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,321
but...

185
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,240
when we went to sew
Seymour back up,

186
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:48,325
we realized we were out
of the heavy sutures

187
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,452
that you're supposed to use
for large dogs.

188
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:52,913
So the doctor decided
if we tripled up

189
00:21:52,954 --> 00:21:55,165
on cat sutures
that should do the trick.

190
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:58,960
Well,

191
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,712
a few days go by

192
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:03,005
and the old man calls up

193
00:22:03,047 --> 00:22:05,424
hysterical.

194
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,428
The cat sutures had burst
when he was at work.

195
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,179
And by the time he got home,

196
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,100
Seymour was sprawled out
on the back porch

197
00:22:15,141 --> 00:22:17,519
with his guts spread
all over the concrete.

198
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:21,689
And the fence
was soaked in blood

199
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,608
all the way around the yard.

200
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:32,074
It was a mess.

201
00:22:35,619 --> 00:22:37,954
I had to sew that one back up.

202
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:55,470
So, I guess your job
takes lots of guts.

203
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:58,765
Lots.

204
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,691
Why are those kids touching
everything like that?

205
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:11,026
They're blind kids.

206
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,278
They're from the day care center
around the block.

207
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:18,533
Dang, I got to go.

208
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:21,452
There's an Argenta playing
at the Beverly in 15 minutes.

209
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:24,413
I took the afternoon off.
They're showing "Trauma."

210
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:27,333
- Is that a movie?
- You've never seen "Trauma"?

211
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:32,421
Don't go.

212
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:35,924
What?

213
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,054
Nothing.

214
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:43,514
I should probably get back
to work, anyway.

215
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,642
Thank you for the sandwich...

216
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,520
and the cigarette.

217
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,521
I got to see this movie,

218
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,191
but maybe I can
see you again sometime.

219
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,862
How about tonight?

220
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:02,823
I got this thing tonight, but...

221
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,869
- maybe after.
- Great!

222
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,834
All right.
I look forward to it, May.

223
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,132
You want to take it with you?

224
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,908
Thanks for the advice, doll.

225
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,378
So...

226
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:50,130
what were you doing to me
that day at the coffee shop?

227
00:25:53,842 --> 00:25:55,802
I'm so embarrassed.

228
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:57,554
Why?

229
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:03,017
I've never had
a boyfriend before.

230
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:12,609
Do you like me, Adam?

231
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:17,530
Sure, I do.

232
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,041
You don't think I'm weird?

233
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,545
I do think you're weird.

234
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,382
- I knew that.
- I like weird.

235
00:26:40,218 --> 00:26:42,220
I like weird a lot.

236
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,692
You are perfect, aren't you?

237
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:01,529
Nobody's perfect.

238
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,864
You're perfect.

239
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,786
You want to see my room?

240
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,798
Does this stuff freak you out?

241
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,222
Nothing freaks me out.

242
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:33,600
That's right, it wouldn't,
would it?

243
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:48,697
You're on to me.

244
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,373
I'm a psycho.

245
00:28:11,843 --> 00:28:13,678
Got you.

246
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,605
It's pretty cool, huh?

247
00:29:20,907 --> 00:29:22,867
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

248
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,998
Who taught you how to kiss?

249
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,003
Suzie.

250
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,683
Who taught you how to kiss?!

251
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:54,187
Ah!

252
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,183
What's the haps, doll?

253
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,479
What happened to your hand?

254
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:43,858
Scupel.

255
00:30:50,739 --> 00:30:52,741
You're funny.

256
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:57,287
You want to watch me file?

257
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:09,548
Hey.

258
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,092
We got the whole place
to ourselves.

259
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:14,094
Let's dance.

260
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,776
Listen, they're serenading us.

261
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:32,944
We have to dance now.

262
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:37,699
Oh.

263
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,618
Please, please, please.

264
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,328
Please.

265
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,975
So, are you going
to dance with me or what?

266
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,903
- Do you like pussy?
- What?!

267
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:20,780
Cats?

268
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,616
Do you like pussycats?

269
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:27,494
Jeez, you're a nasty
little thing, aren't you?

270
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,207
Do you like Lupe?

271
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,252
My landlady's a real bitch.

272
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:37,337
I have to get rid of her.

273
00:32:38,671 --> 00:32:40,548
Your landlady?

274
00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:44,301
No, dummy, the cat.

275
00:32:50,557 --> 00:32:52,517
You're her only hope.

276
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,815
Oh, come on.

277
00:32:58,856 --> 00:33:01,651
Lupe will keep you company
when you're all alone.

278
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:03,944
Besides,

279
00:33:03,986 --> 00:33:06,071
she'll remind you of me.

280
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:09,908
- Okay.
- Wonderful!

281
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:15,372
Oh, look at the time.

282
00:33:16,706 --> 00:33:18,541
I have to go.

283
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:24,380
It's girls' night out tonight.

284
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:26,549
You want to come?

285
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,342
I know.

286
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:30,302
You need your beauty rest.

287
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,514
Not much of it, though.

288
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,367
Please leave a message
after the scream.

289
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,499
Hello, Adam, this is May.

290
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,836
I was just wondering
if you would like to be together again...

291
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:16,011
Get together again sometime.

292
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,597
I had such a good time last night.

293
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:24,894
742-5663.
That's my number.

294
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,770
Call me.

295
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:28,772
Anytime.

296
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:35,695
I look forward
to seeing you again.

297
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,950
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

298
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:13,702
May, you scared the hell
out of me!

299
00:36:13,743 --> 00:36:15,870
What are you doing out here?

300
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:17,831
Nothing.

301
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:21,375
How long have you been
standing out here?

302
00:36:23,002 --> 00:36:25,004
Since about 2:00.

303
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:32,260
You haven't really been standing out here
for two hours, have you?

304
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,555
What do you think?

305
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:39,767
Look, I got your message.

306
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,978
I'm sorry I haven't
called you back.

307
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:44,146
I've been really busy
with this movie.

308
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:46,106
You made a movie?

309
00:36:46,148 --> 00:36:49,693
In college before I dropped out.
I just finished putting it together.

310
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,362
Can I see it?

311
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:56,282
I'll make you macaroni and cheese.

312
00:36:59,118 --> 00:37:00,828
Go to a movie, huh?

313
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,538
Sounds like a date.

314
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:11,672
I dig your place.

315
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:13,924
It's really...

316
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,884
neat.

317
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,936
Is this Gatorade?

318
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:32,941
Cool.

319
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:46,120
You'll never believe
what I had to do at work today.

320
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,920
You ready?

321
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:56,671
Roll 'em.

322
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:58,631
Roll 'em.

323
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:57,073
So?

324
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:58,950
What did you think?

325
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:04,205
It was sweet.

326
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,544
It was sweet?

327
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:18,426
I don't think
she could have gotten

328
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:21,053
his whole finger
in one bite, though.

329
00:40:23,055 --> 00:40:25,558
That part was kind
of far-fetched.

330
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:10,140
Okay, okay, breathe

331
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:01,979
Oh, God damn it!

332
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,737
What the fuck is that?

333
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,202
- Oh, fuck, I'm bleeding.
- I know.

334
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,039
May, what are you doing?

335
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,128
Please.
I need a towel.

336
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:50,482
I think...
I think I'm gonna go.

337
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,652
What?

338
00:42:55,779 --> 00:42:57,947
I'll see you around.

339
00:42:59,157 --> 00:43:01,701
But it's just like your movie.

340
00:43:01,742 --> 00:43:03,828
May, this is weird.

341
00:43:04,954 --> 00:43:06,914
You like weird.

342
00:43:08,457 --> 00:43:10,000
Not that weird.

343
00:43:28,017 --> 00:43:30,644
I told you to face
the goddamn wall!

344
00:43:51,788 --> 00:43:53,832
Oops!
It fall down.

345
00:43:53,874 --> 00:43:55,583
Moy, you help me.

346
00:43:57,752 --> 00:44:00,213
Doctor, this delivery guy
is insisting

347
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:01,631
that you sign for this.

348
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,050
I'm in surgery, Polly,
please!

349
00:44:10,305 --> 00:44:12,766
Yeah, yeah, that's good.
Kitty live now.

350
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:21,691
- What are you doing?
- What?

351
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:24,652
Take it outside, man.

352
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:28,489
So, what's up, bro'?
What do you think?

353
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,532
Fuck, she's pretty.

354
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:32,951
I don't think she's playing
with a full deck.

355
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:36,079
- That's not what you wanted.
- True.

356
00:44:37,163 --> 00:44:39,248
At least you know
she's not out of her mind.

357
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:42,001
You know what,
we're not talking about May anymore.

358
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:44,336
I've successfully escaped
that lunatic.

359
00:44:44,378 --> 00:44:46,088
Who's May?

360
00:44:47,214 --> 00:44:49,883
Some weird chick
Adam just dumped.

361
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:51,718
How's your lip?

362
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,095
Stow it, all right?
Would you, please?

363
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:57,265
I see. May I?

364
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:59,309
So what if she likes
your hands?

365
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,977
Just keep them away
from her face.

366
00:45:01,018 --> 00:45:03,771
You're a prick, you know that?

367
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:06,482
- Yeah, do some more pushups.
- Fuck you.

368
00:45:09,443 --> 00:45:12,237
What's up, doll?

369
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:14,197
This is Polly.

370
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:17,826
I'm just sitting here
in my nightie.

371
00:45:17,867 --> 00:45:20,620
I wanted to know
how my little puss-puss was.

372
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:24,790
Come on over
if you get this, okay?

373
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,760
What's giving you
the sads, doll?

374
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:42,848
Oh.

375
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,684
No frumpy faces allowed
in this place.

376
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:20,758
I wanted to kiss you
since I first saw you.

377
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,016
Is this what was bugging you?

378
00:46:32,602 --> 00:46:34,563
I wasn't bugged.

379
00:46:42,945 --> 00:46:45,030
Just angry at someone.

380
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:47,199
Not me, I hope.

381
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:52,454
No, not you.

382
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:57,250
Do you feel weird doing this?

383
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,839
I am weird.

384
00:47:05,716 --> 00:47:07,635
I love weird.

385
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,975
Are you serious?

386
00:47:16,017 --> 00:47:17,811
Yeah.

387
00:47:18,978 --> 00:47:20,813
About me?

388
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:24,692
Dead.

389
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,154
Can you help us
with something?

390
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,784
I saw some kids playing
in the park

391
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:07,786
and I was wondering
if I could volunteer

392
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:09,663
to help watch them.

393
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:13,542
What kind of kids were they?
Retarded, deaf, crippled, dumb?

394
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,293
They were blind.

395
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:16,795
So you want to work
at the day care center?

396
00:49:16,836 --> 00:49:19,047
Would it be the same kids?

397
00:49:19,088 --> 00:49:22,341
What's the difference?
You only like a certain type of blind kids?

398
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:34,853
May Kennedy?
Lucille.

399
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:36,896
Let's introduce you
to the kids.

400
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:39,857
Do you think
I could meet her first?

401
00:49:39,899 --> 00:49:42,360
Who, Petey?
We can try.

402
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,779
She usually likes being left alone.

403
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,906
Nobody likes to be alone.

404
00:49:46,947 --> 00:49:50,158
Hey, Petey, I got someone here
who wants to meet you.

405
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,244
Go away, sniggel-head.

406
00:49:52,285 --> 00:49:54,788
You are so mean to me, Petey.

407
00:49:55,997 --> 00:49:57,874
Good luck.

408
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,307
What are you making, Petey?

409
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,142
Ashtray.

410
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,062
You smoke?

411
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:22,605
No.

412
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:26,108
Then who are you making
the ash tray for, Petey?

413
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:29,862
You smoke.

414
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,032
Yes, I do.

415
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:35,950
Then you can have it
when I'm done.

416
00:51:07,938 --> 00:51:09,648
How you doing, May?

417
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:15,153
Great, actually.

418
00:51:15,195 --> 00:51:17,280
Making new friends.

419
00:51:18,448 --> 00:51:19,907
Right and left.

420
00:51:19,949 --> 00:51:21,868
Lovely.

421
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,955
Lupe,

422
00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:27,706
this is Adam.

423
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,710
It's cute.

424
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:33,962
How are you doing?

425
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:40,259
Aw, man, this thing is broke.

426
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:42,470
I'm gonna have to go down
to the Fluff and Fold.

427
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:46,974
Call me sometime?

428
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:50,018
Yeah, sure.
I'll see you around, May.

429
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:37,228
May!

430
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,355
What's up?

431
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:42,108
Who is it, Polly?

432
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:45,277
Who is that?

433
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:50,240
An opportunity
I just couldn't pass up.

434
00:52:51,867 --> 00:52:53,618
Oh.

435
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,620
You want to join us?

436
00:52:59,082 --> 00:53:01,417
Well, then can we do
something tomorrow, May?

437
00:53:01,459 --> 00:53:03,502
I got to hit this.

438
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:09,091
I don't understand.

439
00:53:12,886 --> 00:53:14,846
You're jealous!

440
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:19,892
- What's going on out there?
- Shut up, hooker!

441
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:24,980
Oh, May, look.

442
00:53:25,022 --> 00:53:27,858
I can kick her out
if you really want me to.

443
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,319
You know you're my main mama.

444
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:44,553
Come here, Lup.
Come here.

445
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:47,014
Come on.

446
00:54:48,682 --> 00:54:51,810
Come on, girl, it's been
a really rough couple of days.

447
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:18,209
Shut up!

448
00:55:28,635 --> 00:55:30,512
Thank you.

449
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,068
Hello?

450
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,904
- Is Adam there?
- Hey, what's up?

451
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,989
Not much.

452
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:53,033
How did you know it was me?

453
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:57,745
Hello?

454
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,914
Who is this?

455
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,874
May, silly.

456
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:09,047
What are you doing tonight?

457
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:14,427
Hello?

458
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,513
Why?

459
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,475
I was just thinking
we could get together

460
00:56:20,516 --> 00:56:22,393
and do something.

461
00:56:22,435 --> 00:56:24,395
I have plans.

462
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:27,815
Oh.

463
00:56:27,856 --> 00:56:29,858
Quiet!

464
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,943
Hello? Who are you talking to?

465
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:35,947
What about tomorrow night?

466
00:56:37,073 --> 00:56:38,741
Maybe.

467
00:56:38,783 --> 00:56:41,619
Maybe?

468
00:56:41,661 --> 00:56:43,996
Okay, what time?
I'll wait.

469
00:56:44,038 --> 00:56:45,748
Don't do that.

470
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:47,833
No, no, no. It's okay.
I'll wait.

471
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:51,086
I got to go, May.

472
00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:56,508
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you
tomorrow then.

473
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:59,677
Goodbye, May.

474
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:34,709
I hate you.

475
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,129
Who can tell me
what this is?

476
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:42,216
We don't know,
May, what is it?

477
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:45,219
Petey, come here and see
if you can figure it out.

478
00:58:00,691 --> 00:58:02,276
I don't know.

479
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:04,487
Come on, Petey,
you can try harder than that.

480
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:06,030
I don't know.

481
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:10,993
All right,
I'll tell you what it is.

482
00:58:12,077 --> 00:58:13,703
What, what is it?

483
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:18,374
This is my best friend.

484
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:23,754
My best friend.

485
00:58:23,796 --> 00:58:27,049
And I didn't even realize it
until just last night.

486
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:31,303
It's just a box.

487
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:36,182
- Her friend must be inside.
- That's very good, Deirdre.

488
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:38,059
Take it out.

489
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:40,395
I can't.

490
00:58:40,436 --> 00:58:42,897
- Why not?
- I just can't.

491
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:46,734
Come on, May, let it out.
We want to meet your friend.

492
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,777
No, I...

493
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:51,780
I can't. She's special.
She doesn't come out.

494
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,908
She always stays in.
She's very fragile.

495
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,828
Petey.

496
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,960
Stop it!

497
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,680
- She's out!
- No!

498
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,848
- The floor!
- Glass!

499
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,600
Don't!

500
00:59:26,103 --> 00:59:28,188
Glass! Ow!

501
01:00:58,229 --> 01:01:00,440
This is May Kennedy.

502
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:02,567
Please leave your numbers.

503
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:08,572
Hello.
Where are you, doll?

504
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:11,199
I think Dr. Zarkizein is upset.

505
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:13,827
Either that or he has
a kidney infection.

506
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:15,537
I'm not sure.

507
01:01:15,578 --> 01:01:18,164
Either way, you need to get
your cute butt in here.

508
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:20,083
You've missed two days
in a row.

509
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:21,792
Are you all right?

510
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:23,961
I miss you. Kisses.

511
01:01:24,003 --> 01:01:25,880
Call me, okay?

512
01:01:57,492 --> 01:01:59,452
Ah.

513
01:02:21,055 --> 01:02:22,556
Oh, Lupe.

514
01:02:23,891 --> 01:02:26,018
I'll miss petting your pretty fur.

515
01:03:05,346 --> 01:03:07,014
Are you okay?

516
01:03:10,017 --> 01:03:13,061
So many pretty parts
and no pretty holes.

517
01:03:14,688 --> 01:03:16,940
No shit.
What's your name?

518
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,195
It doesn't matter.

519
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:30,827
Hey, you want to go get
some Jujubes with me?

520
01:03:32,537 --> 01:03:34,372
What's the point?

521
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:39,877
I'm just trying to be friendly.

522
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:41,879
Sorry.

523
01:03:50,387 --> 01:03:52,347
Hmm...

524
01:03:57,685 --> 01:04:00,188
Shit, man,
I can live off of these.

525
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:14,367
It's getting hella hot.

526
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:16,411
You mind if I take off my shirt?

527
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:20,415
- Do what you want.
- All right.

528
01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:32,926
I love your tattoo.

529
01:04:34,386 --> 01:04:36,429
Thanks.

530
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:38,389
Ah.

531
01:04:40,725 --> 01:04:43,561
Fuck!
I'm still burning up.

532
01:04:44,854 --> 01:04:47,398
Do you have any ice cubes
I can rub on my nipples?

533
01:04:55,322 --> 01:04:57,323
Freeze!

534
01:04:57,365 --> 01:04:59,075
That's the idea.

535
01:04:59,117 --> 01:05:00,993
Stop!

536
01:05:05,247 --> 01:05:07,041
What the fuck is that?

537
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:11,837
- A friend.
- Whoa.

538
01:05:11,878 --> 01:05:14,130
This is some sick shit.

539
01:05:14,172 --> 01:05:15,799
So...

540
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,469
are we best friends now that
you've seen what's inside my freezer?

541
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,846
You fucking freak.

542
01:05:24,014 --> 01:05:25,850
I'm not going to be your friend.

543
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,374
I need more parts.

544
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,222
Hey, May.

545
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:57,308
Hey, dude, what's up?

546
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,395
Not much.

547
01:07:01,812 --> 01:07:04,273
What are you reading about?

548
01:07:04,315 --> 01:07:07,109
Amputation.

549
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:10,362
- Is that for work?
- Nope.

550
01:07:10,404 --> 01:07:12,447
It's just for fun.

551
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:22,748
Listen, May,

552
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:25,501
I'm sorry things didn't work out
between us.

553
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,837
L... you know.
It just didn't feel right.

554
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:32,215
It doesn't feel right,
you know?

555
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:34,175
I understand now...

556
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,428
Adam.

557
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,015
I understand.

558
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,063
Friends?

559
01:07:59,949 --> 01:08:01,701
Okay. All right.

560
01:08:01,742 --> 01:08:03,536
I really have to go.

561
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,413
Later hands.

562
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:11,418
Right. All right.
See you around.

563
01:08:25,973 --> 01:08:27,766
How's Lupe?

564
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:32,479
- In pieces.
- Is she sad about something?

565
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:34,481
She does get depressed.

566
01:08:35,648 --> 01:08:38,067
- She doesn't seem happy.
- Oh.

567
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:42,863
Can I ask what you're doing?

568
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:46,784
I want to make

569
01:08:46,825 --> 01:08:48,786
a blouse for you.

570
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:52,789
Kind of an apology present
for the other night and my behavior.

571
01:08:52,831 --> 01:08:55,917
Oh, May, that is so sweet.

572
01:08:55,959 --> 01:08:58,127
Polly, are you back there, sweetie?

573
01:08:58,169 --> 01:08:59,962
Back here.

574
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:04,133
Did you bring my lunch?

575
01:09:10,973 --> 01:09:12,641
Oh...

576
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:17,478
May, I would like you to meet
a new friend of mine.

577
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:20,356
Her name's Ambrosia.

578
01:09:20,398 --> 01:09:22,608
Nice gams.

579
01:09:24,151 --> 01:09:25,528
Aren't they?

580
01:09:29,156 --> 01:09:31,074
Can I get a few more measurements?

581
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:35,745
Have you ever thought
about having this removed?

582
01:09:35,787 --> 01:09:38,831
My grandma said it's imperfections
that make you special.

583
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:45,337
What do you think?

584
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:54,429
Freak.

585
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:28,627
Hello, Polly, this is May.
Happy Halloween.

586
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:33,089
I was thinking about popping by later
to bring you your new blouse.

587
01:10:35,425 --> 01:10:37,010
Show you my costume.

588
01:10:48,228 --> 01:10:50,856
Give me a call if that's cool.
Miss you.

589
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:55,902
Kisses.

590
01:10:55,944 --> 01:10:56,945
Call me, okay?

591
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,081
If you can't find a friend,

592
01:11:09,122 --> 01:11:11,041
make one.

593
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:19,841
Hello, May.

594
01:11:19,882 --> 01:11:21,634
Hello, Polly.

595
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,012
Slick duds.

596
01:11:25,054 --> 01:11:26,764
Thank you.

597
01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:29,183
I was going to call you tonight,
but...

598
01:11:30,809 --> 01:11:32,519
I've been so busy.

599
01:11:32,561 --> 01:11:34,187
What are you doing right now?

600
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:36,022
Nothing.

601
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:39,442
I'm starting to understand
what the doctor's saying

602
01:11:39,484 --> 01:11:41,736
20% of the time now.

603
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:48,242
It's funny because I always thought
it was the doctor's writing

604
01:11:48,283 --> 01:11:50,369
that was supposed
to be incomprehensible.

605
01:11:51,495 --> 01:11:53,788
Maybe it's different
with animal doctors.

606
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,960
Ah, that's better.

607
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:08,719
Are you expecting someone?

608
01:12:12,514 --> 01:12:14,474
Did you forget my blouse?

609
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:17,977
No?!

610
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:26,652
You're not sore about me
and Ambrosia, are you?

611
01:12:27,653 --> 01:12:29,363
I'm not sore.

612
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:31,406
You understand
it's not serious, right?

613
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:33,575
It's just a piece of ass.

614
01:12:35,702 --> 01:12:37,370
Whoa!

615
01:12:37,412 --> 01:12:39,831
Whoa.

616
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:45,711
Oh, please don't hurt me, May.

617
01:12:45,753 --> 01:12:47,504
Pleasey-please.

618
01:12:48,672 --> 01:12:50,632
I trust you.

619
01:13:01,142 --> 01:13:03,352
I know you would
never hurt me, May.

620
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:44,348
What are you doing here?

621
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:46,225
Where's Polly?

622
01:13:48,018 --> 01:13:49,728
In the head.

623
01:13:51,021 --> 01:13:52,981
Polly, hurry up in there!

624
01:13:53,023 --> 01:13:57,360
I've been drinking vodka all night
and I have to piss like a racehorse!

625
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:04,283
You have really beautiful legs.

626
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,414
I thought they were gams?

627
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,792
Gams, stems, wheels,
whatever.

628
01:14:19,130 --> 01:14:22,216
Give us a little spin, doll.

629
01:14:23,384 --> 01:14:24,635
Huh?

630
01:14:24,677 --> 01:14:26,929
Turn around for me.

631
01:14:26,971 --> 01:14:29,223
You are so fucking weird.

632
01:14:31,016 --> 01:14:33,018
I don't know
what Polly sees in you.

633
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,771
Polly doesn't see anything.

634
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:39,524
Turn around, Miss Grable.

635
01:14:40,817 --> 01:14:42,735
Okay, doll.

636
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:54,079
How was that?

637
01:14:55,622 --> 01:14:57,373
Beautiful.

638
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,268
Sweet costume.

639
01:15:18,309 --> 01:15:20,311
You got any cold ones
in there?

640
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:22,480
Yes, I do.

641
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,856
What are you doing here?

642
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:21,659
Hello.
Anyone home?

643
01:16:22,785 --> 01:16:24,620
I need them, Adam.

644
01:16:26,288 --> 01:16:29,374
Listen, sister,
Adam's taken for the evening.

645
01:16:30,959 --> 01:16:32,878
I like your earrings.

646
01:16:34,462 --> 01:16:36,256
Thanks.

647
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:37,799
Nice costume.

648
01:16:39,467 --> 01:16:41,511
Thank you.
I made it myself.

649
01:16:43,471 --> 01:16:45,472
Just like one
of your movies, Adam.

650
01:16:45,514 --> 01:16:47,099
May...

651
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:51,937
what are you doing here?

652
01:16:51,978 --> 01:16:53,939
This is May?

653
01:16:55,106 --> 01:16:58,568
Do you want to come in
for a drink or something?

654
01:17:03,948 --> 01:17:05,574
Thank you.

655
01:17:21,005 --> 01:17:23,215
You should have called.

656
01:17:23,257 --> 01:17:25,217
Would you have answered?

657
01:17:25,259 --> 01:17:27,386
If I was home, yes.

658
01:17:27,428 --> 01:17:30,222
Doesn't matter.
I didn't come here to see you.

659
01:17:30,264 --> 01:17:32,099
Vodka okay?

660
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,476
Sounds great.

661
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,697
Did something happen?

662
01:17:51,908 --> 01:17:53,577
Touch me.

663
01:17:54,661 --> 01:17:56,454
Touch my face.

664
01:17:59,499 --> 01:18:02,209
Go on, Adam, touch my face.

665
01:18:07,006 --> 01:18:10,133
- Stop that!
- These hands are mine now, honey.

666
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,968
No, they are mine, quagledoo.

667
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:14,596
Fuck you. What is that,
Russian or something?

668
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:19,934
Touch my face.

669
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:25,105
Yeah, fucking go on, asshole.

670
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:27,316
Fucking touch away,
I don't give a shit.

671
01:18:34,447 --> 01:18:36,116
Um...

672
01:18:39,869 --> 01:18:41,579
Okay,

673
01:18:41,621 --> 01:18:43,497
I'm pretty drunk

674
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:46,166
and I'm feeling queasy
and I just wish you would leave.

675
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:50,587
Fine, you know what,
I'm out of here.

676
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:52,756
Not you, dumbshit.

677
01:18:54,007 --> 01:18:55,925
Dumbshit?

678
01:18:55,967 --> 01:18:57,886
I guess that would be me.

679
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,222
You're not going to touch
my face?

680
01:19:07,728 --> 01:19:09,730
Fine, I'll touch your face.

681
01:19:38,923 --> 01:19:41,092
You're going to look perfect.

682
01:23:02,943 --> 01:23:05,404
You have all of the parts.

683
01:23:10,117 --> 01:23:12,077
Words can't describe.

684
01:23:17,624 --> 01:23:20,251
But I don't have
to talk to you, do I?

685
01:23:22,003 --> 01:23:23,546
I can just...

686
01:23:23,587 --> 01:23:25,631
feel.

687
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:31,720
And you'll feel it right here, too.

688
01:23:47,484 --> 01:23:49,278
Right.

689
01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:56,951
You can't see me.

690
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:14,926
Can't see me.

691
01:26:52,529 --> 01:26:54,531
See me!

692
01:26:58,201 --> 01:27:00,036
All I want...

693
01:27:03,706 --> 01:27:05,708
is see me.

694
01:27:14,215 --> 01:27:16,217
What...

695
01:28:37,917 --> 01:28:41,546
# Bring us all the children #

696
01:28:41,587 --> 01:28:45,674
# Because they are sweet #

697
01:28:45,716 --> 01:28:49,678
# Toss them up into the air #

698
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:53,848
# They come down and swing their feet #

699
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:57,685
# Twirling all the while #

700
01:28:57,727 --> 01:29:02,231
# Tumbling in a pile #

701
01:29:06,026 --> 01:29:10,030
# They are good #

702
01:29:10,072 --> 01:29:14,284
# What a treat #

703
01:29:14,326 --> 01:29:18,329
# Bring us all the children #

704
01:29:18,371 --> 01:29:22,416
# Just when they are sweet #

705
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:26,670
# Wanderlust and packed with pride #

706
01:29:26,712 --> 01:29:30,632
# When they laugh and go inside #

707
01:29:30,674 --> 01:29:34,636
# Echoing all the while #

708
01:29:34,678 --> 01:29:38,806
# Tumbling in a pile #

709
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:46,897
# They are good #

710
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:50,817
# Good to eat #

711
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:55,196
# Bring us all the children #

712
01:29:55,238 --> 01:29:59,283
# Even when they're not so sweet #

713
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:03,412
# Toss them up into the air #

714
01:30:03,454 --> 01:30:07,708
# They come down and get a treat #

715
01:30:11,503 --> 01:30:15,298
# Bringing tea #

716
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:19,635
# A good night's sleep #

717
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:24,974
# It goes away. #

718
01:30:33,523 --> 01:30:37,443
#... Love you #

719
01:30:37,485 --> 01:30:43,032
# You were perfect,
and you were made to be #

720
01:30:43,074 --> 01:30:46,619
# That's all, that's all
we had to do #

721
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:49,538
# That's all, that's all
we had to see #

722
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:52,541
# That's all, that's all
you faked, you weaved #

723
01:30:52,582 --> 01:30:56,461
# Walls and walls and walls
and walls and walls #

724
01:30:56,503 --> 01:30:59,589
# Things that I see #

725
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:02,675
# Don't know what they mean #

726
01:31:02,717 --> 01:31:05,844
# But this I threw in #

727
01:31:05,886 --> 01:31:09,097
# Good to be all caught up #

728
01:31:09,139 --> 01:31:14,185
# With no place to go #

729
01:31:14,227 --> 01:31:17,063
# You were carried away with the words #

730
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:21,108
# And I couldn't follow #

731
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:26,864
# They were made up,
yet used so cautiously #

732
01:31:26,905 --> 01:31:30,367
# You were perfect in every way #

733
01:31:30,409 --> 01:31:33,662
# You were made to love me #

734
01:31:33,703 --> 01:31:37,081
# Well, that's all,
that's all we had to do #

735
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:39,751
# That's all, that's all
we had to see #

736
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:42,878
# I saw, I saw you
straight through these #

737
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,007
# Walls and walls and walls
and walls and walls #

738
01:31:47,049 --> 01:31:49,885
# Things that I see #

739
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:53,430

01:32:04,732 --> 01:32:07,484
# And the only thing that I know #

744
01:32:07,526 --> 01:32:11,530
# I was made to love you #

745

748
01:32:31,256 --> 01:32:34,592
# Good to be all dolled up #

749
01:32:34,634 --> 01:32:38,554
# The things that we see #

750
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:41,432
# You never come clean #

751
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:44,477
# But you know what we mean #

752
01:32:44,518 --> 01:32:47,855
