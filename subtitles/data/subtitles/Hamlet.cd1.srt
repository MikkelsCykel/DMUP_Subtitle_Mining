1
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,718
I have of late,
wherefore I know not...

2
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,064
lost all my mirth.

3
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:47,494
What a piece of work is a man.

4
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,914
How noble in reason,
how infinite in faculties.

5
00:01:51,164 --> 00:01:53,458
In form, in moving,

6
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,543
how express and admirable.

7
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:59,589
In action, how like an ángel.
In apprehensión, how like a god.

8
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,768
The beauty of the worid,

9
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:18,608
the paragon of animals.

10
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:23,029
And yet to me...

11
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:29,244
what is this
quintessence of dust?

12
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,595
Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death...

13
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,639
our memory be green

14
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,559
and that it is us befitted
to bear our heart in grief,

15
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,813
and our whole kingdom to be
contracted in one brow of woe.

16
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:01,276
Yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature

17
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,820
that we with wisest sorrow
think on him

18
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:06,531
together with remembrance
of ourselves.

19
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:10,160
Therefore our sometime sister,

20
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,245
now our Queen,

21
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:15,999
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state

22
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:19,335
have we, as 'twere,
with a defeated joy,

23
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:23,840
with an auspicious
and dropping eye,

24
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:27,469
with mirth and funeral,
and with dirge in marriage,

25
00:03:27,677 --> 00:03:31,306
in equal scale,
weighing delight and dole,

26
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,517
taken to wife.

27
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,074
Nor have we herein
barred your better wisdoms

28
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:53,244
which have freely gone
with this affair along.

29
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:54,704
For all...

30
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,247
Our thanks.

31
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,836
Now follow that you know,

32
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,297
young Fortinbras,

33
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:07,509
holding a weak supposal
of our worth

34
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:11,221
or thinking by our late
dear brother's death

35
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:13,389
our state to be disjoint
and out of frame,

36
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,934
co-leagued with this
dream of his advantage,

37
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:20,396
he hath not failed to
pester us with message,

38
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:23,566
importing the surrender of
those lands

39
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:25,109
lost by his father,

40
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:29,322
with all bond of law
to our most valiant brother.

41
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,742
So much for him.

42
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:48,800
And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?

43
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:52,178
The head is not more native to
the heart, the hand to the mouth,

44
00:04:52,387 --> 00:04:54,556
than the throne of Denmark
to thy father.

45
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:56,516
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

46
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,686
My dread lord, your leave
and favour to return to France,

47
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:03,606
from whence, though willing I come
to show my duty in your coronation,

48
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:07,318
now I must confess that duty done,
my thoughts bend again to France.

49
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,196
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

50
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:15,118
He has wrung from me by slow leave,
by laboursome petition

51
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,453
and at last upon his will

52
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:20,415
I sealed my hard consent.

53
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:24,502
I do beseech you
give him leave to go.

54
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:27,672
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.
Time be thine,

55
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,176
and thy best grace.
Spend it at thy will.

56
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:36,806
My cousin Hamlet, and my son.

57
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:40,768
How is it that the clouds
still hang on you?

58
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:42,312
Hamlet,

59
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,690
cast thy nighted colour off,

60
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,651
and let thine eye look like
a friend on Denmark.

61
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:53,114
Do not with veiled lids seek for
thy noble father in the dust.

62
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:56,201
Thou know'st 'tis common.

63
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:00,121
All that lives must die,
passing through nature to eternity.

64
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,207
Ay, madam, it is common.

65
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,917
If it be,

66
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:07,045
why seems it so
particular with thee?

67
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,255
Seems, madam?

68
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,261
Nay, it is.
I know not seems.

69
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:18,389
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother,

70
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:22,060
nor customary suits
of solemn black,

71
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:24,354
nor windy suspiration

72
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,023
of forced breath. No.

73
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:30,610
Nor the fruitful river in the eye
that can denote me truly.

74
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:32,654
These indeed seem.

75
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:36,324
They are actions
that a man might play.

76
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:39,118
But I have within
that passeth show

77
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,454
these but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

78
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:49,462
'Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet,

79
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,382
to give these mourning duties
to your father.

80
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:55,051
That father lost,
lost his,

81
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,553
and the survivor bound

82
00:06:56,803 --> 00:07:00,348
in filial obligation for some term
to do obsequious sorrow.

83
00:07:00,557 --> 00:07:04,519
But to persevere in condolement
is impious stubbornness.

84
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:06,229
'Tis unmanly grief.

85
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,691
It shows a will most incorrect
to heaven,

86
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:13,111
a heart unfortified,
a mind impatient.

87
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:17,323
For your intent on going back
to school in Wittenberg

88
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,451
is most retrograde
to our desire.

89
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,788
We beseech you to remain in
the care and comfort of our eye.

90
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,959
Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

91
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:32,088
Stay with us, go not
to Wittenberg.

92
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:35,758
I shall in all my best
obey you, madam.

93
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,244
O that this too too solid flesh
would melt,

94
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:06,372
thaw and resolve itself
into a dew.

95
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:11,419
Or the Everlasting had not fixed
his canon against self slaughter.

96
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:15,006
O God, how weary, stale,

97
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:17,175
flat and unprofitable seem to me

98
00:08:17,383 --> 00:08:18,927
all the uses of this worid.

99
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:23,598
'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed.

100
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:27,268
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.

101
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,939
That it should come to this.

102
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:34,859
But two months dead,
nay, not so much, not two.

103
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:37,111
So excellent a king, that was

104
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,657
to this, Hyperion to a satyr.

105
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,828
So loving to my mother that
he might not beteem the winds

106
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,205
visit her face too roughly.

107
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:49,582
She would hang on him as if

108
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,045
increase of appetite grew by
what it fed on, yet within a month,

109
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,048
I may not think on it.

110
00:08:57,882 --> 00:09:00,218
Frailty, thy name is woman.

111
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,054
O little month,

112
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:05,640
or ere these shoes were old

113
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,018
with which she followed
my poor father's body,

114
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,854
like Niobe, all tears.

115
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,898
Why she, even she, O, God.

116
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:17,986
A beast that wants discourse of
reason would have mourned longer.

117
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,530
Married with my uncle,
my father's brother,

118
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,158
but no more like my father
than I to Hercules.

119
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:25,201
Within a month.

120
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:28,538
Ere yet the salt of most
unrighteous tears had left

121
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:30,540
the flushing in her galled eyes,

122
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,041
she married.

123
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,085
O most wicked speed,

124
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:38,590
to post with such dexterity
to incestuous sheets.

125
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,633
It is not,

126
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:43,845
nor it cannot come to good,
but break my heart

127
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,681
for I must hold my tongue.

128
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:26,971
What make you from Wittenberg?

129
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:27,972
Marcella.

130
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,390
My good lord.

131
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,642
I am very glad to see you.

132
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,851
Good even, sir.

133
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:35,772
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

134
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:38,316
A truant disposition,
good my lord.

135
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,486
What is your affair in Elsinore?

136
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:44,197
I came to see
your father's funeral.

137
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:47,951
I prithee, do not mock me,
it was to see my mother's wedding.

138
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,286
Indeed, it followed hard upon.

139
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,372
Thrift, Horatio.

140
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,167
The funeral baked meats did
coldly furnish the marriage tables.

141
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:58,628
Would I have met my dearest foe
in Heaven

142
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,089
or ever I had seen that day.

143
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,594
My father.
Methinks I see my father.

144
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:08,471
Where, my lord?

145
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:11,850
In my mind's eye.

146
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:17,188
I saw him once.
He was a goodly king.

147
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:21,151
He was a man, take him for all,
I shall not see his like again.

148
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,403
I think I saw him,

149
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,031
yesternight.

150
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,409
Saw? Who?

151
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,745
My lord, the King, your father.

152
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,789
The King, my father?

153
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:40,128
Season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear

154
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:44,257
while I deliver upon witness of
this gentleman this marvel to you.

155
00:11:44,716 --> 00:11:48,052
In the dead waste of the middle of
the night, the apparition comes.

156
00:11:58,062 --> 00:11:59,522
Where was this?

157
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:02,317
Upon the platform where we watched.

158
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:03,818
'Tis here.

159
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,372
Did you not speak to it?

160
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:18,750
I did, but answer made it none.

161
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,462
Yet once, methought,
it lifted up its head,

162
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,006
like as if it would speak.

163
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,010
Stay, illusión.

164
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:34,307
If thou hast any sound or use
of voice, speak to me.

165
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:38,603
It is offended.

166
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:43,149
If there be good to be done
that may to thee do ease,

167
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:46,528
and grace to me, speak to me.

168
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:50,406
Speak! Speak!

169
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,576
I charge thee, speak.

170
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,377
'Tis very strange.

171
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,838
As I do live, my lord,
'tis true.

172
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:08,424
And we did think of it our duty
to let you know of it.

173
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:11,928
Indeed, indeed,
but this troubles me.

174
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:15,557
Hold you the watch again tonight?

175
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:16,933
I do, my lord.

176
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:22,939
What looked he, frowningly?

177
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:25,567
A countenance more in sorrow
than in anger.

178
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,069
And fixed his eyes upon you?

179
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:29,154
Most constantly.

180
00:13:29,362 --> 00:13:30,947
How would I have been there.

181
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,532
I would have much amazed you.

182
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:33,992
I will watch tonight.

183
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,536
I will speak to it
though hell itself should

184
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,955
gape and bid me hold my peace.

185
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:40,999
And I pray you all,
if you have hitherto concealed

186
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:44,169
this sight, let it be
tenable in your silence still.

187
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,547
And what shall hap tonight,
give it understanding but no tongue.

188
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:52,093
I will require your loves.
So fare you well.

189
00:13:57,724 --> 00:14:00,894
Upon on the platform,
twixt 11 and 12, I'll visit you.

190
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,687
Our duty to your honour.

191
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,315
Your loves as mine to you.
Farewell.

192
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,322
Would the night were come.

193
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:15,700
Till then, sit still my soul.

194
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,871
Foul deeds will rise,

195
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:24,501
though all the earth
o'erwhelm them to men's eyes.

196
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:29,798
Perhaps he loves you now,

197
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:31,925
and now no soil nor cautel

198
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,886
doth besmirch the virtue
of his will.

199
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,890
But you must fear.

200
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:44,354
His virtue weighed,
his will is not his own,

201
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:47,148
for he is subject to his birth.

202
00:14:55,865 --> 00:14:59,327
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
carve for himself,

203
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,664
for on his choice depends

204
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:05,083
the health and safety of this state.

205
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:08,044
Therefore must his choice be
circumscribed unto the voice

206
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,004
of that body whereof he is head.

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,092
Then if he says he loves you,
it fits your wisdom to believe it

208
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,594
as he in his particular act
and place

209
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,555
may give his saying deed which is

210
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,807
no further than the main voice
of Denmark goes withal.

211
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:30,150
Then weigh what loss your
honour may sustain if with too...

212
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,193
credent ear

213
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:33,695
you list his songs,

214
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,197
or lose your heart.

215
00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:44,164
Or your chaste treasure open to

216
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,876
his ummastered importunity.

217
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:56,301
Fear it, Ophelia.

218
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,805
Fear it, my dear sister.

219
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,892
Keep you in the rear
of your affection,

220
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,269
out of shot and danger of desire.

221
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,942
Best safety lies in fear.

222
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,990
Youth to itself rebels,

223
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,659
though none else near.

224
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:28,416
I shall the effect of
this good lesson keep,

225
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,251
as watchman to my heart.

226
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:36,216
But good my brother do not,
as some ungracious pastors do,

227
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:39,177
show me the steep and thorny
way to heaven

228
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:40,762
while like a puffed
and reckless libertine

229
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,932
himself the primrose path
of dalliance treads...

230
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,560
and recks not his own creed.

231
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,065
Fear me not.

232
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,819
I stay too long.

233
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:01,157
A double blessing
is a double grace.

234
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:04,077
Occasión smiles upon a second leave.

235
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:11,709
Yet here, Laertes?

236
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:14,212
Aboard, aboard for shame.

237
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:17,215
The wind sits in the shoulder

238
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:19,175
of your sail, and you stayed for?

239
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:21,261
My blessing with thee.

240
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:26,141
And these few precepts,

241
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:28,893
in thy memory look thou character.

242
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,106
Give thy thoughts no tongue,

243
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:36,526
nor unproportioned thought his act.

244
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:40,405
Be thou familiar,
but by no means vulgar.

245
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:45,577
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried,

246
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:49,622
grapple them to thy soul
with hoops of steel.

247
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,835
But do not dull thy palm

248
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,671
with entertainment of each
new-hatched, unpledged comrade.

249
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,053
Beware of entrance to a quarrel,

250
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,055
but being in it,

251
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:09,767
bear it that the opposed
may beware of thee.

252
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,230
Give every man thy ear,
but few thy voice.

253
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:18,693
Take each man's censure,
but reserve thy judgement.

254
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:23,198
Costly thy habit
as thy purse can buy,

255
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,991
but not expressed in fancy.

256
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:28,661
Rich, not gaudy.

257
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:32,540
For the apparel
oft proclaims the man.

258
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,171
Neither a borrower
nor a lender be,

259
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,717
for loan oft loses
both itself and friend.

260
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,975
This above all,
to thine own self be true,

261
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:54,521
and it must follow,
as the night the day,

262
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,773
thou canst not be false to any man.

263
00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:06,699
I humbly take my leave, my lord.

264
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:08,827
The time invites you. Go.

265
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:15,875
Farewell, Ophelia.

266
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,139
Remember well what I said to you.

267
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:11,032
Angels and ministers of grace
defend us!

268
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,245
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damned,

269
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:18,706
bring with thee airs of heaven
or blasts from hell,

270
00:21:18,998 --> 00:21:22,377
thou com'st in such questionable
shape that I'll speak to thee.

271
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,637
Mark me.

272
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:35,598
I will.

273
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:59,706
My hour is almost come

274
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:05,336
when I to sulphurous and tormenting
flames must render up myself.

275
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:06,588
Alas, poor ghost.

276
00:22:06,838 --> 00:22:07,922
Pity me not.

277
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:11,050
But lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

278
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:14,345
Speak. I am bound to hear.

279
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,140
I am thy father's spirit,

280
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:21,186
doomed for a term to walk the night

281
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,730
and by day to fast in fires till

282
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:27,609
the foul crimes done in my days
of nature of are burnt and purged.

283
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,574
But that I am forbid to tell
the secrets of my prison house,

284
00:22:34,824 --> 00:22:37,994
I could a tale unfold whose
lightest word would harrow thy soul,

285
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:40,622
freeze thy young blood,

286
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:45,460
make thy two eyes like stars
start from their spheres,

287
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:50,715
thy knotted and combined locks
to part,

288
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:54,844
and each to stand on end
like upon the fretful porcupine.

289
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,062
But this eternal blazon must not
be the ears of flesh and blood.

290
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:07,273
List, list, o list!
If thou did'st ever

291
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:08,900
thy dear father love.

292
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,068
O God!

293
00:23:10,276 --> 00:23:12,904
Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

294
00:23:13,154 --> 00:23:14,155
Murder?

295
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:15,907
Murder most foul,
as in the best it is,

296
00:23:16,324 --> 00:23:19,661
but this most foul,
strange, unnatural.

297
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,209
Now,

298
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:30,130
Hamlet, dear.

299
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:39,222
'Tis given out that
sleeping in my orchard,

300
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,057
a serpent stung me.

301
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:45,311
So the whole ear of Denmark
is by a forged process

302
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,689
of my death rankly abused.

303
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:51,151
But know, nobled youth, the serpent
that did sting thy father's life

304
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,735
now wears his crown.

305
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:53,903
My uncle!

306
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:57,949
Ay, that incestuous, adulterate
beast with witchcraft of his wit,

307
00:23:58,158 --> 00:24:02,078
with traitorous gifts, wicked
gifts with the power to seduce,

308
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,622
won to his shameful lust
the will of

309
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:07,917
my most seeming-virtuous queen.

310
00:24:09,627 --> 00:24:13,214
O, Hamlet, what a falling off
was there from me,

311
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,341
whose love was of a dignity that

312
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,261
it went hand in hand with
the vow I made to her in marriage.

313
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:20,722
And to decline upon a wretch

314
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,184
whose natural gifts were
poor to those of mine.

315
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:31,608
But soft,

316
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,736
methinks I scent the morning air.

317
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:36,070
Brief let me be.

318
00:24:39,282 --> 00:24:42,452
Sleeping in my orchard,
my custom of the afternoon,

319
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,246
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

320
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:48,208
with juice of cursed hebona
in a vial,

321
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,961
and in the porches of my ears
did pour the leprous distillment

322
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,507
whose effect holds such enmity
with the blood of man

323
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:59,177
that swift as quicksilver
it courses through the body

324
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:01,429
and with sudden vigour it curds

325
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:03,348
like eager droppings into milk,

326
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,266
the thin and wholesome blood.

327
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,521
So did it mine.

328
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:14,275
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand...

329
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:20,114
unhouseled, disappointed,
no reckoning made,

330
00:25:20,323 --> 00:25:22,826
but sent to my account with
all my imperfections on my head.

331
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:27,288
O horrible, horrible,
most horrible!

332
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:37,590
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not.

333
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,302
Let not the royal bed of Denmark

334
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:43,888
be a couch for luxury
and damned incest.

335
00:25:48,977 --> 00:25:52,313
But howsoever thou pursuest
this act, taint not thy mind.

336
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:56,151
Nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother.

337
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,656
Leave her to Heaven

338
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,494
and to those thorns
that in her bosom lodge,

339
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:08,538
to prick and sting her.

340
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:13,334
Fare thee well at once.

341
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:18,882
Remember me.

342
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:33,980
The time is out of joint.

343
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:36,149
O cursed spite,

344
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:39,861
that ever I was born
to set it right.

345
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:50,455
My lord.

346
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,707
What news, my lord?

347
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:04,302
O day and night,
but this is wondrous strange.

348
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,599
Therefore as a stranger
give him welcome.

349
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:13,561
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

350
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,064
than are dreamt of
in our philosophy.

351
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:24,489
My fate cries out.

352
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:38,628
What is it, Ophelia,
he hath sent you?

353
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:42,590
So please you, something
touching the lord Hamlet.

354
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:46,928
Marry, well bethought.
What is between you?

355
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:49,556
Give me up the truth.

356
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:55,311
He hath, of late, made many
tenders of his affection to me.

357
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,606
Affection!

358
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:08,575
Think yourself a baby,

359
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:13,163
that you take these tenders for
true pay, which are not sterling.

360
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:16,708
Tender yourself more dearly.

361
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,004
He hath importuned me with
love in honourable fashion.

362
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:23,381
When the blood burns,

363
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:27,051
how prodigal the soul
doth lend the tongue vows.

364
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,679
These blazes, daughter,

365
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,099
given more light than heat,
extinct in both,

366
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:37,187
even in their promise
as it is a-making,

367
00:28:37,437 --> 00:28:39,564
you must not take for fire.

368
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,901
I do not know what I should think.

369
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:48,448
From this time,

370
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:52,660
be scanter of your maiden presence.

371
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:57,040
Set your entreatments
at a higher rate,

372
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:59,584
than a command to parley.

373
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:04,255
The Lord Hamlet, believe in him
so much that he is young

374
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:08,134
and with a larger tether may he
walk than may be given you.

375
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:13,681
Do not believe his vows.

376
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:17,268
I would not, in plain terms,

377
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:19,521
from this time forth,

378
00:29:20,188 --> 00:29:22,357
have you so slander

379
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,818
any moment leisure as to give
words or talk

380
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:27,237
with the Lord Hamlet.

381
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:33,034
Look to it.

382
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:35,328
I charge you.

383
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,715
<i>We have the word "to be".</i>

384
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:50,844
<i>But what I propose ¡s
the word "to Inter-be".</i>

385
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,513
<i>"Inter-be".</i>

386
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,474
<i>It ¡s not poss¡ble to be alone,</i>

387
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:58,685
<i>to be by yourself.</i>

388
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:03,022
<i>You need other people
¡n order to be.</i>

389
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:06,401
<i>You need other be¡ngs
¡n order to be.</i>

390
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:09,237
<i>Not only you need
father, mother,</i>

391
00:30:09,445 --> 00:30:10,989
<i>but also uncle,</i>

392
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,867
<i>or brother, s¡ster,</i>

393
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,535
<i>soc¡ety.</i>

394
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,829
<i>But you also need sunsh¡ne,</i>

395
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:21,791
<i>r¡ver, a¡r, trees,</i>

396
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:25,587
<i>b¡rds, elephants,
and so on.</i>

397
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:27,755
<i>So ¡t ¡s ¡mposs¡ble to be</i>

398
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:30,216
<i>by yourself, alone.</i>

399
00:30:30,592 --> 00:30:32,844
<i>You have to "¡nter-be"</i>

400
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:35,263
<i>w¡th everyone and everyth¡ng else.</i>

401
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:39,017
<i>And therefore to be
means to "¡nter-be".</i>

402
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:56,743
To the celestial
and my soul's idol...

403
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,968
the most beautified Ophelia.

404
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:19,265
Doubt that the stars are fire,

405
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,935
doubt that the sun doth move,

406
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,065
doubt truth to be a liar,

407
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:31,069
but never doubt my love.

408
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,603
<i>To be or not to be.</i>

409
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:39,239
<i>To be or not to be.</i>

410
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:54,087
<i>So oft ¡t chances
¡n part¡cular men</i>

411
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,965
<i>that for some v¡c¡ous
mole of nature ¡n them</i>

412
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:59,759
<i>or by some hab¡t
that too much overleavens</i>

413
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:02,178
<i>the form of plaus¡ble manners,</i>

414
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:04,264
<i>that these men,</i>

415
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:09,060
<i>carry¡ng, I say,
the stamp of one defect,</i>

416
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:14,399
<i>the¡r v¡rtues else they
as pure as grace,</i>

417
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:16,568
<i>shall ¡n the general censure
take corrupt¡on...</i>

418
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:18,361
How goes my good Lord Hamlet?

419
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,071
Well, God-a-mercy.

420
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,656
Do you know me, my lord?

421
00:34:21,865 --> 00:34:24,576
Excellent well.
You are a fishmonger.

422
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:25,869
Not I, my lord.

423
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:27,996
Then I would you were
so honest a man.

424
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:29,038
Honest, my lord?

425
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,708
Ay, sir. To be honest,
as this worid goes,

426
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,626
<i>¡s to one man of ten thousand.</i>

427
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:35,170
<i>That ¡s very true, my lord.</i>

428
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:38,089
Have you a daughter?

429
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:40,758
I have, my lord.

430
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:43,136
Let her not walk in the sun.

431
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:48,016
Conception is a blessing,
but as your daughter may conceive,

432
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:50,852
friend, look to it.

433
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:57,984
<i>How say you by that?</i>

434
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:02,238
<i>St¡ll harp¡ng on my daughter.
He ¡s far gone.</i>

435
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:05,158
<i>And truly ¡n my youth</i>

436
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:07,535
<i>I suffered much for love.</i>

437
00:35:09,162 --> 00:35:11,331
Will you go out into the air?

438
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:12,832
Into my grave.

439
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:18,338
My honourable lord,
I humbly take my leave of you.

440
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:21,424
You cannot take from me anything
I will not willingly part,

441
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,804
except my life.

442
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:30,558
Except my life.

443
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:33,144
Except my life.

444
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:38,900
Except my life.

445
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,292
My liege.

446
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:59,295
My liege, and madam.

447
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:04,884
To expostulate...

448
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:06,970
what majesty should be,

449
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,055
what duty is,

450
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,933
why day is day,
night, night,

451
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:15,562
and time is time,
where nothing but to waste...

452
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,605
night, day and time.

453
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:20,567
Therefore, since brevity

454
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,777
is the soul of wit

455
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:26,823
and tediousness the limbs
and outward flourishes,

456
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:28,908
I will be brief.

457
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:33,329
Your noble son is mad.

458
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,416
Mad call I it, for to define

459
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:39,252
true madness, what is it but...

460
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,629
to be nothing else but mad?

461
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:43,673
But let that go.

462
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:46,342
More matter, less art.

463
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:48,928
I swear I use no art at all.

464
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:53,475
That he is mad, 'tis true,
'tis true, 'tis pity,

465
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:57,520
and pity 'tis, 'tis true
a foolish figure, but farewell it,

466
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:59,814
for I will use no art.

467
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:02,525
Mad let us grant him then.

468
00:37:02,984 --> 00:37:05,487
Now remains for us to find out

469
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:07,655
the cause of this effect.

470
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,949
Or rather the cause of this defect.

471
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:13,870
For this effect,
defective comes by cause.

472
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,499
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus.

473
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,796
Perpend: I have a daughter,

474
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:27,133
have while she is mine,
who in her duty,

475
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:31,346
and obedience, mark,
hath given me this.

476
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:34,307
Gather now and surmise.

477
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,645
Came this from Hamlet to her?

478
00:37:39,437 --> 00:37:43,107
"I have no art to reckon my groans.
I love thee best, O most best.

479
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,318
Every thought of thine,

480
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:49,239
ever more whist this machine
is to him, Hamlet. "

481
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:55,662
This in obedience
hath my daughter shown to me.

482
00:37:55,912 --> 00:37:58,164
And more above,

483
00:37:58,414 --> 00:38:00,458
hath his solicitings

484
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:05,964
as they fell out by time, means
and place all given to my ear.

485
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,386
How hath she received his love?

486
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:22,021
What do you think of me?

487
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:26,651
As of a man,
faithful and honourable.

488
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:29,571
I would fain prove so.

489
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:33,700
But what might you think had I
seen this hot love on the wing,

490
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:36,953
as I perceived
before my daughter told me,

491
00:38:37,287 --> 00:38:40,540
what might you or
my dear Majesty think

492
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,835
if I had looked upon
this love with idle sight?

493
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:46,129
What might you think?

494
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,883
No, I went round to work

495
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,844
and my young mistress
thus I did bespeak:

496
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:56,681
"Lord Hamlet is a prince,

497
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:58,558
out of thy star.

498
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,977
This must not be. "

499
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,242
She took the fruits of
my advice and he repelled,

500
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:19,120
a short tale to make,

501
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,872
fell into a sadness,

502
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,707
then into a fast,

503
00:39:22,957 --> 00:39:26,377
thence to a watch,
thence into a weakness,

504
00:39:26,753 --> 00:39:30,507
thence to a lightness
and by this declensión

505
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:32,467
into the madness

506
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:35,345
wherein now he raves,

507
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:39,557
and all we mourn for.

508
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,644
Do you think 'tis this?

509
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:45,730
It may be, very like.

510
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:49,901
Take this from this,
if this be otherwise.

511
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,827
If circumstances lead me,

512
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,037
I will find where truth is hid,

513
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,999
though it were hid, indeed,
within the centre.

514
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:19,264
To be or not to be,
that is the question.

515
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:23,184
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

516
00:40:23,393 --> 00:40:27,188
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

517
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:30,900
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles

518
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:33,820
and by opposing,
end them.

519
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:35,238
To die,

520
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:38,283
to sleep...

521
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:41,119
no more.

522
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:44,539
And by a sleep to say
we end the heartache

523
00:40:44,747 --> 00:40:47,292
and the thousand natural shocks
the flesh is heir to.

524
00:40:48,668 --> 00:40:51,963
'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished.

525
00:40:53,673 --> 00:40:55,008
To die,

526
00:40:56,426 --> 00:40:59,179
to sleep, perchance to dream.

527
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:04,976
There's the rub.

528
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,646
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come, when we

529
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:12,233
have shuffled off this
mortal coil, must give us pause.

530
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:14,611
There's the respect

531
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:18,615
that makes calamity
of so long a life.

532
00:41:20,408 --> 00:41:24,037
For who could bear
the whips and scorns of time,

533
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:26,790
the proud man's contumely,

534
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:30,001
the insolence of office,
the law's delay,

535
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,504
the pangs of disprized love,

536
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:36,382
when he himself might
his own quietus make

537
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:38,134
with a bare bodkin?

538
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:42,931
Who would fardles bear,
to grunt and sweat

539
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:44,933
under a weary life

540
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:49,103
were it not the dread
of something after death?

541
00:41:49,854 --> 00:41:51,689
The undiscovered country

542
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,192
to whose bourn no traveller returns

543
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:58,238
puzzles the will

544
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:01,199
and makes us rather bear
those ills we have

545
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:03,326
than fly to others we know not of.

546
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:06,329
And thus conscience

547
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:08,748
does make cowards of us all.

548
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:14,337
And thus the native hue
of resolution

549
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:19,926
is sicklied o'er with
the pale cast of thought

550
00:42:21,302 --> 00:42:23,930
and enterprises of
great pitch and moment

551
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,640
in this regard

552
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:28,101
their currents turn awry

553
00:42:30,854 --> 00:42:33,106
and lose the name of action.

554
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,876
My excellent good friend!

555
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:54,878
How dost thou, Guildenstern?

556
00:42:55,128 --> 00:42:56,296
Ah, Rosencrantz!

557
00:42:57,297 --> 00:42:59,841
Good lads, how do you both?

558
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:04,220
As the indifferent children
of the earth.

559
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:06,431
Happy in that
we are not overhappy.

560
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:09,642
On fortune's cap we are not
the very button.

561
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:11,936
- Nor the soles of her shoes?
- Neither, my lord.

562
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,876
What news?

563
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:39,130
None, my lord, but that
the worid's grown honest.

564
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:40,965
Then doomsday is near.

565
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:45,595
But your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular.

566
00:43:46,137 --> 00:43:48,223
What have you my friends deserved

567
00:43:48,598 --> 00:43:51,893
at the hands of fortune that
she has sent you to prison hither?

568
00:43:52,227 --> 00:43:53,770
Prison, my lord?

569
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,772
Denmark is a prison.

570
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:58,149
Then the worid is one.

571
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:00,401
A goodly one, with confines,

572
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:03,446
wards and dungeons,
Denmark being one of the worst.

573
00:44:05,114 --> 00:44:07,117
We think not so, my lord.

574
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,868
Well then 'tis none to you,

575
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:12,288
for their is neither good
nor bad but thinking makes it so.

576
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:13,998
To me it is a prison.

577
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:18,211
Your ambition makes it so.
'Tis too narrow for your mind.

578
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:19,879
O God, I could be

579
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:24,717
bound in a nutshell and count
myself king of infinite space.

580
00:44:26,761 --> 00:44:29,222
Were it not that
I have bad dreams.

581
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,601
What make you here?

582
00:44:33,935 --> 00:44:37,856
To visit you, my lord,
no other occasión.

583
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:49,284
Can you by no conference get from
him why he puts on this confusión

584
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:53,580
grating so harshly his days with
turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

585
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:56,249
<i>He confesses he feel d¡stracted,</i>

586
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:59,335
<i>but from what cause
he w¡ll 'a no means speak.</i>

587
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:02,088
<i>Nor do we f¡nd h¡m
forward to be sounded</i>

588
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:03,756
<i>but w¡th a crafty madness</i>

589
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,177
<i>keeps aloof when we would br¡ng
h¡m to confess h¡s true state.</i>

590
00:45:08,678 --> 00:45:10,263
Did he receive you well?

591
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:11,806
<i>Most I¡ke a gentleman.</i>

592
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:14,184
<i>But forces h¡s d¡spos¡t¡on.</i>

593
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:18,521
<i>N¡ggard of quest¡on, but of
our demands most free ¡n h¡s reply.</i>

594
00:45:21,483 --> 00:45:24,486
Thank you, Rosencrantz
and gentle Guildenstern.

595
00:45:24,736 --> 00:45:28,114
Thank you, Guildenstern
and gentle Rosencrantz.

596
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:32,285
<i>We lay our serv¡ce
freely at your feet.</i>

597
00:45:38,917 --> 00:45:42,086
O what a rogue
and peasant slave am I.

598
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:46,049
Is it not monstrous
that this player here,

599
00:45:46,883 --> 00:45:48,092
but in a fiction,

600
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:50,094
in a dream of passión,

601
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:53,181
could force his soul so
to his own conceit,

602
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,559
that from her working
all his visión waned,

603
00:45:56,768 --> 00:46:00,271
his whole function suiting
with forms to his conceit?

604
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,106
And all for nothing.

605
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:05,652
What would be do,

606
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,405
had he the motive and cue
for passión that I have?

607
00:46:24,003 --> 00:46:27,966
I've heard that guilty creatures,
sitting at a play

608
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:32,846
have by the cunning of the scene,
been struck so to the soul

609
00:46:33,096 --> 00:46:36,474
that presently they have
proclaimed their malefactions.

610
00:46:36,724 --> 00:46:40,728
For murder, though it hath
no tongue,

611
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:45,358
will speak with
most miraculous organ.

612
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:47,944
I know my course.

613
00:46:48,444 --> 00:46:51,156
The spirit I have seen
may be a devil.

614
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:55,118
And the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape, yea,

615
00:46:55,994 --> 00:46:59,789
and perhaps out of my weakness
and melancholy abuses to damn me.

616
00:47:00,915 --> 00:47:03,293
I'll have grounds
more relative than this.

617
00:47:04,544 --> 00:47:06,045
The play's the thing

618
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:10,717
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the King.

619
00:47:17,474 --> 00:47:18,808
'Tis most true

620
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:21,728
and he beseeched me

621
00:47:21,978 --> 00:47:24,355
to entreat your majesties

622
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:26,316
to hear and see the matter.

623
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:30,320
With all my heart and it doth
content me to hear him so inclined.

624
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:32,739
Good gentlemen,
give him a further edge

625
00:47:32,906 --> 00:47:35,825
and drive his purpose
into these delights.

626
00:47:36,075 --> 00:47:37,494
<i>We shall, my lord.</i>

627
00:47:37,702 --> 00:47:39,245
And for your part, Ophelia,

628
00:47:39,454 --> 00:47:41,915
I do wish your beauties be
the happy cause

629
00:47:42,123 --> 00:47:43,708
of Hamlet's wildness.

630
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,589
So shall I hope your virtues will
bring him to his wonted way again.

631
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:20,829
How does your honour?

632
00:48:21,913 --> 00:48:24,207
I humbly thank you. Well.

633
00:48:30,046 --> 00:48:34,175
I have remembrances of yours
I have longed to redeliver.

634
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:37,720
I pray you, receive them.

635
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:42,851
No, not I.
I never gave you aught.

636
00:48:43,309 --> 00:48:45,979
My honoured lord,
you know right well you did.

637
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:50,817
And with words of so sweet a breath
that made these things more rich.

638
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:53,778
Their perfume lost, take them.

639
00:48:53,987 --> 00:48:56,030
For to the noble mind,

640
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,658
rich gifts wax poor
when givers prove unkind.

641
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:00,910
There, my lord.

642
00:49:03,663 --> 00:49:04,914
Are you honest?

643
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,292
Lord?

644
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:10,044
Are you fair?

645
00:49:12,046 --> 00:49:13,840
What means your lordship?

646
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,469
I did love you once.

647
00:49:18,428 --> 00:49:20,263
Indeed, you made me believe so.

648
00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:22,515
You should not have believed me.

649
00:49:24,184 --> 00:49:25,643
I loved you not.

650
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:37,363
I was the more deceived.

651
00:49:47,832 --> 00:49:49,918
Get thee to a nunnery.

652
00:49:51,252 --> 00:49:53,129
Why wouldst thou be
a breeder of sinners?

653
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:58,259
I am myself indifferent honest,

654
00:49:58,468 --> 00:50:02,263
yet could accuse me of things,
better my mother had not borne me.

655
00:50:02,847 --> 00:50:04,432
I am very proud,

656
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:07,602
revengeful, ambitious,

657
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:12,440
with more offences than I have
thought to put them in,

658
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,860
imagination to give them shape,

659
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:18,655
or time to act them in.

660
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:31,876
What should such
fellows as I do,

661
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:35,088
crawling between earth
and heaven?

662
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:40,051
We are errant knaves all,
believe none of us.

663
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:06,035
Where is thy father?

664
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,707
Let the doors
be shut upon him

665
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:14,002
that he play the fool nowhere
but in his own house!

666
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,171
Get thee to a nunnery!

667
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:41,863
<i>Two messages.</i>

668
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:46,534
<i>If thou dost marry,</i>

669
00:51:46,785 --> 00:51:49,204
<i>I'll g¡ve thee th¡s plague
for thy dowry.</i>

670
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:52,081
<i>Be thou as chaste as ¡ce,
as pure as snow,</i>

671
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:54,751
<i>thou shall not escape calumny.</i>

672
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:56,503
<i>Get thee to a nunnery.</i>

673
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:58,838
<i>Go! Farewell.</i>

674
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,179
<i>We shall have no more marr¡age!</i>

675
00:52:06,971 --> 00:52:09,516
<i>Those that are marr¡ed already,
all but one,</i>

676
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:11,100
<i>shall I¡ve.</i>

677
00:52:11,392 --> 00:52:14,771
<i>The rest shall keep
as they are. To a nunnery, go.</i>

678
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:37,168
Give me that man that is not
passión's slave and I will

679
00:52:37,377 --> 00:52:39,087
wear him in my heart's core,

680
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,839
in my heart of heart, as I do thee.

681
00:52:46,302 --> 00:52:49,848
Tonight one scene comes near
the circumstances of which

682
00:52:50,056 --> 00:52:51,599
I have told thee
of my father's death.

683
00:52:51,808 --> 00:52:54,894
I pray thee, when thou seest
that act afoot, observe...

684
00:52:58,106 --> 00:53:00,900
my uncle. If his occulted guilt

685
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:03,611
do not itself unkennel
in one speech,

686
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,780
it is a damned ghost we have seen.

687
00:53:06,197 --> 00:53:08,324
Give him heedful note,

688
00:53:08,616 --> 00:53:11,035
for I mine eyes
will rivet to his face

689
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:13,872
and after we will our judgements
join in censure of his seeming.

690
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:15,331
Well, my lord.

691
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,710
Get you a place. I must be idle.

692
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:44,277
Hamlet, come sit by me.

693
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:47,989
No, mother, here's metal
more attractive.

694
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:50,533
Lady, shall I sit in your lap?

695
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:51,618
No, my lord.

696
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:54,287
I mean, my head upon your lap.

697
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:55,997
Think you I meant country matters?

698
00:53:56,372 --> 00:53:58,082
I think nothing, my lord.

699
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:02,003
Well that's a fair thought,
to lie between maid's legs.

700
00:54:02,212 --> 00:54:03,004
What is, my lord?

701
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:03,880
Nothing.

702
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:07,759
You are merry, my lord.

703
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:10,970
What should a man do
but be merry?

704
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:15,016
Look how cheerful my mother looks
and my father died within 2 hours.

705
00:54:15,517 --> 00:54:17,685
Nay, 'tis twice 2 months.

706
00:54:18,186 --> 00:54:20,980
So long? Nay then,
let the Devil wear black,

707
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:22,857
for I'll have a suit of sables.

708
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,403
O heavens! Died 2 months ago
and not forgotten yet?

709
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:31,658
Then there's hope a great man's
memory may outlive half a year.

710
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:34,536
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

711
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:39,541
Excellent.

712
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:50,541
