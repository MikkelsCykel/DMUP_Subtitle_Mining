<i>It was a nightmare.</i>
<i>So many dead people.</i>

2
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:31,039
<i>So many victims.</i>
<i>It all started a few days ago...</i>

3
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,177
<i>when I came here for a rave.</i>

4
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:36,245
<i>And, now, all that remains</i>
<i>is the rotten smell of death.</i>

5
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,855
You must stop Curien...

6
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,300
or else something terrible will happen!

7
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:16,446
Nice. So, where are they, dude?
We're gonna miss the boat.

8
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,184
<i>Greg and Simon.</i>

9
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:20,818
<i>Greg's the guy</i>
<i>I played ball with in college.</i>

10
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:24,352
<i>A good guy, if not a little goofy.</i>

11
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:28,765
<i>Simon. They say God doesn't give</i>
<i>with two hands, and they were right.</i>

12
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:31,668
<i>He got the looks,</i>
<i>but not much between those ears.</i>

13
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,871
<i>Cynthia... Greg's girlfriend.</i>
<i>Pure eye candy.</i>

14
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,673
I'm Simon.

15
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:43,147
<i>Karma. Thinks she's Foxy Brown.</i>

16
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:48,051
<i>She has a crush on Simon, but Simon</i>
<i>only has eyes for Alicia, my ex.</i>

17
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,454
<i>We broke up a few weeks ago</i>
<i>so I could study and she could fence.</i>

18
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:54,391
<i>She loves it.</i>
<i>I don't see what it's good for.</i>

19
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:57,760
Anyone have one of those invitations
with the map on it?

20
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,369
Are you sure this is where
the boat's supposed to leave from?

21
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,199
Maybe Johnnie gave you the wrong info.

22
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,604
Yeah, hon.
I'm pretty sure.

23
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,306
It says here the boat
doesn't leave until 5:00.

24
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:15,041
Yeah, and it's 5:15 now, Simon.

25
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:16,742
Shit. We're so fucked.

26
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:18,807
<i>They missed the boat to the rave.</i>

27
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:21,581
<i>If only they decided</i>
<i>to stay back in Seattle...</i>

28
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,646
<i>they'd all be alive today.</i>

29
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:18,742
Unbelievable. It's going on all weekend.
You gotta come.

30
00:04:19,646 --> 00:04:21,637
And you'll never guess who's here.

31
00:04:21,715 --> 00:04:26,152
Hello? The cell phone reception's
for shit out here.

32
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:28,619
Hello, sweetie? I'm losing you.
Are you there?

33
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:32,089
Hello? Shit!

34
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:35,753
Now, where was it
you wanted to take me to?

35
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:47,629
<i>I was trying my best</i>
<i>to function as a single guy should.</i>

36
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:51,541
<i>But at the back of my head, something</i>
<i>was nibbling away at my subconscious.</i>

37
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:00,009
Hello?

38
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,726
What you doin' over there?

39
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,955
Good evening.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

40
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,555
You got yourself some sort
of hearin' disability?

41
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:15,465
I asked you a question.

42
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,469
I've come to charter your boat, sir.

43
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:21,371
You do, huh?
Well, that's too bad...

44
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:24,239
'cause this here's a fishin' boat,
not the <i>Pacific Princess.</i>

45
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,335
Why don't you try the yellow pages?

46
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:30,042
We gotta get to this party on an island,
and we were hopin' to use your boat.

47
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,175
You're not the sharpest tool
in the shed, are ya?

48
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:36,416
I said, shove off!
Or don't you <i>sprechen Sie Englisch?</i>

49
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,787
Why don't you just name your price,
and we can skip...

50
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:40,519
the old-man-on-the-sea routine.

51
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:42,060
A man's gotta eat, right?

52
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:45,029
What part of"shove off"
didn't you understand?

53
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:47,191
Hold it.

54
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,258
Geez. Who's the U-boat commander?

55
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:53,899
- What?
- How much?

56
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,172
$300 sound fair?

57
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,939
- About 600 might.
- Six hundred? No way.

58
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:02,675
No one is talking to you.
Where are you headed, girls?

59
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:05,343
- Huh?
- I don't know. We got this map.

60
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:09,718
It's somewhere in the San Juans.
You must know where that is, right?

61
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,222
You crazy?

62
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,725
- They crazy.
- No, I don't think so.

63
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,091
- Excuse me?
- I said, forget it.

64
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:18,153
Yeah, forget it. Forget it.

65
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:21,098
- That means stop talkin', start walkin'.
- Why?

66
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:24,762
Why? Why? Why?
They always ask "why."

67
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:27,170
You know what they call this island?

68
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,538
<i>Isle del Morte.</i>

69
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:34,546
<i>Morte.</i> That's Spanish for "death,"
in case you don't speak Mexican.

70
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:37,447
Well, listen, friend,
I got me an island to catch right here.

71
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,577
And if this is some lame attempt
to hit me up for more cash...

72
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,450
It ain't.

73
00:06:42,522 --> 00:06:45,423
There ain't enough cash in the world
to make us go back there.

74
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,393
- Keep the cash. Keep the cash.
- Let's get out of here.

75
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,928
Fuck it. A grand.

76
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:56,564
What do you say 500 now,
and another five on the way back?

77
00:06:56,636 --> 00:07:00,128
You can be mighty persuasive
if you wanna be, <i>Mr...</i>

78
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:03,232
- Simon Cruz. And you are?
- Kirk's the name.

79
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:07,605
Wait, wait. Captain Kirk?

80
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
Does that make him Mr. Spock?

81
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:14,918
I don't like no Captain Kirk jokes.

82
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:20,657
Now, let's shove off before
you say something else you'll regret.

83
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:24,790
All right.

84
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,525
It's all good.

85
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,034
Cap'n! Cap'n!

86
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:37,203
I'm not goin'.
I'm not goin'.

87
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:39,370
There's evil spirits on that island.

88
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:45,042
You just get the deck lines and let me
worry about the evil spirits, okay?

89
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:47,086
<i>Ahoy there, Captain Kirk.</i>

90
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:50,850
<i>This is the</i>
<i>United States Marine Patrol.</i>

91
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:54,291
<i>Stand down and prepare</i>
<i>to be boarded, Captain.</i>

92
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:58,557
Oh, shit!

93
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:01,429
What are you gonna do?

94
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:05,301
We have no choice.
We got to do what the lady says.

95
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:08,465
It'll delay our departure
for a while, though.

96
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,237
Delay us?
For how long?

97
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:15,338
Well, I imagine they're looking
for guns, drugs, who knows what.

98
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:17,383
It'll probably take 'em a few hours.

99
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,214
And that's only
if they don't find nothin'.

100
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:24,222
How much to lose 'em?

101
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,417
<i>Did you forget what today is?</i>

102
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,426
You can lose them, right?

103
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,792
Sure I can.

104
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:33,331
Who's talking, Alexander Hamilton,
Ben Franklin or you?

105
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,029
<i>- It's the second Friday of the month!</i>
- Do it.

106
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,096
<i>Just a routine inspection, Kirk.</i>

107
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,665
<i>Don't even think</i>
<i>ofleaving my harbor.</i>

108
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:47,702
<i>Heave to! Where the hell</i>
<i>do you think you're going?</i>

109
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,411
<i>Heave to!</i>

110
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:58,517
<i>This is Casper.</i>
<i>McGyvers and I are moving out. Over.</i>

111
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:05,863
Hate to break this to you, kid,
but I would have done it for free.

112
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:10,028
The lady needs to dine
on a humble pie once in a while.

113
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:13,231
- So you've run into her before?
- Run into her?

114
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:15,797
Hell yeah.
She's had a hard-on for me...

115
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,809
ever since we got out of the service...

116
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,812
and I didn't start working
for Uncle Sam like she did.

117
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:25,312
Can't blame her for still
getting wet over me, can ya?

118
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,925
Sweet.

119
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:45,402
- Come on.
- Come on what?

120
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,837
Let's go swimming.

121
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:49,397
Now?

122
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:55,313
You're crazy.
You're pretty enough to eat.

123
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,286
- You're nuts, baby.
- Come on.

124
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:10,126
All right.

125
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:17,660
Oh, yeah.

126
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,333
Come on.

127
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:26,844
Oh, my God.
That's cold, baby.

128
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:31,272
Come on, you big wimp.

129
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:34,184
No, you go.
You have a good swim, babe.

130
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,813
Yeah, fine.

131
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:39,585
It's fine once you get in.
Come on, Matt.

132
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:41,320
You're no fun.

133
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,359
<i>He's heading out to</i>
<i>the San Juan Islands, Cap.</i>

134
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,960
<i>Just maintain speed and distance.</i>

135
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:55,166
<i>I don't want him to make us yet.</i>

136
00:11:08,087 --> 00:11:11,386
- Cynthia's such a trooper.
- Don't come near me.

137
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,551
Must've eaten something
back at the...

138
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:19,860
You know what?
Whatever you say, baby.

139
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:21,695
- God, it's cold.
- I know.

140
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,305
Greg, you look like shit, man.
Here.

141
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:32,936
Have another beer.
This'll make you feel better.

142
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,350
On my face!

143
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:50,693
Oh, yeah.

144
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,799
- Get back here.
- Come on, Matt!

145
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,706
Come on, Matt.
Don't play games.

146
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:15,704
Matt, where are you?

147
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:36,600
What a mess.
What an idiot.

148
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:42,067
Did you get
a real good peek there, perv?

149
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:44,974
I wanna give this to you.

150
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:48,241
- What's this for?
- It's for your protection.

151
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:50,043
It's okay.
I'm on the pill.

152
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:53,279
It'll ward off evil spirits.

153
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:55,980
It'll protect you
and your friends from harm.

154
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,221
Whatever, Gandalf.

155
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,768
Matt, where are you?

156
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:23,781
I'm lost.
Where are you?

157
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,817
What is that?

158
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:44,632
What is this?

159
00:14:47,306 --> 00:14:49,297
Are you in there?

160
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,507
Are you in there?

161
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,779
Is that you, Matt?

162
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,690
Oh, my God!

163
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:56,698
<i>Hey, Cap, I can get</i>
<i>a little closer to 'em.</i>

164
00:15:56,776 --> 00:16:00,109
<i>Yeah. Let's keep our distance</i>
<i>and see where he's headin'.</i>

165
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,523
- Slow down, slow down.
- Come on.

166
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,822
Did you hear that?

167
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,225
- Shallow water!
- Okay, Salish.

168
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:54,027
Hey, guys, there it is.

169
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,227
Yes!

170
00:16:57,303 --> 00:16:59,897
Yes! Finally!

171
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:08,135
Easy, now.

172
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,705
Almost there.

173
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:15,813
Shut it down!

174
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,622
- I'm so excited!
- Finally!

175
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:33,332
<i>I know where they're docking. Drop me</i>
<i>off on the other side of the island.</i>

176
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,896
<i>- You want me to radio for backup?</i>
<i>- Nah.</i>

177
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:38,967
<i>I think I can handle Victor myself.</i>

178
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:48,786
- Okeydoke.
- They're on their way.

179
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,789
What do you wanna do now?

180
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:56,055
Let's go. I found a spot
for our merchandise.

181
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:59,359
Start unloading.
If Casper comes after us...

182
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:02,594
she won't find anything
left on board to arrest us for.

183
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,017
Yeah, right up here.

184
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:22,019
Wait. Wait.
Let me see that a second.

185
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,258
Well, you're obviously no cartographer.

186
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:29,158
- What?
- Come on. It's this way.

187
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,496
- Smart too, isn't she?
- Yep.

188
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:37,798
Smart enough not to get involved
with the likes of you, bro.

189
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:47,938
- What's this?
- Come on.

190
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:56,879
- Smells like someone farted up there.
- Look at all these bubbles.

191
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:59,891
It's disgusting.

192
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:22,472
Seems like a storm's comin' up.

193
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:29,213
Maybe so.
But that's all right.

194
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:31,688
Keeps Casper off our ass
if she tries coming after us...

195
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,691
while we blow on out of here.

196
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,284
What about the kids?
We can't leave 'em alone.

197
00:19:36,362 --> 00:19:38,057
This is a bad island.

198
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:42,760
I ain't waiting around for 'em, not if
we have a chance to slip past Casper.

199
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:46,271
- You'd better keep unloading.
- All right.

200
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:47,566
Fine.

201
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,167
Then we'll come back next week
when the heat is off, huh?

202
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:59,881
- You hear somethin'?
- No, nothing.

203
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,994
- Where is everyone?
- Come on, Karma.

204
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:17,467
I can't believe this.

205
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,868
It's their loss. We have
this entire place to ourselves...

206
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:24,399
to dance the night away,
and I intend to put it to good use.

207
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:27,240
- I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
- You would say that.

208
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:29,873
Do you mind if
everybody isn't miserable, like you?

209
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,611
Yeah, you know what?
I remember when she used to be fun.

210
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:35,085
When was that, kindergarten?

211
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:38,746
How funny.
You're funny.

212
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:43,458
I think something bad's
happened here.

213
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:45,394
Like what?

214
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:53,636
Well, they sure as hell did not
go to 7-11 to get more booze...

215
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:57,665
because the keg is full.

216
00:20:57,743 --> 00:20:59,335
- Right on.
- Cheers.

217
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:01,345
<i>- Chin-chin.</i>
<i>- Salud!</i>

218
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:04,780
<i>- L 'chaim!</i>
- Well, what the fuck?

219
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,445
Doesn't this bother any of you?

220
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,579
We're on the island where the rave of
the year's supposed to be happening...

221
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:12,590
but it's completely deserted.

222
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:14,956
Yeah, it worries me.
It worries me there aren't any mixers.

223
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:17,257
Simon cannot survive on Bud alone.

224
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:19,422
Speak for yourself, dude.

225
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:14,316
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna
go find out where everyone went.

226
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:17,878
Okay? Is anyone else coming?

227
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,117
Hell no.
Me and Cyn are gonna...

228
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:23,127
groove to some funky tunes
all night long, right, baby doll?

229
00:22:23,195 --> 00:22:25,686
You know it, sugarplum.

230
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:28,289
Okay, you know what?
I'm coming with you.

231
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm starting to get diabetes
from all this "sugar, sugar" over here.

232
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,238
- What about you, Studly Doolittle?
- Three's not company in this case.

233
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,365
I think I'll join you.

234
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,036
Good. We need a big,
strong man to protect us.

235
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:41,602
Problem is, there's never a big,
strong man around when you need one.

236
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,910
All right, let's go.

237
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:52,684
Why do I always end up
doin' this shit work?

238
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:22,643
Cap'n, is that you?

239
00:23:38,637 --> 00:23:41,105
Hello, Cleveland!

240
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:43,107
- Cut it out.
- What? Why?

241
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,405
Because I said so.

242
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:47,274
Said so, huh?
Maybe I should just...

243
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,184
Wait, wait, wait.

244
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:55,186
I think I feel some rain coming.

245
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:59,315
Why don't we... I think it might...
I think it might rain.

246
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:02,519
Why don't we go somewhere
where we won't get wet?

247
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:05,962
Too late.

248
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:16,129
Close the Velcro.
Beautiful Velcro.

249
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,540
- We are gonna do the humpity-bumpity.
- Come on, baby.

250
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,601
The humpity-bumpity!

251
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:26,477
- Yeah, baby!
- One, two, three!

252
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,648
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if the others come back?

253
00:24:31,723 --> 00:24:34,886
- I can be quick.
- What else is new?

254
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,293
Hey, don't...
Don't take it personal, Greg.

255
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:41,491
- A lot of men have these problems.
- I just gotta take a piss.

256
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:44,001
Not in here, you idiot!
Go pee in the bushes!

257
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:45,661
Christ, I just...

258
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:48,433
I just gotta go and take a piss is all.

259
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:51,533
- All this beer's gotta go somewhere.
- For God's sakes.

260
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,271
Be right back.

261
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,712
- Hello?
- It's so quiet.

262
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:06,820
It's a gorgeous night.
Why don't we play for a little while?

263
00:25:06,892 --> 00:25:08,086
Shall we?

264
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,493
Why don't you just stick to
playing with yourself for now?

265
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:15,556
- By the way, what's with the accent?
- I don't know.

266
00:25:33,852 --> 00:25:36,047
Salish, are you done yet?

267
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,470
Better hurry back, baby.

268
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,510
Mama's gonna give it to ya.

269
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,364
Greg, you're scaring me.

270
00:26:56,735 --> 00:26:58,828
Come on, baby.

271
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:11,239
- Will you get a load of that?
- What the hell is it?

272
00:27:11,316 --> 00:27:13,181
Looks like it was built
a millennia ago.

273
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:16,652
Simon, it's centuries.

274
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,690
Right. Well, that's what I meant.

275
00:27:18,757 --> 00:27:21,453
Should we go in?

276
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:25,462
I am not going in there.

277
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,125
Unless there's a spa and a 24-hour
room service, you're on your own, hon.

278
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:32,127
Well, are you coming,
or am I going in myself?

279
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:35,571
Didn't you ever watch <i>Scooby Doo?</i>

280
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,835
This is so not a good idea.

281
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:47,508
I am completely
not in favor of doing this.

282
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,526
Well, the candles are lit.
I mean, someone must be home.

283
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,698
Hello?

284
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,709
Alicia, watch out!

285
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:22,413
What the fuck?

286
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:26,690
What the hell are you doing here?

287
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:29,625
- Where is everyone?
- Shut the door!

288
00:28:31,196 --> 00:28:34,393
You broke my glasses.
Great. Nice.

289
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:37,162
Okay, what is going on here?

290
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:40,398
We'll show you.

291
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:42,531
Come on.

292
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:44,871
I've got it on tape.

293
00:28:51,216 --> 00:28:55,380
Sorry. I have a lot of footage here.
I'll just fast-forward.

294
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:02,319
Everyone was partying, you know.

295
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:05,921
Drinking and dancing
and just hanging out, having fun.

296
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:09,398
And then these things came
and they attacked the rave.

297
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:12,733
They started killing everybody.
Those of us that could get away did.

298
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:15,739
We ran. We finally got to the boat,
but it wasn't there.

299
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,670
These things, they just kept
coming and coming and killing.

300
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,941
We found this house.
We ran inside and tried to hide.

301
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:26,848
That's when you guys came.
We thought you were more of them.

302
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:28,681
"Them"? Who the hell is "them"?

303
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:32,416
"Who"? Try "what."

304
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:35,983
- Rudy, they were dead people.
- Okay, guys, you saw the tape.

305
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:39,690
Those are reanimated corpses just like
out of a fuckin' Romero movie.

306
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:42,995
- A what?
- A Romero movie.

307
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:45,298
You know, like, the holy trilogy:
<i>Night, Dawn</i> and <i>Day.</i>

308
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:48,601
They say he's gonna make <i>Twilight of</i>
<i>the Dead</i> one day, but I doubt it.

309
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:51,506
Yeah, I find this
all a little hard to believe.

310
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:53,703
It was a stunt.
It was part of the rave.

311
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:56,872
- It wasn't a stunt, Alicia.
- You know what?

312
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:59,781
Simon says let's get out of here
and let the cops ask questions later...

313
00:29:59,851 --> 00:30:02,319
while we're kicking it back in Seattle
selling our story to the <i>Enquirer.</i>

314
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:04,651
Sounds great.
You got a boat?

315
00:30:04,723 --> 00:30:06,850
- Yes, down at the beach.
- Thank God.

316
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:09,291
Then let's not waste any more time
yakking. Let's just go!

317
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:12,626
We can't. We still have friends back at
the rave. We're not gonna leave them.

318
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:15,097
We gotta get out of here
while we still can.

319
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,532
We're not leaving without them.

320
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,797
Okay. Let's go.

321
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:59,768
- So, you came with that girl?
- What?

322
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,341
Let me give you a tip. I don't think
she's a natural red, white and blue.

323
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:09,146
Met her at the rave.
So, who's your boy over there...

324
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,451
with the Tom Cruise smile
and the <i>Rain Man</i> brain?

325
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:17,154
He just so happens to be the biggest
underwear model in America.

326
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:18,991
Congratulations.

327
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:21,897
- That's great.
- You okay, Simon?

328
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,060
Sure.

329
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:38,606
Where the hell are they?

330
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:43,017
- Greg? Cindy?
- Please, do not do that.

331
00:31:43,088 --> 00:31:44,749
You're being taken, Hugh.

332
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:47,291
This is all just one big practical joke.

333
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,884
If you'd been here, which you weren't,
you wouldn't think it was a joke.

334
00:31:49,961 --> 00:31:51,155
Believe me.

335
00:31:52,263 --> 00:31:53,787
What is that?

336
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,530
I'm so not touching that.

337
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:59,069
Hold this.

338
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:04,832
Let's flip it over.

339
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:09,836
Liberty.

340
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,462
Holy... Dude, what the fuck
happened to you?

341
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:26,463
I was in there,
and then all of the sudden...

342
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:29,091
the frickin'... the banging,
and then the frickin' thing fell over.

343
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:32,034
And I was stuck inside. Shit!

344
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:35,872
- You're in deep shit, huh?
- That's very funny.

345
00:32:37,942 --> 00:32:39,967
Get that fuckin'...
Who are you?

346
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:45,978
- Where's Cyn?
- I don't know, bro. You tell me.

347
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:49,551
We gotta go find her.

348
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:09,563
Where the fuck did that come from?

349
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:11,973
What is... Oh, my God!

350
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,910
What is... Cynthia!

351
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:23,320
What the hell was that thing?

352
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:25,253
Our best friend.

353
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:27,553
Not anymore.

354
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,650
She was like a wild animal.

355
00:33:29,728 --> 00:33:32,492
Did you see here face?
Oh, my God!

356
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:36,022
- It's horrible!
- What happened to her?

357
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:38,035
Everybody hold on a minute.

358
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,628
Maybe I can get us some answers.

359
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,935
McGyvers, come in.

360
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:47,802
This is Casper.
Come in. Over. It's out.

361
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:51,440
I'm not getting anything on the radio.
Anyone have a cell phone?

362
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:53,450
We already tried. It's not working.

363
00:33:53,518 --> 00:33:56,681
- There's some sort of interference.
- Look, I don't know what's going on.

364
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:59,519
What I do know is I've gotta
get you all off this island.

365
00:33:59,591 --> 00:34:02,754
- How did you get here?
- On a boat like everyone else.

366
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:04,419
But it's gone.
It's been destroyed.

367
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:06,726
We didn't. We came
in the <i>Lazarus</i> with Kirk.

368
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:09,096
- Where is he?
- He's in the inlet down at the beach.

369
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,362
- Can you take me to him?
- Are you gonna arrest him?

370
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,370
Not at the moment.
Right now...

371
00:34:13,438 --> 00:34:16,032
I just wanna get you all
as far away from here as possible.

372
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:18,098
Sounds like a plan to me.

373
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,496
I am so fucking scared, Simon.

374
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:54,470
I know. Me too.

375
00:35:57,742 --> 00:36:00,677
I just can't believe Cynthia's dead.

376
00:36:06,618 --> 00:36:08,552
I'm so sorry, Alicia.

377
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:12,516
Quiet, everybody.

378
00:36:52,497 --> 00:36:54,158
Everyone, quiet.

379
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:17,043
Shit!

380
00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:33,503
Can we go home now, please?

381
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:37,029
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

382
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:38,905
- Move it!
- Let's go!

383
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,455
Go!

384
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,796
- Oh, shit!
- Kirk!

385
00:38:06,504 --> 00:38:08,438
It's gotta be down here!
It's gotta be down here!

386
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:10,599
- All right.
- Where is it?

387
00:38:15,947 --> 00:38:19,348
- Oh, God, that's not Kirk.
- Simon!

388
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:21,510
- Don't jump in the water!
- Simon, don't!

389
00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:25,181
- No, don't!
- Simon, don't go!

390
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:46,642
- Swim, Simon!
- Swim!

391
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,347
- Look out!
- Go, go, go!

392
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,817
Get out of the water, Simon!

393
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:37,552
Shoot him!

394
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,220
Rudy, behind you!

395
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,428
Swim, Simon! Swim!

396
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:47,266
No! Liberty!

397
00:40:20,071 --> 00:40:21,095
Shoot it!

398
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:24,266
What do you think I'm trying
to do, you fucking moron?

399
00:40:52,036 --> 00:40:53,663
Come on.
Come on.

400
00:40:55,673 --> 00:40:58,938
Fuck! You fucking zombie bastards!

401
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,138
You're not gonna fuck with us again,
are ya, asshole?

402
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:04,545
Are you? Are you?

403
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:14,753
- My face!
- You all right? Let me see.

404
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:17,123
Let me see.
Could I have your coat?

405
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:20,562
- Oh, fuck!
- Here, let me see it. Let me look.

406
00:41:20,631 --> 00:41:22,326
Fuck!

407
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,426
- Let me see it.
- Are you a doctor?

408
00:41:25,503 --> 00:41:28,165
- Hardly. He's premed.
- I'm in med school.

409
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,174
At least you're not pre-law.

410
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:35,138
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.

411
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:39,883
- Is that a bite?
- Yeah.

412
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:42,442
- All right.
- Hmm?

413
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,819
I've gotta get back to the patrol boat.
I can get on the radio and get us help.

414
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:49,519
Wait. Are you just gonna leave us here
while you go looking for the cavalry?

415
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:52,324
- You're coming with me.
- Me? Why me?

416
00:41:52,396 --> 00:41:55,092
Are you a doctor?
Are you wounded?

417
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,566
- Can you use a gun?
- Well, I can...

418
00:41:57,635 --> 00:41:59,626
That's why you.

419
00:41:59,704 --> 00:42:01,638
The boat should be
a mile or so up the beach.

420
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:03,697
We'll climb aboard and come back
for help. Understood?

421
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,572
- Come on.
- Greg. My name's Greg.

422
00:42:06,644 --> 00:42:08,544
Come on, Greg!

423
00:42:12,683 --> 00:42:16,619
- Hey, what the hell were those things?
- I don't know.

424
00:42:16,687 --> 00:42:21,056
But what I do know now is why
they call this island <i>Isle del Morte.</i>

425
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,060
You gotta do this.
You gotta do this.

426
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:27,029
There must be some kind
of scientific explanation for this.

427
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:31,729
Liberty's right.
They gotta be some kind of mutation.

428
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:36,296
Yeah, from what? The shrinking ozone?
What, too little sunscreen?

429
00:42:36,374 --> 00:42:39,138
Rudy, give me a break.
These are zombies pure and simple.

430
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,644
The sooner we accept it
and deal with it...

431
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,976
the better chance we have
of getting out of here alive.

432
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:50,220
Your first mate seemed to know something
about this island. What was it?

433
00:42:50,288 --> 00:42:53,951
- Nothing but an old wives' tale.
- Like the walking dead?

434
00:42:56,093 --> 00:42:58,789
Well...

435
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:01,127
best I reckon,
the story goes...

436
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:06,096
<i>there was once some</i>
<i>crazy Spanish padre...</i>

437
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,104
<i>who was banished from Spain...</i>

438
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:10,606
<i>hundreds of years ago.</i>

439
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:13,269
<i>His name was Castillo Sermano.</i>

440
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:24,312
You asked to see me,
Father Castillo?

441
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:42,503
Come closer, Captain.
I cannot see your face.

442
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,533
Are you afraid, Captain?

443
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:54,841
You know why
I was banished from Spain?

444
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:58,013
Your experiments are not of God.

445
00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:00,353
God?

446
00:44:00,424 --> 00:44:04,417
What has God done for you,
or for me?

447
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:06,656
Nothing.

448
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:11,191
There is no God.
There's only me.

449
00:44:11,268 --> 00:44:14,465
May he have mercy on your soul.

450
00:44:26,016 --> 00:44:28,484
<i>The Spanish were trying from falling...</i>

451
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:31,146
<i>the sands into the limeys.</i>

452
00:44:31,222 --> 00:44:33,884
They never made it to the garrison.

453
00:44:36,127 --> 00:44:38,789
They say he murdered the crew
of the <i>St. Cristobol...</i>

454
00:44:38,863 --> 00:44:44,199
enslaved the natives of this island,
and killed whoever came here ever since.

455
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,896
Some say he still does.

456
00:44:46,971 --> 00:44:50,338
- I'm sorry I asked.
- If you ask me...

457
00:44:50,408 --> 00:44:52,603
it's just a bunch
of smugglers and cutthroats...

458
00:44:52,676 --> 00:44:54,610
looking for ways
to scare people off.

459
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:57,169
Well, you would know,
wouldn't you?

460
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:59,273
What can I say?

461
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,547
They're doing a hell of a job,
ain't they?

462
00:45:15,499 --> 00:45:17,694
What is it?

463
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:21,260
- I can't hear anything.
- Neither do I.

464
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,904
Run! Run!

465
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:49,245
We can't stay out here like this.
We're too vulnerable.

466
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,254
I know, but we can't leave
until Greg and Casper get back.

467
00:47:51,322 --> 00:47:54,291
We gotta get back on that boat, but
there's no way I'm goin' in that water.

468
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:57,759
We can't. It's too far. Besides,
we don't know what's still on that boat.

469
00:47:57,828 --> 00:47:59,921
What about that house?

470
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:03,366
It's defensible.
We'll have shelter.

471
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:06,870
Okay, it's a good idea. We make a run
for it as soon as they get back.

472
00:48:06,937 --> 00:48:08,905
What if they don't come back?
What then?

473
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:11,203
- They'll come back.
- Yeah, but what if they don't?

474
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:14,210
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any weapons or food.

475
00:48:14,278 --> 00:48:16,906
- I mean, we don't have shit.
- Actually, we do.

476
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:32,426
- You gotta be kidding me.
- This is why Casper's on your ass?

477
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:35,397
- You're smuggling Cuban cigars?
- Among other things.

478
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:38,333
Still hard at work smuggling,
I see, Victor.

479
00:48:38,402 --> 00:48:40,734
Don't you just wish
you could prove that, Jordan?

480
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:43,932
- What are these then?
- We just found them on the beach.

481
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,805
- Right.
- Crazy, huh?

482
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:48,242
I'm not gonna worry about that
right now. We've got bigger problems.

483
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:50,940
My patrol boat's been destroyed.
My first mate is missing.

484
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:53,984
- What about Greg? Where is he?
- Yeah.

485
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:56,285
I don't think he made it.

486
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:59,811
- What do you mean?
- He's gone. I'm sorry.

487
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,326
We gotta go back there and look for him.
Maybe there's a chance he's okay.

488
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:06,625
- We can't just leave him out there.
- He's dead.

489
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:10,360
If you don't wanna end up like him,
shut up and listen to what she's saying.

490
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:14,833
What else you got in there
besides smokes? Anything useful?

491
00:49:15,906 --> 00:49:19,364
Let me introduce you
to my little friend.

492
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:31,418
And who said size doesn't matter?

493
00:49:31,488 --> 00:49:34,514
Nice. But mine's bigger.

494
00:49:34,591 --> 00:49:36,388
Mossberg 500.

495
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,055
Stainless shotgun
with incendiary shells.

496
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,223
Saving the best for last.

497
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:47,499
Here you go.
Take it.

498
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:53,169
Good choice.

499
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:57,475
Desert Eagle.
I like the way you think, girl.

500
00:49:57,548 --> 00:50:01,177
We can't stay here for long.
Those creatures are everywhere.

501
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,742
We talked about making a run for it
to that house that we found.

502
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:06,517
That sounds like a good idea. We can
hole up in there until help arrives.

503
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,080
If help arrives.

504
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:11,821
Don't worry. When we don't report in,
the marine patrol will come for us.

505
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:14,523
Everyone know how
to use their weapons?

506
00:50:56,073 --> 00:50:58,234
- Shit!
- We're gonna have to make a run for it.

507
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,276
- What if they're already inside?
- That's a chance we have to take.

508
00:51:00,344 --> 00:51:02,778
We can hold up a lot better
in there than we can out here.

509
00:51:02,846 --> 00:51:04,609
- Once they spot us...
- Oh, God!

510
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:19,177
Over here!

511
00:56:48,391 --> 00:56:50,655
- The door's locked!
- You gotta be kidding me!

512
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:54,754
We could blow the door. But there
won't be enough left to keep them out.

513
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:58,360
Forget it.
We'll find another way.

514
00:58:46,943 --> 00:58:50,572
- We need more ammo!
- We haven't got any.

515
00:58:50,647 --> 00:58:52,808
- I'm down to my last clip.
- Yeah, me too.

516
00:58:52,882 --> 00:58:54,747
I'm saving mine for myself.

517
00:58:54,818 --> 00:58:57,184
Are you okay?
Watch out!

518
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:06,852
- The window!
- Can you get through, Rudy?

519
00:59:08,698 --> 00:59:11,462
Yeah. Come on!

520
00:59:12,836 --> 00:59:14,394
Oh, shit.

521
00:59:15,705 --> 00:59:18,139
Die, you son of a bitch!

522
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:24,747
Pull! Hurry!

523
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,064
Oh, my God!

524
00:59:45,168 --> 00:59:47,398
Oh, my God!

525
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:50,405
Casper? Look at me.

526
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:52,907
Casper, look at me.
I need you to look at me.

527
00:59:52,976 --> 00:59:55,410
Okay? Look at me.

528
00:59:55,478 --> 00:59:59,505
Look at me.
You saved us, okay?

529
00:59:59,582 --> 01:00:01,516
You saved us.

530
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:08,480
Shit, I'm out!

531
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,270
Fuck.

532
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,904
Let's get him to that table!

533
01:01:05,482 --> 01:01:07,916
See if we can find something
to use as a bandage.

534
01:01:09,486 --> 01:01:12,046
Simon, we should check
for more of them.

535
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:19,954
- Sorry.
- Where's Casper, Rudy?

536
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:22,429
She didn't make it.
I'm sorry.

537
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:28,631
Okay.

538
01:01:36,446 --> 01:01:38,914
Okay, Captain, this is gonna hurt.

539
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:41,712
Do it. Do it!

540
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,015
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

541
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,187
- Give me a light.
- Here.

542
01:01:56,966 --> 01:02:00,402
Fuck. Oh, shit.

543
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,267
Don't look at me.

544
01:02:12,282 --> 01:02:14,273
I'm the fuckin' Elephant Man.

545
01:02:20,056 --> 01:02:22,183
- I think we should...
- Just get away from me.

546
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:24,556
I don't need your help.

547
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:41,503
- Hang in there, Kirk.
- All right, all right, all right.

548
01:02:41,578 --> 01:02:44,775
Just get some rest.

549
01:02:46,516 --> 01:02:50,179
- Is he gonna end up like Cynthia?
- I don't know.

550
01:03:10,039 --> 01:03:13,167
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

551
01:03:13,243 --> 01:03:16,838
- Does it matter?
- It does. It matters to me.

552
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:20,841
I mean, are we even
gonna get out of here?

553
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:24,011
Even if we get out of here,
I'm finished.

554
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:27,750
Who's gonna be able to look me
in the eyes with a face like this?

555
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:29,348
I'm a freak.
I belong in the fuckin' circus.

556
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:31,757
Don't talk like that.

557
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:35,161
I happen to think
you've been very brave tonight.

558
01:03:35,231 --> 01:03:38,291
And I still think
you're pretty damn sexy.

559
01:03:47,076 --> 01:03:49,806
You're not just doing this
to make me feel better, are you?

560
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:53,007
I'm doing this
to make me feel better.

561
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:05,986
It's so quiet.

562
01:04:06,062 --> 01:04:07,996
Yeah, it's almost too quiet.

563
01:04:08,064 --> 01:04:11,056
- Look at this.
- What?

564
01:04:13,002 --> 01:04:15,527
Where are they dragging them?

565
01:04:15,605 --> 01:04:17,596
What are they doing
with the bodies?

566
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:19,835
I got a bad feeling.

567
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:28,509
What happened?

568
01:04:28,585 --> 01:04:32,180
- Rudy, what happened?
- Why does it matter what happened?

569
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,713
She's dead. I didn't save her.

570
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,885
- It's not your fault.
- It was my fault!

571
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,122
It was my fault!

572
01:04:40,196 --> 01:04:42,892
Were you here?
Did you see it?

573
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,662
Did you see...
watch them rip her apart?

574
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:53,909
You know what?

575
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:57,402
You know what?

576
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,350
It's not gonna happen again.

577
01:05:12,762 --> 01:05:14,753
We're gonna get out of here.

578
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:25,471
It's Kirk. You need to take a look
at him. He's getting worse.

579
01:05:26,943 --> 01:05:28,433
Okay.

580
01:05:37,286 --> 01:05:39,754
How you doin', Captain?

581
01:05:39,822 --> 01:05:43,121
- I wouldn't mind a drink.
- Okay.

582
01:05:47,063 --> 01:05:48,997
That's all we got.

583
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:54,332
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but thanks just the same.

584
01:05:58,908 --> 01:06:01,103
Guys, check out this book.

585
01:06:02,812 --> 01:06:05,940
It looks pretty old.
Maybe it'll help us.

586
01:06:08,651 --> 01:06:12,951
Well, that cuts it.
I'm either gonna get better or I ain't.

587
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:21,563
In any case, you have no <i>agua,</i> a fistful
of ammo left and zero rations.

588
01:06:21,631 --> 01:06:25,032
Maybe it's time
you stopped babysitting me...

589
01:06:25,101 --> 01:06:27,899
and started worrying about yourselves
a bit more.

590
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:31,599
- What'd you have in mind?
- Check out the rest of the house.

591
01:06:31,674 --> 01:06:35,701
See what you can scrounge and
where you can fortify yourselves better.

592
01:06:35,778 --> 01:06:39,179
There's no telling
what's coming through that door next.

593
01:06:41,284 --> 01:06:43,218
Maybe there's another way out of here.

594
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,554
You guys,
this looks like a ship's journal.

595
01:06:46,622 --> 01:06:51,082
According to the officer's logs, it says
Castillo Sermano killed the captain...

596
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,651
then beached the ship
and lit it on fire.

597
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:56,392
So the stories that Kirk told us
make sense now.

598
01:06:56,466 --> 01:06:58,730
You'd better go now. Go.

599
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:01,497
You're right.

600
01:07:03,473 --> 01:07:05,498
- You gonna be okay?
- Just fine.

601
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:09,033
If not, I've always got this.

602
01:07:12,215 --> 01:07:15,776
The captain's right. We gotta get out of
here and search the rest of this house.

603
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:23,619
Let's go.

604
01:07:29,699 --> 01:07:32,497
Let's start with the courtyard.

605
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:47,873
What is all this?

606
01:07:51,754 --> 01:07:54,951
What's in there?

607
01:07:55,024 --> 01:07:57,151
- I can't...
- It's locked?

608
01:08:05,535 --> 01:08:09,130
- What...
- Oh, my God.

609
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:13,633
This is sick!

610
01:08:23,152 --> 01:08:26,315
Sorry.
This is unbelievable.

611
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:31,358
- Why aren't these zombies alive?
- I don't know.

612
01:09:04,727 --> 01:09:07,195
Rudy, take a look at this.

613
01:09:15,605 --> 01:09:17,038
It's blood.

614
01:09:17,106 --> 01:09:18,767
It's blood?

615
01:09:20,176 --> 01:09:22,167
Yeah, but...

616
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,179
it's not human, though.

617
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:26,875
It's like it's...
It's like it's been mutated.

618
01:09:28,351 --> 01:09:30,979
I've never seen anything
like it before.

619
01:09:32,054 --> 01:09:34,079
It's completely unnatural.

620
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,718
It's fucking genius.

621
01:11:02,078 --> 01:11:05,275
I'm not gonna let Salish
live like one of them.

622
01:11:08,918 --> 01:11:11,546
Kirk, where are you?

623
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,464
What are you doing?
They're gonna kill you.

624
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:32,598
I'm dead already.

625
01:11:41,183 --> 01:11:43,549
See you in hell, boys.

626
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:46,213
Everybody get down! Now!

627
01:11:54,697 --> 01:11:56,187
Get out of here! Everybody!

628
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:02,837
- We just need to...
- Lock the door!

629
01:12:02,905 --> 01:12:04,566
Hurry, hurry!

630
01:12:07,376 --> 01:12:09,844
What?

631
01:12:12,214 --> 01:12:16,048
- What is that?
- Son of a bitch! It's gunpowder.

632
01:12:16,118 --> 01:12:19,383
Well, it's a good thing.
We can use it, right?

633
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,889
The only way we can use it
is if we blew it up, and...

634
01:12:21,957 --> 01:12:25,188
No, it's useless, because
someone would have to be here to...

635
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:27,661
I'll go to the lab.
I'm gonna see if I can find something.

636
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:30,164
I'll go with you.

637
01:12:30,232 --> 01:12:32,223
Let's see.

638
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:39,438
What is this?

639
01:12:45,147 --> 01:12:47,945
What happened?

640
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:50,778
Karma, no!

641
01:12:53,022 --> 01:12:56,389
Oh, my God, it's the blood!
It brings 'em back to life!

642
01:13:01,697 --> 01:13:03,562
Go!

643
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:06,859
Here!

644
01:13:09,772 --> 01:13:11,603
Here, use this!

645
01:13:11,674 --> 01:13:13,801
- Let's move this!
- Board it up with this!

646
01:13:16,312 --> 01:13:18,439
They're breaking through!

647
01:13:20,182 --> 01:13:21,114
Come on!

648
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:25,420
You guys, there's a door!

649
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,786
Get down! Go!

650
01:13:27,857 --> 01:13:30,485
Simon, come on!

651
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:36,725
Just go!

652
01:13:39,135 --> 01:13:41,126
Shit!

653
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:35,414
Where the hell are we?

654
01:14:35,491 --> 01:14:38,016
Must be some kind of catacomb
underneath the house.

655
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:41,890
Sorry, Karma.

656
01:14:43,866 --> 01:14:47,029
This must be how they shift supplies
from the ship to the house.

657
01:14:47,102 --> 01:14:51,198
If that's the case, then one of these
tunnels lead to the beach somewhere.

658
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,869
Let's go.

659
01:15:13,796 --> 01:15:15,457
I'm out.

660
01:15:32,314 --> 01:15:35,477
- Have they gone?
- I hope so.

661
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,348
Listen. Be quiet.

662
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:44,119
Let's go.

663
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:54,727
- Go! Go!
- Go, go, go, go!

664
01:16:01,677 --> 01:16:04,271
- I'll take care of these guys.
- Karma, no!

665
01:16:12,054 --> 01:16:13,646
Get out of here! Hurry!

666
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:15,280
Hurry!

667
01:17:00,402 --> 01:17:03,394
- Greg, what are you doing here?
- What is this room?

668
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:09,534
Greg, we thought you were dead.

669
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:18,216
Greg, say something.

670
01:17:24,426 --> 01:17:27,987
Alicia, get away from him.
That's not Greg! Get away!

671
01:17:30,332 --> 01:17:32,357
Get off me!

672
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:34,834
- Oh, God!
- What do they want with us?

673
01:17:34,903 --> 01:17:37,770
On the table.
On the table!

674
01:17:39,074 --> 01:17:41,565
Hold him down.
Hold him down!

675
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,683
Your body parts...

676
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:52,084
they will serve me well
for a long time.

677
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:53,587
Beautiful.

678
01:17:53,655 --> 01:17:57,989
The blood we found,
it ties all the creatures.

679
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,655
You created it all so
you could be immortal. Why?

680
01:18:03,999 --> 01:18:06,229
To live forever.

681
01:18:06,301 --> 01:18:08,735
It works.

682
01:18:08,804 --> 01:18:10,897
After all these years, it finally works.

683
01:18:10,973 --> 01:18:14,500
The blood lives like I said it would.

684
01:18:14,576 --> 01:18:17,136
Fantastic.

685
01:18:17,212 --> 01:18:19,646
Did you hear what I said?

686
01:18:19,715 --> 01:18:21,706
It works.

687
01:18:21,784 --> 01:18:23,945
I'm going to live forever.

688
01:18:24,019 --> 01:18:25,680
Forever.

689
01:18:34,296 --> 01:18:36,992
I will never die.

690
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:40,057
You think you can kill me?

691
01:18:40,135 --> 01:18:42,365
I will live forever.

692
01:19:02,524 --> 01:19:04,958
Forever!

693
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:11,292
Your skin.

694
01:19:11,366 --> 01:19:13,834
So beautiful.

695
01:19:17,873 --> 01:19:20,205
I've been waiting for you...

696
01:19:20,275 --> 01:19:22,266
for a long time.

697
01:19:23,946 --> 01:19:26,506
What do you want?

698
01:19:26,582 --> 01:19:30,814
I just want your flesh.

699
01:19:46,835 --> 01:19:50,601
Run! Come on!

700
01:20:13,762 --> 01:20:16,356
- Fuck, that was close!
- I can't believe what just happened!

701
01:20:20,235 --> 01:20:22,362
Isn't it nice to know
someone wants you for your body?

702
01:20:22,437 --> 01:20:23,734
Yeah.

703
01:20:23,805 --> 01:20:26,205
Depending on what they want.

704
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:34,581
We gotta get to the beach.
Come on.

705
01:21:10,752 --> 01:21:12,413
Fucker!

706
01:21:18,026 --> 01:21:19,618
Fuck you!

707
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,477
Game over, fucker.

708
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:58,720
Oh, my God.

709
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:11,126
Maintain perimeter.
"G" and I are proceeding inside.

710
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:15,067
Advise of any contact with reanimated
Homo sapiens. Maintain alpha alert.

711
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:22,609
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

712
01:24:22,677 --> 01:24:26,044
We're here to rescue you.

713
01:24:26,114 --> 01:24:28,981
- Thanks.
- Is she okay?

714
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:31,416
Does she look okay?

715
01:24:36,324 --> 01:24:38,315
What's your name?

716
01:24:39,327 --> 01:24:41,261
Rudolph.

717
01:24:41,329 --> 01:24:43,320
You got a last name?

718
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,961
Curien.

719
01:24:48,603 --> 01:24:52,505
<i>I feel guilty</i>
<i>because of what happened.</i>

720
01:24:52,574 --> 01:24:54,508
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

721
01:24:54,576 --> 01:24:57,943
<i>So many dead,</i>
<i>so many victims...</i>

722
01:24:58,013 --> 01:25:00,607
<i>and people that were my friends.</i>

723
01:25:00,682 --> 01:25:03,708
<i>And now we go home...</i>
<i>me and Alicia.</i>

724
01:25:03,785 --> 01:25:07,619
<i>Or whatever she is now,</i>
<i>whatever I've created.</i>

725
01:25:07,689 --> 01:25:10,180
<i>God, ain't love a bitch?</i>

726
01:25:10,258 --> 01:25:14,024
<i>Is this the end,</i>
<i>or only the beginning?</i>
