1
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,800
The word "deviant"comes
from the Latin roots...

2
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,640
de, meaning "from"...

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,080
and via, "the road. "

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,640
One who wanders
from the road or gets lost.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,800
One who separates from the crowd.

6
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Of course nowadays it refers to someone
whose sexual practices are abnormal.

7
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,880
This is the story
of Stuart, Alex and me...

8
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,280
and how, for a while,
we became deviants...

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,320
in both senses of the word.

10
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Don't do it!
It's a trap! Run away!

11
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
It's been said that anyone
who wants to live in a dormitory...

12
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,600
must either be a mental defective
or a freshman.

13
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,200
I was neither.
I was a junior transfer student...

14
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,920
and I thought living in a dorm
couldn't be that bad.

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,840
I've never been quite that wrong
before or since.

16
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
- Hi.
- Hi. Eddy Howe.

17
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,200
I think I'm supposed
to sign something.

18
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,120
Yeah, here you go.

19
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
- Here.
- Thank you.

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,000
- Here's your key, and there you go.
- Where do I go?

21
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
- Upstairs.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,480
You're welcome.

23
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,720
- Fresh meat.
- I saw him first.

24
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Who are you?

25
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,480
I guess I'm your new roommate Eddy.

26
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,720
I thought they were gonna let me
keep the twin as a single.

27
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
Fuck!

28
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,760
It's nice to meet you too.

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,240
What I quickly realized
about Stuart...

30
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,040
was that he lacked that part
of the brain which would stop him...

31
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,920
from saying things that might be
offensive to other people.

32
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
I also realized that we couldn't
have been less suited as roommates.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,680
- Fore!
- But we managed to get along.

34
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,600
In fact, there developed a bizarre
equanimity in the relationship.

35
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
A balance.

36
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,600
I showed Stuart how to make his bed
with hospital corners...

37
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,200
Lick the salt, drink the drink,
suck the lime. One, two, three.

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,000
and in return
Stuart taught me how to drink.

39
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,840
I wrote Stuart's
English papers for him...

40
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
and he bought me dinner.

41
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,920
I cleaned the bathroom...

42
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,840
and he took care of the laundry.

43
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,240
Sometimes he borrowed
things of mine...

44
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
and sometimes I borrowed
things back.

45
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,760
You think it's real funny, don't you?
How's this? Ready?

46
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,880
Stuart would be quiet
so that I could study...

47
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,720
and I gave him time alone
to socialize with friends.

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,520
This delicate equilibrium
in the relationship...

49
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,800
was soon upset by an arrival.

50
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,680
The other room in the suite,
a single, had remained empty...

51
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
until one day.

52
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Whoever he is,
he isn't very friendly.

53
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,360
But we soon met.

54
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,360
Stuart, did you go to class or just
stay in bed and masturbate all day?

55
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,400
You know, I've been...

56
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,680
Would you please get outta here?

57
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,520
It's a coed dorm.
What's the problem?

58
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,160
It's coed within the building.
It's not within the rooms.

59
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
So?

60
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,840
So the polite thing for you to do
is go down to the housing office...

61
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,280
tell them there's been a mistake, and
they need to get you boys new rooms.

62
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,160
No, we were here first.
Besides, it's your fault.

63
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,880
Why didn't you use Alexandria
or whatever your full name is?

64
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,040
Alex is my full name.

65
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,840
- It sounds like a man's name to me.
- I think it's lovely.

66
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
Wow, she's amazing.

67
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
Truly amazing.

68
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Amazing grace

69
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,240
It's not Grace. It's Alex.

70
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,360
Amazing Alex

71
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,440
" Hendrickson, Alex. Male. "

72
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,520
I'm a female. Trust me.

73
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,160
According to our files,
you're male.

74
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,360
Okay...

75
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,640
let's just suppose for a second...

76
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
that I'm a female.

77
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
What would happen then?

78
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,240
I'd have to put you
on the transfer waiting list...

79
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,480
and your name would probably
come up in eight to twelve weeks.

80
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,160
There's a severe housing shortage
in the area.

81
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,800
- Would you consider living off-campus?
- I can't afford it.

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,080
I can put you on the transfer
waiting list...

83
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,000
but I'll need official verification
that you are indeed a female.

84
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,360
Next.

85
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,880
It's only temporary.
I mean, till I can find something.

86
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,240
I just... I'm not asking anyone
to do anything silly...

87
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,480
like put down the toilet seat.

88
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm just asking that when you're done
voiding your bowels, you flush.

89
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,000
After we're done
"whating" our "what"?

90
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,160
She means flush after you take
one of those big dumps, moron.

91
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
Is that what you mean?

92
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,120
That's a shame.
I'm so proud of those.

93
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,480
You know, in some countries,
the size of a man's crap...

94
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,200
is a sign of his masculinity.

95
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
She avoided us.

96
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
What was it
that kept her away?

97
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,280
I just love the smell
of her dirty panties.

98
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,240
For some unknown reason,
Stuart was confident she'd come around.

99
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,280
I need to talk to you.

100
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,280
Yes, Alex?

101
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,040
If you don't stop
eating my yogurt...

102
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,320
I know it was you...

103
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

104
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,560
You make murder sound
so sexual, Alex.

105
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,640
Get that crap to go.
I wanna work on her.

106
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,000
She doesn't like you, all right?
When's it gonna penetrate?

107
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,360
As soon as you go away, maybe.

108
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,080
Now wrap it up and get it
to go quickly. Go now.

109
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Eat shit now.

110
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,680
- One, two, three.
- Don't do that.

111
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,000
- Go. Get out of here.
- You're a neanderthal. You know that?

112
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,560
- I know that.
- No, you're really growing.

113
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
You're growing as a person.
That's important.

114
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
- You should show Alex that.
- Will you get outta here?

115
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
No, I have to order
another slice of pizza.

116
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,840
I think there's a danger
in our being overfriendly.

117
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,320
How can we be overfriendly
if we aren't even friendly?

118
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,320
He's got a point.

119
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,480
That's a great book.
You're gonna love it.

120
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,360
I've read it four times.

121
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,720
You know, I've often felt like
the main character, Holden Caulfield.

122
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,520
No, you're not Holden Caulfield.

123
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,760
He's Stradlater,
the obnoxious roommate.

124
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,480
The one that thinks he's a stud and
borrows Holden's coat without asking...

125
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,800
and stretches it out
and doesn't apologize.

126
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,600
It's a good book.

127
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,800
I always felt like
the little sister.

128
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,160
- Phoebe?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
Have you read Franny and Zooey
or Nine Stories?

130
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,200
Yeah. They're not as good, though.

131
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,520
You know, one time my mom...
She actually metJ D Salinger.

132
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,520
- Really?
- She threw up on his front lawn.

133
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,640
Really?

134
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Yeah, she was on vacation
in Maine with her best friend...

135
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
and they met these two sailors
who were in port for the night.

136
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,800
They got really drunk
and these sailors took them out.

137
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,360
Before long, Alex and I were
wrapped in conversation...

138
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,040
and Stuart was not.

139
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,800
Look, I wasn't trying to horn in
on your situation, okay?

140
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm not interested in her anyway.

141
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,480
Whatever.
I don't want to talk about it.

142
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,280
Sorry.

143
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,480
Gimme your toothbrush.

144
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,360
- Why?
- Give me your toothbrush.

145
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,200
- I don't want to.
- Gimme the goddamn toothbrush!

146
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,520
I would not have spilled
my father's blood...

147
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
or listened to those
who called me my mother's wife.

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,520
And now I am God-shunned...

149
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
the daughter of a mother defiled...

150
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,560
and I have taken my turn
in my mother's bed.

151
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,720
If there is any tragedy
greater than all others...

152
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,760
it belongs to me.

153
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,080
Pretty awful, huh?

154
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,440
I just don't understand
why anybody would do...

155
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,600
a lesbian version of Oedipus Rex.

156
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,560
I thought it was good.

157
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,040
- You did?
- Yeah. I really liked it.

158
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,280
Stuart, you don't have to worry
about hurting my feelings.

159
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,760
I know it was a piece of crap.

160
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,720
I thought you were good.
I thought everybody was really good.

161
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
- I liked it.
- What'd you think?

162
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,040
The translation was bad.

163
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,880
Direction was nonexistent.

164
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,640
Somebody should call the acting police
on a couple of those actresses.

165
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,040
Costumes looked like
a bad night at Caesar's Palace.

166
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Other than that,
I thought it was great.

167
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,040
You were wonderful.
You made the best out of your part.

168
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,720
I agree with all that.

169
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,840
I think you guys are being
too hard on it.

170
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,360
You're a business major. This is art.
The work is what's important here.

171
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
It's better to be honest
than to be nice, okay?

172
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,080
Fuck me for being nice.

173
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
- Wait, Stuart.
- Just let him go.

174
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
It's better just the two of us.

175
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,680
A toast to bigger and better things.

176
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,280
A toast to bigger and better things.

177
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,720
Professionally or personally?

178
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,640
I was speaking professionally...

179
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,680
but as the big dude says, a man is happy
when he has both work and love.

180
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,600
The big dude?

181
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,840
Yeah, unfashionable
though he may be, Freud.

182
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,040
I love Freud,
unfashionable though he may be.

183
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,520
- I should go.
- No.

184
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,240
Come on. Just sit down for one second.
You mind if I change?

185
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,800
No.

186
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,600
I just really want everything
to be perfect for this moment.

187
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,720
Are we having a moment?

188
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,200
How about this?

189
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
That's perfect.

190
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,320
This?

191
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Great.
They're both excellent choices.

192
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,080
I hate them.

193
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
It's kinda pointless.
Don't you think?

194
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,120
What is?

195
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Putting on clothes.

196
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,400
When I just want to take 'em off.

197
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,200
Well, some people say it's pointless
to make your bed every morning...

198
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
just 'cause you're gonna
unmake it every night...

199
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,640
but I still think
it's nice to make your bed.

200
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,960
- My bed's made.
- Yeah. You did a really good job too.

201
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,840
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- I should...

202
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,400
- What are you doing?
- Guess.

203
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,040
- Let's talk about this first.
- Let's not.

204
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,280
- Am I hurting you?
- No. Could you get off me now?

205
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,400
- You want me to get you off?
- No, I...

206
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,520
What are you doing?

207
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,280
- You smell good.
- Alex, I...

208
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,840
Alex, I don't know.

209
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,800
- I don't know if this...
- I think you're at a loss for words.

210
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,080
Eddy, come back!

211
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
- Then what did you do?
- I didn't know what to do, all right?

212
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,160
She kissed me,
and it snowballed into this insanity.

213
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
You didn't get anything?
You didn't look down her dress?

214
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,480
- Cop a little feel? Goose her? Nothing?
- No. I told her to stop touching me.

215
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,040
- Why didn't you just fuck her?
- Yeah, right.

216
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,280
The girl was on her knees,
undoing your fly with her teeth.

217
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,400
She's in the perfect position
to at least get a blow job.

218
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,320
- You wouldn't understand.
- You're right. I wouldn't understand.

219
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,240
The girl wants you to fuck her,
you fuck her.

220
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,720
Unless you're doing
the asexual thing.

221
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,160
- The what?
- It's a classic.

222
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
What are you talking about?

223
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,480
You act like you're a fag,
the two of you become good friends...

224
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,120
you start to share clothes,
she starts to confide in you...

225
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,560
and then, "boom,"
you go for her tits.

226
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,120
It's brilliant,
if you can pull it off.

227
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,040
Yeah, maybe that's what I'm doing.

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,520
Hi.

229
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,160
I think there's something
you should know.

230
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,280
I find libraries very erotic.

231
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,200
The smell of old books.

232
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,120
The silence.

233
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,800
The long aisles.

234
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,800
To be lost in the stacks.

235
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,440
That's very interesting.

236
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,280
- What are you reading?
- Hawthorne.

237
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,160
- Will you read to me?
- Alex, I've got to study for this.

238
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,080
Please, please, please.

239
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,680
"Soon there emerged
from under a sculpted portal...

240
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,680
the figure of a young girl...

241
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,240
arrayed with as much richness of taste
as the most splendid of the flowers.

242
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Beautiful as the...

243
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,160
day...

244
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,080
and with a bloom
so deep and vivid that...

245
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Oh, my!

246
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,680
one shade more
would have been too much.

247
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,360
She looked redundant with life,
health and energy...

248
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,880
all of which attributes were bound
down and compressed, as it were...

249
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
and girdled tensely
in their luxuriance...

250
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,440
by her virgin zone. "

251
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,400
Are you all right?

252
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,880
Golly...

253
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,680
I love big words.

254
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,520
Right there?

255
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
She came right there?

256
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,160
I think so. I don't know.
Don't tell her I told you, all right?

257
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,200
What do you think I am,
some kind of a sleazebag?

258
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,800
Then what happened?

259
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
- Nothing. I was reading.
- What were you reading?

260
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,880
Hawthorne.
Nathaniel Hawthorne.

261
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,240
Moby Dick.
That's good.

262
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
That's Herman Melville.

263
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,040
Whatever.

264
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,160
So?

265
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,400
So, Eddy, this is a major discovery.

266
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,680
This girl... She is a live wire
of sexual energy.

267
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
You're telling me.

268
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,680
Doesn't that excite you?

269
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,840
I mean, don't you want to just
take this girl and, like...

270
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,000
grab her and just fuck her?

271
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Maybe.

272
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
There's no maybes about it.

273
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,240
The next time you're in that situation,
you slide her off that table...

274
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
and you pull up her skirt.

275
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,320
Rip her panties off
with your teeth.

276
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,680
With your teeth. That's good.
And then take your fingers... No.

277
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,480
At that moment, I was indeed
becoming sexually excited...

278
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,200
but not over Alex.

279
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
Then all of a sudden you just
shove it right in.

280
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
As Stuart went on and on,
I realized finally...

281
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,400
that it was he I lusted after.

282
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,840
Right when you're about to come,
just squeeze it at the end and...

283
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,240
You know what I mean?

284
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,680
Yeah.

285
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,600
Stuart went on to say he had never
felt as strongly for any girl...

286
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,160
as he did for Alex, and since
I was indifferent, he had to have her.

287
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
He would stop at nothing.

288
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,840
Even if it meant being...

289
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,760
an intellectual.

290
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,120
What are you doing here?

291
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,600
Reading.

292
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
Stuart, have you ever set foot
in this library before?

293
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,360
In any library, for that matter?

294
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,920
Well, last time I checked,
the purpose for college...

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,160
was educational advancement.

296
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,200
Eddy told you what happened
yesterday, didn't he?

297
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
What are you talking about?

298
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,480
It's not gonna happen.

299
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,960
It's nothing personal.
There's just no magic.

300
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,600
So just cool it, okay?

301
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,360
You don't need magic.

302
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,520
Really? What do I need?

303
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
What you need...

304
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,880
is a long...

305
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,520
hard...

306
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,280
phantasmagoric...

307
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,280
fuck.

308
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,880
- I don't like you, Stuart.
- That's okay.

309
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,720
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

310
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,680
You know, you really shouldn't
deprive the body of what it needs.

311
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,680
"Alexei Fyodorovitch Karamazov...

312
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,400
was the third son
of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov... "

313
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
What are you doing?

314
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,840
Dostoevsky.

315
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,160
You try too hard.

316
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,720
That's your whole problem.

317
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,880
You were just about ready
to tap into something...

318
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,800
completely savage and emotional...

319
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,160
and you ruin it by trying to be
something you're not.

320
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,240
I'm sorry.

321
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,800
You're not an intellectual.
Accept it.

322
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,480
I accept it.
Now can we try this again? Please?

323
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,160
No!

324
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,080
Shit.

325
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,280
- I've been looking for you.
- You have?

326
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,680
- We need to talk.
- We do?

327
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,160
- Why are you backing away from me?
- I'm not backing away from you.

328
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,320
I'm just walking backwards
while you're walking forwards.

329
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,800
I forgive you for telling Stuart
about what happened in the library.

330
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,560
I apologize for my exuberance.

331
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
I don't apologize
for my exuberance!

332
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,320
I revel in it! And I wanna know
what the story is with you!

333
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,840
Why are you so standoffish with me?
Tell me.

334
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:55,841
Why won't you kiss me?
Why?

335
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:59,842
- Look, you see, it's--
- What?

336
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:02,843
- Never mind.
- What?

337
00:25:02,844 --> 00:25:05,844
- I can't tell you!
- Tell me.

338
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,160
I'm sexually ambivalent.

339
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,840
Ambivalent about sex in general,
or ambivalent about sex with me?

340
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,760
Ambivalent about sex with girls.

341
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,400
You don't like girls.

342
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,480
I like them.
I just don't wanna have sex with them.

343
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,160
You know...

344
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,280
I suspected it.

345
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
You did?

346
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,840
Oh, yeah.

347
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Come on.
Let's go get a drink.

348
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,960
How many men have you been with?

349
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,720
- Alex, come on.
- Just tell me.

350
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
All right.

351
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,760
The truth is...

352
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,600
except for a few
botched attempts with girls...

353
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm a...

354
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,440
You know.

355
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, God.
I haven't slept with anyone.

356
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,560
- You haven't been with a man yet?
- No, not with anyone.

357
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,800
Then you're not gay!

358
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,920
You're a blank slate!

359
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,560
I'll mold you into a heterosexual
with my bare hands.

360
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,120
Drama major.
Okay, fine. Just do me a favor.

361
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,040
Don't tell Stuart, all right?

362
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,960
- Sure.
- You promise?

363
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,280
Yeah.

364
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,480
What are you doing?

365
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Nothing.

366
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,880
Were you just looking
at my butt?

367
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,480
No.

368
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,880
You weren't just looking
at my butt?

369
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Don't know
what you're talking about.

370
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,160
Eddy, I've been thinking
about something.

371
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,640
That's good.

372
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,800
I think you were checking out
my butt the other day.

373
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,480
I was not.

374
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I think you were.

375
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,400
I don't care what you think.

376
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,120
Are you a homo?

377
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,440
Fuck off.

378
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,080
It's okay if you are.
Doesn't bother me.

379
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm secure enough in my own sexuality
to not feel threatened by it.

380
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,720
I have a very hip attitude
about this sort of thing.

381
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,600
My mom had a lot of gay friends.

382
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,120
You know, it's not a good time to be
a sexually promiscuous homo.

383
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,200
You ever butt-fucked anybody?

384
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,600
Jesus!

385
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,560
No? You ever been butt-fucked?

386
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,120
Please, Stuart. Please shut up.
All right?

387
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm not gonna finish writing
this paper for you unless you shut up.

388
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,400
Look, I don't have anything
against homos.

389
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,200
I mean, you are what you are, right?

390
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
And it's okay
if you look at my butt.

391
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,560
It's a nice butt.
I know that.

392
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,400
Will you stop saying
the word "butt"?

393
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,680
- But...
- That's it.

394
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,080
Hey, Eddy, this paper's due tomorrow.
What am I gonna do?

395
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,200
Guess what?

396
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,680
What?

397
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,240
- Eddy is a proud home owner.
- A what?

398
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,680
A homeboy.
Homo erectus.

399
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
- A fag.
- I didn't say that.

400
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,040
You didn't deny it.

401
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,680
I don't believe it.

402
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,920
You can't say "fag. "

403
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It's like when one black guy
calls another "nigger. "

404
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,600
You can't say it
unless you are one.

405
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
You just said "nigger,"
and you're not a black guy.

406
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,840
It's okay, though,
'cause I'm a fag.

407
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,960
You see?
What'd I tell you?

408
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,440
- Stop saying that word.
- He is what he is.

409
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,600
He doesn't know what he is.
He's confused.

410
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,040
He's not confused about my butt.

411
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,400
Do you like boys or girls?

412
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,680
The truth is,
sometimes both are attractive.

413
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,120
- Of course they are.
- But if you think it through...

414
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,040
gay sex, by definition,
is better than straight sex.

415
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,320
Get the fuck outta here.

416
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,920
- No, I have a theory.
- I would love to hear this.

417
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,200
Well, as I see it,
it all has to do with equipment...

418
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,880
and the correct use
of that equipment.

419
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,440
Now, if you have male genitalia,
as I do...

420
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,360
and you're sleeping with someone
who also has male genitalia...

421
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,000
then you have firsthand knowledge
of how their equipment works.

422
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,040
You know where
the pressure-sensitive points are.

423
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,640
You know what buttons to push.

424
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,520
On the other hand, if you're a man
having sex with a woman or vice versa...

425
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,080
then you really never know
how they feel.

426
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,480
You don't know if they really feel great
or if they're just faking it.

427
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,800
Wow.

428
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,920
No. No.

429
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,200
Straight sex is better than gay sex.
It's written in the Bible.

430
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,680
Is that in the King James
or the New World edition?

431
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,320
Look, I just know. Okay?

432
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,840
How do you know, Stuart?
I mean, have you compared the two?

433
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
Have you?

434
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,640
Surely you admit
that lesbian sex...

435
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
is more satisfying to women
than hetero sex, right?

436
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,520
I mean, that's an established fact.

437
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
Everybody knows that.

438
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,280
I've grown tired.

439
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,480
Look, no matter what happens,
somebody's gonna get screwed.

440
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,480
Who's gonna get screwed?

441
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,520
I think you guys know
what I'm talking about.

442
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,040
I think it's destructive
and dangerous.

443
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
What is?

444
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,880
Don't act stupid.

445
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,800
He's not acting, Alex.

446
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,000
Okay, look.

447
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,800
You have the hots for me,
I have the hots for him...

448
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,840
and sooner or later,
he's gonna have the hots for you.

449
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,240
Sounds pretty hot to me.

450
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,880
Let's make a vow.

451
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,680
Sacred vow.

452
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,040
The three of us
are gonna be friends, and that's it.

453
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,440
I mean, aren't you guys tired
of this whole sex thing?

454
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
How can I be tired of this whole
sex thing if I haven't had any sex?

455
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,240
Well, then, have sex with someone
outside our little circle.

456
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,680
Sex with strangers.
That sounds wise.

457
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,920
Forget about that.

458
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,040
But as far as the three of us go,
let's just be friends.

459
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,720
No sex.

460
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,760
Yes, Stuart?

461
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,400
Do blow jobs count as sex?

462
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,120
I'm not gonna blow you, man,
and that's final.

463
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,320
Come on!

464
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,520
Okay?

465
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,880
Okay.

466
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,480
Sacred vows are all
very well and good...

467
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,240
but only moments later I felt Alex
eyeing my rear end on the way home.

468
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,120
And as we said good night,
Stuart allowed his gaze to linger...

469
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,120
on the gently sloping nape
of Alex's neck.

470
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,680
And I stayed up
for reasons of my own.

471
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,840
But the sacred vow was observed...

472
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,280
at least on the surface...
and we became friends.

473
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,560
Hey, Stuart!

474
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Watch out for the balloons!

475
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm gonna kill you!

476
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
Alex, I'm in here.
Can you please wait?

478
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
How about, "Alex, you look so nice"?

479
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,280
Stuart, let's go.
Get outta here!

480
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,440
Get outta here.

481
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,840
- Alex, come on. Get out.
- Don't fucking push me!

482
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,400
I swear I'll hit you. I'm violent.
I'll hit you with it.

483
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,040
It's not funny!

484
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,240
The oddity of our happy little enclave
is lost on no one.

485
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Especially not the lobby lizards.

486
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,160
All I wanna know
is who's doing who.

487
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,480
I heard that Eddy and Stu
are taking turns with her.

488
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,720
I think the guys are gay,
and she's their fag hag.

489
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,400
She's not a fag hag.
You're a fag hag.

490
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,760
- I am not.
- Leave her alone, Stuart.

491
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,880
Leave me alone!

492
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,520
I don't like you.
Stop it.

493
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,360
You're hurting me!
Would you knock it off?

494
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,120
I bruise easily. I have 5,000
gazillion-jillion bruises from you.

495
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
- Where did he hurt you? Let me see.
- Look at that.

496
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,320
- Right there? Is that where it hurts?
- Don't you get like that.

497
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,160
Oh, my God.
It's total S&M.

498
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,280
Hi.
How are the three musketeers?

499
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,480
Just one big happy family.

500
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,120
It sounds pretty kinky.

501
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,200
Incest is best.

502
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,160
Right there. Right there.

503
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
Unbelievable.

504
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,320
One night, when Alex had the nerve
to go to a party without us...

505
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,680
Stuart and I fell asleep
in her room.

506
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,560
A foul and mysterious odor having
driven us out of our own quarters.

507
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
What are you doing in here?

508
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,160
Our room has
a foul and mysterious odor.

509
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,000
Why don't you clean it?
You used to be a clean person. Let's go.

510
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,440
That was before
I moved in with him.

511
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,440
I used to make hospital corners.
Now I don't even wash my sheets.

512
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,600
- Who are you?
- That's Larry. This is Eddy and Stuart.

513
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,800
Hi.

514
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,840
What's his name? "Scary?"

515
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,720
I think he said " Larry. "

516
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,680
- Get out!
- " Larry?"

517
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, " Larry. "

518
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
Come on. Let's go. Get out.

519
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,720
Stop kicking at me.
Get out.

520
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,960
- Are you hungry?
- No, thank you.

521
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,640
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

522
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
We should've expected it.
No oaths of exclusivity had been taken.

523
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,880
Quite the opposite.

524
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,360
But, nonetheless, we felt supplanted
by Larry and betrayed by Alex.

525
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,640
The sanctuary
had been trespassed upon.

526
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,360
You're a very special girl.

527
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,640
I think I'd like to get
to know you a lot better.

528
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,800
What are your dreams?

529
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,160
Who is Alex?

530
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,800
Gosh, let's not talk.

531
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,360
You're right.

532
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,400
Let's communicate via
the international language of love.

533
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,200
Twenty. Shit.

534
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,960
- You hungry?
- Am I ever not hungry?

535
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,320
Pizza?

536
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,560
Sounds good.

537
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,880
Okay.

538
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,080
- You think Alex is hungry?
- Let's not forget about Scary Larry.

539
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,760
- Hi. You hungry?
- I hope you burn in hell!

540
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,280
I don't think she's hungry.
I think she's mad.

541
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,840
No, you're mistaken.

542
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,960
You need to call her back up
and make sure you didn't...

543
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,680
ruffle her feathers unnecessarily.

544
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,040
What a good idea.

545
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,240
Hi. It's me again.
Look, I was curious.

546
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,520
Are you angry with me because I called,
or because you're just not hungry?

547
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,160
Hello?

548
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,200
She hung up.

549
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,680
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
Are you that jealous?

550
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,320
My dear, we're just worried about
a young man that comes a-courtin'.

551
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,040
Is he a Christian?

552
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,400
- Leave me alone.
- Wait.

553
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,640
- What?
- One more question.

554
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,240
It's about his hair.

555
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Is it fiberglass or steel?

556
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,760
We think that Larry...

557
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,000
is very scary.

558
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,320
- And hairy.
- Very hairy.

559
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,080
So be wary...

560
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,520
of very scary hairy Larry.

561
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,760
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Be wary.

562
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,560
Stop!

563
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,360
Stop that!

564
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,280
No!

565
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,400
What's up, bro?

566
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,720
- Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning.
- Shut up!

567
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,200
By the following morning,
we had forgotten about Scary Larry.

568
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,560
I think I found the source
of your foul, mysterious odor.

569
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,640
My sausage and pepperoni
with extra cheese and double anchovy.

570
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
I been looking for this.

571
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,960
We never heard from Larry
ever again...

572
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,800
but not two weeks later...

573
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,800
Stuart told us about a slice of hair pie
he'd been trying to get a bite of.

574
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,160
Hip to the lingo,
we knew this meant he'd met a girl...

575
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,200
and was trying
to get her into bed.

576
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,680
How come you never say anything?

577
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,840
I'm shy.

578
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,920
How come...

579
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,600
How come you never introduce me
to any of your friends?

580
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,160
You want to meet my friends?

581
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,560
So the nuns says to the mechanic...

582
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,600
" No, but if you give me a lube job,
I'll throw you some Hail Marys. "

583
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,640
I went to Catholic school...

584
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,920
and all my teachers were nuns.

585
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,440
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- No, I...

586
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,400
You didn't, like,
offend me or anything...

587
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,200
but I remember something
that happened with the nuns once.

588
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,200
Well, we took
this field trip once...

589
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,840
and we were on this school bus
that was, like, really old.

590
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,920
So all of a sudden
it just broke down...

591
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,480
and we all got out,
and we waited...

592
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,960
and some of us
started wandering off.

593
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
And we came to this path...

594
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,000
that led to this huge,
like, meadow...

595
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,800
that was really pretty.

596
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,640
Then what happened?

597
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,080
Well, it was just
a really pretty meadow.

598
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,520
That's neat.

599
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,760
Will you excuse me?

600
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,600
I have to go use
the ladies room.

601
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,240
She's so sweet.

602
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,240
Will you kick this
into my forehead, please?

603
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,960
Shut up, all right?

604
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,440
I like being around her.
When I'm around her I feel intellectual.

605
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,160
All things being relative.

606
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,040
Besides that she's got
a really great set of titties.

607
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,200
- No, she doesn't.
- She does. I told her the other night.

608
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,560
- I said, "You have great tits. "
- And good, like, grammar, like, too.

609
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,680
Like, great storytelling.

610
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,960
- She's so sweet.
- She's so sweet.

611
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,760
I was out to dinner with her
the other night...

612
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,320
and I asked her
if she liked Scorsese...

613
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,680
and she said,
"Well, I'm really not that hungry. "

614
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,400
We were efficient
at eliminating outsiders.

615
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,400
It seemed the whole world had been
divided into two categories:

616
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,280
those who got the joke,
and those who didn't.

617
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,840
We were the only ones
who got the joke.

618
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,680
I like her.

619
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,480
I think I was
especially stricken.

620
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,520
I thought that if Stuart and Alex
could have been...

621
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,120
genetically merged
into one person...

622
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,240
he or she would have been
the love of my life.

623
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
I think not.

624
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,240
I promise you'll enjoy yourself.
Just slowly down...

625
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,560
- Just for a second.
- I don't want to!

626
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,160
Please, just for a second.

627
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,080
Right there.

628
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,640
Okay. All right, stop.
Okay. I understand.

629
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay. That's enough. Stop it.
Let go!

630
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,760
Come on, now. This is very serious.
Who else can we think of?

631
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,480
Instead, I had to contend
with their matchmaking notions.

632
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,400
I got it. What about that teacher
of yours in your film class?

633
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,760
You said he was
giving you the evil eye, right?

634
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,240
Stuart, he's 47 years old.

635
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,920
So?

636
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,080
So I don't need to be fixed up,
all right? Let's just drop this.

637
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,680
Yes, you do.
The question is with who.

638
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,400
"With whom. "

639
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,800
I still think it's a job
for a young woman.

640
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,760
He doesn't need pussy.

641
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,200
He needs dick.
Big, hard dick.

642
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,600
Good-bye.

643
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,400
If you're so hot on the idea,
why don't you have sex with him?

644
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,560
Taste of semen makes me gag.

645
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,560
How would you know?
Whose semen were you eating?

646
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,000
My own.

647
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,120
So I see you got "leid," Edward.

648
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,800
What?

649
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,880
Right. Yeah.

650
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,880
That's a good one, Richard.

651
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,040
Front desk dick.

652
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,480
What's up?

653
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,240
Come in, Eddy.

654
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,920
I want you
to say hello to Richard.

655
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,760
- " Hello to Richard. "
- Hello, Edward.

656
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,160
Will you excuse me?

657
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,640
See ya later.

658
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
This is really awkward for me.

659
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,240
What is?

660
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,800
Well, when Alex told me what you said,
I was sort of taken aback at first...

661
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,120
but then I realized...

662
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,760
that I have always
felt similarly toward you.

663
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,000
What exactly did she say?

664
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,920
Well, you know,
that you like me...

665
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,200
but that you were too shy
to say anything.

666
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,720
It's funny, you know. I have always
been attracted to shy people.

667
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,120
Maybe it's because
I'm pretty shy myself.

668
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,920
You seem really nervous.

669
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,720
Maybe this is a mistake.

670
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,360
- No, I'm rushing things. Aren't I?
- No, but...

671
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,960
Look, I've thought you were cute
since you moved in, and I...

672
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,440
Really?

673
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,480
Maybe this'll help you relax.

674
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

675
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,280
Damn it!

676
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,760
Wait a minute!
Where you going?

677
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Listen to me.
I know what I'm talking about.

678
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,280
If you don't get sex pretty soon...

679
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,080
what'll happen is your dick will just
get smaller and smaller and smaller...

680
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,920
until eventually it'll just shrivel up,
go up inside your body...

681
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,720
and then what do you have?

682
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,800
- A vagina.
- Shut up.

683
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,280
We're sorry.

684
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,760
We'll never meddle in your sex life,
or lack thereof, ever again.

685
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,080
What'd he do,
try to grab your nuts?

686
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,680
No.

687
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,720
He tried to kiss me.

688
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,640
I could see his nose hairs.

689
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,040
His breath was really bad too.

690
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,480
Smelled like kitty litter.

691
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,240
It did. I swear to God.

692
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,480
Here it is.

693
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,120
It's great. Too bad we didn't
bring bathing suits, huh?

694
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,080
Don't be an old fart.

695
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,240
Feels good.

696
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,040
Come on in!

697
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,240
Hurry up!

698
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,320
Come on!

699
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,680
- No.
- Come on, Eddy.

700
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,880
No. It's cold.
It's very cold out here. I'm freezing.

701
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,840
- How come you're sweating?
- It's cold sweat.

702
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,680
Please?

703
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,720
Come on!

704
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,760
No one's looking.

705
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,760
Come on.
It feels good on your balls.

706
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,920
That's nice, Stuart.
That's very nice.

707
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,160
Look, the moon's showing.

708
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
It's really cold!

709
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,920
I'm grabbing the rock.
I'm gonna drown.

710
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
I want everyone to stay
with their fun buddy.

711
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,360
Nobody leaves
their fun buddy, okay?

712
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,080
Hey, look!

713
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,680
Oh, no.

714
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,360
Let's go.
Terry, Mary, let's go.

715
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,800
This way.

716
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,920
Alex said that the priest
symbolized God...

717
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
the children, lost innocence...

718
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,120
and the three of us,
a postmodern Eve with two Adams...

719
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,120
banished from the sacred garden...

720
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,040
to wander in the wilderness for eternity
because we had sinned.

721
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,920
We had acknowledged our own nakedness
and partaken of the forbidden fruit.

722
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,920
Though it amounted to only a kiss...
a touch... it changed everything.

723
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,920
Pandora's proverbial box
had been opened...

724
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,080
but, more interestingly...

725
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,360
I'm not sure any of us
wanted it closed again.

726
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,960
Want some pizza?

727
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,920
No. I'm fat.

728
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,560
Alex, you're not fat.
You're skinny.

729
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,960
I'm so fat.

730
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,080
You know,
I've been giving it some thought.

731
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,120
I think you are fat.

732
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,200
Don't toy with my emotions.

733
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,120
Come here.

734
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,080
Comfort me.

735
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,160
I've been so depressed.

736
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,880
Me too.

737
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,320
We don't hang out
like we used to.

738
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
Let's comfort each other.

739
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,200
Put your head on my breast.

740
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Is this a sex thing?

741
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,400
Will you just be human for once?
Put your arms around me.

742
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,120
And relax.

743
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,640
What are you doing, Alex?

744
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,560
I'm lovingly stroking your hair.

745
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,120
You can't stand to be
alone with me, can you?

746
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,640
You always want to have
Stuart along for the ride.

747
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,320
- It's true, isn't it?
- Yeah, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

748
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,160
You're afraid of women.

749
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,880
You hate women.

750
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,800
Why do you hate women?

751
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,160
Just stop it.

752
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,200
Stop it, all right?
I don't hate women.

753
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,960
I don't understand why we can't just
sit here without touching each other.

754
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,640
What's wrong with touching?

755
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,120
You don't try to touch
Stuart all the time, do you?

756
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,840
The only reason you touch me is because
you know I don't like to be touched.

757
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,840
What?

758
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,000
The only reason you're attracted to me
is you know I'm not attracted back.

759
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,160
- That's not true!
- It is true.

760
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,520
You're looking
for a self-destructive situation.

761
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,800
You are a rejection junky,
plain and simple.

762
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,560
What about you? You're the one who's
always drooling all over your roommate!

763
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,840
- Talk about self-destructive!
- I don't drool over him!

764
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,920
Liar!
You know what your problem is?

765
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,840
You're secretly attracted to women,
and you're afraid to admit it!

766
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,720
You're a closet heterosexual!

767
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,280
- I am not.
- Are too.

768
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,560
- Bitch.
- Heterosexual!

769
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,080
Haagen Dazs and brewskies.

770
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,440
Come on, man, we can
make beer floats again.

771
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,240
What the hell was
going on in here?

772
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,800
I hate him!

773
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,720
I do too. So what?

774
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,840
Oh, I'm so sick of this shit!

775
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,960
I'm so sick of it!
It's not normal!

776
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,240
It's not normal,
the three of us living together!

777
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,360
I'm sick of falling in love with guys
who don't give a fuck about me!

778
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,480
I'm not normal!
I need help!

779
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,320
I need medication!

780
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,320
I need money!
Oh, God!

781
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,000
I need a facial!
I need to go on a diet!

782
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,440
I need new shoes!

783
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,800
Oh, God!
Just do something.

784
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,880
Wait, wait, wait!

785
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,920
Here, put it on.

786
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,320
Okay. Okay.

787
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,720
Don't tell Eddy.

788
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,040
It's me. Are you asleep?

789
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,680
Just want to say I'm sorry.

790
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,680
It's okay.

791
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
I shouldn't have said any of it.

792
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,560
I'm glad you called.

793
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,600
I was dreaming about you.

794
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,160
You were my mailman.

795
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,800
And you wore those
cute little mailman shorts.

796
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,840
Kept delivering me things
from the Home Shopping Network.

797
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,480
Yeah, yeah. We'll have to
analyze that someday.

798
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,240
Where are you?

799
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,040
I'm just waiting for
my French Cinema class to start.

800
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,680
I was just thinking
about women and men.

801
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,320
Oh, yeah?

802
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,040
I think you were right
about me being afraid of women.

803
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,960
All men are afraid of women because
they're inherently better creatures.

804
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,920
They can bear children,
they can nurse them.

805
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,040
They have an infinitely higher capacity
to be compassionate.

806
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,200
It's like they're
a different species.

807
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,360
You were just sitting there
thinking about this?

808
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,120
Yeah. It's dumb, I know.

809
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,120
No, it's not.

810
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,640
I feel like I understand women more.
They're more inclusive and open.

811
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,600
With men, there's always a feeling
that everything's a competition.

812
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,840
They're so guarded.

813
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,360
Defensive.

814
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,440
Well, I just never feel
competitive with you.

815
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,680
I feel collaborative.

816
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,640
That's the wrong word.

817
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:22,120
Symbiotic.

818
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,080
Symbiotic.
That's a good word.

819
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,240
That's a really good word.

820
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,520
Listen.
I gotta get to my class.

821
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,720
Wait, Eddy.
Before you go...

822
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,840
will you say some other words,
some really, really big words?

823
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,880
Symbiotic.

824
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,480
Symbiosis.

825
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,160
Profligate.

826
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,600
Sepulchre.

827
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,000
Prevaricate.
Oh, wait, wait.

828
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:59,160
I got a good one,
I got a good one. Concupiscence.

829
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:01,320
Concupiscence?

830
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,760
That's a good one!
That's a really good one!

831
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,480
I gotta go.
I'm really glad we had this talk.

832
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,960
Bye.

833
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,160
Oh, God!
What does "concupiscence" mean?

834
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,760
Beats the shit outta me.

835
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,160
Get out.

836
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,800
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out.

837
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,480
I was beginning to realize that
I had something special in Alex.

838
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Here was a woman who was willing
to do anything to have sex with me.

839
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,560
Suddenly something
very interesting happened.

840
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,760
I seemed to actually
will myself into action.

841
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,800
Was a whole new world
opening up to me?

842
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,840
I was having another dream.

843
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,400
I was in a desert...

844
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,280
and I had on this fur bikini...

845
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,360
like Raquel Welch.

846
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,360
And you were there...

847
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:53,160
as a butcher,
and you had all these sausages.

848
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,080
I must still be dreaming.

849
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,000
No?

850
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,960
This is happening?

851
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,800
This is happening.

852
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,360
Is that how it's supposed to go?

853
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,080
- It was perfect.
- Good.

854
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,360
I'm really glad we did this.

855
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,840
Me too.

856
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,240
That part when my, you know...

857
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,000
was in with your thing and...

858
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,800
- That was good?
- It was great.

859
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,280
Good.

860
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,200
Maybe this should just be
our little secret.

861
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,920
- So?
- So? So what?

862
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,440
So I had sex with a woman.

863
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,440
- What?
- But it wasn't very good, though.

864
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,680
- What woman did you have sex with?
- This girl in my French Cinema class.

865
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,720
Well, fuckin' a, bro!

866
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,960
Yeah, but I didn't
really enjoy it.

867
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,800
You have to change your whole outlook
on this subject matter.

868
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,760
For me, sex, it's like pizza. Even
if it's bad, it's still pretty good.

869
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,000
Okay, fine, whatever.
Just do me a favor. Don't tell Alex.

870
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,440
- Why?
- If she finds out I had sex...

871
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,360
albeit mediocre sex with someone
other than her, she'll get jealous.

872
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,520
Don't worry about that.
This is beautiful!

873
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,200
All you need is a couple more tries.

874
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,120
Before you know it,
you'll be rockin' and rollin'.

875
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,280
The first time you have sex, you're so
flipped out you're actually doing it...

876
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,040
you can't tell whether
you're enjoying it or not.

877
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,680
Come on, man!
God has given you a penis...

878
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,400
and that penis
is meant for fucking.

879
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,280
Ever hear the expression, "The little
head thinking for the big head?"

880
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,200
I live by that. Trust me.
It's a beautiful way to live.

881
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,600
Don't worry about practicing
with somebody alive. I'll get you...

882
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,080
"a blow me up, suck me off,
fuck me" doll.

883
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,960
It'll suck your dick.

884
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,440
You can fuck the shit out of it.
It'll be a beautiful thing.

885
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,440
As Stuart ranted and raved,
something very shocking occurred to me.

886
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,080
I'd always sensed something
strange about Stuart's behavior...

887
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:12,240
something that set him apart
from your average straight guy.

888
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,280
Could it be that what I'd been looking
for was right under my nose all along?

889
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,640
Could Stuart be a homo?

890
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,640
- Are you with me on this or what?
- Absolutely.

891
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,840
- I know something that you don't.
- What?

892
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,840
I'm not supposed to say...

893
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,960
but I think that Eddy
slept with a girl.

894
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,960
- Who?
- He won't say...

895
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,560
but I think it's some chick
from his French Cinema class.

896
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,040
That's nice.

897
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,760
- You want me to come scrub your back?
- Sure.

898
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,520
He thought you'd be jealous.

899
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,000
I can handle it.

900
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,440
There's really nothing to be jealous
about because he said it was lousy.

901
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,520
- What was?
- The sex.

902
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,480
He said that she was
a lousy lay.

903
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,680
There's nothing worse
than a lousy lay.

904
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,320
I remember this girl
from high school, Monica Bryson.

905
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,240
She was like...

906
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,520
like a piece of fish loaf.

907
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,360
I mean she was really
un-fuckin'- believably bad.

908
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,840
I think that I'd rather have a dog fart
in my face than be with her again.

909
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,440
Ow! You're hurting me.

910
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,000
- With this?
- Yes!

911
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:42,520
I think you're upset because
I called her a piece of fish loaf.

912
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,000
I apologize.

913
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,760
Perhaps I should've said
she was a skanky, fishy bitch wad.

914
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,360
Just get out!
Just get out! Get out!

915
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,040
So I was a lousy lay, huh?

916
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,600
What did you say?

917
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,360
Never mind! You weren't supposed
to say anything. It was a secret!

918
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,640
I didn't tell him it was you.
Besides, it wasn't lousy.

919
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,160
It was pretty good, considering...

920
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,720
- Considering what?
- Considering that you're a girl!

921
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,440
I shouldn't have.

922
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,440
I mean, I don't know.

923
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,600
I don't know what the hell I know.

924
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,640
I felt like an impostor.

925
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,920
I am so confused.

926
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,040
It's okay. It was fine.

927
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,960
We just need to practice.

928
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,120
I don't think I can. Anyway,
I think I figured out something.

929
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,520
What?

930
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,840
Come on now.

931
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,840
I think Stu is...

932
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,000
What?

933
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,760
I think he likes boys more than he likes
girls. He's just afraid to admit it.

934
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,040
Think about it.
It makes total sense.

935
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:14,160
He's obsessed with male genitalia. All
he does is talk about cocks and fucking.

936
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,320
He's a complete misogynist.
Women are just objects to him.

937
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,120
He's a total narcissist.
He has intense self-body worship.

938
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,720
He has an absent father, a domineering
mother. And if that's not enough...

939
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,240
he knows all the lyrics
to Oklahoma and The Music Man.

940
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,320
He's a classic closet case.
I know, it's crazy, right?

941
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,200
We don't see what we don't want to see,
but I don't think he knows.

942
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,160
- I'm going to help him find out.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

943
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,280
How much did that bottle cost you?

944
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,640
Money is no object...

945
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,240
when it comes to getting
totally shit-faced.

946
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,520
- Shh. Shh.
- What?

947
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,640
- Wait a minute.
- What do you hear?

948
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,040
What?

949
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,600
How did we get on the ceiling?

950
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,640
- Uh-oh.
- How did we get on the ceiling?

951
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,160
Did you pay
the gravity bill this morning?

952
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,560
I forgot!

953
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,760
I'm sorry.

954
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,680
It's okay.

955
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,600
It's no problem. I forgive you. Let's
just get back on the floor 'cause...

956
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,640
- What?
- We're going back on the floor.

957
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,440
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Look out, floor!

958
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,200
Back on the floor.

959
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,400
Are you seeing anything?

960
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,440
I told you so.

961
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,000
- Don't. You're gonna ruin everything.
- Look at that.

962
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,760
He's wrong for you!

963
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,160
What are they doing?
Oh, my God!

964
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,200
It's like a devil worship thing.

965
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,640
It's not working.

966
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,880
I don't feel so good.

967
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,560
God!

968
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,560
I'm going to be sick.

969
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,360
Just breathe easy.

970
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,920
That feels good.

971
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,920
- You okay?
- Yeah.

972
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,000
Whoa, Eddy.

973
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,720
You'll spoil it.

974
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,600
Spoil what?

975
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,240
The intimacy.

976
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,240
Intimacy?

977
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,160
Eddy, there's not
gonna be any intimacy.

978
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,800
Okay. Just empty sex is fine.

979
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,360
Eddy, are you okay?
Because you're pretty drunk.

980
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,000
And so are you.

981
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,040
I don't like guys, okay?

982
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,320
Yes, you do.

983
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,080
No, I don't.

984
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,040
Stuart, you're
a classic closet case.

985
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,840
Eddy, listen to me.

986
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,800
You got all the telltale signs.
You got absent Oklahoma...

987
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,880
Music Mother, the...

988
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,280
I like girls.

989
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,920
I like them a lot.

990
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,800
I fuck them.

991
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,520
No, see, you don't. You talk about
doin' it, but you don't do it.

992
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,680
It's called denial. Right?

993
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,960
I'm an expert at denial.
I can see that a mile away.

994
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,640
So then how come
I'm fuckin' one right now?

995
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,840
I see, you're fucking an imaginary girl,
right now. Is that it?

996
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,440
You've got an imaginary girl?

997
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,480
He's got an imaginary...

998
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,560
It's just me and you here.

999
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,040
Oh, no, she's not imaginary.

1000
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,960
She's somebody
that you know quite well.

1001
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,560
And every day that you skip off to your
little fuckin' French Cinema class...

1002
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,640
we fuck like dogs...

1003
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,480
and her name is Alex.

1004
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,960
I see.

1005
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:45,360
"I see," said the blind man.

1006
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,960
Oh, shit.

1007
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,560
Look out!

1008
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,280
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Shit, he's bleeding.

1009
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,920
Oh, my God.

1010
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,200
And then I said that I didn't
like guys. He didn't believe me.

1011
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,240
He said I was in denial.
I said, "I like girls. "

1012
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,680
He still didn't believe me.
That's when it just came out.

1013
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,360
What?

1014
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,520
That you and I...

1015
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,320
- You know.
- What?

1016
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,240
That we're fucking, okay?

1017
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,720
You idiot!

1018
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,400
- God!
- I was drunk.

1019
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,200
He was touching me.
I freaked out.

1020
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,840
- That's all I can do from here.
- I don't need any stitches?

1021
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,880
Stitches are next semester.

1022
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,040
In the morning, I went
to my film class as usual.

1023
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,440
Prophetically enough,
they showed an old French film...

1024
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,320
about two men and a woman
in a love triangle.

1025
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,720
Both the men loved the same woman,
and it slowly made her go insane.

1026
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,640
In the end, she killed herself
and one of the men...

1027
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,880
by driving her car off
of a bridge.

1028
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,680
I understood
the moral of the story...

1029
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,480
two's company,
three's pathetic.

1030
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,600
I knew what I had to do.

1031
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,680
Still not funny.

1032
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,120
He's moving out.

1033
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,640
I don't want you to move out.

1034
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,800
- Why not?
- I don't wanna be alone with him.

1035
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,120
I'll move out then.

1036
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,680
Okay.

1037
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,520
Fuck you.

1038
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,960
You wish.

1039
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,440
Fuck both of you.

1040
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,400
You wish.

1041
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,640
Don't you?

1042
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,600
I'm pregnant.

1043
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,080
I think.

1044
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,480
"Within two minutes, the white tab
on the plastic stick may change color.

1045
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,840
If the white tab remains white,
the test is negative.

1046
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,360
If the tab turns pale blue,
the test is positive. "

1047
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,920
If the tab turns pink, you
have been impregnated by a homosexual.

1048
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,000
Nothing's happening.

1049
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,560
- What do we do if it's positive?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1050
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,360
I mean...

1051
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,880
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1052
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:38,160
If I can just get through this part,
everything's gonna be fine.

1053
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,200
I just want to get on
to the next part of my life.

1054
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,160
This part sucks.

1055
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,800
This part sucks?

1056
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,520
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

1057
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,200
Oh, Eddy, I'm nervous, okay?

1058
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,440
I don't think that's it.

1059
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,040
You two wanna get the hell out of here
and forget this ever happened!

1060
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,160
Why haven't we been
hanging out lately?

1061
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,880
How come we haven't talked
in the past couple of weeks, huh?

1062
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:10,400
Maybe you guys can just walk away
and look for something else...

1063
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,400
but it's not that easy for me.

1064
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,320
Eddy, nobody's gettin' out easy.

1065
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:19,840
Nobody.

1066
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,680
You understand that?

1067
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,200
Oh, my God.

1068
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,400
Just prop your head up.
Stuart, come on.

1069
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,640
Oh, Jesus.

1070
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,800
What made this happen?

1071
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,960
I was...

1072
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,520
talking to Jesus.

1073
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,280
Did he say Jesus or Elvis?

1074
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,720
Jesus.

1075
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,160
He said I should cut my penis off...

1076
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,280
Oh, God.

1077
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,760
because it was the cause
of all my problems.

1078
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:18,240
Stuart, you don't have
to cut your pee-pee off.

1079
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,640
You just can't let it
run your life.

1080
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,520
Home free. No baby.

1081
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:58,080
The semester and the year
would be over in three weeks...

1082
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,280
whereupon Alex would move
to an apartment.

1083
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,160
I'll call you guys later.

1084
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,200
Stuart went home for the summer
and moved to another dorm in the fall.

1085
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,040
I noticed that he never seemed quite the
same after that episode in the bathroom.

1086
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,920
We all tried to keep in touch,
but you know how it is.

1087
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,160
The next semester
I got a single...

1088
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,400
a room all to myself.

1089
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,520
Solitude brought out
the worst in me.

1090
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,440
It gave me time to brood over
the nature of things.

1091
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:09,400
I wondered how some people can be such a
necessary part of one's life one day...

1092
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,560
and simply vanish the next.

1093
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,000
Isn't it supposed to last?

1094
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,440
We ran into each other
at graduation.

1095
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,680
And we had lunch
about a year after that.

1096
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,280
It was nice to see them,
but it wasn't like the old days.

1097
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:45,080
Stuart ended up becoming monogamous
to a girl, if you can believe that.

1098
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,600
In fact, I heard
they even got married.

1099
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,520
Alex, on the other hand, enjoyed
staying single for a long time...

1100
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,560
though she admitted to sometimes missing
the rejection from doomed relationships.

1101
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:59,840
Whenever I talk to her, she always
manages to refer to my boyfriend as...

1102
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,840
"the other woman. "

1103
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,600
My college experience
wasn't what I'd planned.

1104
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,200
It bore no resemblance
to the pictures in the brochure.

1105
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,800
But I'm not unhappy.

1106
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,920
I don't think any of us are.

1107
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,640
We got what we needed out of it.

1108
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:23,920
It's kind of like when you go
on vacation. You plan everything out.

1109
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:30,160
But then one day you make
a wrong turn or take a detour...

1110
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:34,280
and you end up in some crazy place
you can't even find on the map...

1111
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,640
doing something you never
thought you'd do.

1112
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,400
Maybe you feel a little lost
while it's happening.

1113
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,960
But later you realize it was
the best part of the whole trip.
