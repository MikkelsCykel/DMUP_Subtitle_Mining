1
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,565
We said we'd do something
I wanted to do.

2
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,480
- We did. Camel riding.
- I hated camel riding.

3
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,600
I really want to do
some real stuff.

4
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,120
What do you mean real stuff?
It's for losers! Ruth?

5
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,920
OK... We'll miss the
Rajasthani buffet!

6
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,640
Ruth!

7
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,240
Ruth!

8
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Ruth, wait!

9
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,600
Is she out of money?

10
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,560
No, it's quite simple.
I have to tell you the truth.

11
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,200
For the sake of Ruth's
and our old friendship.

12
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,440
Oh, what's that taken on?

13
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,560
That's very exotic. Hmm?

14
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,600
- On my Olympus.
- That's interesting.

15
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
Mine's a Minolta.
Is yours an auto flash job?

16
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,120
What am I looking at here, Prue?

17
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,240
Who are these people
in the photo?

18
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Ruth.

19
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,920
That's Ruth.

20
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,360
My God, I didn't realise.
Gilbert, it's Ruth!

21
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,640
Yeah, I can see that now. She's
wearing the national costume.

22
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,800
I'd never have recognised her.

23
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,445
I know.

24
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Is something wrong?

25
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,840
Tell me, I want to know.

26
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,640
We were just like everyone else
travelling in India.

27
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
We wanted to visit a live guru.

28
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,480
We weren't serious about it.

29
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,805
She thought it would
be a good laugh.

30
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,280
Oh, it was so scary. Some sort
of freaky hypnotism happened.

31
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,880
I think they were on drugs.

32
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,680
She even burnt her airline
ticket in front of me.

33
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,560
That's when I asked her,
"Is it true what they said?"

34
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,845
"That Baba might marry you?"

35
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,400
No, thank you, mate. No,
thank you. No, mate. Thank you.

36
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,080
No, no. Say no, Ruth! Say no!
Say no, Ruth. Stop him!

37
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,845
Ruthy, stop him!

38
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,240
No, no, Ruthy! Stop!
Please, no! Say no!

39
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,800
Ruthy! Ruthy!
Somebody help!

40
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,360
This is serious.
Tim, please. It's serious.

41
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,620
Come on.
We were waiting for you.

42
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,280
OK, seriously, what's happening?

43
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
- Who's he?
- He's the top man on the subject.

44
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,880
He's been very very helpful.

45
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Hi, Tim. Isn't it terrible?

46
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,880
But don't worry, Miriam's gonna
get her back. She's going to India.

47
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,640
- Are you?
- I will if I need to.

48
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm determined to fight.

49
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,565
G'day, Tim.

50
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,360
Stop Robbie drinking too much.

51
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:00,085
That's right, Mom, we'll fight.

52
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,160
Don't. Don't come here and mock.
I'm close to the edge, Tim.

53
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Sophie, sterilised at 23
to focus on her spiritual growth...

54
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:13,040
...wanted a reversal at 34.

55
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,245
It can't be done.

56
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,360
- So how do we get her back?
- Lure... You lure her.

57
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,400
Couldn't we contact the
embassy to send her home?

58
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,685
No, you can't.

59
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,525
If she were under 18, yes, under
the International Convention.

60
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,800
But you got nothing on your sister other
than declare her mentally incompetent.

61
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,840
And that's almost impossible to do.

62
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,160
What we often do is steal. These cults
use coercive and deceptive methods.

63
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,960
Steal 'em.
Turn the deception around.

64
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,080
They make up their little
stories, we make up ours.

65
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
But we get her back.

66
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,805
The next step
is the difficult one.

67
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,280
You'll have captured
your daughter's body...

68
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,320
...but not her mind.

69
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,840
So what do we do, Stan?

70
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,925
We hire the man I believe to be...

71
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,725
...the number one exit
counsellor in America.

72
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,560
For legal reasons, it's best
if he's in and out. Untraceable.

73
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,565
- Could it be dangerous?
- Yeah, it's delicate.

74
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,520
The mind's a damn mystery.
Why do people believe in God?

75
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,240
Why do people believe
they're in love?

76
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,720
Why do I tell myself every day,
"You're fat, mate. "

77
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,360
"Today I won't eat
cake, butter or bread"...

78
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,040
...and by lunch time,
I've done the lot?

79
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,560
So what did Mr Hot Dog
American cost?

80
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,840
$10,000 Australian,
plus expenses.

81
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,760
Shit! And what's wrong with
Number Two? How much did he cost?

82
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,040
Forget it, Gilly. We're doing
it. She's our golden girl.

83
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,480
My plane's leaving in
three hours, everybody!

84
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,685
Delhi's hot.
95 to 105 degrees.

85
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
- Oh, God!
- What if she doesn't come back?

86
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,480
When she knows you're
dying, she'll come.

87
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,600
Sure!

88
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,240
What's bitten his old bum?

89
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,160
He doesn't like
pretending to die.

90
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,400
Do you speak English?

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,560
Do you know where that is? That
restaurant? Shiva's Restaurant?

92
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,480
It's a... fair way,
I suppose, is it?

93
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,680
Ah... goodness,
this is busy, isn't it?

94
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,880
Hello. Give me your money, please?
Give me a rupee, please?

95
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,920
I'm sorry, I'm from Australia.
I haven't got any...

96
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
...any Indian money.

97
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,840
Are you sure this is it?

98
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
Mum!

99
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,440
Oh, where's your sari?

100
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,680
- You've got this on.
- I was looking for a sari.

101
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,520
Oh, you're so hot!

102
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,880
Who's that?

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,720
The restaurant's fake holy man.
This is my friend Rahi.

104
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,480
- Who?
- Rahi.

105
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,960
It's my Sanyasin name.
Hello, Miriam.

106
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
Hello.

107
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,080
You need a cold drink.
Have you ever tried a lassi?

108
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,480
- A who?
- A lassi. It's a yoghurt drink.

109
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,840
Is it from a bottle?

110
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,000
Mum, it's clean here.

111
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,440
Yes, only a few dozen flies.

112
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,240
Is there a toilet
or a hole here?

113
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,760
It's a hole.

114
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,280
"All your father and I want... "
Oh, no...

115
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,560
Calmie, calm... Calmie, calm.

116
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,120
Ventolin.

117
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,920
Oogh!

118
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,360
Mum, I've got no idea
what Prue told you.

119
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
She got really scared.

120
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,040
Something amazing
happened to me.

121
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,400
So powerful and so gentle.

122
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
It's... hard for me to describe.

123
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,080
You've got to
experience Baba, Mum.

124
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,740
When he looks at you,
just looks at you...

125
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:07,320
...all your pretensions
and fears just vanish!

126
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,280
Suddenly, it's so obvious
how to live your life.

127
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,640
That it's really possible
to be happy...

128
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,960
...and truthful and do good.

129
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,685
How would you feel if I
were to become enlightened?

130
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,200
Come to a meeting tonight.
It's a beautiful opportunity.

131
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:30,600
Baba's going to be
taking questions.

132
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,080
Just come and see!

133
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,280
He is so full of love.

134
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
Your father and I are pleased
you've found fulfilment.

135
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,080
Are you?

136
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,760
How is Dad?

137
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,525
Like I wrote to you,
he is very ill.

138
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,720
He had a stroke at Bill and
Puss's farm and won't be moved.

139
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,520
Is he going to die?

140
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,360
Yes, he could.
He wants to see you.

141
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,240
He's paid for your ticket home.

142
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,040
See? I cry!
I couldn't cry before.

143
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,520
I didn't know you didn't cry!

144
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,400
Will Daddy...?

145
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,800
Maybe next time.

146
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,080
- What do you mean next time?
- You know, next time.

147
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,640
In another life.

148
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,080
- Oh, never mind.
- He's dying, Ruth!

149
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,480
- Is he scared?
- Of course he is.

150
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,080
He wants to see you!
We've got a ticket for you.

151
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,240
It's really the timing.
Isn't it, Nazni?

152
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
Who is Nazni?

153
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,360
It's Ruth.
That's her apprentice name.

154
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,120
Ruth, can you speak for you?

155
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,720
Would you mind calling me Nazni?
It's my name now.

156
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,200
Look, they only initiate
new Sanyisans once a year...

157
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,525
Fine, fine! You're doing
just as you should.

158
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,240
You're pleasing yourself which
is exactly what we taught you.

159
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,160
Just please yourself. Don't let
our deaths inconvenience you.

160
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,805
You've got great hair.

161
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,480
Oh, goodness.
That's really kind of you.

162
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,880
No, it's fantastic.

163
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,600
- She's a bit nervous.
- Of course.

164
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,720
- How's the hair? Any scent?
- Ah, it's good.

165
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Great.

166
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,000
The kitchen will be
open for supper...

167
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,600
...after the evening
programme...

168
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,800
No.

169
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,600
- Please.
- I'm sorry, no.

170
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,960
I can't be sniffed.
I feel sick, I want to go back.

171
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,925
- Don't be...
- I can't. I feel like an animal.

172
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,400
- Yes you can. You'll be fine, just...
- No, NO! Don't touch me!

173
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,285
- Mum...
- No!

174
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,600
- Mum. Don't be silly. Mum!
- Excuse me.

175
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,880
Mum, stop it.
You're embarrassing me!

176
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:43,360
- No!
- MUM!

177
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,880
No! No!

178
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,320
I can't breathe!

179
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,440
My spray! My spray!

180
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,560
No! No drink! No drink!

181
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,280
Oh, thank God it's QANTAS.

182
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,760
We're here, it's fine.

183
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,720
- Hello!
- Oh, my God!

184
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,445
Why is Miriam so freaked out?

185
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,900
Oh, she thinks
I'm gonna live in India...

186
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:16,285
...marry Buba and
commit group suicide.

187
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,960
She and Dad hate Indians.
You know? Dark people.

188
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,920
They're just the main points.

189
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,240
Well...?
Are you going to marry him?

190
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,000
- I wish.
- You wish?!

191
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,560
Well, yeah.
He's an absolute love.

192
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,325
There's, um...
just three problems.

193
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,680
He's not cute, Ruth.
Look at him. He's like, old!

194
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,800
It's about love. It's not that
literal. Marriage is symbolic.

195
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,800
He's marrying everyone.

196
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,240
Sydney, Australia.
Case 190.

197
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,240
Fabio's an extra body
if needs be, and Robbie, too.

198
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,040
- Hi, there.
- Yep, whatever's necessary.

199
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,160
Mr Waters, my name's Yvonne,
with a 'Y'. I'm Robert's wife.

200
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:21,157
It's such a relief
you've arrived...

201
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,120
...because we've all
been so worried.

202
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm here to be of assistance
to you. I'm on supplies.

203
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,320
Do you find it hard to get
polite help in America?

204
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,360
- Polite?
- People with lovely manners.

205
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,840
Don't look at Robbie.
He hasn't got any.

206
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,760
Where's the guy with
the exiting experience?

207
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,000
Ah... Colin, where's he?

208
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,200
He's had a family misfortune.
His mother died.

209
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,880
Oh, God, Stan! Was it expected?

210
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,320
Excuse me. This is not looking
good, Stan. I needed Colin.

211
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,760
I can't begin this work without a
properly experienced assistant.

212
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,880
- Those are the rules.
- That's where Robbie comes in.

213
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,160
Stan, come here a moment.

214
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,400
I'm a little aggravated.
I could've got my Carol to come...

215
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,080
...and she is good.

216
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,320
Now instead, you've
given me two fruitcakes -

217
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,600
One's a ponytail and
the other is a clown!

218
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,240
Now, exiting is a...
precision exercise.

219
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,120
I'm taking a leap with
this girl into the sky.

220
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,360
We put everything at risk.

221
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,520
And when we get to the bottom,
I need her parachute to open.

222
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:38,160
I need mine to open.

223
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Now, which of these men would
you trust to pack your chute?

224
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,560
Ah... Fabio?
I think he'd do a neat job.

225
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:49,080
He'd do a neat job
with his toilet bag.

226
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,280
If he hasn't packed one before,
would you trust him?

227
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey! Don't splash!
No, no, no, no!

228
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,360
- Yvonne! Yvonne!
- What?

229
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,800
OK, cop you later.
That was Tim, my older brother.

230
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,040
He's a gay man. They've arrived.

231
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,840
She's visited Dad once,
but she's restless.

232
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,325
So, where do we go from here?

233
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,720
I'll take a look at her when I
arrive, then we'll start talking.

234
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,125
Mm-hmm.

235
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,920
She's not that easy to
chat to. Is she, Robbie?

236
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,640
This isn't a chat. This is a
conversation that takes 3 days.

237
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:32,720
It's a very intuitive thing,
very concentrated.

238
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,800
So, what is it that you do?

239
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,200
I work a basic
three-step system...

240
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,680
...where I steer the subject
toward a breakthrough.

241
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,480
Breakdown, whatever
you prefer to call it.

242
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,720
Step one - isolate her,
get her attention and respect.

243
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,120
When she's listening, I start
to push her. The heat goes on.

244
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,040
- The heat?
- It's very traumatic for her...

245
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,640
...which it's supposed to be.

246
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,480
- You want some? It's hot.
- No, thank you.

247
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,000
Step two -
I remove all her props...

248
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,840
...her books, her sari,
if she wears one.

249
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,725
- Is she wearing one?
- Yeah.

250
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,880
Actually, she looks quite feminine
for a change. Doesn't she, Robbie?

251
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:14,840
What?!

252
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Finally, the clouds of
her unreason burst -

253
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,200
there's tears, sobs,
hugs with the family and...

254
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,840
...it's over for me.

255
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,240
But, just beginning for you.

256
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,720
I've successfully exited
189 subjects...

257
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,880
...with a recidivist rate of 3.5%.

258
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,180
There's no one in the US or UK
who can match those statistics.

259
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:39,400
I've rejected three cases when
I've judged the subject too...

260
00:22:39,435 --> 00:22:41,400
...psychologically unstable.

261
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,280
Do you have a wife or
lady friend, Mr Waters?

262
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,960
Why do you ask?

263
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,320
I bet she wouldn't
stand a chance.

264
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,920
What do you mean?

265
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,880
You're very persuasive.

266
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
I imagine you could persuade
any woman to do anything.

267
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,560
- Hi, Mummy.
- Hi, baby.

268
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,080
- Hi, Aunt Puss.
- Good morning, early bird.

269
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,365
Where are the boys?

270
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,120
Back at the motel,
cuddled up asleep.

271
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,120
I thought I'd just... drive out
and say bye to Dad.

272
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,760
Oh, he's sleeping, Ruth,
I think he should be left.

273
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,080
Don't worry.
I'll sneak in. I won't wake him.

274
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,200
Wait, Ruth. We'll come, too.

275
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,040
Ok, race you.

276
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,400
Come on!

277
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
Oh, God.

278
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,280
Om...

279
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,040
Om mani padme om...

280
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,240
Dad, you're up!

281
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,800
My God, that's great!
That's great!

282
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
What's the matter?

283
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,000
What's going on?
You're not sick at all, are you?

284
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,680
We're all sick from
worrying about you, Ruth.

285
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
What?!

286
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,480
There's someone visiting
we want you to talk to.

287
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,365
You're bullshitting me.

288
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,880
We want to be sure
you're on the right track.

289
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,440
Look, you'll bloody well stay
here... Get this sheet...!

290
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,845
How dare you?!

291
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,120
- Hey! Hey!
- Liar! You lied to me.

292
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,360
I fucking came home! Made me
think you were dying. You liar!

293
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,840
- We did it cos we all love you.
- Yeah, we all love you. I love you.

294
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,565
You know we love you.

295
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,320
Yeah, Ruth.
We all love you.

296
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:57,840
We love you, sis.

297
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,520
- Where's Mum?
- Give it time.

298
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,240
- Come on. I'll take you to meet him.
- It's for your own good.

299
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,680
No, thanks. Where's Mum?

300
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,600
You want your mummy now,
do you? Not so tough, eh?

301
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,600
You've met your match in him,
girlie. He's kinda strike you out.

302
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,000
He's a great guy, sis. He's really
experienced in religion and stuff.

303
00:27:20,035 --> 00:27:22,400
Just three days, just listen to him.

304
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:25,080
Get round her, get round her.

305
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,720
You fucking lying shit!
You lying shit! I hate you!

306
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,200
- Let go. Let go.
- Behave yourself.

307
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,720
Tim. Timmy.

308
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,160
Timmy, let me talk to you
and Mum, please.

309
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,160
Tim, please, Tim.

310
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,200
Please! Please, Timmy, please!

311
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,520
Please! Please! Timmy!

312
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,600
Come on, walk over.

313
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,760
Oh, God!

314
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
He's not there?

315
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,400
No other back-ups,
nobody else?

316
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,920
Phone's out of range.
It doesn't work.

317
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,960
Look at this.

318
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,760
It's a gift, see?
She's coming towards me.

319
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,840
We're on step one.
This could be over in 12 hours.

320
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,160
- What about your lady friend, Carol?
- I need someone now.

321
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,045
But there isn't anyone.

322
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,600
I've tried the Rabbi, I've left
several messages, no response.

323
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,600
- What do we do? Just let her go?
- Yeah, we let her go.

324
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,080
Three little steps, Stan.
But you don't want to fall.

325
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,760
Well...
you're the expert.

326
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,840
I wanna talk to my mother.

327
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,880
Sure.

328
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,720
You're in.
So, are you gonna do it?

329
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,560
Ah... there.

330
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,880
Why?

331
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,600
Why? Why?

332
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,400
Because I think you've
been manipulated...

333
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
...maybe even drugged.

334
00:30:02,955 --> 00:30:06,520
No... No, Mum.

335
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,800
Mum, I'm the only one of my
friends who doesn't do drugs.

336
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,600
Tell her!

337
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm sorry, Ruth,
that's what I believe.

338
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,000
I believe you're
manipulating me right now.

339
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,960
Mum, Mum, Mum...
why are you here?

340
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,760
To save you.

341
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,920
No. I mean on Earth. Why are you
here? What's the point of your life?

342
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,960
- This is a trick.
- No, no Mum.

343
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:46,000
It's a real question. Why are you here?
Did you ever think about that?

344
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,880
Yes, I think about
a lot of things.

345
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,400
I think about the...
magnetic draw of the planets...

346
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,400
...their ever-shifting
relationship...

347
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
...the healing power of crystals...

348
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,685
Look. Mum and Dad have spent
a small fortune on this guy...

349
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,640
...who by the way has a very good reputation.
- According to who?

350
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,125
No. According to who?

351
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,965
So why don't you just
do the three days?

352
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,125
According to who?
Excuse me, according to who?

353
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,040
Ok, to a friend of mine,
a doctor, a psychiatrist, ok?

354
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
May I?

355
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,800
Come on.

356
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,880
Come on, big jump. Coming! Ooh!

357
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,080
Oh! That was a good one.

358
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,200
My turn.

359
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,480
What do you believe in?

360
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,085
Safe sex.

361
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,840
- Sex?
- Hey, I'm an anarchist.

362
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,840
My parents subscribe
to their magazine.

363
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,560
The Lord's Prayer is muttered
by traumatised, paranoid worms...

364
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,965
...grovelling for a
meagre existence.

365
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,760
- Traumatised worms?
- Traumatised paranoid worms.

366
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,240
So what's happening?
Have they finished?

367
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,440
No. The good news is
she's shaken hands on it.

368
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,160
She's going to do the three days.

369
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,160
He finally promised her a ticket
back to India. Excuse me, Robbie!

370
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,680
He wants to leave
as soon as possible.

371
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,360
Where are they going?

372
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,320
I think he should have told me about it.
I'm supposed to be security.

373
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,040
A halfway hut. Says he can't
work anywhere near the family.

374
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,405
Look, we're very lucky to
have him in the circumstances.

375
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,200
His personal assistant's coming
from America. And she's experienced.

376
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm not gonna think costs.
We HAVE to do it.

377
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:53,240
But what about
the security operation?

378
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,480
What about Fabio?
Do we send him home?

379
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,780
- Well done, dear.
- Fuck off all of you.

380
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:01,000
You, madam, watch yourself
with your mother.

381
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,480
Hey, come on, Ruth.

382
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,080
You can talk, you hypocrite.
Where's your little love bomb?

383
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,720
- I don't know what you mean.
- Don't engage with her.

384
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:13,280
Yes, you do. Where's my
half-sister then, Dad?

385
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
You know, your secretary's
secret little love bomb?

386
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,560
What love bomb?

387
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,680
If this cure works, I'll be
as fucked a liar as you!

388
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,520
Keep up with her. Go!

389
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,400
- To the rescue!
- It's my go.

390
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,560
Batman!

391
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,680
Shoes, please, Ruth.

392
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,920
Day one -
Isolate her. Get her attention.

393
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,320
Win her respect.

394
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,760
I feel for these kids,
every one of them.

395
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,240
They're lost and they
don't know it yet.

396
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,000
This is, um...
a complete waste of time.

397
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,440
You're never gonna break me.

398
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,480
That's fine.
I didn't expect it to be easy.

399
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,880
You're a young, intelligent lady
with strong convictions.

400
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,960
It would be disappointing
if it were too quick.

401
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,080
There's no way I can even listen to
someone like you, who dyes their hair.

402
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,240
- I've made up my mind.
- You grew up your mind?

403
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,520
Yes, that's right.

404
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,280
And how may I ask,
did that happen?

405
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,280
- What?
- How did you do it?

406
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,280
Did you make your mind
hard and solid like a brick...

407
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,400
...always the same, rain or shine,
nothing gets through?

408
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,320
If I say to you "don't think
of pink butterflies"...

409
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,480
...you don't, right? Or do you?

410
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,200
I'm not thinking
of pink butterflies.

411
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,040
You just mentioned them.

412
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,440
You see, the mind is
a rebel, not a servant.

413
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,520
I'm not the one who will
break you. Your own mind will.

414
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,640
"It will seek the truth and
the truth will set you free. "

415
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,200
John Vlll, 32.

416
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,280
It's already heard the truth.

417
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,440
The truth about your saintdom?
Baba and Mrs Baba.

418
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Not everything's a posture.
Not everything's a joke.

419
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,720
You're right. It's not a joke.
We're talking about your soul here.

420
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,560
Have you thought about the damage
that could be done to your soul...

421
00:36:40,595 --> 00:36:43,165
...to your very centre...

422
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,120
...if you hand it over
to someone else?

423
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,960
To the wrong someone else?

424
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,640
"I feel within me that spark...

425
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,480
..."that atom emanation of the
divine spirit. " Giuseppe Verdi.

426
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
The soul is the match.

427
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,760
The spark.

428
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,840
The flame that
can light your path.

429
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,240
I wanna ask you a question.

430
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,560
What in your opinion is the most
important task of a human life?

431
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,120
Any idea?

432
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,920
Is this multiple choice,
or a fake question?

433
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,080
It's an oratory technique.
Have you heard of Socrates?

434
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,840
Yeah.

435
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,000
"The soul takes nothing
with her to the other world...

436
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:06,640
..."but her education and culture. "

437
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,600
So, let's get to the facts.

438
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,440
What are you doing
with your soul?

439
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,960
What does Chidaatma Baba
teach you?

440
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:18,400
What's the point
of my telling you?

441
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
You already have an opinion.

442
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,040
I wanna know what you know.

443
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,400
Something has
touched you, hasn't it?

444
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,160
To find out that, you'd have
to look into my heart.

445
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,480
Way beyond something
you can read in a book and quote.

446
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,000
It is. It is. It is.
That's his teaching.

447
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,400
And that's what he said?

448
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,600
His words? It is.

449
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,920
His words.

450
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,160
"He alone attains unto it
who exclaims 'It is! It is!'

451
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,600
"Thus may it be perceived and
apprehended in its essence. "

452
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,960
The Upanishad.

453
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,240
The Upanishad, Ruth.
An ancient Hindu text.

454
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,920
Feel with your heart,
but check your facts.

455
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,400
I want my shoes back.

456
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,920
No. You agreed to stay...

457
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,160
...and I'm going to
make it easy for you.

458
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,560
You can't stand the fact
that I've got faith, can you?

459
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,600
Cos you're so frightened
and dried up.

460
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,600
But feeling... just trusting
your heart... is beyond you.

461
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,040
I get strength like... like you
can't imagine from my choice.

462
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,040
That's what we're
really here to examine.

463
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,840
The meaning of the word "choice",
and whether you had one or not.

464
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Hello?

465
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,565
Listen, I need clothes for Ruth.

466
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,560
- Oh, yes.
- Can you meet me at the yards?

467
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,320
Ok, but... two changes?
Do you think dresses or pants?

468
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,960
- You decide.
- Dresses?

469
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,840
- Have you got the clothes?
- Yeah, clothes and the coffee.

470
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,000
So, has she started
talking yet?

471
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,440
A little.

472
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,640
She's so lucky
to have you to talk to.

473
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,720
I've got problems,
too, you know?

474
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,880
Robbie thinks
I've been having an affair.

475
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,160
- Yeah, he found my letters...
- So, you are?

476
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,320
Robbie's so mad.

477
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,560
He just wants
to beat the guy up.

478
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,320
He has no idea who it is,
and he'll never ever guess.

479
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,880
Shall I tell you?

480
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,040
Ok...

481
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,720
Me.

482
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,240
I wrote them...
and they're so beautiful.

483
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,000
And they're so romantic.

484
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,240
You wrote the letters?

485
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,760
I don't have sex with Robbie.
I have sex with film stars.

486
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,920
I cut out their picture and I
stick them on my bedside drawer.

487
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,165
And when we make love...

488
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,520
...I pretend it's Brad Pitt
or Tom Cruise.

489
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,240
- I like Sly, too. Do you?
- Mmm.

490
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,440
In the dark...

491
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,000
.. I imagine that Robbie's
arms and legs are theirs.

492
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,080
Oh, that's lovely, Robbie.
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

493
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,600
Oh, Tom, Tom!
Oh, God, Matt! Matt!

494
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,680
Sometimes I get
a little confused...

495
00:43:25,715 --> 00:43:27,200
...because I can't
remember who it is...

496
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:29,800
.. who is making love to me.

497
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,840
But... but I think
that Yvonne is cheap!

498
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,200
Take it easy.

499
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,600
Breathe... into the diaphragm.

500
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,640
- Yeah.
- Keep breathing.

501
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,965
I mean, who's
gonna want me...

502
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,920
...when they know how
many guys I've slept with?

503
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,040
- Keep breathing.
- Yes, thank you, the breathing.

504
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,560
Down here.

505
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,120
The breathing.

506
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,120
Do you have a web site?

507
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,800
Keep breathing.

508
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,280
Oh!

509
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,040
Keep breathing.

510
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,200
Day Two -
A painful day for the client.

511
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,680
Remove her props,
upset her and provoke her.

512
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,320
So I put the sari up the tree.
No more Mr Nice Guy.

513
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,200
I want my clothes back.

514
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,120
Juice?

515
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,120
I thought I was gonna have
to wait for the longest time...

516
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,720
...for the real you
to break through.

517
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,800
You think a sari
is going to change that?

518
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,280
Ten hundred saris
won't hide that.

519
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,600
And you'll only succeed in tying
a big knot around yourself.

520
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,160
Hello? Would you share
what you're thinking, please?

521
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,040
Hello?

522
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,120
Meditating.

523
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,640
I was just meditating on the
difference between you and Baba.

524
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,360
He wears a dress.

525
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,520
He lives the way he teaches.

526
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,920
And what specifically
has he taught you?

527
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,160
To do good. To be
a good person!

528
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,600
And how is that
manifesting itself?

529
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,520
Are you out there doing
good deeds, paying taxes?

530
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,165
- You're a cynic.
- Yes.

531
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,840
Yes, I am a cynic.
Because I investigate crap.

532
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,680
What about the
crap in you, Ruth?

533
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,800
Did you take that to the guru?

534
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,440
You're a shit.
You don't care about me!

535
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,200
You don't even know me.

536
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,000
And I didn't go to Baba to get
my fucked-upness fixed.

537
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,840
- You'd be the first.
- Allright!

538
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,800
So I hoped it would
help me grow!

539
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,120
- I know I'm not perfect.
- Good, Ruth.

540
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,680
Yeah.

541
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,680
So what do you
believe in, then?

542
00:47:06,715 --> 00:47:09,000
Why do you want to know?

543
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,800
Because I'm just curious to
know what you worked out.

544
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,880
So you can follow me? Sorry,
honey, that's not my ticket.

545
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:39,320
I told you. Don't you ever touch me!
My body is mine... honey.

546
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,240
You're a prick!

547
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,600
You know, you'd be
better off crying.

548
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,240
FUCK YOU!

549
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,400
I don't want to
disempower you.

550
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:50,880
Oh, yeah?

551
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,200
If you want disempowerment,
go right back to Mother India!

552
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:56,165
See how they treat women there!

553
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Or didn't you notice those
little ultrasounds blipping away...

554
00:47:59,235 --> 00:48:01,720
...so people say,
"Oh, my God, it's a girl"...

555
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,120
...and flush her out and abort her.

556
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,120
- They're more honest.
- Excuse me?

557
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,720
They're more honest
in their hatred of women!

558
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,680
I don't hate women.
I love ladies.

559
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,440
"Ladies".
You wouldn't know any.

560
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,880
I bet you date little
Barbie dolls, don't you?

561
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,040
"Oh, you're so brainy,
you're so big!"

562
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,160
"Can I suck your dick?"

563
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,640
Can I be alone now?

564
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,320
So, was it the ultimate revenge?

565
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
What was?

566
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,960
Taking your beauty
off to an ashram?

567
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,320
Beauty has its own price.
You wouldn't know.

568
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:51,080
It attracts the shit.

569
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,720
Can do.

570
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,720
I've dated some beautiful
ladies. My ex-wife was a model.

571
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,160
Wow!

572
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,040
A bit paranoid - always
going on about fat people.

573
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,160
She looked good, though.

574
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,400
Oh, right.

575
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,680
- Excuse me?
- "She looked good, though. "

576
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,000
Yes, well, it didn't
work that well.

577
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,200
There was a kind of a...
hostility between us.

578
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,680
She was always mixing about -
very flirty with the friends -

579
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,840
...suggesting open marriage,
which we... did.

580
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,920
We both slept around.
Um... I slept around.

581
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,400
Then we went to India.
There were six of us.

582
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,600
Next thing, she's off
with my best friend.

583
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,600
I punched him out...
left the bus and wanted to die.

584
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,360
That's when I met Singh,
the so-called God.

585
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,525
I shook all over. I totally...
relinquished myself then.

586
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,200
If I saw any crap, wich I did on
occasion, I put it down to a test.

587
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:04,800
You know, Singh was testing me.

588
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,440
Then one starred day...

589
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,640
...he took me to his private
rooms and hugged me.

590
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,240
I thought, "I'm special,
he's chosen me".
