1
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,745
Over there. Look.

2
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,582
Dwight, don't!

3
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:05,959
Asshole!

4
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:10,589
Are you nuts? You can't see the cap?
It's not orange enough?

5
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,133
Get out of these woods!

6
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:17,846
- I can hunt here. I got a permit.
- Lf he's got a permit...

7
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,015
Get out!

8
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,981
Let's go.

9
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,945
<i>That's Dwight Armstrong,
my stepfather.</i>

10
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,947
<i>Accent on "step."</i>

11
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,241
<i>He's a lawyer.</i>

12
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:41,203
<i>And he's head of
"The Friends of Fish and Wildlife"...</i>

13
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,540
<i>... an extremist pro-mammal group
in Vermont.</i>

14
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:49,545
<i>Almost all its members, male
and female, look like Dwight.</i>

15
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:53,340
<i>My real dad died
in a motorcycle wreck when I was 6.</i>

16
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,094
<i>Two years later,
Mom met Mr. Personality.</i>

17
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,972
<i>It has not been a barrel of laughs.</i>

18
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:23,579
<i>There was a certain poignancy
about today's hunting party.</i>

19
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:26,164
<i>It was my last evening at home.</i>

20
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:31,795
<i>Tomorrow I was beginning my first year
at New York University film school.</i>

21
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,965
<i>A freshman. That was me.</i>

22
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,019
<i>My farewell dinner was
raucous and hilarious...</i>

23
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>... full of warm, good feelings.</i>

24
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,196
That should cover it.

25
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,283
<i>Dwight gave me $600 spending
money...</i>

26
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,203
<i>... and a hearty handshake.</i>

27
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,448
- Where's the subway?
- Downstairs.

28
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,158
- That way?
- Right.

29
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,383
Sorry.

30
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,227
Forget it. He's out like a light.

31
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,479
The shame of the cities.

32
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,274
- Nothing broken?
- I'm okay.

33
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,734
That was a nasty spill.

34
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,778
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

35
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:24,449
- I'll give you a hand with those bags.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

36
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,286
You're a smart kid.

37
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:28,745
Rule 1:

38
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:34,126
Don't let anybody touch your bags
unless you know that person is bonded.

39
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,377
Thanks.

40
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,881
I'm bonded, which is your good fortune.

41
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,218
Ignore her.

42
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,722
Who's this stranger talking to you?

43
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,559
It's Victor Ray of the
Victor Ray Car Service.

44
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,936
On your way to college, right?

45
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,355
- New York University.
- Good school.

46
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,692
Thanks. Do you know
where the subway is?

47
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,154
- You don't want the subway.
- Yes, I do.

48
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,782
- It's over there.
- Thanks.

49
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,999
In New York, we have
three distinct social classes.

50
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,629
A: People who make a billion dollars a
day and get laid in Trump Tower.

51
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,217
B: People who live in Times Square and
eat Yankee Doodles on the sidewalk.

52
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,512
C: Me.
Guys I call "the glue of society."

53
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:30,057
We go, "Forget about it."
All hell will break loose.

54
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:34,353
- Rich against poor.
- We're on the brink. It's seething.

55
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,689
Come with me.

56
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:42,110
For $65, you get an air-conditioned
ride and peace of mind.

57
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,862
No, I can't afford that.

58
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,199
I'll take you for the old rate, fifty.

59
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,576
No, it's out of my league.

60
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,205
- How much can you go for?
- I don't know.

61
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,377
- Forty, which for me is charity.
- Ten dollars I can manage.

62
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,254
Ten dollars?

63
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,966
For delivery and security in a
mint-condition Bonneville?

64
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,342
I have to eat.

65
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:10,055
I can't do better.
I'll walk or take a bus.

66
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,558
Okay, ten bucks.

67
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,687
I'll take you for ten bucks,
but on one condition.

68
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:21,024
Promise you won't tell anybody.
Word gets out, I'm finished.

69
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:24,820
- I won't tell a soul.
- Follow me.

70
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,364
I'm parked in a reserved spot.

71
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,032
Let's go. Come on.

72
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,826
Watch out!

73
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,288
Watch out! Suicide attempt, right?

74
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,375
It's bigger than I imagined.

75
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:42,921
That's true of many things in Manhattan.
The other boroughs too.

76
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,882
Tremendous things in Queens.

77
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,886
Go to the trunk.
It opens from the inside.

78
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:53,599
Take everything.
You'd be surprised how many people...

79
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,272
Stop the car!

80
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,110
Stop the car, please!

81
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:22,044
<i>I'd been in New York 19 minutes 11
seconds, and I was already ruined.</i>

82
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,265
Action.

83
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,519
The roommate enters. Come on in.

84
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,813
Don't be afraid. That's it. Come in.

85
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:46,652
I'm holding you in a medium shot.
A lovely shot. Very cinematic.

86
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,904
My name is Clark Kel...

87
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:52,783
A little confused. I like it.
It sells.

88
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,537
I like actors who think
in front of the camera.

89
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,040
- I'm moving in.
- Is this the right room?

90
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,042
Cut.

91
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,420
That's a wrap. Check it.

92
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,840
Kellogg?

93
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,258
You're...?

94
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,677
- Steve Bushak.
- How do you do?

95
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,637
Really nice to meet you.

96
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,350
I should go to the police.

97
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,937
Kojak is a fictional character.

98
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,774
- Don't involve the police.
- So I'm just a victim.

99
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,528
Everybody in this city is a victim.

100
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,573
Welcome to New York.

101
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,414
I'm deeply moved.

102
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,125
I understand your position, but...

103
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:48,297
For Introduction to Film you must own
Fleeber's "Viewpoints in Cinema..."

104
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,884
...and "Selected Readings in Cinema,"
by...

105
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,177
...Fleeber.

106
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,345
I want to buy your books...

107
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,931
They aren't "my" books, Mr. Kellogg.

108
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:02,895
They are essential reading, as are
the 12 other books you must own...

109
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,439
...and which will cost over $700.

110
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:31,048
I'm doing a paper, "And The Wheels Go
Slow: Form and Function in "42nd St."

111
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,345
That would be a very interesting idea.
Take a musical...

112
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,972
Call your family for more money.

113
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,517
My stepfather won't help me out.

114
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,602
This is out of Dickens.

115
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:47,105
Robbed by a street urchin.
A wicked stepfather.

116
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,899
I don't know what to say.

117
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,654
I'm trying to explain that I can't
get the books now.

118
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,823
I'm a faculty advisor,
not a caseworker.

119
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,369
I'm only interested
in your academic career.

120
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:04,248
And you're off to an extraordinarily
unimpressive start.

121
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:09,419
I'm sorry,
but being new to New York...

122
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,934
Excuse me. I have to leave now.

123
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:33,986
Hey! Excuse me.

124
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,335
Hey, wait up!

125
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,714
Stop him! Wait!

126
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:11,982
Watch it!

127
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,573
I want my money and my stuff. Now!

128
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,163
My money or I call the cops!

129
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,207
No English!

130
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,210
Knock it off! I know who you are!

131
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,003
Where's my stuff?

132
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:36,173
Upstairs. Give me a hand with this.

133
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,383
You crazy?

134
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:43,597
I victimized you in a moment of
weakness and now justice is done.

135
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,932
Give me a hand.

136
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,605
My money.

137
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,899
Do you have my money?

138
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,276
Watch your step. Floors are wet.

139
00:12:56,527 --> 00:13:01,448
- Give me the money immediately...
- I'd love to do just that.

140
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,450
However...

141
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:07,246
...here we have an awkward moment.

142
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,123
Tragically...

143
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,751
...I have a gambling problem.

144
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,755
I placed a wager on a horse.
Predictably.

145
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,008
You lost my money on a horse?
All of it?

146
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,803
Now, I'm not sure it was a horse.

147
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,097
Oh, God. Oh, God.

148
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,558
I swear, it was a responsible bet.

149
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,478
It was a 4-to-1 shot. What can I say?
Took a beating.

150
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,773
But I still got most of your clothes.

151
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,775
I'm going to the police.

152
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:42,197
Police? You're a college student.
I'm a working man. No police.

153
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,827
No? Robbery is still a crime
in New York. It's not legal.

154
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,454
It depends on the circumstances.

155
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,498
Bullshit.

156
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,836
I'll get you a job.
An unbelievable opportunity.

157
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,464
- You're just the guy.
- I'm serious. In fact...

158
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,717
No, forget about it.

159
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,390
- What?
- No.

160
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:12,227
It's irresponsible of me.
So much money.

161
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,147
What is it?

162
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,526
I shouldn't offer you this job.

163
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,820
But I'm in an awkward position...

164
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,700
...between my feelings of guilt towards
you and my family obligations.

165
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,535
I don't know what you mean.

166
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:32,623
I'm offering you a job
that I promised to my sister's kid.

167
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,543
Perfect for a college student.
Flexible hours, big money.

168
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:41,006
My sister will kill me. She'll get a
gun and blow my brains out.

169
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,135
What kind of work? Stealing cars?

170
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:49,973
If you're going to be a cynic...

171
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:53,977
You expect me to trust you
after you steal everything I own?

172
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:59,024
Don't do anything you don't want to.
I'm giving you a choice is all.

173
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,194
If you want to make serious money...

174
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,198
...be at this address
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

175
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:11,954
"120 Hester Street.
Old World Social Club."

176
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,791
You'll work for my Uncle Carmine.
A great man.

177
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,711
He's the smart one in the family.

178
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,256
Look who's here! Don't be shy.
Come right in.

179
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,425
I wasn't sure this was it.

180
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,886
This is it.
Best neighbourhood in New York.

181
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,764
Uncle Carmine's waiting for you.
Here we go.

182
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,065
There at the desk. That's him.

183
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:25,194
- He's your uncle?
- Yeah. Do me a favour.

184
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,488
Don't say anything about my gambling.

185
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,662
I said, "How are you doing?"

186
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:38,123
"Very well," he says.

187
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,416
Hello.

188
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,836
This is my good friend Clark,
from Kansas.

189
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,171
Vermont.

190
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:51,845
"My heart is filled with much
happiness in meeting you," he says.

191
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,934
God Almighty.

192
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:02,856
You notice the resemblance, right?

193
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,526
He's the real thing. The original.

194
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,029
When they saw him,
they based the movie...

195
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,199
So is he a Mafia guy?

196
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,870
No, local businessman. Importer.
That's it.

197
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,873
- What a kisser.
- Unbelievable.

198
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,757
This is my uncle, Carmine Sabatini.

199
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:33,720
Uncle Carmine, this is Clark.
You never told me your last name.

200
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,390
- Kellogg.
- Just like the cereal.

201
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,893
Like the breakfast cereal.

202
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,688
Your resemblance to...

203
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,357
- Clark, have a seat.
- Pull up a chair.

204
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,952
- Would you like a nut?
- No, thank you.

205
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,289
None for me, Uncle Carmine.

206
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,919
Did you ever try Italian coffee?

207
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,379
No.

208
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:11,550
- Would you like to try a little taste?
- Yeah. Why not?

209
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,553
- Good.
- None for me, Uncle Carmine.

210
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,351
"Two espressos," he says.

211
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:27,566
That picture on the wall
wouldn't by any chance be Mussolini?

212
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,903
It ain't Tony Bennett.

213
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,949
Some older members of the club...

214
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,287
...they keep it up there for sentiment.

215
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,081
- Sentiment.
- The old days.

216
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,376
For the old days.
For good or for bad.

217
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,631
It would be like, for you,
a picture of the Beatles.

218
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,760
They're actually before my time.

219
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,638
Whatever. You understand.

220
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:02,017
You don't keep the picture up
for political reasons.

221
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,144
No. It's not political.

222
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,396
It's definitely not political.

223
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,982
My nephew says you're from Kansas.

224
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,735
Vermont.

225
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,656
Six of one, half-dozen of the other.

226
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:20,327
The most important thing
is that we're all Americans.

227
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:23,997
Right.

228
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,668
Good, Lorenzo. Thank you.

229
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,672
- "Thank you," he says.
- I know.

230
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,134
Now this is real Italian coffee.

231
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:40,639
It's not like regular coffee.
Know what I mean?

232
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:45,686
It's a little strong,
so we put a little sugar in.

233
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,027
It cuts the strength.
Maybe a little more.

234
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,032
All right. Drink it down. One gulp.

235
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,629
Puts hair on your chest.

236
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,925
Did my nephew explain this job to you?

237
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,052
No, not really.

238
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,307
It's best if you explain it,
Uncle Carmine.

239
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:30,856
It's not complicated work, but it
must be done right, like all things.

240
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:37,154
Tomorrow at 1 pm, outside the club,
will be parked a car.

241
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,406
What is it called?

242
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,241
Sedan De Ville.

243
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,495
- Sedan De Ville.
- That's a type of Cadillac.

244
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:45,829
A Cadillac.

245
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,415
Yeah, this is a type of Cadillac.

246
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,754
Now, I want you to drive this car
to the JFK cargo terminal.

247
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:59,801
There you will pick up a package
addressed to Larry London.

248
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:05,432
Deliver this package to Cherry Hill,
New Jersey. That's it.

249
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,143
Is that far?

250
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:11,730
Not more than 3 hours, the whole trip.

251
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,358
Depends on traffic.

252
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:16,026
You never know.

253
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:18,445
You could get there in no time...

254
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:23,575
...or sit in traffic for hours
with your dick in your hand.

255
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,334
That's why I need someone
who can use his head...

256
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:37,005
...who won't get upset, emotional or
nervous no matter what happens.

257
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,342
Right. I understand that.

258
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,972
For this service,
I'm going to pay you $500.

259
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,475
$500?

260
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,311
See why my sister's so pissed?

261
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,689
I mean, angry, beside herself.

262
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:57,025
You'll pull in at least a grand a week.

263
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,027
A thousand dollars a week?

264
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:02,739
I'm going to need two trips a week,
minimum.

265
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:06,910
Of course, if things get busy,
then maybe more.

266
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,207
I hadn't thought of that much money.

267
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,462
I don't know.

268
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,259
- You don't know what?
- Wait. Hold on.

269
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,763
Let him think.
This is a sign of intelligence.

270
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:30,851
He's trying to understand
the nature of this job.

271
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,520
So, what are your thoughts, Kent?

272
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:35,522
Clark.

273
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,399
Sorry. Clark.

274
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,362
I have to ask you something.

275
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,075
Don't take it wrong.

276
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:50,120
No, anything, go ahead.

277
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,627
I smell a rat.

278
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,171
A rat?

279
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,716
He smells a rat.

280
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,427
That's right.

281
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:12,768
Know why you smell a rat?
Because God gave you a brain.

282
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:16,897
Because you're asking yourself,
"Clark, what is this?

283
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:22,694
A man will pay me $500 a trip
to deliver a package?"

284
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:27,074
- This is what you think?
- Right. That's what I'm feeling.

285
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,827
This is natural. Natural.

286
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,745
So then you understand.

287
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:35,249
Sure.
I understand a thousand percent.

288
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,464
Give me your hand.

289
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,100
You know what this is?

290
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:55,644
This handshake?

291
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,605
We call this the hand of friendship.

292
00:23:58,939 --> 00:23:59,982
We?

293
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:06,363
You don't know what this is.
The hand of friendship from my Uncle.

294
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,074
I want you to take this opportunity.

295
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:12,494
Totally legitimate work
for $1000 a week.

296
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:14,705
I know you won't disappoint me.

297
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,958
How can I say no?

298
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,465
This is not a yes.

299
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,389
I want to hear a yes.

300
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,981
Yes.

301
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:44,985
Good.

302
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,573
Good. Now I'm happy. I'm so happy.

303
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,867
I don't know why I'm so happy.

304
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,118
That's good.

305
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,246
Everybody up.

306
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,337
Come to my house in Queens tonight.
He's going to...

307
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,924
You can get the keys.
I'll give you directions.

308
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,597
I have such good feelings about you.

309
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,393
I'm absolutely filled with emotion.

310
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,815
I never had a son.

311
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:37,996
In 15 years, I never saw him
take to anybody like that.

312
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,540
Never.

313
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,094
<i>Senator.</i>

314
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,557
<i>We're both part of the same hypocrisy.</i>

315
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:01,436
<i>Never think it applies to my family.</i>

316
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:04,523
<i>All right. All right.</i>

317
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,443
<i>Some people have to play little games.</i>

318
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,529
<i>You play yours.</i>

319
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:17,327
<i>Let's just say you'll pay me because
it's in your interest to pay me.</i>

320
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,581
<i>I want your answer and the money
by tomorrow.</i>

321
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,793
<i>And one more thing.
Don't you contact me again, ever.</i>

322
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,463
<i>From now on, you deal with Turnbull.</i>

323
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:33,552
<i>Senator, you can have my answer now.</i>

324
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:38,223
<i>My offer is this. Nothing.</i>

325
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:41,101
<i>Not even the fee for the gaming
license...</i>

326
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,938
<i>... which I would appreciate if you
would put up personally.</i>

327
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,402
"Senator, my offer is this:

328
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:52,696
Nothing."

329
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:57,659
In that one moment, Michael Corleone
says that all corruption is equal.

330
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:02,789
That there is no separation between
politics and gangsterism.

331
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:07,336
<i>As discussed in the Fleeber treatise,
Guns and Provolone...</i>

332
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:11,590
...what are the similarities between
Karl Marx's "Das Kapital..."

333
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:14,968
<i>...lmmanuel Kant's
Critique of Pure Reason...</i>

334
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:18,639
...and the Lake Tahoe scene from
"Godfather II"?

335
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,478
You haven't read the Fleeber piece?

336
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,939
Well, in an evolving society...

337
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:29,566
You need help from Mr. Bushak?

338
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,906
He might enjoy helping you write
a five-page answer to my question.

339
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,659
I want it on my desk by noon tomorrow.

340
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,412
In an evolving society...

341
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:46,208
...violence and narcissism replace...
- Oh, shut up!

342
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,711
I hate this guy.

343
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:09,648
You're Clark?

344
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,400
Yes, I'm Clark.

345
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,653
I'm Tina, Carmine Sabatini's
only daughter.

346
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:19,366
- I didn't know he had a daughter, only.
- He does. I'm her.

347
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,076
Come in.

348
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:35,424
This is quite a house. Very European.

349
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:38,844
Can I get you a drink?
Beer? Sprite?

350
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:40,429
No, thanks.

351
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,600
Jesus, look at that.

352
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,771
Wow, what a job they did!

353
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:51,440
Job?

354
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,819
Copying job.
Down to the cracks and everything.

355
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,280
This isn't a copy. This is it.

356
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,948
Right.

357
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,617
I'm very serious.

358
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,827
This has to be a copy.

359
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,292
Do you remember about 10 years ago
the original toured the country?

360
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,668
It did?

361
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,379
They brought it over from the Louvre.

362
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:15,631
Who?

363
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,841
I don't know who. They.

364
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,719
It was in the United States.

365
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,387
And...?

366
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,183
And it stayed here.

367
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:30,896
The one they shipped back to Paris,
the one behind all the glass...

368
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:34,650
...that the tourists take pictures of
is the copy.

369
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,611
My dad thought it was just awful.

370
00:29:37,903 --> 00:29:40,989
A masterpiece behind such thick glass.

371
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,036
He had such a special feeling for it
his whole life.

372
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:48,497
Sort of an obsession.

373
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:50,958
He ripped it off? The "Mona Lisa"?

374
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:55,003
The day it arrived here I was 9.

375
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,924
My dad took it out of this huge crate.

376
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:02,636
There was Styrofoam
and newspaper everywhere.

377
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,013
And suddenly...

378
00:30:05,848 --> 00:30:07,266
...there it was.

379
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,810
And he turned to me...

380
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,521
...l'll never forget this...

381
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,107
...and he said:

382
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,610
"Now I'm happy.

383
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,031
Now I got the "Mona Lisa."

384
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,369
It's safe here in Queens?

385
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,462
People don't steal from my father.

386
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:39,214
- They don't?
- No.

387
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,766
- You want to dance?
- Here?

388
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,067
- It's kind of hot.
- Take your sweater off.

389
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:34,102
My dad tells me you're from Nebraska.

390
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,729
Vermont.

391
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,440
What do you think of New York?

392
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,278
I stopped thinking 24 hours ago.
I'm going on pure instinct.

393
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,119
That's what you should do in New York.

394
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,006
Is your father here now?

395
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,678
He's in the Bronx at some meeting.

396
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,102
Aunt Angelina?

397
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,898
My head's killing me.
I'm going to bed.

398
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:23,360
This is Clark. Dad mentioned him.

399
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,446
Clark. The boy working for Dad.

400
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:30,617
I'm going to bed.
Watch "Jeopardy." You come up?

401
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,036
After Clark leaves.

402
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:35,164
Good night, Aunt Angelina.

403
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,294
Dad's sister.

404
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:43,881
She moved in when my mother died.
I was 4.

405
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,507
I was 6.

406
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,594
- Your mom?
- No, my dad.

407
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,554
But it's never the same.

408
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,557
No, but what can you do?

409
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:55,017
Nothing.

410
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,643
Nothing.

411
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:01,815
I'll get you the keys to the car.

412
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:06,653
I'm a sophomore at the College of the
Sacred Virgin. Don't laugh.

413
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:10,240
- Next year I'm going to Harvard.
- Harvard?

414
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:15,454
That's something. I didn't apply there,
with my high school grades.

415
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,664
Not that they were terrible.

416
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:21,001
My grades are nothing special.
About a B-.

417
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:25,506
How did you get in?
Your Boards must have been monsters.

418
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:26,882
It's Dad.

419
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,220
He told Harvard I wanted to go,
and they said, "Sure."

420
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:37,309
Are we talking about the same Harvard?
In Cambridge, Massachusetts?

421
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:40,437
Of course. Harvard needs my dad.

422
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:45,484
They don't want strikes
by the janitors or gardeners.

423
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,111
All those old trees and lawns.

424
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,863
But he's an importer.

425
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:51,573
Right?

426
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,244
It's great meeting you, Clark.

427
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:59,248
A guy from Vermont.
Real American New England-y.

428
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:00,541
Hold on.

429
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:04,837
- He's an importer. Just tell me.
- He's an importer. Yes.

430
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:08,799
An extremely powerful importer.
There are such people.

431
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,968
So what is it?

432
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,721
- What is what?
- The package at the airport.

433
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:19,226
Hint. It's big.
Bring someone to help you out.

434
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,727
What is it?

435
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,230
If Dad didn't tell you, I can't.

436
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:29,194
It's not going to be a dead guy
in a box or something, is it?

437
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,740
What an imagination.

438
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,372
You're so unbelievably cute.

439
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:44,001
I'll see you again.
I could just eat you up.

440
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,464
Good luck tomorrow.

441
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:07,941
You boys need me?

442
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:14,198
- You Leo?
- I am Big Leo.

443
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:18,410
- It just says Leo.
- We are the same. Leo and Big Leo.

444
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:22,372
- You're synonymous.
- That's right.

445
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,047
Okay, come with me.

446
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,799
You don't bring it out?

447
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,052
No. Not this I don't.

448
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:53,403
"Not this I don't."
Remember those words.

449
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,072
Not very encouraging.

450
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,953
Here it is. All yours.

451
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:05,165
It arrived this morning
on the redeye from Borneo.

452
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,503
I'm going to puke my guts out.

453
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:13,549
- What is it?
- A lizard.

454
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:18,470
- That thing is a lizard?
- They call it the Komodo dragon.

455
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:23,267
Lives in Indonesia, Sumatra,
Komodo Island, in point of fact.

456
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,895
And tell Mr. Sabatini that this one...

457
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,858
...was eight bills extra.
- Excuse me?

458
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:34,778
Just tell him. He'll understand.
Sign here by the X.

459
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,363
Recipient.

460
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,450
- That's me.
- You're the recipient.

461
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:45,122
Put him in the back seat
with the windows open.

462
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,207
The gills need fresh air.

463
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,085
He doesn't have any gills.

464
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:53,714
Whatever. That's what I was told.
Fresh air.

465
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:57,384
And make sure you get
a seat belt on him, because...

466
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,636
...if he jumps on you...

467
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,639
...you got major troubles.

468
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,184
Major troubles.

469
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,812
Down, boy.

470
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,314
It's not a dog.

471
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:15,152
You know what?
We got to pick him up.

472
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,280
Pick him up.

473
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,158
- With what?
- With our hands.

474
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:23,744
It's not that bad.

475
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,914
I'll help you,
but I won't risk my life.

476
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:29,208
- Help. For God's sake.
- Sorry.

477
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,837
- I refuse to handle this animal.
- He's going under the truck.

478
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:40,886
- Get the door.
- You locked it, remember?

479
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:45,766
Take him.

480
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,267
Just for a second.

481
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,811
You're the recipient.

482
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:55,400
If he stains my suit, I'll be pissed.

483
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,404
Could you take any longer?

484
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:09,373
Okay, you go around
and get the other side.

485
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,708
Major trouble.

486
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:19,424
Put the seat belt on him.

487
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,511
- You're joking.
- I'm not joking.

488
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:26,723
This is precious cargo,
this freaking thing.

489
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,894
- What seat belt?
- Put him in this one.

490
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:33,105
Seat belts.

491
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:36,108
- Under his armpit.
- What armpit?

492
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:39,027
This lizard armpit.

493
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,947
Oh, that lizard armpit. I see.

494
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,658
You know...

495
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,668
- I think he's okay.
- Let's go.

496
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,844
Happy as a clam.

497
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,892
- Use the air conditioner.
- He said to leave them open.

498
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,314
Who? Haystack Calhoun? What is he?
A zoologist? I'll take responsibility.

499
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:16,982
All right.

500
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,452
<i>I told you he'd throw up.</i>

501
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,873
I have to open the windows.

502
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:34,917
It's murder.

503
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:40,964
Feeling better? Tummy ache all gone?

504
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:46,178
- It stinks in here.
- I can't take it.

505
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,932
We have to wash it off.
Pull into that gas station.

506
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,567
Excuse me. Hello.

507
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:06,657
- I need some water. A hose.
- Around the corner. Help yourself.

508
00:40:06,907 --> 00:40:09,535
This way. It's around the back.

509
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,647
He went under a car.

510
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:24,443
You go that way.

511
00:41:56,266 --> 00:42:00,979
<i>Owner of the reptile,
report to the information booth.</i>

512
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:11,532
- Don't panic.
- What if I can't find him?

513
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,159
Leave the country for 10 years.

514
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,829
You're kidding? I'm serious!

515
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,851
<i>Security to Concourse B.</i>

516
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,928
Okay, go.

517
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:25,981
Slowly.

518
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:28,901
I'm losing him.

519
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:37,993
I'm afraid now.

520
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,648
Mr. London?

521
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,275
Edward?

522
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,529
Look!

523
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:15,781
It's here!

524
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,199
Finally.

525
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,953
- Are you Edward?
- I am.

526
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:24,498
Oh, what a beautiful specimen.

527
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:31,296
Has this bad boy been swimming?

528
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,675
We took him right here
from the airport.

529
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,719
They just love swimming pools.
But...

530
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:40,138
...chlorine.

531
00:44:45,561 --> 00:44:49,189
I told him he is
very disobedient dragon.

532
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:52,651
For joke.

533
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:56,488
It's a good joke. Very unusual.

534
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,408
Without humour, what do we have?

535
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,006
Beautiful, yes?

536
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,594
- This is like a zoo?
- This is like a zoo.

537
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:23,599
Can you believe this?

538
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:30,105
- So, do you exhibit rare animals?
- On occasion.

539
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,110
Who are these boys?

540
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,366
Carmine said one boy...

541
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,452
...here are two.

542
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:48,916
This is Mr. Larry London.

543
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:56,423
- Mr. London, I'm Clark Kellogg.
- Carmine said one boy...

544
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,592
...here are two.

545
00:46:00,219 --> 00:46:05,641
I realize that, sir. We are two boys,
as you quite rightly point out.

546
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:11,230
However, I'm somewhat
new to the area...

547
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,442
...and this particular parcel
was quite bulky...

548
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:21,073
<i>...so at the suggestion of Tina...
- Ah, die schöne Tina.</i>

549
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,535
The beautiful Tina.

550
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:28,997
Yes, the beautiful Tina.

551
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:33,252
If there was a misunderstanding...

552
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:36,171
Carmine said one boy...

553
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:39,216
...and here are two.

554
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:43,220
You gotta like this guy.

555
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:48,016
Smells like basil.

556
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:49,518
Very good.

557
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,729
A cream basil sauce.

558
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,648
You're a chef?

559
00:46:55,983 --> 00:46:57,901
I wasn't clear what you did.

560
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,530
Now you'll get your money.

561
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:04,783
The money...

562
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:10,831
The money is conveyed
in a brown paper bag.

563
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:21,300
- Not very attractive, I know.
- No problem, sir.

564
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,553
If you count it, I won't mind.

565
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:30,392
That won't be necessary.
I trust you and Mr. Sabatini.

566
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:40,736
That means,
"My heart swims in blood."

567
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:52,331
That's a Bengal tiger,
ladies and gentleman.

568
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:55,459
Something is way off.
Way off.

569
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,635
<i>How are you, darling?
How's New York?</i>

570
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:09,181
I miss you too. Like crazy...

571
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:13,143
...at the risk of sounding like a mother.

572
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:16,688
No, he's asleep, thank God. Why?

573
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:20,442
Well, the thing is I got this job.

574
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:24,822
New York is unbelievably expensive.
I had to.

575
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:30,035
It involved driving...

576
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:33,831
...and picking up a reptile.

577
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,750
What kind of a reptile?
I don't...

578
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:40,963
<i>- It's a Komodo dragon.
- Who? Komodo dragon?</i>

579
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,883
<i>- I never heard of it.
- Then could you look it up?</i>

580
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:56,311
<i>- Komodo? Is that with a K?
- Right.</i>

581
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,023
Koala.

582
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:01,900
Kodiak.

583
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:03,861
Komodo dragon. Here.

584
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,656
"Latin name is" Varanus komodoensis.

585
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:10,742
Main prey are deer and wild pig.

586
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:15,372
<i>There are seven dragons
in zoos outside Indonesia. "</i>

587
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:19,293
<i>- Oh, my God! Oh, Clark.
- What?</i>

588
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:22,629
"Chances for survival
are considered hopeless."

589
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,007
It's an endangered species.

590
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:27,009
<i>My God.</i>

591
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:32,055
<i>- Are you sure?
- There's a red asterisk next to it.</i>

592
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,017
<i>That means virtually extinct.</i>

593
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,770
<i>- What's this job?
- Never mind, I'll quit.</i>

594
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,689
A Komodo dragon.

595
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:44,193
<i>Don't worry. I didn't know.</i>

596
00:49:53,785 --> 00:49:55,454
That's him.

597
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,081
You sure?

598
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:03,295
Absolutely. That's Dwight Armstrong's
stepson. Unbelievable.

599
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:14,640
Is Mr. Sabatini here?

600
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:17,017
Yes. Come in.

601
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,480
Charlie, wait a minute.

602
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,235
General Motors went down 10 points,
and you didn't call?

603
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,447
What about Polaroid?

604
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,867
It went down?

605
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,495
Down what?

606
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:46,964
I told you before,
I don't like it when they go down.

607
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:52,719
I used to have another broker.

608
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:55,848
He bought stocks for me
that went down.

609
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:58,517
And it got very unpleasant.

610
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:01,687
Very unpleasant.

611
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:06,066
Wait a minute. That's right.

612
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:13,031
Next time you call me,
I want to hear good news.

613
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:16,577
Right? That's only good news.

614
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:21,915
I must be getting soft.

615
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,750
Business.

616
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:28,213
Business in this country
is run by children, not men.

617
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,342
Anyway. Forget it.

618
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:35,637
- A nice espresso?
- No, thank you.

619
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,976
Sir, I have to talk to you.

620
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,937
I want to tell you something.

621
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:49,568
Larry London called me.
He couldn't stop talking.

622
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,738
He went on and on.

623
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,493
He's a very interesting man.

624
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:02,456
- I heard of the adventure at the mall.
- You did?

625
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,249
Of course.

626
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:10,923
Clark, what's on your mind?

627
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:15,344
I have to talk to you.
It's about these...

628
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:22,976
- It's about these reptiles.
- What about them?

629
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:25,354
They're endangered.

630
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:29,358
Not anymore. They're fine in Jersey.

631
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:33,654
It's against the law
to bring them here.

632
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,489
It's a crime.

633
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:39,493
You're speaking in generalities.

634
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:42,663
You said my work here was legitimate.

635
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,624
It's perfectly legitimate.

636
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,209
No, it's not.

637
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:51,213
I'm illegally transporting
endangered species.

638
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:54,758
Please, sir,
I'd like to be let out.

639
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,057
This is an impossibility.

640
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,726
What do you mean?

641
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:08,856
I have a certain standing in business.

642
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:14,611
How would it look, some college kid
making me look like a fool?

643
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:19,032
This is humiliation.
It's "infamia."

644
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,952
Know what people will say?

645
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:28,083
"What's wrong with him?"
You understand what I'm saying?

646
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:35,340
I'd never tell a soul.
It wouldn't leave this club.

647
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,218
I only meant that...

648
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:42,764
- Are you trying to hurt my feelings?
- No.

649
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:45,434
That's not the issue at all.

650
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:49,229
I'm going to tell you something
from my heart.

651
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:53,567
You're a great boy.
You are one of a kind.

652
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:56,904
Thank you.

653
00:53:57,237 --> 00:54:02,117
The kind of kids I used to have
working for me, the mooks...

654
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:03,827
...the muscleheads.

655
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:07,581
But you, you're from Connecticut.

656
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,794
It's nothing personal.
It's not you.

657
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,591
In any discussion
about our relationship...

658
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:21,345
...we won't forget
the most important thing.

659
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,138
Which is...?

660
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,641
You marrying my daughter.

661
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:29,812
You should have heard Tina.

662
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:35,734
Clark this, Clark that.
She wants to get married yesterday.

663
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:39,863
I said, "Wait for spring.
Planning takes time."

664
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,449
The food, place, time of year.

665
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:46,203
Who to invite, who not to invite.
That's important.

666
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:50,457
You got to figure that my
business associates alone...

667
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,626
...must be 2000 people.

668
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:57,631
Not including the senators,
congressmen, judges.

669
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:00,467
And don't forget the police.

670
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,970
But you know, love.

671
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:06,974
Love doesn't ask
these questions, right?

672
00:55:08,058 --> 00:55:11,645
Yeah, I guess.

673
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:18,318
Come outside.
I got a little surprise for you.

674
00:55:19,653 --> 00:55:21,363
Come on.

675
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:28,328
I don't know where this talk
of marriage began, but I'm not ready.

676
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:32,040
I'd like to sample life a little bit first.

677
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:36,211
Wait. After you get married,
you sample life.

678
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:40,674
This is what men do.
Marriage is an institution.

679
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,552
It's the bedrock of society.

680
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:47,681
What you're talking about
is a little va-voom.

681
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,350
This is self-understood.

682
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:54,521
I'm talking about social order.

683
00:55:54,897 --> 00:55:57,524
Try to put yourself in my position.

684
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,862
I wish I could, Clarkie.
You're such a beautiful boy.

685
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:07,451
- Know why I'm so nuts about you?
- I don't, no.

686
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:10,329
Because you're not a sneak.

687
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:15,209
You come down to my club.
You open your heart to me.

688
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,711
You say what's on your mind.

689
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:21,381
That's how I know
you won't be a snake.

690
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,301
A snake in the grass.

691
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:28,263
That's how I know
you'll be loyal to me...

692
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,057
...until death.

693
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,726
Until death.

694
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,395
Like a real son.

695
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,773
Oh, I don't know.

696
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:41,193
The son I never had.

697
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:06,093
I got an engagement present for you.

698
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:09,179
It's not much, but it's from my heart.

699
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:10,430
For me?

700
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,182
You're a lucky guy.

701
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,607
Take it for a little spin.

702
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:23,944
Go pick up Tina.
She's waiting at school.

703
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:28,282
I understand.

704
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,952
Sometimes in life...

705
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:36,123
...these emotions are beyond words.

706
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:37,541
Go ahead.

707
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:49,178
College of the Sacred Virgin in Queens.

708
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:51,680
Let's move it.

709
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:57,352
He kissed me on the mouth.

710
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:01,190
You know how big this is?

711
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:07,029
The kiss of all kisses.
The highest! You're in for life!

712
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,156
It's like we're brothers.

713
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,866
God bless you.

714
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:16,830
Anything wrong with it,
we'll get you another.

715
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,876
You have fun.

716
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,501
Say when.

717
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:06,547
When.

718
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,366
Screw this.

719
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:42,207
Turn right. Right!

720
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,218
He's parking?

721
00:59:53,468 --> 00:59:54,636
Hello?

722
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:34,968
I want it to be very conventional,
old-fashioned...

723
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:36,678
Oh, hi, Clark!

724
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:38,180
We have to talk.

725
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:41,600
This is Father Frank
of the music department.

726
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:46,313
We're discussing wedding music.
"Ave Maria" for the recessional...

727
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:48,065
Excuse us.

728
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:50,943
Of course. Congratulations, my son.

729
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:52,778
Thank you, Father.

730
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:56,073
- You're hurting me.
- I'm tense.

731
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,951
- I was involved in a car chase.
- And?

732
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:00,953
And? No "and."

733
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:04,540
This is part of your life,
but not mine.

734
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:09,169
People are flashing their lights at me.
I have to get away.

735
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:13,048
- It's just part of a working day.
- It is not!

736
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:16,677
You weren't forced
to commit to my father.

737
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:19,805
It's beyond commitment.
It's like slavery.

738
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:22,307
People telling me who to marry!

739
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:27,855
- You don't want to marry me?
- I don't want to marry anybody yet.

740
01:01:28,814 --> 01:01:30,482
So we'll wait.

741
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,111
We don't have to rush into anything.

742
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,655
I know that you'll wait for me.

743
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:39,992
You're part of the family permanently.

744
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,493
"Permanently"?

745
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:45,497
Your father kissed me.
Vic says I'm in for life.

746
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:48,000
- You are.
- I'm not!

747
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:53,797
It's a fluke.
I got ripped off by this Vic.

748
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,133
And I caught up to him. What?

749
01:01:57,259 --> 01:02:01,388
You think it was an accident
that you "caught up" to him?

750
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,516
You were chosen, Clark.

751
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:07,603
You were hand-picked.

752
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:12,649
- And it is the greatest honour.
- What are you saying?

753
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:16,195
Vic has great instincts about people.

754
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:21,742
He saw you where? Grand Central?

755
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:27,080
- It was a setup?
- "Setup" is so negative.

756
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:30,167
There are so many levels to this.

757
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,544
I just want my life back.

758
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:36,340
I can't talk to you
when you're so hysterical.

759
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:41,553
What is the deal? What is it?
Am I some kind of dupe?

760
01:02:41,762 --> 01:02:45,098
They looked in my yearbook
and found a chump?

761
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:48,393
Are you serious? A dupe?

762
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,772
You think I'd marry a dupe?

763
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:57,653
Everybody's talking about the job
you're doing. It's all over town.

764
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:03,325
Larry London called my father.
He said how bright you were.

765
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:09,665
How gentle. How perceptive.
If you weren't all those things...

766
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:14,753
...would Vic be out now
getting you a gun permit?

767
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:17,589
I don't need a gun permit!

768
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:21,468
You will if you'll be carrying a gun.

769
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:23,846
People are chasing you.

770
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:28,142
That's quite a story. Charming.

771
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,812
I can't take it so lightly, sir.

772
01:03:32,062 --> 01:03:36,984
It has a real film-noir quality.
Smuggling lizards into New Jersey.

773
01:03:37,693 --> 01:03:41,238
If it was done right,
black and white, grainy...

774
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:43,574
...sort of "Kiss Me Deadly."

775
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:46,118
It's my life, not a film idea.

776
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:51,206
They are the same when perceived
through the twin lenses...

777
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:54,084
Clark Kellogg.

778
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:58,547
I'm Chuck Greenwald.
This is Lloyd Simpson.

779
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:01,383
We're from
the Department of Justice...

780
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:05,596
...Fish and Wildlife Division.
We've been looking for you.

781
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:11,018
- This is what I'm talking about.
- I know nothing about it.

782
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:15,147
We were discussing a film project.
Oh, God, I'm late.

783
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,483
Excuse me, please.

784
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:19,651
Mr. Kellogg.

785
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:30,245
This is actually a federal office?

786
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,081
We're undercover, Mr. Kellogg.

787
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,250
Special agents.

788
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:39,838
- I think I better contact a lawyer.
- You may.

789
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:42,299
You have a lawyer?

790
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,343
My stepfather.

791
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:50,933
- What?
- Your stepfather turned you in.

792
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:56,021
My stepfather?
How did he know anything about this?

793
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:03,195
You know a Carmine Sabatini,
also known as Jimmy the Toucan.

794
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:08,075
"Toucan" I never heard.
My stepfather?

795
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:12,621
Do you know Hans Kurt Schlegel,
alias Larry London?

796
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:20,254
- We've met. I don't know him...
- These men are fiends, Mr. Kellogg.

797
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:24,591
It's up to you to stop
their unspeakable activities.

798
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,718
What are you talking about?

799
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:30,514
You ever heard mention
of the Gourmet Club?

800
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:31,974
No.

801
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:37,646
Sabatini and Schlegel established
the Gourmet Club operation in 1985.

802
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:41,900
It's a moveable feast.
Never the same location.

803
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:46,738
Dinner's every three to six months,
depending on the catch.

804
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:48,240
No prices.

805
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:53,078
The minimum price for eating
at this club is $200,000 per plate.

806
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:57,416
- For dinner?
- Not just dinner, Mr. Kellogg.

807
01:05:57,749 --> 01:06:02,337
The entire menu consists
of endangered species.

808
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:06,258
- They cook these animals?
- They do, yes, sir.

809
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:11,054
For an international clientele
of degenerates, scum, Euro-trash.

810
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:15,434
People pay $200,000
to eat these animals?

811
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:16,768
Minimum.

812
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:20,355
The more endangered,
the higher the price.

813
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:25,777
If there are 5 or less in the world,
it goes up to half a million.

814
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:31,033
- To eat the very last of a species...
- A cool million.

815
01:06:31,283 --> 01:06:34,411
The dragon will be about
$350,000 a plate.

816
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:38,207
Served off the bone,
with a cream basil sauce.

817
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:40,501
That's Schlegel's trademark.

818
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,296
If they fillet it...
Schlegel likes to fillet...

819
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,799
...they can get 60 servings
out of one dragon.

820
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,552
That's a $20 million haul.

821
01:06:53,138 --> 01:06:55,557
Mr. Sabatini wouldn't do that.

822
01:06:55,808 --> 01:06:58,644
Who do you think he is, Bishop Tutu?

823
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:02,648
- I don't believe he'd do that.
- I want Sabatini!

824
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:08,278
- Before they serve that poor animal.
- Tell us where and when.

825
01:07:09,905 --> 01:07:12,157
You want me to be an informer.

826
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:15,410
Or spend two years in Leavenworth.

827
01:07:15,661 --> 01:07:19,915
- You'd lock me up for two years?
- I sure would.

828
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,501
Unless you give us the old man.

829
01:07:28,674 --> 01:07:30,801
I'll think about it.

830
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:45,709
<i>There's freedom in being screwed.</i>

831
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:49,004
<i>You know things can't get any worse.</i>

832
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:58,180
Clark, you can't just split.

833
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,265
What would you do?

834
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:03,185
I'd turn him in and hate myself.

835
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:05,062
You'd do that?

836
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:07,564
I don't know.

837
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:22,621
Is Clark Kellogg
in one of these rooms?

838
01:09:22,871 --> 01:09:27,000
He's here. Come right in.
He's here.

839
01:09:32,047 --> 01:09:36,760
Clark mentioned something,
but I had no idea the resemblance...

840
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:42,099
- This is Steve Bushak, my roommate.
- My pleasure.

841
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:48,272
Could you leave us alone for a moment?
I want to talk to my son-in-law.

842
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:51,525
I'd really like to stay.

843
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,236
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

844
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:58,031
If you'd just leave us alone,
I'd appreciate it.

845
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:00,868
I'll get shoes and be on my way.

846
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:04,705
Could you put those on outside?
I have some...

847
01:10:04,955 --> 01:10:07,666
Outside? I always do that.

848
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:14,923
Sit down.
I want to ask you something.

849
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,264
- You followed me.
- Followed you?

850
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,018
Yeah. A little bit, this evening.

851
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:33,484
Clark, I know when somebody's
following me.

852
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:38,947
I left the club and you were around
on the street, in a doorway.

853
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:41,408
Someplace.

854
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:44,912
Because I feel these things, you know?

855
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,748
Is this true?

856
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,044
Yes.

857
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:57,758
- I had a lot on my mind.
- You don't have to explain.

858
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:05,265
Looks like you're ready for bed.

859
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:10,145
- Soon.
- Want me to read you a bedtime story?

860
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:16,109
Tina used to love
Curious George, the monkey.

861
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:20,280
Every night I told her
a different story.

862
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:25,202
Curious George goes here,
Curious George goes there.

863
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,372
She knew them all by heart.

864
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:32,459
My real father used to read me those.

865
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:38,549
Who was the guy who used to take care
of Curious George, his keeper?

866
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,303
You mean the man in the yellow hat?

867
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:46,723
The man with the yellow hat.

868
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:51,019
Is this your real dad?

869
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,941
That's me when I was 3.

870
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:02,489
I was 6 when he died.
Motorcycle accident.

871
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:06,285
What business was he in?

872
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:11,081
He was a poet. He taught English
at the Putney School.

873
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:13,709
You know any of his poems?

874
01:12:14,793 --> 01:12:16,003
A few of them.

875
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:19,423
- Tell me one.
- One of his poems?

876
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:24,011
Just tell me a short one.

877
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,558
One I like is called
"A Doorway on Boylston Street."

878
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:31,727
In Boston.

879
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:38,400
It's been a while since I did it.

880
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:45,365
<i>There's a certain doorway
On Boylston Street</i>

881
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:48,410
<i>That I passed by on foot</i>

882
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:53,499
<i>Suited and shod
One of many each Tuesday</i>

883
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,960
<i>Toward lunch with a certain woman</i>

884
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:59,379
<i>Regarded each Tuesday</i>

885
01:13:00,047 --> 01:13:02,549
<i>By the perfect turning gaze</i>

886
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,219
<i>Of a white Persian</i>

887
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,181
<i>Regarding me, lovebound</i>

888
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,475
<i>Sped by desire</i>

889
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,521
<i>And returning
To the certainty of his fur</i>

890
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:20,901
This was a cat on the doorway?

891
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:29,034
"The certainty of his fur."

892
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,038
- You liked it?
- I like it very much.

893
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:35,999
Very much.

894
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:40,587
I like especially the fact
that you remember his poems.

895
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:46,385
Well, that's...

896
01:13:47,511 --> 01:13:49,930
That's all I wanted to say.

897
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:56,019
And if there's anything
you have to tell me...

898
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:00,149
...I know that you will.

899
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:03,277
Yes.

900
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:09,366
You told me before that you
wanted to quit your job.

901
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,661
If you want to, it's all right.

902
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:15,539
I'll miss you.

903
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:22,379
It's all right. Get a good sleep.

904
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,090
Good night.

905
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:31,805
So this is college?

906
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,601
I didn't miss nothing.

907
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:07,049
<i>A plane is waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.</i>

908
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:09,843
<i>Don't make a big thing about it.</i>

909
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:15,682
<i>I know it was you, Fredo.</i>

910
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,143
<i>You broke my heart.</i>

911
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,854
"You broke my heart."

912
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,537
"It was you, Fredo."

913
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:38,914
A moment of epiphany.

914
01:15:39,122 --> 01:15:43,961
Michael Corleone kisses his brother.
An astonishing image...

915
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:48,215
...at once suggestive of love,
inversion, power...

916
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:51,927
...and in this world of duplicity
and corruption...

917
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:55,514
...is there anything more important
than loyalty...

918
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,933
- No.
...to friends...

919
01:15:58,225 --> 01:15:59,643
...to family?

920
01:16:00,727 --> 01:16:03,397
And who deserves our loyalty?

921
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:05,274
Yeah?

922
01:16:05,482 --> 01:16:08,443
I need Clark Kellogg for a second.

923
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:11,989
You need Clark Kellogg for a second?

924
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:15,242
Why, may I ask, is it so urgent?

925
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:18,620
I'm Carmine Sabatini's daughter, Tina.

926
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:23,500
- Jimmy the Toucan?
- Nobody calls him that.

927
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,003
Just one second.

928
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:29,715
Up, Mr. Kellogg!

929
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:34,887
- I'll be right back.
- No hurry. I'm quite impressed.

930
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:36,680
Jimmy the Toucan?

931
01:16:37,556 --> 01:16:40,601
He's quite a remarkable person.

932
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:44,062
I'm sure he is. Can I meet him?

933
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:46,773
That's a long shot.

934
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,067
Fine.

935
01:16:49,526 --> 01:16:52,362
My father thinks Clark
is an A student.

936
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,992
- He's a fine young man.
- My father said an A student.

937
01:16:57,242 --> 01:16:59,536
- Absolutely! A, A+!
- Okay.

938
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:03,457
Have a wonderful time.
Give my best to your dad.

939
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,126
Jimmy the Toucan!

940
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:08,462
Are you out of your skull?

941
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:11,465
- I was helping!
- I don't need help.

942
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:13,467
Fine. So I won't.

943
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:17,346
Where are we going?

944
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:58,804
Vic waved.

945
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:01,265
That's nice.

946
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,318
Everybody skate, come on.

947
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,619
Sir, we have to talk.

948
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:25,706
Pull them off. We gotta talk?

949
01:18:25,998 --> 01:18:29,459
I have important things
to bring up with you.

950
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:33,297
- Do you have the clothes?
- In the locker room.

951
01:18:33,547 --> 01:18:36,133
Get the clothes and change.

952
01:18:36,508 --> 01:18:39,303
And then you'll drive us out.

953
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,305
Drive where?

954
01:18:42,306 --> 01:18:46,685
We're going to go to the Gourmet Club.
This is Friday.

955
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:49,104
I have to talk to you first.

956
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,941
- We'll talk in the car.
- You promise?

957
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:57,446
Every word I say, by definition,
is a promise.

958
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,240
Come on.

959
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:07,539
<i>Driving a Porsche
had always been appealing...</i>

960
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:09,625
<i>... until now.</i>

961
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:18,634
<i>"- Do you read" Newsweek"?"
- Sometimes.</i>

962
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:22,387
I'm very worried
about this ozone business.

963
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:25,849
I'm really very concerned.

964
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:28,018
I have to talk to you.

965
01:19:28,685 --> 01:19:32,689
You wanted to talk to me last night,
but couldn't do it.

966
01:19:33,023 --> 01:19:35,526
I knew it would take you a day.

967
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:39,905
<i>The feds are after me.</i>

968
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:43,867
- You get their names?
- Greenwald and Simpson.

969
01:19:44,201 --> 01:19:49,540
They said they'd put me in jail unless
I led them to the Gourmet Club.

970
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:53,210
- They won't send you to jail.
- They won't?

971
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:56,713
They're gonna blow your brains out.

972
01:19:58,048 --> 01:20:02,052
I want to say you have done
an outstanding job.

973
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:05,722
Thank you. We appreciate it.

974
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,892
They work for the Bonelli family...

975
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:12,604
...out of South Amboy.
- Not for the government?

976
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:17,734
They do, but they're on the take
for the Bonellis.

977
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:22,614
- Staggering, isn't it? The corruption.
- Yeah, the corruption is...

978
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:27,411
- He's driving around with mobsters.
- College kid. It's upsetting.

979
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:32,249
These guys are after you
for the Bonellis...

980
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:34,918
...and they just used me.

981
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:38,922
- And once they get you...
- Then they hit you.

982
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:41,425
My God! This is terrible.

983
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:46,430
That's the way it's done.
I'm sorry I got you into this...

984
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:50,559
...but you're in it and we'll
get you out of it.

985
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:51,935
My God!

986
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:53,979
<i>He had a way out.</i>

987
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:57,232
<i>A plan to entrap Greenwald
and Simpson...</i>

988
01:20:57,483 --> 01:21:01,236
<i>... and get him out
of the endangered-species racket.</i>

989
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:05,949
<i>Hint. It involved using me
and the lizard as bait.</i>

990
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:10,662
<i>This would be the final dinner
of the fabulous Gourmet Club.</i>

991
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,680
<i>Tequila!</i>

992
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:02,297
Ladies and gentlemen...

993
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:07,302
...your cohost for this evening,
Mr. Carmine Sabatini.

994
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:14,101
With him are his daughter,
Tina, and her fiancé Clark Kellogg...

995
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:16,895
...from the great state of Montana.

996
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:21,942
Let's have a Gourmet Club welcome
for Carmine and the happy couple.

997
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,209
<i>Tequila!</i>

998
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:57,186
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all waited for.

999
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:02,399
The moment that makes the Gourmet
Club the special place it is.

1000
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:06,445
Our main course,
served for the very last time...

1001
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:09,156
...on this, our planet Earth...

1002
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:12,075
...your Komodo dragon.

1003
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:19,416
<i>There he is</i>

1004
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,836
<i>Your Komodo dragon</i>

1005
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,965
<i>Yes, there he is</i>

1006
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:30,177
<i>One of eight</i>

1007
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,972
<i>With so many species</i>

1008
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,433
<i>He took the town by storm with his</i>

1009
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:40,187
<i>Continental taste and charm</i>

1010
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:43,690
Go into this cornfield. It's deserted.

1011
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,414
Good.

1012
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:01,875
A Rob Roy with a twist.
You?

1013
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,460
Diet Coke.

1014
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:08,340
- Did my uncle bring you up-to-date?
- Yeah.

1015
01:24:08,549 --> 01:24:11,552
We'll be killed
by Greenwald and Simpson.

1016
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:15,055
They're with the Bonellis
out of South Amboy.

1017
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:18,892
That's stretching.
There's a chance we'll be killed.

1018
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:20,769
It's not a lot.

1019
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:24,398
We need to get you
adequately prepared.

1020
01:24:30,863 --> 01:24:32,948
- An Italian passport.
- Open it.

1021
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,290
Is that a piece of work?

1022
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:43,917
What is this?

1023
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:45,544
"Rodolfo Lasparri?"

1024
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:48,005
I got to tell you.

1025
01:24:48,255 --> 01:24:51,925
We may be on a plane to
Palermo, Sicily tonight...

1026
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:53,886
...if we're still walking.

1027
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:57,306
- I don't want to go to Palermo.
- Ever been?

1028
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:01,852
- No.
- Then you can't judge, Rodolfo.

1029
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,562
I'm not going!

1030
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:08,525
I can't take it! I don't want to
spend the rest of my life hiding.

1031
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:12,154
- I want this resolved!
- You do?

1032
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:13,947
Yes!

1033
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:19,828
- Why are you smiling?
- As usual, Uncle Carmine was right.

1034
01:25:21,205 --> 01:25:24,249
You're ready. Ready for Freddy.

1035
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,586
"Ready for Freddy"?

1036
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:34,718
It's showtime. In two minutes,
you go outside and signal the feds.

1037
01:25:37,721 --> 01:25:39,598
What the hell is that?

1038
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:44,102
Fish and Wildlife doesn't mean
we're social workers.

1039
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:51,652
Ladies and gentlemen, your cohost
for this evening, Mr. Larry London!

1040
01:25:55,113 --> 01:25:57,825
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1041
01:26:04,289 --> 01:26:07,709
This is a very special evening
for all of us.

1042
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,298
For tonight you will eat one
of only eight Komodo dragons...

1043
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:16,385
...left in the entire world.

1044
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:24,309
Which is why it has been priced at...

1045
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:28,021
...$350,000 a plate.
Service included!

1046
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:33,193
Thank you for paying in advance.

1047
01:26:33,443 --> 01:26:35,487
Without these monies...

1048
01:26:39,158 --> 01:26:42,828
Smells good.
I want you to take half of it...

1049
01:26:43,162 --> 01:26:46,165
...and put the rest in the steamer.

1050
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,001
Go ahead.

1051
01:26:59,845 --> 01:27:03,182
He wants you to help him
with the dragon.

1052
01:27:06,185 --> 01:27:10,189
Good luck, not that you need it.
Everybody's confident.

1053
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:59,905
The kid is signalling us.

1054
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,740
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

1055
01:28:04,827 --> 01:28:07,955
<i>I crossed the dance floor,
heart pounding.</i>

1056
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:11,291
<i>In a few minutes
I would be free, dead...</i>

1057
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:15,128
<i>... or Rodolfo Lasparri
of Palermo, Sicily.</i>

1058
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:20,509
<i>It was all up to me.
The show was about to begin.</i>

1059
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:54,877
<i>The lizard was more nervous than me.
We were in the same boat.</i>

1060
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:10,267
Everybody out. Get out.

1061
01:29:40,839 --> 01:29:45,302
- Give me that dragon!
- Freeze! Department of Justice!

1062
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:47,679
Sabatini, Schlegel...

1063
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,473
...you're under arrest.

1064
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:54,603
- What's the charge?
- Import and attempted slaughter...

1065
01:29:54,853 --> 01:29:59,358
...of "Varanus komodoensis,"
also known as the Komodo dragon.

1066
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,820
- It's over, old man.
- You betrayed me.

1067
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,404
You betrayed me.

1068
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:06,615
Stand back!

1069
01:30:06,907 --> 01:30:08,575
Drop it or I'll shoot.

1070
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:13,872
- How could you do this?
- Sir...

1071
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,833
How could you betray me?

1072
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,642
Oh, my God, Carmine.

1073
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:45,904
I had no choice.

1074
01:30:46,196 --> 01:30:48,991
- You all saw that.
- You had no choice.

1075
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,242
It was fate.

1076
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:54,329
No matter how you feel, you're a hero.

1077
01:30:58,709 --> 01:30:59,793
I'm numb.

1078
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:01,128
Cigarette?

1079
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:05,799
I'd love one.

1080
01:31:06,967 --> 01:31:10,053
- I had feelings for him.
- I'm sure you did.

1081
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:12,473
A technical matter.

1082
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,935
The money. We need it for evidence.

1083
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,815
It's there in the large tureen.

1084
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:33,035
Good work, kid.

1085
01:31:34,453 --> 01:31:36,622
We gotta impound the evidence.

1086
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:41,168
Job well done.
Everybody wait here.

1087
01:31:42,085 --> 01:31:44,254
- Congratulations.
- Come on.

1088
01:31:51,428 --> 01:31:54,890
- I guess we should go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1089
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:57,184
- Son...
- Don't call me son.

1090
01:31:57,434 --> 01:32:00,854
- I had no choice.
- You didn't have to turn me in.

1091
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:06,318
- Lf it was your son...
- I'd have treated him like a son.

1092
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:09,738
I'd treat my stepson
like he was my son.

1093
01:32:11,073 --> 01:32:14,451
- Clark, that animal...
- Dwight, good night!

1094
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,412
Tell Mom I'll call her tomorrow.

1095
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:24,795
Good night.

1096
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:29,716
FBI, gentlemen.

1097
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:34,888
Greenwald, Simpson,
you're under arrest for violating...

1098
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:40,352
...your oath of office, conspiracy,
fraud, extortion, RICO Act violation.

1099
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:42,437
Put the cuffs on them.

1100
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:45,357
The old man set us up.

1101
01:32:45,983 --> 01:32:47,276
Sabatini?

1102
01:32:48,235 --> 01:32:51,613
- With the kid!
- Watch the corn, gentlemen.

1103
01:33:03,458 --> 01:33:06,503
I'm getting too old for this nonsense.

1104
01:33:07,087 --> 01:33:08,255
We done?

1105
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:12,259
We're done.

1106
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:16,889
- How are you doing?
- I'm a wreck.

1107
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:20,642
Sorry to interrupt,
but they're restless.

1108
01:33:21,185 --> 01:33:25,647
All right, Hans,
what are we serving for dinner?

1109
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:27,983
Hawaiian tiger fish...

1110
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:31,737
...mixed with smoked turkey
from Virginia.

1111
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,405
Smoked turkey?

1112
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:35,449
It's all a scam?

1113
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:39,411
- The Gourmet thing?
- This is an ugly word, "scam."

1114
01:33:39,745 --> 01:33:41,580
This is business.

1115
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,333
In business, this is what you do.

1116
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:03,101
<i>$350, 000 for smoked turkey.</i>

1117
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:07,189
<i>But the Gourmet Club
had a great last night.</i>

1118
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:11,860
<i>Dwight went back to Vermont.
Greenwald and Simpson went to jail.</i>

1119
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:18,116
<i>"The animals went to the Bronx" Z"oo's"
Sabatini Endangered Species Wing.</i>

1120
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:23,038
<i>Carmine was a philanthropist now.
And me? I was just a student.</i>

1121
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:42,975
- You wouldn't have done it.
- Of course not.

1122
01:34:43,225 --> 01:34:45,561
That's why we never told you.

1123
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:49,565
He knew that Dwight
was my stepfather...

1124
01:34:49,815 --> 01:34:53,735
...and he'd call Fish and Wildlife?
- Of course.

1125
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:58,282
- He's like a genius.
- He's like a genius.

1126
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:10,627
Good night, "Liebchen."

1127
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:16,842
You've always been my great love.
I can say it since I'm leaving.

1128
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:20,929
Fantastic job, young man.
Great!

1129
01:35:28,312 --> 01:35:31,482
We're going to some clubs.
Nice work.

1130
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:33,066
Take it easy.

1131
01:35:40,282 --> 01:35:41,783
The show's over.

1132
01:35:42,075 --> 01:35:44,077
So marriage is...

1133
01:35:44,453 --> 01:35:45,787
Please.

1134
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:49,708
- Good. Not that l...
- I know.

1135
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:53,879
- Tell you what I'd really like.
- What's that?

1136
01:35:54,797 --> 01:35:58,050
I want to spend the night
in your dorm room.

1137
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,303
- Really?
- Yes, very much.

1138
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:06,642
I would love that. Get to know
each other under calm circumstances.

1139
01:36:38,257 --> 01:36:40,008
I'll go help Vic.

1140
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,642
It's all over now.
You can go back to Vermont.

1141
01:36:49,184 --> 01:36:50,310
You remember?

1142
01:36:51,145 --> 01:36:52,604
I always knew.

1143
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:57,860
I'm sorry you had to
go through this nonsense, but...

1144
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,821
...it turned out good.
- Sure.

1145
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:03,949
It was just...
It just was.

1146
01:37:05,492 --> 01:37:09,454
I'll tell you something.
You were brave.

1147
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:13,250
- I was proud of you.
- Thank you.

1148
01:37:14,835 --> 01:37:19,214
Anyway, I hope you have a good life.

1149
01:37:29,892 --> 01:37:31,226
You know...

1150
01:37:33,228 --> 01:37:36,482
...I meant everything I told you.

1151
01:38:13,936 --> 01:38:18,398
What's the matter with you?
You turned out to be a bum.

1152
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:20,275
Come on, come on.

1153
01:38:20,943 --> 01:38:26,156
If it weren't for me,
you could have been a handbag.

1154
01:38:27,032 --> 01:38:31,286
- He don't want to walk.
- They don't really walk.

1155
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:36,416
I'll get him. I can pick him up.

1156
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:39,878
- Let me help you.
- I got him.

1157
01:38:46,218 --> 01:38:48,262
I want to tell you something.

1158
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:51,974
When you finish film school,
I'd like to call you.

1159
01:38:52,224 --> 01:38:57,479
I know a lot of people in Hollywood.
I could open some doors for you.

1160
01:38:57,813 --> 01:39:00,482
Give you some opportunities.

1161
01:39:01,024 --> 01:39:05,779
- No, I don't think that's necessary.
- Really, it's easy for me.

1162
01:39:06,029 --> 01:39:10,534
I just make a phone call
and make it easy for you.

1163
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:32,486
