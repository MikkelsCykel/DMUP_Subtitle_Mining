Hey, check this out.

13
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:19,396
Everywhere I go, people
totally lose it.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,866
I'm Victoria English...

15
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,730
sorority princess of
South Beach University.

16
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,234
And, oh, yeah, this year I've
gotta makeover a bunch...

17
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:31,894
of clueless freshmen into
Gamma Gamma girls.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,230
Oh, look at this
Shakira wannabe.

19
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,493
See what I mean?

20
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,068
She's taking a freaking
cab instead of a limo.

21
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,929
Not hot.

22
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,627
See, Gamma Gamma
sorority is in a contest...

23
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:47,670
to become FHM Magazine's
hottest sorority in the country.

24
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:51,258
Everyone wants to go to
South Beach University.

25
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,802
A couple of years ago, they
let unhot people in here...

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,460
and things haven't been the same.

27
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:04,467
I guess i'll just have to put
a blonde wig on this one.

28
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,658
Daddy, stop the car here.

29
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:18,166
- But there's a spot up front.
- Dad, this car is embarrassing.

30
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,858
I don't want people to
think that I'm poor.

31
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,434
Well, honey, you are poor.

32
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,501
Look at this little minx.

33
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,500
This is Kristen Ass.

34
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,693
If I'd have known she'd
come in that car,

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,597
I would have never
let her pledge.

36
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,594
Excuse me.

37
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,689
So there you have it.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,928
A mission to turn the "wannabes"
into the "be wanteds."

39
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,261
Should be fun.

40
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,196
Smell that?

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,531
That, my friends, is the
smell of opportunity.

42
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,763
Fresh, un-tapped poon tang.

43
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,663
Did you just say poon tang?

44
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,893
I mean, that's why they
call them freshmen!

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,367
Because their coochies
are fresh for all us men.

46
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:07,524
What's going on?

47
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:08,725
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

48
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,495
Welcome to South Beach.

49
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,898
I love fresh coochy!

50
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,298
Victoria will be here in 45
seconds, ladies, so smarten up.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,768
# Whoa, whoa, whoa #

52
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:29,998
# Whoa, whoa, whoa #

53
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,333
# Got somebody, she's a beauty #

54
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:40,496
# Very special, really and truly #

55
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,401
# Take good care of me,
like it's her duty #

56
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,833
Every year, school starts
when I pop out of my limo

57
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,924
and see my shadow.

58
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:54,366
But I can't see my shadow
because I'm so thin.

59
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:57,697
Gamma Gamma pledges
ready for inspection.

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,065
People say I shouldn't
torture my pledges.

61
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,932
But I say, who says
learning can't be fun?

62
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,661
Sweetie, do you have
any idea who I am?

63
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,131
You're Victoria English.

64
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:11,098
And what do I do here?

65
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,828
You're the president of the
Gamma Gamma house?

66
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,060
And the ultimate role model
for every college girl

67
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,793
on the face of the earth.

68
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,527
Starting to like this one.

69
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,534
Wait. Whose top is that?

70
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:23,861
- Mine?
- No.

71
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,695
Whose top is that,
gamma pledge?

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,563
Dolce and Gabbana.

73
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,464
Ma'am, my top is Dolce
and Gabbana, ma'am.

74
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:33,057
- It's Dolce and Gabbana.
- Don't you forget it.

75
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,959
What the hell kind of
nail color is that?

76
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:45,093
- It's "cherries in the snow."
- So last week.

77
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,668
Suck it off, Gamma pledge.

78
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:49,393
I will, ma'am.

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,634
You. The shoes.

80
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,701
I saw those on sale
last week, didn't i?

81
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,234
No. My mom sent 'em to me.

82
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,359
Those shoes are expired.
Totally unhot.

83
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,965
Two out of three,
this is a disaster.

84
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,261
- Morgan?
- Yes, Victoria? Ma'am.

85
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:19,598
Please explain to these jackasses
what's at stake this year.

86
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,224
Listen up, ladies.

87
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,702
This year, FHM Magazine will be
selecting the hottest sorority

88
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,428
in the nation to be
featured on their cover...

89
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:32,025
and we are one of
five finalists.

90
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,658
And I'm not gonna let a bunch
of clueless pledges stand...

91
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,428
in between me and the number
one spot in the country.

92
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:40,024
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am!

93
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,158
Victoria, we may have
a little problem here.

94
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,494
What?

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,799
"This year, the winning sorority
must embody diversification."

96
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:53,860
In other words, geeks, nerds,
scientists... everybody.

97
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,134
Problem solved.

98
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,258
We'll just pledge some geeks.

99
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,630
We will?

100
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:08,898
And when we win the magazine
cover, let the fun begin.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,336
Gamma Gamma Girl group hug!

102
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,923
All right, that's enough.

103
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,227
I like the love...

104
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,597
but let's not get all Ellen
DeGeneres about it, okay?

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,900
It's so good.

106
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,096
- Kristen?
- Gloria.

107
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,135
Hi. What are you doing here?

108
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,825
Surprise!

109
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:49,265
- Mr. Haas.
- Oh, hey, Gloria.

110
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,334
- Hi.
- How are you? Nice to see you.

111
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,457
Whoo!

112
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:53,897
How are you doing?

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,399
- I'm great.
- What is this?

114
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,900
Well, I ran into Gloria's mom a
while back, and she mentioned...

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,491
she was coming to South Beach,
so I made a few phone calls...

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,296
and we arranged for
you two to live together.

117
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,335
- Bingo!
- Wow, thanks, dad.

118
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,027
- Yeah, unexpected.
- Full of surprises.

119
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:11,192
Well, I know what good
friends you two are.

120
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,700
- Were.
- Like, in the ninth grade.

121
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,267
You two get reacquainted...

122
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,357
I'll go get the rest
of the bags, okay?

123
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:22,403
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

124
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,061
Are you sure this is
what you really want?

125
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,634
I don't understand why you
have to live in the dorms...

126
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,530
when we live in Coral Gables.

127
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,624
Oh, you don't understand.

128
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,600
'Cause I don't understand why
you had to park your car...

129
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,759
in someone else's garage.

130
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,834
And by car, I mean cock.

131
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,128
- Mommy, what's a...
- It's a rooster, honey.

132
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,390
Kathy, what do you
want me to say?

133
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,899
I keep telling you I'm sorry.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Yeah, you're sorry all right...
a sorry excuse for a husband.

135
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,162
Kids, mommy's going
away to college.

136
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,631
And you know why?

137
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,793
Daddy decided to sleep with some
little tramp from his office!

138
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,595
Well, see you Thanksgiving.

139
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,100
- Bye, kids.
- Bye. Love you.

140
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,035
Hey, football, huh?
Anybody up for a gangbang?

141
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,930
Kathy, Jesus Christ!

142
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,522
- Victoria.

143
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,227
- Baby Dick, I missed
you so much.

144
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,063
Not as much as I missed you,
my little English muffin.

145
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,132
This is my new
boyfriend in training.

146
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,996
He's already progressed
to week three.

147
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,089
Wow.

148
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,433
And, ladies, he's my property,
so hands and eyes off.

149
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,263
Well, you can look.

150
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,630
Now go and be a good boy,
and go get my luggage.

151
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,564
It's been on the sidewalk
for ten minutes.

152
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,997
Right away, princess.

153
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,561
Oh, and Baby D?
Gamsie needs to go potty.

154
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,759
Okay.

155
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,233
Thanks, bitch.

156
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:04,327
Hi there! I'm Kathy!

157
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:07,527
I'm your roommate!

158
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,863
Well, come here, you!

159
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,696
Oh, it is so good to meet you.

160
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,203
We are gonna be
BFF, you and me.

161
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,895
- Maxine. Nice to meet you.
- Ooh, who's the hottie?

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,333
- That's my daddy.
- Dirty son of a bitch.

163
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:27,630
Hey, roomie, do you know where
I could find some pot?

164
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,394
- No.
- Ludes?

165
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,025
- No.
- Meth? Lsd? Pcp? Crack rocks?

166
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,259
No!

167
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,493
Well, looks like I'm gonna
have to kick it old school.

168
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,667
Ugh!

169
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:48,195
- Here, let me help you unpack.
- No, not that bag!

170
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,999
Hey, good idea. Sugar buzz!

171
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,994
This fool's lucky he didn't
walk into Gamma.

172
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,398
His pee-pee would've
left on a stretcher.

173
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,559
Don't forget to call every night.

174
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,497
I promise, Mom. Goodbye.

175
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,560
Keep an eye on that girl.
I think she might be disturbed.

176
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,634
Mom!

177
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,826
I'm so sorry about that.

178
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,367
You know what moms are like.

179
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,697
Yeah. Drunks with guns.

180
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,702
- I'm Babs.
- Tonya.

181
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,299
Open!

182
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,494
Um, hi there. I think we
found your roommate.

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,569
Yeah, we can't pronounce her
name. It sounds very exotic.

184
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:43,660
- Uh, Senagarvar...
- Senagarvarapoopoo Ghandasini.

185
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:46,234
Oh, PooPoo! That's cute.

186
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:50,133
Very nice to make the
acquaintance to you.

187
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,394
'Sup? Monique. I like your style.

188
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,900
Hi, I'm Maxine.
'Sup, Maxine?

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,434
I'm Kathy, and I like to party.

190
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,331
Good to know.
I'm here studying music.

191
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,798
Word, homey.

192
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,527
I'm just here to get even
with my husband.

193
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,466
I'm gonna nail as many
guys as possible.

194
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:10,127
I'm just here for general
studies, for now.

195
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:13,100
Hey, you girls wanna check
out my new boob job?

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,135
Doctor says they should
realign themselves...

197
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,394
and the scarring should go
down in a few months.

198
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,527
I'm sure to land some man meat
with these milk bags, huh?

199
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:27,195
When living together, blondes
and brunettes will always fight.

200
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,999
You look a lot different than
the last time I saw you.

201
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,193
My solution? Let the blonde win.

202
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,961
No, I mean you look good.

203
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,363
Yeah.

204
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:40,958
Listen, let's just be clear.

205
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,966
We're not in ninth grade
anymore, okay?

206
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,227
We're different people now.
At least I am.

207
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:48,359
So let's not pretend we're gonna
be college buddies, okay?

208
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,229
Just because you got yourself
some new clothes,

209
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,733
and bleached your teeth,
and fixed your nose.

210
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,698
I didn't get my nose fixed!

211
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,363
God!

212
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:06,433
Level-one, level-two,
level-three, level-four.

213
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:08,967
One, two, three, four.

214
00:12:09,066 --> 00:12:11,330
How many Red Bulls
did she drink?

215
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,424
About the same as
me... nine or ten.

216
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,797
One, two, three, four.

217
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,130
One, two, three, four.

218
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,700
One... ooh!

219
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,030
No-no-no-no-no-no! PooPoo.

220
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,229
No, honey. That's a vibrator.

221
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,028
Without my guidance...

222
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:36,159
girls look for love in
all the wrong places.

223
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:39,167
It's called the Platapussy.

224
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,666
What is a Platapussy, please?

225
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,233
Well... No-no-no.

226
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,962
It's okay, it won't hurt you.

227
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,966
Who thinks it's time for PooPoo

228
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,159
to meet her special little friend?

229
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:54,326
- Ooh, I do.
- Right here.

230
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:58,267
Well, it is an important
American tradition.

231
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,197
Come on, sweetie.

232
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,995
- Bye!
- Bye!

233
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,036
- Bye.
- Have a good time!

234
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,796
No! No! No!

235
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,528
Going at it like a little
hamster in there.

236
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:18,162
- Yes! Yes! Oh! Oh!
- Poo! Poo! Poo! Poo! Poo!

237
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,665
USA!

238
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,495
Oh! I love this country.

239
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,195
Oh! Ah, ah, ah!

240
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,858
Go, America!

241
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,101
I like this new
American Tradition.

242
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:50,664
Let's check those
bad boys out.

243
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,734
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,797
Look over here.

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,697
A time-honored college tradition
is ignoring the three-way...

246
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,132
in the bathroom
stall behind you.

247
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:20,828
How much does he wish these
lips were in that stall with him?

248
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,335
What are you doing?

249
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:35,834
My dog is such a perv.
I love it.

250
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,662
Mmm. Now I'm craving sushi.

251
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,290
Moshi Moshi.

252
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,858
Paging Plumber Jones.

253
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:52,365
Plumber Jones.

254
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,902
What is the problem? Over.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,332
There's a pipe blockage
in the girl's bathroom.

256
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,264
We need you to
go check it out.

257
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,594
This problem is solved.

258
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,634
Signing off.

259
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:08,727
Son, I realize you always wanted
to be a plumber like your old man.

260
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:14,294
As long as people remain full of
shit, we'll have job security.

261
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,526
Stay here.

262
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,261
I'm coming!

263
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:27,727
It's a lovely smile, isn't it?

264
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,427
Now, cleanliness is
next to godliness.

265
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:33,127
I have been supervisor of this
dorm for over 27 years...

266
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,861
and I take personal pride in
maintaining a sanitary

267
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,729
and a wholesome environment.

268
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,324
The rules of the dormitory
are very simple.

269
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,867
One: Although this is
a coed college...

270
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:45,298
this is not a coed dormitory.

271
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,800
Any sexual touching
is forbidden.

272
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,165
Two: A good student
is a clean student...

273
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,427
and that must be reflected
in their environment.

274
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,860
What is wrong with you?

275
00:15:56,966 --> 00:15:59,958
I gotta pee so bad my
back teeth are floating.

276
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,533
Lucky there's a
potty right here.

277
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,396
Hurry. We don't
want any accidents.

278
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,401
Sit on the paper if
you are going to sit.

279
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,833
I think she needs
more toilet paper.

280
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:25,865
Help!

281
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:28,526
Go, go! Hurry!

282
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:30,191
I'm going down the gurgler.

283
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,200
Grab her legs.

284
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,632
Just hold on.

285
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,496
I don't want to die.

286
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,797
Oh, sweet Jesus, do not
let me die in here.

287
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,630
I'm stuck, and the
toilet's eating me.

288
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:52,801
- Can you please hurry up?
- We're gonna get you outta there.

289
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,128
You hang on.

290
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,890
Oh, no!

291
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,264
It's a 10.2 on the shitter scale!

292
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:05,958
It's never gone this high before!

293
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,296
I have no idea what that means.

294
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,470
Everybody run!

295
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,329
What the hell is wrong
with that man?

296
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,958
Get down!

297
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,662
Oh, shit!

298
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,827
Oh, my god!

299
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,001
I am closing down
this dormitory.

300
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:49,160
All of you get out!

301
00:17:55,966 --> 00:18:00,300
It's just like when I used to live
next to the methane plant.

302
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,334
Please step back. We just had
a plumbing emergency...

303
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:04,867
causing the fat girl
to go sky high.

304
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:07,298
Strangely we found a
Dolce & Gabbana top...

305
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,697
stuffed down the pipes.

306
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,994
Holy shit.

307
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,362
This stuff happens all the time.

308
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,490
There's nothing to see here.

309
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,534
School'll take care of
all your bathroom needs.

310
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:16,624
Why does it smell
like hot ass?

311
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,258
That would be the
gas escaping.

312
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,334
So where are we gonna
stay 'til it gets fixed?

313
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,560
School has arranged
for housing vouchers.

314
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,726
I can't believe the school is
only giving us _200 a month.

315
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,631
You can't even get a
cardboard box for that.

316
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,701
What if we pool all our money?

317
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:35,497
Don't look at me, guys. I'm still
saving up for ass implants.

318
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,899
There's nothing affordable unless
you commute from the swamp.

319
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,729
Hey, girls.

320
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,664
What about a sorority?

321
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:46,031
Hey, great idea. A sorority.

322
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:48,067
That's like flypaper
for horny guys.

323
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,463
Yeah.

324
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,056
If we all did it
together, it'd be fun.

325
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,292
I don't know, Max.

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,198
I don't think I'm really down
with the whole sorority thing.

327
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,862
Aren't sororities supposed to be
about friendships and bonding?

328
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:02,491
We could at least check it out.

329
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,127
It's either that or a commute
from the swamp.

330
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,724
There are so many
temptations out there...

331
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,597
like drugs, alcohol, and boys.

332
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,567
I'd like to introduce you
to a different kind of boy.

333
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,258
I think you're really
gonna like him.

334
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:19,062
He's smart, he's funny,
and he's really cool.

335
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,428
The coolest.

336
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,434
His name is Jesus, and he just
wants to hang with you guys.

337
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,865
Welcome to Kappa!

338
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,926
Can I ask a question?

339
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,728
Was he circumcised?

340
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,994
I mean, he's a Jew,
but he's a Christian.

341
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:37,624
What's the deal with that?

342
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:44,393
No, I, uh...

343
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,565
Very nice to meet you.

344
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,099
They're dykes.

345
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,099
I love curry fish.

346
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,658
I think we've taken up enough
of these ladies' valuable time.

347
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:02,429
Where you going?
We're gonna play spin the bottle!

348
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,797
You guys can pledge if you want.

349
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,561
We only have one rule.

350
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:10,158
If you're gonna kill yourselves,
make sure you tell us in advance.

351
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,393
So we can plan the party.

352
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,730
Yeah.

353
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,666
Love what you've
done with the place.

354
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:20,826
Very cozy.

355
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:25,563
Once you cross the doors at Phi
Iota Gamma, you will never again

356
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:28,897
have to worry about what to
wear in order to be accepted.

357
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,358
Big hug!

358
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,957
Oh, my god.

359
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,727
We're so out of here.

360
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,425
No, girls., come back.

361
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:42,127
Please. The sisterhood needs you.

362
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,127
# One, two, three four #

363
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:09,725
# I did something last night
that you don't know #

364
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,233
Hey, it's the madman.

365
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,563
- Check it, dog.
- Yeah, what up?

366
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,362
Listen. Huge party at
the Gamma's house.

367
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,730
You're going.
Don't say nothing, all right?

368
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,961
You know I'm gonna
sign that check, dog.

369
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,425
Check you later, dude.

370
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,832
# If only I could tell you
one, two, three, four #

371
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,958
Oh, snap!

372
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,590
Rappers!

373
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,167
Chicks love rappers, right?

374
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:39,359
Yeah, yeah. In those videos
they always got bitches.

375
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,865
Bitches and hoes.

376
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,898
Check this out.

377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,991
Yo, yo, you're cold.
You're old.

378
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:47,695
Your mom's got mold. Her teeth
are gold, and brown and...

379
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,496
That didn't rhyme.
I'm gonna check that out.

380
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,261
I'm gonna fix that,
but it's gonna be good.

381
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,094
Yeah.

382
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,193
What's crackin' there, baby?
We're in South Beach...

383
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:00,792
where it's so hot the girls
get undressed naturally.

384
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,462
I was thinking about
taking a swim...

385
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:13,501
but now i'll have to drain
and disinfect the pool.

386
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,393
What?

387
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,264
Is everyone from
MySpace in my pool?

388
00:22:21,366 --> 00:22:23,095
Oh, my God.

389
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,136
I know for a fact that
girl has syphilis.

390
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,394
She's so beautiful.

391
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,991
I'm gonna pull a muscle if I
have to keep smiling like this.

392
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:34,295
I heard her dad
is a billionaire.

393
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,459
I heard her dad bought France.

394
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,898
Have you seen her boyfriend?
He's hot.

395
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:44,966
Clue, what's up?
Howsa howsa?

396
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:46,863
Who let that loser in here?

397
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,934
Big-ass titties for ya!

398
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,364
That's hot.

399
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:53,230
Aw, man.

400
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,325
This is embarrassing.

401
00:22:56,433 --> 00:23:00,096
If I was a real queen, I'd have
that dickless wonder beheaded.

402
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,862
Speaking of dickless.

403
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,797
Why do you have always
have to bring Dax here?

404
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,197
Baby.

405
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,234
Princess.

406
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,130
Dax is my boy.

407
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:14,795
We go way back, like... car seats.

408
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,425
That is so corny.

409
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,262
Where you going?

410
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:21,425
Downstairs.

411
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,467
I have people waiting for me.

412
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,261
Come here for a sec, baby.

413
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:27,163
I got something I
want to show you.

414
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:31,828
And it rhymes with "my renis."

415
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,265
And keep my public waiting?

416
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:35,924
Unlikely, Derek.

417
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,364
Come on, baby.

418
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,366
We haven't hooked
up in like a week.

419
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:42,162
My balls miss your chin.

420
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,860
You know I can't
resist Little Derek.

421
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,490
Little?

422
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:57,932
Tiny. Like a baby's dick.

423
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:00,194
Who's your baby dick?

424
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,631
- You are.
- Yeah.

425
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,099
- Tie me up, huh?
- Yeah.

426
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,692
- Oh, yeah. Baby.
- Tie it up.

427
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,095
Close your eyes.

428
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,031
Okay.

429
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:19,328
Oh, baby.

430
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,901
- You like that?
- Yeah.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,935
Oh, baby, you're
driving me crazy.

432
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,630
Oh, Hell no.
The whipped cream?

433
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:38,966
Baby, you're bringing
out the freak in me.

434
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:42,661
You be a good little boy
and keep your eyes closed.

435
00:24:42,766 --> 00:24:46,099
I'm gonna keep one eye open,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

436
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,292
Huh?

437
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,368
Just don't open
them or I'll stop.

438
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:50,592
Okay.

439
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:55,560
God, you're driving me crazy.

440
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:56,758
Oh, yeah.

441
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:59,198
Come over here and get
some of this baby dick.

442
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:02,497
Close your eyes.

443
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,228
Aw, I hate giving my dog
such a small bone.

444
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,766
Baby.

445
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:09,266
Oh, god! Feels so good.

446
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,895
You're an animal.

447
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,365
Whoo!

448
00:25:14,466 --> 00:25:15,626
Sandpaper time.

449
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:16,961
I like that shit.

450
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:18,795
Ow, that hurts! Do it again.

451
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,557
Oh, my God.

452
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,463
Did you hear his accent?

453
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,558
I know. I love irish accents.

454
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,897
I would totally let him
do me in the butt.

455
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,968
Ew!

456
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,829
Me, too.

457
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,424
Irish accent.

458
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,524
Butt sex.

459
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:42,397
I need an Irish accent.

460
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,094
World famous DJ Clue,
Desert Storm...

461
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,724
Scott Danimal in the building.

462
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:49,825
And Gamma Gammas, I would
like introduce your princess,

463
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,333
the lovely Victoria English.

464
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,893
Thank you.

465
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,298
I have an announcement to make.

466
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,129
Gamma Gamma was
selected as a finalist

467
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,827
in FHM's hottest sorority contest.

468
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,332
Everybody have a great
time at my party.

469
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,867
Rock on to DJ Clue.

470
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:17,494
Yeah, ya'll, let's get the party
started Desert Storm-style, baby!

471
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,034
Someone's getting
their stick licked.

472
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,998
Fuck, that hurt! Do that again.

473
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:24,364
Oh, yeah.

474
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:27,765
Don't fucking look at me like that.

475
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,198
Sounds like my mom and dad.

476
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,790
Oh, yeah.

477
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,731
Go under the carriage, baby.

478
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,667
God, baby, that feels
so fucking good.

479
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:38,790
Oh, yeah.

480
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,197
Oh, my God.

481
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,291
Fuck, that hurt.

482
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,526
Do that again.

483
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:45,567
Oh, yeah.

484
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,293
Damn.

485
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,061
It's a fucking dog, dude!

486
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,190
Oh, baby.

487
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,597
Oh, my god.

488
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,395
- Fuck, that hurt!
- That's nasty.

489
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,525
Put your pointer in my
purple starfish, baby.

490
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:56,964
Oh, yeah, that's it.

491
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:58,431
I think.

492
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,932
Are you ready for the smoothie?

493
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,033
Come here, gamsie.

494
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,259
Come here.

495
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,459
What's up, derek?

496
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,466
How's your girl? I
mean, your bitch.

497
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:22,433
I heard they've got a fine cocker
spaniel at the Kappa house.

498
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:23,522
And you know what?

499
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:27,592
She likes it ruff!

500
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,897
Say, we're just doggin' with ya.

501
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,195
Yeah, yuk it up all
you want, clowns.

502
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,133
'Cause at the end of the
day, I still got Victoria,

503
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,895
and you got fingered by
Father Mulrooney.

504
00:27:41,566 --> 00:27:43,193
Fuck you!

505
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:45,291
Bro, you gotta leave
your past behind.

506
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,327
That was interesting.

507
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,867
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

508
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:53,526
I'm an exchange student
from the Emerald Isle.

509
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,895
You're from Ireland?

510
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,025
Aye! That I am... from Ireland.

511
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,896
That's such a coincidence.
She's from Ireland, too.

512
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,730
That's right.
I'm from Galway.

513
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,664
Where you hail from?

514
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:09,500
Uh, I'm from, uh,
South... Middle Earth.

515
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,465
Nice try, Frodo.

516
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,760
Later.

517
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:13,992
Wait!

518
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:15,089
Don't leave yet.

519
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,724
Don't you want to
taste my shillaley?

520
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,164
You're disgustin'.

521
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:21,758
When I look around this class of
talented students, what do I see?

522
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:26,462
I see a future of Dolce's,
Gabbana's, Chloe's and Prada's.

523
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:29,467
If I wanted to get an
"A" in fashion class,

524
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,830
I would have walked in naked.

525
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:38,702
This slow motion helps, so you
can get a good look, you pervs.

526
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,667
So sorry I'm late, Lisa.

527
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:44,599
The lady doing my
pedicure took forever.

528
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,225
Hi, Victoria. We were just
discussing your work.

529
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,063
- Nice job as always.
- Thank you.

530
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:57,296
However, I was especially
impressed by the freshness

531
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,630
of this designer's work.

532
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:07,232
Are those clothes for Muppets?

533
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:12,930
Now who may I say is
responsible for these?

534
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:16,434
Gloria Torres.

535
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,001
Great job, Gloria.

536
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,897
Thanks.

537
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,164
Note to self: Fire design team.

538
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,530
Check out these freshman.
They're so hot.

539
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,362
Cut it out, man.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

540
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,763
What happened to you, man?

541
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:35,197
What ever happened to the guy
that fucked Denise Reynolds

542
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:37,029
in front of her grandparents?

543
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,691
I miss that guy.

544
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,631
I'm still here.

545
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:43,065
Ugh. Shoot.

546
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:45,259
Damn.

547
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,663
That's hot.

548
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,562
Damn.

549
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:52,327
- Think she's hot?
- Who?

550
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,128
That Mexican broad
you were staring at.

551
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:56,463
Actually, I think
she's Portuguese.

552
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,534
Shut the fuck up, Dax!

553
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:01,568
And you... you stay
away from that bitch.

554
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,964
Bye.

555
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:12,968
Daddy, darling, will you do Queen
Victoria the hugest favor?

556
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:15,466
I need my fashion design
teacher killed.

557
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,397
Oh, really?

558
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,230
Well then I want that
fucking bitch fired.

559
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,630
Thank you, Daddy.

560
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,064
I love you.

561
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,498
# Back home #

562
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,329
# Back home #

563
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:28,832
You know what, girls?

564
00:30:28,933 --> 00:30:31,367
There is one place that
we haven't tried yet.

565
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:38,624
Wow.

566
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,824
Gamma Gamma.

567
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:47,198
Damn, It looks like
some MTV crib shit.

568
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,927
My cooter's tingling.

569
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:52,434
I think there might
be boys in there.

570
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,398
We need to get a door guy.

571
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,991
Better yet, a human bug zapper.

572
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,126
Oh, my God, that dress is so hot.

573
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,325
Thank you.

574
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,560
That must have cost
hundreds of dollars.

575
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,691
Try thousands of hundreds.

576
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,894
So don't go looking for
it in any Sears catalog.

577
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,230
That's what I meant.

578
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,324
Thousands... hundreds.

579
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,830
Oh, Morgan.

580
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:21,369
We'd like to pledge
your sorority, please.

581
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:24,731
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like a room with a bidet.

582
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,462
Could you guys hold
on for a second?

583
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:32,525
I think she likes us.

584
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:38,833
Someone left a mess on our front
door, and it wants to pledge.

585
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:45,692
Look at this place.
It's just heaven on earth.

586
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,462
And it's so pink.

587
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:52,024
We could have one hell
of an orgy in here, gals.

588
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,226
What do you think, girls?

589
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,598
Are they Gamma material?

590
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,759
I think we should let them pledge.

591
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,595
- And you are?
- Kristen.

592
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,168
Kristen Haas.

593
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:08,168
And why do you think we should
let them pledge, Kristen _ss?

594
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:14,728
Because, um... because they
could be our diversity.

595
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,323
Hot.

596
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,060
She's right.

597
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:20,862
Gamma's about acceptance
and individuality.

598
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:22,524
Who are we to discriminate?

599
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:24,157
Bring them in.

600
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:25,631
Good idea, Kristen Haas.

601
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:27,724
Nice hair.

602
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:29,960
Yeah, thanks. Shut the door.

603
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:34,059
Morgan, can you get the girls
some champagne, please?

604
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:41,461
I'd like to lick her all over.

605
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:43,466
I heard about your
housing situation.

606
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:45,966
It's so unfortunate.

607
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:51,629
And that's why we'd like
to offer you an early bid.

608
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,861
Normally we don't let
pledges move right in...

609
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:58,458
but in your case, I think we're
gonna make an exception.

610
00:32:58,566 --> 00:33:01,057
Why don't you girls go
check out the house.

611
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,963
Let us know by the
end of the night.

612
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,933
I don't know.

613
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,433
You guys really think this
place is right for us?

614
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:17,830
Are you kidding me?

615
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:20,561
This is the most beautiful
place I ever seen.

616
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,328
Its beauty puts the
Taj Mahal to shame.

617
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:25,731
- All right?
- All right. Fuck it.

618
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,630
I'm in.

619
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,826
This place is insane!

620
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,162
Have you ladies come
to a decision yet?

621
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,631
I think we're in!

622
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:41,360
Welcome to gamma.

623
00:33:41,466 --> 00:33:43,559
Why don't you guys get
changed for dinner?

624
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:47,124
With their diversity, we
can win the FHM contest.

625
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,463
But they'll never be
Gamma Gammas.

626
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:52,364
That was a great idea, Kristen.

627
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,627
And if the freak show
make it through hell week?

628
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,564
You're in.

629
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,258
Wait!

630
00:33:58,366 --> 00:33:59,856
I thought I already was in.

631
00:33:59,966 --> 00:34:01,092
Good luck.

632
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,692
Wait. Wait. Wait.

633
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,701
So you tried the rapper
thing, the jackass thing.

634
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,290
- Nothing worked?
- Nothing.

635
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,197
I really liked that Irish thing.
That was good.

636
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,325
I liked it, too. I just don't get it.

637
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:16,459
- Maybe I'm ugly.
- No.

638
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:18,193
A little.

639
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,063
I think she's the one.

640
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,293
What? Who's the one?

641
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,731
Victoria, dick.

642
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,198
Victoria? No, man.

643
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,598
- She's the hottest girl in school.
- She's the craziest girl in school.

644
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,962
Yeah, crazy for me.

645
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,261
Yeah, so crazy for you she
got her dog to blow you.

646
00:34:31,366 --> 00:34:32,355
She's sharing.

647
00:34:32,466 --> 00:34:34,024
So crazy for you that she
emptied your bank account...

648
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,693
and bought a ticket for her
ex-boyfriend to visit her.

649
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,700
They're friends.
I steal her panties.

650
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,825
She puts pictures of
me on the internet.

651
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,333
It's a relationship.
It's a two way street, dick!

652
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,695
I gotta go.

653
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,665
Victoria's gonna let
me be on top this time.

654
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,129
But there's only one bed.

655
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,896
That's okay, because you ladies
will be sleeping in there.

656
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,430
But don't worry, there's
plenty of room.

657
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:07,160
Okay? I'll see you at dinner.

658
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:08,631
- Bye.
- Bye.

659
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,668
We are so flattered...

660
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:19,597
that you all want to be
a part of Gamma Gamma.

661
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:22,533
I think that Jackie Onassis
said it best when she said...

662
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:23,895
Thanks, Morgan.

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,900
I think we know what you mean.

664
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,460
You pledges are our future,
and that's why it's important...

665
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:32,796
you live up to the
highest of standards.

666
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,837
Because we are the
hottest sorority eyer.

667
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:41,334
So you're asking, if I keep
treating pledges like shit...

668
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,060
won't they just leave?

669
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:45,999
Will fat chicks ever stop
squeezing into low rise jeans?

670
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:48,591
Will hairy chicks
ever stop waxing?

671
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:50,565
No.

672
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:54,033
The more I humiliate them, the
more they're gonna love me.

673
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,691
Sick, huh?

674
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:01,065
Gross.

675
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,464
Be sure to lick your
bowls clean, girls.

676
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:06,000
And don't use your hands.

677
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,503
By the way, that's
not dog food.

678
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,366
It's yesterday's sushi.

679
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,024
Eat up.

680
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,262
Damn, Maxine, move over.

681
00:36:31,366 --> 00:36:32,765
I'm sorry.

682
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:34,595
I'm just big boned is all.

683
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:38,329
FYI, the ass is not a bone.

684
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,732
Babs, would you please
stop rubbing my butt?

685
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,926
I though that was my ass.

686
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,434
Oh, yeah, baby.

687
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,330
Oh, that's good.

688
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,333
Suck on my titties.

689
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:02,634
Someone seriously has to take
that thing away from her.

690
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,400
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

691
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,469
Sleep is for gammas,
not pledges.

692
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:20,969
Now, we have a little sexual
awareness exercise for you guys.

693
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,466
Good morning.

694
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:28,503
Gammas must learn all aspects of
condom use and proper disposal.

695
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:29,999
How many of these
do we have to find?

696
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,499
Just 50.

697
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,693
And how many do we have?

698
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,131
Three.

699
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:36,723
Why don't we just buy
some condoms...

700
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,461
and jerk off some
homeless guys?

701
00:37:39,566 --> 00:37:43,002
Like that didn't occur
to anyone else.

702
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,692
I think I found one.

703
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,926
Where?

704
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,501
Ew. Get it off. Get it off!

705
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,296
Wait! Poops don't lose that one!

706
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,594
Wait! Stop!

707
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:54,258
We need it! Get back!

708
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:09,597
Excuse me. Uh, gays?

709
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:12,134
You think we could
get your condom?

710
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:15,669
You know, after?

711
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:17,529
We'll bring you two, sweetie.

712
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,533
Two!

713
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:21,157
You got it.

714
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,529
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

715
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,658
Sorry.

716
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:47,360
You're Derek, right?
Victoria's boyfriend.

717
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,991
What the hell are you doing
here at 4:OO in the morning?

718
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,965
We got in a fight.
She kicked me out.

719
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:53,397
Well, that sucks.

720
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,365
Happens all the time.

721
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,058
She kicks me out, I come
lay here for a while...

722
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,793
and then I go to my room.

723
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,390
Why do you take it?

724
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,061
I guess I'm addicted and
Victoria's the drug.

725
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,760
That is so refreshingly honest...

726
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,494
and tear-jerkingly pathetic
at the same time.

727
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,934
- Pathetic?
- At the same time.

728
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:17,264
Not that I'm not enjoying
this conversation...

729
00:39:17,366 --> 00:39:18,663
with you or anything...

730
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:20,757
but there's something about a
woman wearing rubber gloves...

731
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:22,857
and carrying tongs at
four in the morning...

732
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:25,400
that naturally scares
the shit out of a guy.

733
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,628
Victoria has us pledges
collecting used condoms.

734
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,064
Oh, right.

735
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,100
That exercise she
likes to give.

736
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,633
Any luck?

737
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:35,496
No, not really.

738
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,160
It's not like I'm trying
all that hard, either.

739
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:43,169
You know, I may be able to
help you out with this.

740
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:46,758
- Excuse me?
- No, not like that.

741
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,458
Just come with me.

742
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:49,897
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

743
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,433
Just trust me. Come on.

744
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,125
- I'm not gonna bite.
- All right.

745
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,066
No, I want to be on
"The Real World"!

746
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:48,465
You're all gonna be there.

747
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:50,761
- Oh, shit! John!
- Derek.

748
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,265
What the fuck are you
doing here, dude?

749
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,458
Derek!

750
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:54,760
Of course. I'm outta here.

751
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:55,730
No, wait a second.

752
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,164
John, get the hell out of here.
It's my night.

753
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,200
Hey, I'm sorry.
I live here, too, man.

754
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,733
Uh, my night.

755
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,892
Girls, this is derek.
Introduce yourself.

756
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,967
Hi.

757
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:05,226
I'm Brenda.

758
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,322
All of you, out!

759
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,025
And he's not even
on "The Real World."

760
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,601
What? You're an asshole!

761
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,292
Ow!

762
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,833
Wait. Wait.

763
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:16,128
I had a callback. Wait, girls.

764
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:17,427
I apologize.

765
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:18,727
Okay, what am I doing here?

766
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:19,925
Oh, right.

767
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,433
Think fast.

768
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:25,467
Yeah, my roommate John's
a bit of a weirdo.

769
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,194
- He keeps them after he fucks.
- I get the picture.

770
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,428
John, will you get
out of here, man?

771
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,366
Come on. Open up, Baby Dick.

772
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,367
One minute, Angel Tits!

773
00:41:37,466 --> 00:41:39,127
- Get under the bed.
- What!?

774
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,723
Just trust me, okay?

775
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:42,994
My old look was bad,
so the ka-ka came...

776
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:46,228
but it's not raining
ka-ka anymore.

777
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,823
- Okay, will you trust me?
- No.

778
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:49,195
Just get under the bed.

779
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:55,496
It's raining... sperm.

780
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,192
Why do I have to
get under the bed?

781
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,200
I think it's raining sperm.

782
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,996
Open the door immediately,
or i'll tell everyone.

783
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,630
It is raining sperm.

784
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:09,726
Open the door.
Come on, Baby Dick.

785
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,097
- Victoria.
- Hi, Baby Dick.

786
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,690
I missed you.

787
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:18,058
Put this on, now.

788
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:19,497
Just this.

789
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,194
No. I'm not gonna do it.

790
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,064
I'm not gonna be your little
boy toy anymore, okay?

791
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,191
I'm not gonna be your
little sex slave anymore.

792
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,292
I'm sta... I'm standing up
for myself this time...

793
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,833
and I'm not gonna do it.

794
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:37,303
Oh, really? How about now?

795
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,992
Never mind.

796
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:44,463
I'm sportin' wood.

797
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:46,796
Oh, my god! Blow my rooster!

798
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,834
You're such a hot tool.

799
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,299
Screw me, baby.

800
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,595
Pull out your tape
MeftSU re n OW.

801
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,099
Oh, yeah. Oh, my.

802
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,065
Oh, yeah.

803
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,600
Nail me.

804
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:01,429
Oh, yeah. Oh, god.

805
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:05,128
I'm gonna tile your house.

806
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,632
Jackhammer.

807
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:07,927
Rub it.

808
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,364
Oh, my god.

809
00:43:09,466 --> 00:43:10,831
Feels so good.

810
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,901
Take me to the
construction site!

811
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:23,228
Nail me, baby. Nail me.

812
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,028
Raise my roof, baby.

813
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,157
Oh, yeah.

814
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:45,730
Bad-ass sex every night, sweet
pledge torture every day.

815
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,859
It's so good to be me.

816
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,700
Hello, Sister Victoria, Sister
Morgan, Sister Trista.

817
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,564
How do the pledges greet
their Gamma sisters?

818
00:44:05,866 --> 00:44:08,699
Gamma girls are so sweet.

819
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,735
May we please kiss your feet?

820
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,198
Okay.

821
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:20,867
- Ooh, I kinda like that.
- You may rise.

822
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,894
So, how did your
first mission go?

823
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:33,900
Trista, count them.

824
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,128
I count six.

825
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:39,599
Let's hope you do
better on the next one.

826
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:41,429
We're rooting for you.

827
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:43,467
You girls make me sick.

828
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:45,659
Yeah, you're sick.

829
00:44:47,966 --> 00:44:49,524
Wait for me.

830
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:00,667
Hey, boys, you
know you want it!

831
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:02,825
I'm the horn of plenty!

832
00:45:06,933 --> 00:45:08,594
Nice legs!

833
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:10,099
How'd you like me to
fill your diaper?

834
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:11,462
Hey, boys.

835
00:45:11,566 --> 00:45:13,898
Mommy needs a diaper change.

836
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:22,733
Part of becoming a gamma
is learning sophistication.

837
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,664
Like mother here.

838
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,527
And part of being
sophisticated is knowing...

839
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:36,765
how to properly entertain
nice, young gentlemen.

840
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:38,493
Oh, my God.

841
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:39,862
Make with the rub-a-dub.

842
00:45:39,966 --> 00:45:42,332
We were promised a
sensual foot experience.

843
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:44,697
I will burn in hell first.

844
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,328
I really want to be nice, but the
smell is just... unbearable.

845
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:51,424
You like that, baby?

846
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,057
You like that?

847
00:45:53,166 --> 00:45:55,760
Mommy's gonna make you a man.

848
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:57,663
Whoo!

849
00:45:57,766 --> 00:45:59,666
Okay.

850
00:45:59,766 --> 00:46:01,631
Who's next?

851
00:46:05,033 --> 00:46:08,469
Oh, yeah!

852
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:12,400
If you see, see, see, see seamen.

853
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,263
Won't you free, free,
free, free them?

854
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,760
I'm such a humanitarian...

855
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:22,428
so I decided to mark her
friends up, Victoria-style.

856
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,000
You don't have to do this, Max.

857
00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:25,727
I'm all right.

858
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:28,233
Wow.

859
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,233
What do we have here?

860
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,459
Mother?

861
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,702
These girls were
such a mess...

862
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,963
it was easier to mark the
places that were okay.

863
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,125
- No!
- You can do it.

864
00:46:44,233 --> 00:46:45,757
Give me that!

865
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:47,527
Who the hell do
you think you are?

866
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:50,033
Excuse me?

867
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,727
You can't treat us like this.

868
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,664
We're just trying to help you.

869
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:56,461
It's bullshit.

870
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:58,796
You and your fembots just
want to make fun of us.

871
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,993
Well, mission accomplished.

872
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:02,499
You know what?

873
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:04,534
I quit.

874
00:47:04,633 --> 00:47:10,265
Sayonara, puta.

875
00:47:10,366 --> 00:47:13,301
Three days before initiation,
and what does she do?

876
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,891
Quits. Know why?

877
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,400
Because she doesn't have the
dedication to be a Gamma.

878
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,297
Anyone else want to drop out?

879
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,630
Yes. If one goes, we all go.

880
00:47:22,733 --> 00:47:23,961
Yeah.

881
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:28,631
They walked out on me.

882
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:30,564
I'll get those bitches.

883
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,725
Victoria... I'm still in, right?

884
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,529
Kristen, you're my favorite,
and I love you, but she bailed.

885
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,225
Sorry, maybe next year.

886
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,631
What if I can get her back?

887
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:42,702
If you can get her back...

888
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,598
then I'd say welcome back
to Gamma Gamma.

889
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,661
Okay.

890
00:47:51,766 --> 00:47:53,927
Those nerds should have known
not to go to a real estate agent...

891
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:55,694
that also sold churros.

892
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,324
Allow me to introduce myself.

893
00:47:57,433 --> 00:47:58,593
My name is Buford Gomez.

894
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:00,600
I'm a former border patrol agent.

895
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:02,531
I used to put the
panic to Hispanic.

896
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:04,362
I put the pepper spray to Jos.

897
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,764
I put the baton to Juan.
That's all behind me.

898
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:08,128
I'm helping people now.

899
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,463
Look at you, look,
you soul sister.

900
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,761
Them braids real? That's amazing.

901
00:48:12,866 --> 00:48:14,629
Okay, you must be
the Appalachian.

902
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:18,760
Like a like a whack mohawk
thing going on there.

903
00:48:18,866 --> 00:48:21,664
You're like a little
redneck peacock.

904
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,859
What the hell
happened there, girl?

905
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:25,695
I don't know if
I'm comin' or goin'.

906
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,461
How you doin'?

907
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:28,794
You don't eat pork, do you?

908
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,061
I'd like to pork you. Porky Pig.

909
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:33,066
Whoa, a big girl!

910
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:34,861
You done beat anorexia!

911
00:48:34,966 --> 00:48:37,867
I'm so glad you're a
strong, healthy girl.

912
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:41,163
And look at... okay.
You ever been with a man?

913
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:43,962
You ever been the man?
Never mind.

914
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:47,593
Buford, can you show us
something we could live in?

915
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:49,429
Okay, you need
a place to stay.

916
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:53,560
Got it: Super Pollo Loco.

917
00:48:53,666 --> 00:48:56,260
Is it a boat? Is it a restaurant?

918
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,663
Who cares!?

919
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:02,829
It's a hybrid with a history dating
back to pre-revolutionary Cuba.

920
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:04,560
Smell the black
beans and rice.

921
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,997
Taste the tostitos.

922
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:07,328
Babalo, babalo, babalo.

923
00:49:07,433 --> 00:49:10,698
They don't make structures
like this anymore.

924
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,961
I'm not sure they ever did.

925
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:16,331
Two converted sleeping
bedrooms, a dining room...

926
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:18,958
and a working deep fryer.

927
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:20,260
Hey, great!

928
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,695
I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry.

929
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,290
I'm not in the mood, Kristen.

930
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,664
Victoria feels really bad
about what happened.

931
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,199
Please.

932
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,530
She thinks you'd be a
really great Gamma.

933
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:43,431
She told me that.

934
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,660
You're the only reason...

935
00:49:45,766 --> 00:49:48,564
she let the other girls
pledge in the first place.

936
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:50,293
It's too late anyway.

937
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,561
You could come back.

938
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:59,759
Just think about it.

939
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,566
I'm feeling this shit.

940
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:14,725
I mean, metrosexuals
are where it's at.

941
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,528
"Queer Eye" is the shit.

942
00:50:16,633 --> 00:50:18,260
You got the queer
part down good.

943
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:19,799
Big time.

944
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,258
You know what?

945
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:24,856
Screw you guys, okay?

946
00:50:24,966 --> 00:50:27,901
See who's laughing when I'm
getting laid in five minutes.

947
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,661
By a dude.

948
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:31,461
I think the shirt works.

949
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:33,591
There's no way
it's gonna work.

950
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:36,669
Excuse me, could I
get an apple martini?

951
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:38,358
Thanks.

952
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:40,297
I'm Jessica.

953
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,492
Hey, Jessica.

954
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,568
I'm Dax.

955
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,328
Nice and fruity.

956
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,958
So have you
got a boyfriend?

957
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,227
- No! No!
- I'm sorry, I thought you...

958
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,461
No, see, I'm not, um...

959
00:50:55,566 --> 00:51:02,995
Um, I mean, I'm not
speaking to him right now.

960
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:05,864
I caught him with another guy.

961
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:08,935
- Really?
- Yeah.

962
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,661
Man, that sucks.
Guys can be such assholes.

963
00:51:11,766 --> 00:51:13,961
You're preaching
to the choir, sister.

964
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:16,967
The gay man's choir,
which I'm a member of.

965
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,491
Can I ask you a
personal question?

966
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:26,036
Ten inches, and that's
after a cold shower.

967
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:29,398
Have you ever been
with a woman?

968
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,967
Oh, I...

969
00:51:44,533 --> 00:51:46,592
Have you ever kissed a girl?

970
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:48,463
Here.

971
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,693
I want you take this.

972
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,530
It enhances sexual experience.

973
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:55,828
You take it orally.

974
00:51:55,933 --> 00:51:58,197
That's right. I do.

975
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,600
How does that feel?

976
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:13,261
It's okay.

977
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:16,233
It doesn't feel wrong?

978
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:20,770
Yeah, it does, but it's
the right kind of wrong.

979
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,763
It's okay.

980
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,062
I'll show you what to do.

981
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:47,499
Oh, wow.

982
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,898
You're really hard.

983
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,128
Oh, my God!

984
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:56,634
I've been living a lie!

985
00:52:56,733 --> 00:53:02,729
I'm a straight man trapped in a
gay, homosexual's fabulous body!

986
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:04,858
Set me free, child!

987
00:53:04,966 --> 00:53:06,524
Set me free!

988
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:09,761
Hallelujah!

989
00:53:09,866 --> 00:53:11,663
Victoria's dog is missing!

990
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:13,631
Victoria's dog is missing!

991
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:15,257
Get the cock out of your mouth!

992
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,628
Gamsie?

993
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:17,893
Before it starts
running, right now!

994
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,989
Wait a second.

995
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:20,431
No, no. You can't go.

996
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:22,091
You gotta help me
figure out who I am!

997
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,462
I still don't know
if I'm gay or not.

998
00:53:23,566 --> 00:53:24,828
I'm sorry. Maybe another time.

999
00:53:24,933 --> 00:53:26,298
No, don't go.

1000
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,731
Please, don't go!

1001
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,824
Please, don't go!

1002
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:31,992
Come back!!!

1003
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,568
I want you to take this.

1004
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:38,932
It enhances sexual experience.

1005
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,591
Hi.

1006
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:53,693
Your bodies are so beautiful.

1007
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,965
Can I touch them?

1008
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:03,833
Well, well, well.

1009
00:54:03,933 --> 00:54:10,702
If it isn't Mr. Brad Pitt
ready to invade Troy.

1010
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,634
And by "Troy,"
I mean my vagina.

1011
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:21,056
That's right, baby.

1012
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:24,033
Mamma's got some
brand new bags.

1013
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,966
Why don't you grab a handful?

1014
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,801
What the fuck?

1015
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,527
Morning, lover.

1016
00:54:39,066 --> 00:54:40,624
Hungry?

1017
00:54:40,733 --> 00:54:43,099
Do you want a muffin?

1018
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,601
Do you want butter
or cream cheese?

1019
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:53,358
Where are my clothes?

1020
00:54:57,033 --> 00:54:59,399
Where's my underwear?

1021
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,764
I ate them.

1022
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:06,828
No!!!

1023
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:09,755
Call me.

1024
00:55:17,366 --> 00:55:19,300
- Hey, Gloria.
- Hey, baby.

1025
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,833
Have you seen my mom?

1026
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:24,164
I think she's back at
the chicken boat.

1027
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:26,359
- Thanks, Gloria.
- It's all right.

1028
00:55:26,466 --> 00:55:27,956
- Hey, Gloria.
- Mm-hm?

1029
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:29,397
What's a rim job?

1030
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:37,196
Um, that's when you have your
tire changed in your car.

1031
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,268
- Thanks, Gloria.
- It's all right.

1032
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:41,664
- I got worried.
- Me, too.

1033
00:55:41,766 --> 00:55:44,530
- A boy in my class said it was a...
- Oh, never mind!

1034
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,693
He's a bad boy,
and he's wrong.

1035
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,860
Why don't you go
look for your mommy?

1036
00:55:50,966 --> 00:55:52,365
- Okay.
- Okay?

1037
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:54,263
Bye.

1038
00:55:54,366 --> 00:55:56,027
Hey, there you are.

1039
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:58,067
Been looking all over for you.

1040
00:55:58,166 --> 00:56:02,125
I'm sorry about the other night.

1041
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:07,865
I do appreciate you
trying to help me out.

1042
00:56:07,966 --> 00:56:12,596
You have a huge
problem, derek.

1043
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:15,567
You should seriously consider
seeing a shrink or something.

1044
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,600
Do some serious couch time.

1045
00:56:17,699 --> 00:56:19,292
I did warn you.

1046
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,800
True.

1047
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,993
You know what?

1048
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:25,465
It doesn't even matter.

1049
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:27,124
I don't care anymore.

1050
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,565
Gamma Gamma can
kiss my butta butta.

1051
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,293
No, no, no, no.

1052
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,960
You can't quit, 'cause if you
leave now, then she wins.

1053
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:36,227
Wait a minute.

1054
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:40,497
Why are you taking our
side against her?

1055
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:43,160
To hell with Victoria.

1056
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,861
What about your addiction?

1057
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:49,457
I'm cured.

1058
00:56:49,566 --> 00:56:54,594
I found somebody that I
care about so much more.

1059
00:56:58,366 --> 00:57:00,459
We're gonna kiss, aren't we?

1060
00:57:00,566 --> 00:57:02,329
God, I hope so.

1061
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:08,534
- Oh, my little...
- Promise me something?

1062
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:11,193
- Anything.
- No more pet names.

1063
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,634
Think of it as step
one of your recovery.

1064
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:19,931
# Because it's
gonna be beautiful #

1065
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,297
The Kama Sutra was originally
written in Sanskrit...

1066
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,925
by an indian man
called Vatsyayana...

1067
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:28,434
whose name literally means
"split the bamboo."

1068
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:30,592
Lmagine, if you will...

1069
00:57:30,699 --> 00:57:32,998
a young man and a young
woman like yourself...

1070
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:39,505
in the full thrush of a passionate
intensely sexual embrace...

1071
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:45,038
all being watched by Garuda,
the bird of Vishnu.

1072
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:49,627
- As those juices...
- Hey, kristen.

1073
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,860
Nice legs.

1074
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,794
What time do they open?

1075
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,663
Disgusting.

1076
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:03,133
Dude! Great line!

1077
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:06,862
Que pasa, mommy?

1078
00:58:06,966 --> 00:58:12,598
Trista, Morgan is a total freak.

1079
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:14,861
She wants to remove her rib.

1080
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:16,900
Ow, that must really hurt.
How do you know?

1081
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,695
Because I'm IM'ing her right now.

1082
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,097
Wow, that's so great.

1083
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,132
How do you even know that?

1084
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:23,793
Duh. NetZero, loser.

1085
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,336
Miss English, I'm sorry,
are we bothering you?

1086
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:29,230
Oh, not at all
Professor Milch'ik.

1087
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,062
Just keep it soft and quiet.

1088
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:32,326
Thanks.

1089
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:33,559
Where was i?

1090
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:34,758
Yes.

1091
00:58:34,866 --> 00:58:36,390
Fruition.

1092
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,526
That woman is bringing that
man to fruition through a series

1093
00:58:39,633 --> 00:58:43,501
of very mysterious and intensely
complex moves called...

1094
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,568
Mysterious? Complex?

1095
00:58:45,666 --> 00:58:47,293
Men are dogs.

1096
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,962
Observe.

1097
00:58:58,066 --> 00:58:59,624
Lights, please.

1098
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:05,363
Look who's teaching now.

1099
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:08,629
You like that, don't you?

1100
00:59:08,733 --> 00:59:11,224
Bet you wish I was yours.

1101
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,528
Hot, aren't i?

1102
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:19,399
What do we have here?

1103
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,094
A little bit of this.

1104
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:23,861
Yeah.

1105
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,591
And a little bit of that.

1106
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:33,168
I'm making you
so hot right now.

1107
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:34,460
Yeah.

1108
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:39,700
I bet you really wish that
I was your girlfriend.

1109
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,165
Too bad.

1110
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:17,761
Mystery solved.

1111
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:20,096
Now let's see what you
guys have learned.

1112
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,031
You.

1113
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:23,828
Me?

1114
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:25,127
Come up here.

1115
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:31,458
What do you want me to do?

1116
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:33,500
Give it your best shot.

1117
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,361
Okay, girls.

1118
01:00:47,466 --> 01:00:49,696
Here's to life on a
crappy-assed boat.

1119
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,028
I think I'm having
the bed spins,

1120
01:00:59,133 --> 01:01:01,192
and not the good kind.

1121
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,791
It's the boat.

1122
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,269
Our investment is being
tossed around like a mud hut...

1123
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:12,029
i n m o n s o o n seas o n.

1124
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:14,328
You'll get used to it.

1125
01:01:14,433 --> 01:01:18,369
I think I need to bow to
the porcelain goddess.

1126
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,459
Sounds like she's
getting used to it.

1127
01:01:22,566 --> 01:01:25,660
She acts like she's never
been on a roller coaster...

1128
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,666
with a bean burrito
in her belly.

1129
01:01:27,766 --> 01:01:28,858
Oh, crap.

1130
01:01:28,966 --> 01:01:30,456
I think I'm gonna
lose my lunch.

1131
01:01:30,566 --> 01:01:32,227
Or taken a sip from
someone else's seven-up...

1132
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:34,631
that they backwashed into.

1133
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,291
Stop it, Gloria.

1134
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,732
You're gonna make me hurl.

1135
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,357
Ooh, you know what's
really gross?

1136
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:41,990
When you take the
last sips of milk...

1137
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,068
and then found out
there was chunks in it.

1138
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:01,401
The FHM judges were
coming the next day...

1139
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,990
and without those
geeky girls...

1140
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:04,727
I wouldn't have my diversity.

1141
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,323
I had to get them
back to Gamma.

1142
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,128
So, of course, I
make Kristen do it.

1143
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:09,291
You ready, Kristen?

1144
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,664
I don't know, Victoria.

1145
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:13,256
This is pretty fucked up.

1146
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:15,732
I invite these girls
into my house...

1147
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,597
and they have zero appreciation
for anything I've done.

1148
01:02:18,699 --> 01:02:22,898
And, Kristen,
need I remind you...

1149
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,060
that this entire thing
was your idea?

1150
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:30,125
You know, normally, I
would ask Morgan to come.

1151
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,634
But there's something
special about you...

1152
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,860
Kristen Haas.

1153
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:41,700
Something special enough
to be Gamma president.

1154
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,700
What?

1155
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,098
I think you have
what it takes.

1156
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:48,896
Or at least I
thought I did.

1157
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,299
Now, I'm beginning to
second guess your loyalty.

1158
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,389
No, no, no.

1159
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,525
I'm-I'm loyal.

1160
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:57,897
Then act like a
future Gamma pres...

1161
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,696
and go and protect
your sisters.

1162
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,062
Go!

1163
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,063
Oh, Gamsie.

1164
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:11,566
They'll do whatever
we tell them to.

1165
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:14,362
Well, looks like chicken
boat's going for a swim.

1166
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:18,464
Oh!

1167
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:19,624
Oh, no!

1168
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:22,201
Please don't send me
back to Gamma, Krishna.

1169
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,733
Oh, no.

1170
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,164
Welcome.

1171
01:03:25,266 --> 01:03:26,460
Those evil Gamma bitches
will eat me alive.

1172
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:27,794
Oh, please no.

1173
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,832
Oh!

1174
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:30,491
It's the evilest bitch
of all, Victoria!

1175
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:32,329
Please, krishna, no!

1176
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,661
No!

1177
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:44,133
My physics test!

1178
01:03:44,233 --> 01:03:45,700
Motherfucker, shit!

1179
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,392
Shit, motherfucker, shit!

1180
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,364
Ow!

1181
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:49,626
Fucking cock, man.

1182
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,391
I lost my platapussy.

1183
01:03:58,866 --> 01:03:59,924
Somebody get me a chair.

1184
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:01,227
I got a signal.

1185
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:02,231
Fuck!

1186
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,425
It's gone.

1187
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:11,831
What in god's
name is that?

1188
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:14,493
Sure ain't no bird.

1189
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:21,034
I think we're
being watched.

1190
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:22,725
Who's watching?

1191
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:27,126
Who-wee!

1192
01:04:27,233 --> 01:04:29,633
You ladies need
a tug, do ya?

1193
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,894
We'll tug ya.

1194
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,661
I'd love a tug.

1195
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:34,994
Uh-huh.

1196
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,067
It's gonna cost
you though.

1197
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,599
A little money up front.

1198
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,168
Plus, Randy here gets to look
through all your clothes.

1199
01:04:40,266 --> 01:04:42,166
Dirty honky.

1200
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:43,460
What did you say,
you little bitch?

1201
01:04:43,566 --> 01:04:45,295
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1202
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,369
You motherfucker!

1203
01:04:48,466 --> 01:04:50,457
Oh, my god.

1204
01:04:50,566 --> 01:04:51,692
I swear to god.

1205
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,097
All right, let's get
this boat roped up.

1206
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:53,928
Come on, ladies.

1207
01:04:54,033 --> 01:04:55,000
Give me some help!

1208
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,431
Let's tow this
motherfucker out of here.

1209
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,963
The boat is leaking.

1210
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,556
We've got nowhere to stay.

1211
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,133
It looks like we may
have to ask Victoria...

1212
01:05:05,233 --> 01:05:06,427
to take us back.

1213
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:08,160
Oh, and you can imagine
how excited I am...

1214
01:05:08,266 --> 01:05:10,530
to have that conversation.

1215
01:05:10,633 --> 01:05:12,794
What conversation
might that be, Bitch?

1216
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:19,829
I, um, I just wanted to
know if I can have

1217
01:05:19,933 --> 01:05:21,867
another chance to come back.

1218
01:05:21,966 --> 01:05:24,025
You think you can just
waltz back in here?

1219
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:25,031
Yeah.

1220
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:26,259
Can you waltz?

1221
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,232
So, what do you
think, Kristen?

1222
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:35,164
Has she learned
her lesson?

1223
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:37,359
I think so.

1224
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,696
Welcome back to Gamma.

1225
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,324
Yeah!

1226
01:05:41,433 --> 01:05:42,764
Are her nipples hard?

1227
01:05:42,866 --> 01:05:44,128
Wait those are mine.

1228
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,361
Gamma Gamma was selected
as a finalist in FHM's...

1229
01:05:57,466 --> 01:06:00,765
hottest sorority contest.

1230
01:06:00,866 --> 01:06:03,027
Then, guess what?

1231
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:04,361
We won.

1232
01:06:07,233 --> 01:06:08,461
Thank you, thank you.

1233
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:09,396
Gamma!

1234
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,228
Gamma!

1235
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,061
Gamma!

1236
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:11,860
Gamma!

1237
01:06:11,966 --> 01:06:12,660
Gamma!

1238
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:13,425
Gamma!

1239
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:14,227
Gamma!

1240
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:14,992
Gamma!

1241
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:15,759
Gamma!

1242
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:16,560
Gamma!

1243
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:17,428
Gamma!

1244
01:06:17,533 --> 01:06:19,524
Thank you, thank you.

1245
01:06:19,633 --> 01:06:21,225
Before I was
elected president,

1246
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,801
Gamma Gamma threw
average parties...

1247
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,095
and made below
average impressions.

1248
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:27,929
Not hot.

1249
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:30,433
But since the dawn of
what i'd like to call...

1250
01:06:30,533 --> 01:06:34,025
the Victorian era, we have
achieved total hotness.

1251
01:06:37,533 --> 01:06:41,993
And we're going to be
on the cover of FHM.

1252
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:49,597
It's important that future
Gammas are the most poised...

1253
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:52,863
sophisticated, and
beautiful girls on campus...

1254
01:06:52,966 --> 01:06:54,558
ftS yOU Cftn See.

1255
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:58,124
And these are the kind of
freaks that will never get in!

1256
01:06:58,233 --> 01:07:00,394
Yeah!

1257
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,797
I can't believe they
actually thought...

1258
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:06,030
they were going to get in.

1259
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:09,967
Let's hear it for the
Gamma girls, guys.

1260
01:07:10,066 --> 01:07:13,229
How hot is this?

1261
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,257
Girls, paint them up.

1262
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,128
Why won't you run?

1263
01:07:34,733 --> 01:07:35,927
This ain't right.

1264
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,230
Take this!

1265
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:04,966
I can't believe I let
her play me like that.

1266
01:08:05,066 --> 01:08:06,795
Why don't we pick
up this stuff...

1267
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,424
and set the dang
house on fire?

1268
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:10,694
And after that, we'll set
the whole campus on fire!

1269
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,267
At least we'll have
somewhere to stay.

1270
01:08:12,366 --> 01:08:15,494
I hear the beds are very
comfortable in jail.

1271
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,898
And we get used
to the rough sex.

1272
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,867
Babs, not now.

1273
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:23,491
Our possessions have
been strewn in the dirt...

1274
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,898
like our hopes
and our dreams!

1275
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,161
Oh, Krishna.

1276
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:30,359
Why have you deserted us?

1277
01:08:30,466 --> 01:08:32,400
Why?

1278
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,798
Gloria, I am so sorry.

1279
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:35,958
Forget it, Derek.

1280
01:08:36,066 --> 01:08:37,192
I don't even
wanna hear it.

1281
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,062
Well, you don't actually
think I had something...

1282
01:08:38,166 --> 01:08:39,497
to do with that, do you?

1283
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,658
It was all a big ploy...

1284
01:08:40,766 --> 01:08:42,597
to make us look like fools
in front of everyone.

1285
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:44,600
You disgust me.

1286
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:47,260
I swear to you I had
nothing to do with that.

1287
01:08:47,366 --> 01:08:49,834
How do I make you
understand this?

1288
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:52,197
I have no loyalty
to her anymore.

1289
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,392
Okay.

1290
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,263
Prove it.

1291
01:08:55,366 --> 01:08:58,233
What's the most
important thing to her...

1292
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,561
in her shallow life?

1293
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:01,293
Besides making us
look like fools?

1294
01:09:01,399 --> 01:09:02,332
I don't know.

1295
01:09:02,433 --> 01:09:03,627
I really don't know.

1296
01:09:03,733 --> 01:09:05,166
FHM magazine.

1297
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,858
Getting on the cover has
been an obsession of hers...

1298
01:09:06,966 --> 01:09:08,194
since i've known her.

1299
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,562
For the last three years
all she wants to do...

1300
01:09:09,666 --> 01:09:11,657
is win this stupid
contest, and I know how...

1301
01:09:11,766 --> 01:09:13,734
to make that dream
turn into a nightmare.

1302
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,698
This party is gonna be the
biggest night of her life.

1303
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,392
You wanna get back at her?

1304
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,298
The keys to Gamma Gamma.

1305
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,598
Let's do it, Gloria.

1306
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:26,827
- Give me that.
- Yes!

1307
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,166
Just like everyone,
Kristen let me down.

1308
01:09:37,266 --> 01:09:39,530
But if being mean to
people turned her off...

1309
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:43,034
then why the hell did
she become a Gamma?

1310
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:46,068
You are not welcome
here, stabber of backs.

1311
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,758
I have a good mind to
put you over my knee...

1312
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:50,096
and give you the spanking
of your life, young lady.

1313
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:52,725
Oh, i've been bad, too.

1314
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:55,666
I just wanted to
say that I'm sorry.

1315
01:09:55,766 --> 01:09:57,358
I don't know what
I was thinking...

1316
01:09:57,466 --> 01:09:59,434
and I don't blame
you for hating me...

1317
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:01,296
but I know what
I did was wrong...

1318
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:04,392
and I want to make
it up to you.

1319
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,934
Pledging a sorority isn't
worth hurting other people...

1320
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:11,663
especially people who
used to be your friends.

1321
01:10:11,766 --> 01:10:16,829
I forgive you, my child.

1322
01:10:16,933 --> 01:10:19,458
Excuse me.

1323
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:26,294
I know, I wouldn't
trust me either.

1324
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:29,460
But I've changed.

1325
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:32,865
I want to help you guys
get back at the Gammas.

1326
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:35,594
Let's get 'em.

1327
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:42,326
Hello, my beautiful,
beautiful bitches.

1328
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:45,402
Welcome to the
FHM beauty shoot...

1329
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,559
because we're going to
make you on the cover...

1330
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,998
of the world's best
men's magazine.

1331
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,001
You are going to
absolutely look gorgeous.

1332
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:53,998
Give me sex.

1333
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:54,998
Give me love.

1334
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,192
Give it to me.

1335
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,733
This is what I want
you bitches to do.

1336
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,199
Victoria, you stand
in the middle...

1337
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,097
you lovely, lovely
goddess of light.

1338
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:04,259
The rest of you bitches,
go around in a circle.

1339
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:06,391
In a circle!

1340
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,489
Okay.

1341
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,931
Yes.

1342
01:11:09,033 --> 01:11:10,625
Now, dance around
like a horse.

1343
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,064
You want to be in
the picture show...

1344
01:11:12,166 --> 01:11:14,259
you have to do it like
you're on a horse.

1345
01:11:14,366 --> 01:11:17,164
All of you are creatures,
except for Victoria.

1346
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:18,290
You stay in the middle.

1347
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:19,458
All of you creatures.

1348
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:21,625
Victoria, I
swear to Versace...

1349
01:11:21,733 --> 01:11:24,395
if you weren't here, I'd be
like a banana... I'd do a split.

1350
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,467
Get out of here.

1351
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:26,498
Please, Just stay
in the middle.

1352
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,760
I need to take some
pictures of you.

1353
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:28,890
He loves me.

1354
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,160
He loves me.

1355
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:31,893
I'll make him give
me that cover.

1356
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:44,929
Those bitches, they
snuck into Gamma

1357
01:11:45,033 --> 01:11:47,194
during our group
liposuction night.

1358
01:11:57,066 --> 01:12:00,092
These are the smallest
cameras known to man.

1359
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:07,766
The lenses are the
size of a-of a-a pinhead.

1360
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:11,597
Virtually undetectable.

1361
01:12:11,699 --> 01:12:16,967
You can hide these
bad boys anywhere.

1362
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:21,002
Picture frames, sunglasses...

1363
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:27,300
You can even hide
them in a pet's fur.

1364
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:43,993
Hey, will you be able to
find anything on Victoria?

1365
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,058
Yes.

1366
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,794
You guys aren't gonna
believe what I just found.

1367
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:53,629
We got something.

1368
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:55,724
Look what I found...

1369
01:12:55,833 --> 01:13:02,204
bonner central.

1370
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,700
We're coming to you live
from the world famous...

1371
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,166
South Beach Miami, for
what promises to be...

1372
01:13:07,266 --> 01:13:09,962
the hottest party of the year,
the unveiling of the new...

1373
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:12,899
FHM sorority of the
year magazine cover.

1374
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,093
Gamma Gamma sorority
won the contest...

1375
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,758
and we can't wait to see
what they're wearing...

1376
01:13:16,866 --> 01:13:18,265
or not wearing.

1377
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:19,560
Tonight.

1378
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:29,058
Come on in girls, these guys
are gonna help you on out.

1379
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:30,656
They're my little
temp service here.

1380
01:13:30,766 --> 01:13:32,791
This is Jos, he
testified in trial...

1381
01:13:32,899 --> 01:13:35,130
for me with the border
patrol back in the day...

1382
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:35,995
you know what I'm saying?

1383
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,362
That guy with the
turban did it.

1384
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:39,366
Now these guys wanna get
back at them Gamma bitches.

1385
01:13:39,466 --> 01:13:41,525
The Gammas turned
em on in to the INS...

1386
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:44,602
so they wanna get
back at the girls too.

1387
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:46,565
Thank you.

1388
01:13:46,666 --> 01:13:49,567
Anything you need
they're gonna help you.

1389
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:52,965
I get hepatitis.

1390
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,326
No Poops.

1391
01:14:04,133 --> 01:14:05,760
Damn!

1392
01:14:05,866 --> 01:14:07,731
I mean this is
like a buffet.

1393
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:13,601
Oh my god, that's
Carmen Electra.

1394
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,429
She's my fantasy
girlfriend.

1395
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:17,262
She's coming here.

1396
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,857
Hey.

1397
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:32,268
Um... nice legs.

1398
01:14:32,366 --> 01:14:34,664
Thanks.

1399
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:39,362
What time do they open?

1400
01:14:39,466 --> 01:14:42,731
I was thinking maybe we
could go somewhere...

1401
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:48,669
and, uh... talk.

1402
01:14:48,766 --> 01:14:50,233
Oh, Dax!

1403
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,698
Oh God.

1404
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,062
Hey!

1405
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,724
Step away from my man!

1406
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:56,061
I don't know her.

1407
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:59,192
Kids this is Dax,
he's your new daddy.

1408
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,857
What?

1409
01:14:59,966 --> 01:15:00,762
No, I don't have kids!

1410
01:15:00,866 --> 01:15:01,560
Pony ride!

1411
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:02,428
No-no, don't leave!

1412
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:03,431
Wait, Carmen!

1413
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:09,065
By any chance
are you jewish?

1414
01:15:09,166 --> 01:15:13,102
No, I'm methodist.

1415
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:15,794
That'll do.

1416
01:15:26,366 --> 01:15:28,834
What's up, hottie?

1417
01:15:28,933 --> 01:15:31,925
Word.

1418
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:34,729
You ever been in the
back of a pickup truck?

1419
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,324
What's a pickup truck?

1420
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:40,334
You're about to find out.

1421
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,330
You're not gonna be
needing this shit.

1422
01:15:59,166 --> 01:16:00,133
Hi.

1423
01:16:00,233 --> 01:16:01,894
Hi.

1424
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,900
Would you like a drink?

1425
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,558
Su-sure.

1426
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:09,261
Champagne's really good
for the complexion.

1427
01:16:09,366 --> 01:16:12,802
Just kiss her
allready you big puss!

1428
01:16:12,899 --> 01:16:14,925
Wooo!

1429
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:18,469
Oh, God, somebody kill me!

1430
01:16:18,566 --> 01:16:21,865
I'm a pony!

1431
01:16:21,966 --> 01:16:25,163
I'm a pony!

1432
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:29,726
And now the moment
you've been waiting for...

1433
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:34,167
FHM presents the
girls of Gamma Gamma.

1434
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:03,191
And now, here's your
host for the evening...

1435
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,565
Sofia Vergara!

1436
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:10,534
We have searched far and
wide to find a sorority...

1437
01:17:10,633 --> 01:17:12,430
that will represent
everything...

1438
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:15,024
that you have come
to love about FHM...

1439
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:19,729
sex apeal, power,
style and respect.

1440
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:23,826
Let me present to you
FHM's hottest sorority...

1441
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:25,662
Gamma Gamma!

1442
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,490
Congratulations!

1443
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:34,200
Thank you.

1444
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,995
Thank you.

1445
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,400
People told me, "Victoria
no question about it...

1446
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,229
"you're the hottest
sorority leader...

1447
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:44,301
"at South Beach University."

1448
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:48,302
But the entire country, I
just knew I could do it.

1449
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:55,533
And this is only the beginning
of Victoria English.

1450
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:59,831
This is supposed to be
about Gamma, not just her.

1451
01:17:59,933 --> 01:18:02,060
Sofia, you are so hot.

1452
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:04,498
We should totally like
do a show together.

1453
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,591
Oh my god, thank
you, of course.

1454
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:08,292
Wouldn't that
be so hot guys?

1455
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:09,526
Do her!

1456
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:22,472
Hi, I have a really
big favor to ask you...

1457
01:18:22,566 --> 01:18:26,559
I seem to have dropped my
earring backing over here.

1458
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:30,158
I was wondering if you
could help me find it.

1459
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:32,325
All right Gammas, do you
wanna see your cover?

1460
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:40,868
We're not even on it.

1461
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,764
Victoria looks
really beautiful.

1462
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,997
God I look hot.

1463
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,729
Backstabbing little bitch!

1464
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:56,233
And now lets take a
look behind the scenes...

1465
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:59,734
at the hottest
sorority in America.

1466
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:06,294
Hey everybody, I'm
Victoria English...

1467
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:09,460
president of Gamma Gamma and
I wanna show you around.

1468
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:12,296
This is the
master bedroom.

1469
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,630
And this is Gamsie, my dog.

1470
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:24,031
# Twinkle-twinkle little... #

1471
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,494
They showed me
on the potty.

1472
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,364
What are you doing
you ugly ass?

1473
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:48,760
You poor thing, there
you go you're better.

1474
01:19:48,866 --> 01:19:50,697
You are looking so thin.

1475
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:51,824
Thank you.

1476
01:19:51,933 --> 01:19:53,332
Probably had
another abortion.

1477
01:19:57,933 --> 01:19:59,059
Uh-oh.

1478
01:20:09,233 --> 01:20:10,825
You fucking bitches.

1479
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,464
Stop the video!

1480
01:20:17,566 --> 01:20:18,897
I did not approve of this!

1481
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:32,367
Oh my God!

1482
01:20:32,466 --> 01:20:33,831
That's my school picture!

1483
01:20:33,933 --> 01:20:34,865
Oh, my God.

1484
01:20:34,966 --> 01:20:36,160
Where did you find that?

1485
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,364
Stop the video, I did
not approve of this.

1486
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:46,625
Very, very
interesting but...

1487
01:20:46,733 --> 01:20:49,258
This isn't the right tape.

1488
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:52,164
I was obviously joking.

1489
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:55,895
Everybody knows what a
great sense of humor I have.

1490
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,729
You can't walk out on me!

1491
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,892
Where are you all going?

1492
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,297
None of this is true!

1493
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,493
Don't you know who I am?

1494
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,465
I'm Victoria English!

1495
01:21:05,566 --> 01:21:09,229
Those bitches just set this
up because their jealous!

1496
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,130
Oh Shit.

1497
01:21:13,133 --> 01:21:15,158
Hey, any of you broads...

1498
01:21:15,266 --> 01:21:17,962
wanna eat sushi off
my naked body?

1499
01:21:18,066 --> 01:21:20,694
I am the one.

1500
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,735
Oh, yes.

1501
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,802
I am the one.

1502
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:34,165
Aren't you one of those
Gamma Gamma girls?

1503
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:37,360
Oh, darlin', I'm not just one
of the Gamma Gamma girls...

1504
01:21:37,466 --> 01:21:40,060
I'm victoria english.

1505
01:21:40,166 --> 01:21:42,896
Right, and I'm
Paris Hilton.

1506
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,593
Where have you
been baby dick?

1507
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,294
Victoria, it's all over.

1508
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:56,334
I deserve better.

1509
01:21:56,433 --> 01:21:58,924
Better than me?

1510
01:21:59,033 --> 01:22:01,729
There's no one
better than me.

1511
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:03,095
And there's no
way I'm gonna let...

1512
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,827
some dumbass pledge
ruin my relationship...

1513
01:22:04,933 --> 01:22:06,798
with this worthless
piece of shit.

1514
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:09,664
Victoria...

1515
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:13,896
- Pledge this.
- Pledge this.

1516
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,592
Derek disapointed me.

1517
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:17,725
He was too clueless
to know what he had.

1518
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:21,234
As far as I'm concerned, she
can have that tiny bastard.

1519
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:23,324
That was great,
baby, fantastic.

1520
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:26,163
Ari Belinsky producer
E channel Los Angeles.

1521
01:22:26,266 --> 01:22:29,724
So, where you really
an ugly kid, or what?

1522
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:31,664
It's all lies!

1523
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:33,290
Oh, it's too bad.

1524
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:35,061
I was hoping we could
do a reality show,

1525
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:36,531
back to basic's
kind of thing...

1526
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:39,295
but if it isn't true...

1527
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:42,164
A show about me?

1528
01:22:42,266 --> 01:22:44,860
It's all true!

1529
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:46,695
It's all true!

1530
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,030
A true Gamma Gamma
never quits...

1531
01:22:49,133 --> 01:22:51,795
so I gave them the
ending they wanted.

1532
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:58,736
Well, I guess now you
all know the real me.

1533
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,528
Pretty huh?

1534
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:06,691
Sometimes it's hard
for me to remember...

1535
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,291
what it was like
all those years...

1536
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:11,925
of being ridiculed
and laughed at.

1537
01:23:12,033 --> 01:23:14,263
I struggled to erase that
girl you saw up there...

1538
01:23:14,366 --> 01:23:18,029
and become the one that
you see down here.

1539
01:23:18,133 --> 01:23:23,469
Respected, admired, hot.

1540
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:28,833
But I guess somewhere
along the way...

1541
01:23:28,933 --> 01:23:31,128
I became like one of those
people that caused me...

1542
01:23:31,233 --> 01:23:35,966
so much pain and that
is totally not hot.

1543
01:23:36,066 --> 01:23:39,297
It's not about how you
look or building your body...

1544
01:23:39,399 --> 01:23:42,665
or straighting your nose
or getting bigger boobs.

1545
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:47,066
It's about your attitude
and that's what's hot...

1546
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:49,896
and I should know
because I invented it.

1547
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,331
Morgan?

1548
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:03,492
You're a bitch!

1549
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,764
You tell me now about this
hot attitude bullshit!

1550
01:24:07,866 --> 01:24:11,461
I spent my life savings
fixing my nose...

1551
01:24:11,566 --> 01:24:14,364
and my entire body
to look like you!

1552
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:19,165
Now you tell me to
be me and not you.

1553
01:24:19,266 --> 01:24:20,893
You're a disgrace.

1554
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,833
I hate you!

1555
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:26,163
Hey, lady, get a life.

1556
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:34,800
So, I made a nice speech
about having a good attitude...

1557
01:24:34,899 --> 01:24:36,731
and inner beauty.

1558
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:38,425
But I can't figure out...

1559
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:40,865
if I was mad at those girls
for showing me up...

1560
01:24:40,966 --> 01:24:42,797
or proud that they
actually managed...

1561
01:24:42,899 --> 01:24:45,232
to totally minipulate me.

1562
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:47,358
What the heck?

1563
01:24:47,466 --> 01:24:51,903
The next year Gloria became the
president of Gamma Gamma.

1564
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,869
And me, I loved
my cover so much...

1565
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:59,400
I bought FHM magazine.
