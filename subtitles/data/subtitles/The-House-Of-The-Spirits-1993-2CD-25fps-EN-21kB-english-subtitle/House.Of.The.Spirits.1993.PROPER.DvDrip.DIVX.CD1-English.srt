1
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,530
THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS

2
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,460
that good to be of turn.

3
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,850
come, dad.

4
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,430
that good to be of turn.

5
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,790
Our memory is weak.

6
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,390
The life is very brief.

7
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,470
everything is so fast

8
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,780
that there is no time to understand the relationship among events.

9
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,580
this wrote my mother in their diaries

10
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,770
to be attentive at the time.

11
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,130
what was, dad?

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,200
do want to lie down?

13
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,510
feel Clara's lack.

14
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,710
dad...

15
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,300
... I think the mammy he/she is connosco at this time.

16
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,060
come to lie down.

17
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,210
My mother always referred to the love as a miracle.

18
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,210
from child registava everything

19
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,880
to see the things in their owed dimens

20
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,710
were the first time that she saw my father.

21
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,750
although he had come to ask the oldest sister's hand, the Rose,

22
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,060
my mother noticed that it was passionate for him.

23
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,410
wanted, we didn't get to talk.

24
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,800
Esteban, if it is that also the will of the Rose...

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,590
for us the important...

26
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,990
... it is not only that the Rose is happy,

27
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,270
but also... - I am decided...

28
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,830
to work arduously everyday.

29
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,220
are convinced...

30
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,180
that to work always arduously,

31
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,420
one day I will be sufficiently rich for...

32
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,250
no, Clara.

33
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,490
that one day will be sufficiently rich to take the Rose to the altar.

34
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,160
Clara, not!

35
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,130
two years later,

36
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,450
discovered the gold that would take him of turn Pink

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,240
The love made him to go down bottom in the mine,

38
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,040
but the arduous work and the wait turned his desire still larger.

39
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,270
finally, he had success and soon it would go back to marry the Rose.

40
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,580
vein people to celebrate the candidacy of my av

41
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,690
my grandparents tried to hide my mother's supernatural powers,

42
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,650
but all knew them.

43
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,800
secretly, the people came to advise with her.

44
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,200
only wanted to know Clara it was able to me to say...

45
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,720
got into an enormous debt.

46
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,270
for a politician that is an escãndalo.

47
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,150
don't know what to do.

48
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,110
My family... - "Black Devil" will expire Sunday.

49
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,190
The something? - In the third race.

50
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,500
thank him/her immense.

51
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,700
promise that never again I will ask for him/her help. Thank you.

52
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,290
thank you.

53
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,010
It is that my fiancé...

54
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,730
are so unhappy...

55
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,480
thought that Clara maybe I could help myself.

56
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,360
could feel a hunch for him love again.

57
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,520
His/her fiancé doesn't support the lavender smell.

58
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,710
if he/she leaves of using lavender oil,

59
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,630
maybe he wants her again.

60
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,190
what happens?

61
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Clara?!

62
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,530
should be embarrassed for upsetting Clara!

63
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,850
He/she is a delicate child.

64
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,000
rose, what is she to say her?

65
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,630
say that soon there will be a death in our family,

66
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,710
but that will be by accident.

67
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,300
Partido Conservador has state always in the power.

68
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,740
are greedy, corrupt, intolerant and outdated.

69
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,850
us, of Partido Liberal, we have that combatting.

70
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,730
thank you, dear friends for your support. Thank you.

71
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,590
should drink.

72
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,460
who it carves the pig, drink. It is the tradition. Go.

73
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,120
Clara? 74

74
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,610
nun meows...

75
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,760
nun meows...

76
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,190
The brandy has enough poison to kill an ox.

77
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,670
but...

78
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,900
to have the certainty of the cause of the death, I have of the autopsiar.

79
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,500
have that to examine.

80
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,700
mean... what will have he/she that to shred?

81
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,890
Clara...

82
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,970
... the fault was not yours.

83
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
you don't provoke the events...

84
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,470
wanted...

85
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,390
only foresee them a little before they happen.

86
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,520
It is soon the Rose had to die in my place.

87
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,790
don't feel need of revenge.

88
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,510
The revenge doesn't do well to anybody.

89
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,710
The revenge...

90
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,060
... he/she won't bring us the Rose of turn.

91
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,500
because I wrapped up in politics in this country?

92
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,210
don't pass of murderers and thieves!

93
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,380
My mother thought the Rose he/she had died for fault of her.

94
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,210
that if he/she spoke again, he/she could cause new accidents.

95
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,050
tormented for the displeasure and fault, maintained the silence.

96
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
never again decided to pronounce word.

97
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,590
Is it even true, Clara?

98
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,370
could not have waited for me, Pink?

99
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,890
for why didn't wait for me you?

100
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,480
if he/she knew that you would live so a little,

101
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,360
would have stolen to marry with you.

102
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,840
would have done you happy.

103
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,220
after leaving of speaking,

104
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,860
the mother started to live in an own world,

105
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,010
wrapped up in their fantasies,

106
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,850
in a world that escaped logical ã and laws of the physics.

107
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,640
enclosed for spirits of the air, of the water and of the earth...

108
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,280
becoming unnecessary for her to speak for many years.

109
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,350
don't go back to the mine.

110
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,820
have to do any thing.

111
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,540
the mother's medicines they are expensive.

112
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,100
already ended.

113
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,970
already ended.

114
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,980
how many years of my life do know passed to take care of the mother?

115
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,780
The road for God is through of the devotion and of the suffering.

116
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,140
were what taught me.

117
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,570
will leave. I hate this city.

118
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,450
because you don't say before what do hate this house?

119
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,090
that also.

120
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,760
would like to be man... for also to leave.

121
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,520
And I am happy for not being woman.

122
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,430
bought an old farm with the money of the mine.

123
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,630
will feel your lack.

124
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,620
write me if the mother worsens.

125
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,450
do favor!

126
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,250
can take me even ã "Three Marias?"

127
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,680
how you call?

128
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
second.

129
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,200
now are the patrón here now.

130
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,720
who doesn't like, it can leave.

131
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
the ones that be...

132
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,190
won't lack them food, if they work a lot and well.

133
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,430
understand?

134
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,110
understood, patrón. We don't have to go where.

135
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,480
force, force.

136
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
care, they can break the wheel.

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,750
go, I count. A, two, three!

138
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,950
in the 20 following years, the father rebuilt Three Marias,

139
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,550
turning her/it in an of the farms more productive of the country.

140
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,540
worked very in the morning even ã night,

141
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,820
and he/she had many conflicts with unhappy workers.

142
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,060
do you want him to pay them orderly? Is it like this that you/they thank me?

143
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,410
are demanding, but I am always exactly.

144
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,410
in spite of all of the problems, my father was happy

145
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,360
and conscious that everything was fruit of his/her arduous work.

146
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,550
how much want?

147
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,150
preferred that he/she lent me some money.

148
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,710
are very shameless. - 50 weights, patrón.

149
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,540
He/she is the most powerful man and rich of this city.

150
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,780
would not ask for this the more nobody.

151
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,570
for something so much money?

152
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,930
for a convoy ticket for the city, a red dress,

153
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,720
a pair of shoes of high jump, a perfume bottle...

154
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,240
and a permanent one. I want to come to be rich and famous.

155
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,190
as I know that I return you to see? - We will see each other again.

156
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,750
I know.

157
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,310
trust me.

158
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,700
how you call?

159
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,660
I closed business,

160
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,930
I taste of ambitious people.

161
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,920
- Is everything? - Yes.

162
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,470
telegram for itself, patrón.

163
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,030
remember of when were we children?

164
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,300
cook for you...

165
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,380
and to order you to the school.

166
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,300
take care of you, do you know?

167
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
will make what the mother asked me.

168
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,670
accepted me as son-in-law once...

169
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,830
her no, Esteban. - They can make him/it again.

170
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,030
she is not normal.

171
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,300
His/her sister, the Rose, was special.

172
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,660
at least, it was healthy and normal,

173
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,900
but Clara is so strange. You will never be happy with her.

174
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,130
are with jealousies. You were never passionate.

175
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,330
only remain you a home for old spinsters.

176
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,730
she will never be able to love you as necessary of being loved.

177
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,320
Clara is too strange.

178
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,680
necessary of a woman that he/she takes care of you,

179
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,800
that he/she adores you and obey. - It already arrives, Ferula!

180
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,310
seem to live in another world, since the Rose died.

181
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,870
I know.

182
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,460
are not that she cannot speak. He/she never wanted.

183
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,900
I know.

184
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,010
since it can feel healthy children, it is enough.

185
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,610
maybe had her protected too much.

186
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,570
It is impossible to give afecto too much to somebody.

187
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,080
can see her now?

188
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,160
don't take decis

189
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,320
know her first.

190
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,110
later have to know what does Clara want, doesn't you agree?

191
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,600
dad! Dad!

192
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,360
came to ask me in marriage.

193
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,520
Clara! Be not impertinent!

194
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,550
want to know. I don't want to lose time.

195
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,950
me also taste of being directo.

196
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,630
yes, Clara. - She told any thing.

197
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,110
were for that that I came. - She spoke!

198
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,340
she told any thing. - You told any thing!

199
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,180
she spoke!

200
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,780
she speaks!

201
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,690
she speaks!

202
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,970
thank you, Clara. You did me very happy.

203
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,680
good-bye.

204
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,820
everything is well?

205
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,120
good afternoon, Ferula.

206
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,320
excuse the delay.

207
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,430
suddenly...I didn't remember if it was today.

208
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,070
owe you an explanation...

209
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,950
for having request that you came.

210
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,140
wait for not having made you to wait a long time.

211
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,620
not.

212
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,980
are so happy that you have come.

213
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,610
used to frequent places like this.

214
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,170
in fact, it had never here come.

215
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,560
Clara, he/she would like to talk about you...

216
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,070
don't worry.

217
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,550
come to live with me and with Esteban when we marry.

218
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,790
will be as sisters.

219
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,100
And our friendship... the rest of our lives will last.

220
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,450
don't worry. I will speak to him.

221
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:20,360
nor we will tell him/her that in the encontrámos.

222
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,480
are well?

223
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,310
excuse me. Used to cry.

224
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,110
are not habituated that you/they play me. Excuse.

225
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,230
are not accustomed the one that is kind to me.

226
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,780
never nobody showed me affection.

227
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,940
excuse me...

228
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,810
are so confused... and so diminished.

229
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,010
thank you, dear Clara.

230
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,530
Ferula, dear sister.

231
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,840

232
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
... Esteban Trueba...

233
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,110
... Clara del Valle...

234
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,590

00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,990

236
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,580
... in the disease and in the health...

237
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,900
... in the wealth and in the poverty...

238
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,340
... until that the death separates you?

239
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,580
accept.

240
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,770
And you, Clara del Valle...

241
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,160
... you accept Esteban Trueba...

242
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,640
... as your legitimate husband...

243
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,400
... to love and to respect...

244
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,870
... in the disease and in the health...

245
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,510
... in the wealth and in the poverty...

246
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,350
... until that the death separates you?

247
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,910
accept.

248
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,060
yes, I accept.

249
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,550
It is beautiful.

250
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,890
oh! It is beautiful!

251
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,560
welcome ãs Three Marias. Congratulations.

252
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
remember of my sister Ferula?

253
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,470
should be tired.

254
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,910
will make you a chocolate.

255
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,630
are not tired.

256
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,470
did take good trip? 257

257
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,820
she is not any child. You should not treat her as such.

258
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,890
oh! My dear Esteban!

259
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,430
walk!

260
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,910
forgive me Priest, because I sinned. I don't admit there am me one week.

261
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,220
leaning that committed a terrible sin. - Of the meat?

262
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,620
My meat is weakened, but my spirit is not.

263
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,770
The demónio torments me.

264
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,890
The mercy of God is infinite.

265
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,850
don't imagine the thoughts that a lonely woman has.

266
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,920
a virgin that he/she never had a man,

267
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,040
not for opportunity lack but because...

268
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,110
God gave me a sick mother of who had to take care.

269
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,990
that sacrifice it is recorded in the sky, daughter.

270
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,590
same that I have sin in thoughts, Priest?

271
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,820
well, that depends of the thoughts.

272
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,130
per times...

273
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,370
... ã night...

274
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,050
... I don't get to sleep.

275
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,410
feel to suffocate.

276
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,560
to calm down, I wander for the house.

277
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,910
are going to my sister-in-law's room and I listen ã carries.

278
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,950
per times,

279
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,790
enter in beaks of feet and I observe her/it to sleep.

280
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,660
that she was stupid and incompetent.

281
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,500
now know that she doesn't belong to this world.

282
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,650
maybe his/her life in the earth be a small part of her.

283
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,090
maybe are more close to God than us, Priest.

284
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,840
seem the Angel of the Light.

285
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,350
please to enter me in his/her bed...

286
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,870
... and to feel...

287
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,190
... the heat of his/her skin...

288
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,860
... and his/her soft breathing.

289
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,820
prayer, my daughter.

290
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,140
the oraç

291
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,420
wait, I still didn't finish.

292
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,250
when my brother, per times, sleeps with her...

293
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,090
... it is still worse.

294
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,800
my oraç 296

295
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
don't get to sleep.

296
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
sweat and all my body shakes.

297
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,990
rise and I wander for the house in the darkness.

298
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,510
cross the corridor...

299
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,740
carefully,for the ground not to do noise...

300
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,820
... and I listen to them...

301
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,780
... ã carries of his/her room.

302
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,250
once, until I saw them...

303
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:47,370
... because the door was open.

304
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,770
What saw...

305
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,200
... I cannot tell him/her, Priest. It is a great sin.

306
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,120
The fault doesn't belong to Clara.

307
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,550
she is innocent. My brother takes her/it to that.

308
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,350
he wants much more of the one that his/her body.

309
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,750
want what exists inside of her of more secret.

310
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,620
he is eternally cursed.

311
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,900
only God can judge and to curse, my daughter.

312
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,460
but...

313
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,090
what made them?

314
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,010
be good narrator.

315
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
didn't get to see very well,

316
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,240
but the one that I felt was incredible.

317
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,790
the movements trementes,

318
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,990
the abundãncia of fluids,

319
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,020
the whispered words to his/her ear,

320
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,500
the strangers and secret odors,

321
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,570
a true miracle.

322
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:10,160
He/she is a girl...

323
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,960
... and Blanca will be called.

324
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,150
are not beautiful, Esteban?

325
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,830
who he/she had felt that the mother could be present.

326
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,740
would be proud of you. And only think...

327
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,420
... a girl. Badly I can wait.

328
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,140
don't like the form like her he/she always walks thereabout.

329
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,660
The doctor ordered to rest her a lot.

330
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,370
And he/she said that should not continue to sleep together.

331
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,570
The something?

332
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,770
said that it would not be good for Clara to sleep together during the pregnancy.

333
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,920
To me didn't tell me anything.

334
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,200
are only to repeat what he said.

335
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,000
leaning that he wanted to say...

336
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,030
that you are weighed for the bebé or for Clara, that is fragile.

337
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,590
leaning that a lot of excitement he/she won't make ã well Clara.

338
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,540
are to enter in subjects that you/they don't tell you respect.

339
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,900
good morning, Clara.

340
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,180
Is it necessary kiss each other?

341
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,780
are, yes.

342
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,010
sit down how he/she gives kicks.

343
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,010
think he/she wants to leave to greet the grandparents.

344
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,440
grandparents? - Do they arrive today,do you remember?

345
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
will treat of your bath.

346
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,160
will know myself well.

347
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,350
The doctor gave me almond oil for your belly.

348
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,020
Evita that you are with grooves.

349
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,110
lament a lot.

350
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,270
should have come from convoy but the dad insisted on coming...

351
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,260
... in that old car.

352
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,460
have something to communicate him/her.

353
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,500
It is terrible. - Tell me.

354
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,090
due ã collision with the convoy...

355
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,890
their parents they were spit of the car...

356
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,200
His/her mother's head it was separate from the body...

357
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,240
And the most terrible is that...

358
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,560
but I know where she is!

359
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,400
stop with that.

360
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,240
know where she is!

361
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,150
The police sought her/it on the whole side.

362
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,750
My wife is a little... It is of the pregnancy.

363
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,510
Ferula, my sister,do you help me?

364
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
- It is here. - Clear?

365
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,410
but we are very far of the place of the accident.

366
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,810

367
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,480

368
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,440

hold her/it with firmness.

378
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,120
concentrate you, Blanca. - You are a champion.

379
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,040
throw her/it for the aunt Ferula!

380
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,470
go, Ferula, with force!

381
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,740
do you have to play with hat?

382
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,340
will win.

383
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,050
don't throw her outside.

384
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,130

385
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,640

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,150
almost that it picked her!

388
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,390
should teach Clara to play.

389
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,340
think ganhámos. Blanca is the champion.

390
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,650
if the mother was alive it ordered you for his/her foot.

391
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,160
will take a refreshment. Only us the two.

392
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,920

then will win him/it!

399
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,050
P

400
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,490
don't remember of me, Esteban?

401
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,370
to the foot of the river?

402
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,080
this is your son.

403
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,080
look at him.

404
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,040
have your name.

405
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,520
what that talks is?

406
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,230

408
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,140
will never get rid of us, Esteban!

409
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,340
will never get rid of your son!

410
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,980
did stop playing? Were you to win?

411
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,550
who are you? - Esteban Garcia.

412
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,590
my parents are not.

413
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,350
I know.

414
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,390
what want?

415
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,420
to see your house. - You cannot be here.

416
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,780
the strangers are not authorized to enter here.

417
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,420
I know.

418
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,210
then are going you away.

419
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,640
already go.

420
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,020
arrive here.

421
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,900
walk. - Reason?

422
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,010
want to smell you.

423
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,520
smell well.

424
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,720
It is perfume. My mother he/she gives me everyday bath.

425
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,550
have a beautiful dress.

426
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,020
seat you to the foot of me for the power to touch.

427
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,820
were my aunt Ferula that made him/it.

428
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,170
imagine.We are of the same blood.

429
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,520
don't understand you.

430
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,540
Blanca, your chocolate is ready.

431
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,930
last, he/she wanted to ask to Pedro

432
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,960
that it told us the history of the chickens and of the fox.

433
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,520
once there was a capoeira...

434
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,070
and all of them night was visited for a fox...

435
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,830
to steal the eggs and to eat the chicks.

436
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,550
this irritated the chickens.

437
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,370
the people are happy with their liç

438
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,370
Pedro! - Blanca!

439
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,090
Blanca!

440
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:28,450
Clara, why don't use your powers well, to vary,

441
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,210
and don't you tell me where they are?

442
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,280
cannot contact who doesn't want to be found.

443
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,520
if you didn't have the school, nothing of this would have happened.

444
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,110
The Second found them close to the river.

445
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,270
are well?

446
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,940
The fault is yours, Second!

447
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,860
never again want to see your son with Blanca! Did you hear?

448
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,770
heard yes, patrón.

449
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,850
will close the school tomorrow and to order Blanca for an internal school.

450
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,850
cannot do a thing of those!

451
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,130
can, yes!

452
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,880
don't want to see my daughter turn in a native one.

453
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,080
It is my duty to give him/her a life enter people of his/her class.

454
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,110
Esteban, it is not necessary... - It silences you, Ferula!

455
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:22,550
It is interfere never again in subjects of my family!

456
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,150
Pedro! - Blanca!

457
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,250
The school had finishing.

458
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,290
What turned bearable my life in the school...

459
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,080
were the wonderful vacations of Summer that approached.

460
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,420
congratulations for your exam. - There is so much time.

461
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,020
are very proud of you.

462
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,700
the school finished! - Thanks to God!

463
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,170
are so happy that you are home.

464
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,250
me and your mother we felt your lack.

465
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,960
I and Pedro saw each other always hidden ãs, to the foot of the river.

466
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,030
now that he/she had finishing the school, we could be together forever.

467
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,210
missed.

468
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,610
thought that he/she would die at the school. Now never again I return.

469
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,010
of here for the future only both of us will count.

470
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,960
what happens? - You know...

471
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,400
... that it is not well like this. - It is, yes.

472
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:53,030
don't want to know of the opinion of my family.

473
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,590
I love you and you love me. That is that it matters.

474
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,340
told me that you began to do political speeches.

475
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,260
Your father represses the farmers.

476
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,890
are afraid of him.

477
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,650
all hate him/it. - Pedro...

478
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,400
promise me that you are careful. Don't run danger.

479
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,320
love you.

480
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,880
love you.

481
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,680
I also love you.

482
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,740
well coming, Mr. Trueba!

483
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,620
the Conservatives want to do him a proposal.

484
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,570
are not political. - He/she is a powerful man, Esteban.

485
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,810
He/she is a honest man, as we needed for Senator.

486
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,850
The country is to change.

487
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,800
unhappily,the things are not what were.

488
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,400
are with crazy ideas. The farmers of his/her district

489
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,760
and the workers of the cities speak in uniting.

490
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,030
if we don't take a position now...

491
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,830
will think.

492
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,270
you are a family man, which has to be protected.

493
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,590
have to protect our values.

494
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,900
who is that?

495
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,500
He/she is Conde Jean of Satigny, there is very absentee of the country.

496
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,420
for the that I know are very rich and it continues single.

497
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,210
His/her daughter could use a coat of arms in their cart

498
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,410
later tell me that decided on Party.

499
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,120

500
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,680
can make him/her company?

501
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,840
have ear to speak a lot of itself, "Monsieur" Trueba.

502
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,430

503
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,310
And the most efficient, as it consists.

504
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,980
wait one day to know her. To study their methods.

505
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,460

506
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,490

507
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,330

508
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,210

509
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,710

511
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,460
Clara?

512
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,410
Clara asked me to be to his/her foot to fall asleep.

513
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,490
were panicky with the terramoto. It was alone for that.

514
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,990
finished.

515
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,620
already destroyed too much my life family time.

516
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,260
want you to leave of this house.

517
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,140

518
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,850
... and you proíbo-te of you contact with my wife...

519
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,490
or with my daughter.

520
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,560
will send you money all of the months for Priest António.

521
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,560
will live honestly, while I live.

522
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,310
if it picks you to importune my family again,

523
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,350
kill you.

524
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,190
interest...

525
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,100
... for our mother's soul...

526
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,060
... that I kill you.

527
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,850
damned you are, Esteban.

528
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,770
had been alone forever...

529
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:42,330
... your body and your soul mirrarão...

530
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,120
... you will die with fear...

531
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,520
... and with the heavy conscience.
- He/she leaves.

532
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,360
in consideration to Clara...

533
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,190
tell you that there was never anything of what you imagine, among us.

534
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,430
never!

535
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,320
Clara...

536
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,590
would like to speak with you, Clara.

537
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,940
as you could do a thing of those?

538
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,850
as you could order her away?

539
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,810
now already more nobody exists among us.

540
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,690
she was never among us.

541
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,130
love you, Clara.

542
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,890
want to do you happy!

543
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,640
want us to have a happy family!

544
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,840
but she is also part of our family. He/she is your sister.

545
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,270
don't want to know of Ferula.

546
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,470
want to know of us and of our love.

547
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,830

552
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,320
help me, Clara.

553
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,400
tell me that should do...

554
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,640
for us to be happy, as husband and woman.

555
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,790
give me a time, Esteban.

556
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,300
give me a time.

557
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,210
a long time passed,

558
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,280
are with good aspect.

559
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,560
as it is that he/she discovered me, patrón?

560
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,800
asked for the best house of the city.

561
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,670
now can pay him/her the 5O weights...

562
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,710
... with interests.

563
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,110
prefer that you are me to owe that favor.

564
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,250
wait a little

565
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,170
I display...

566
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,640
... some tenderness.

567
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,160
fake that you like me.

568
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,030
It is alone of that that I need. - But I like you...

569
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,980
a lot.

570
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,980
come.

571
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,250
come for here.

572
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,960
I feel so well with you.

573
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,120
It is as returning to the home.

574
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,150
are the best, Esteban.

575
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,310
are a strong man.

576
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,580
very strong.

577
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,460
a man of the earth.

578
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,410
"to your health."

579
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,770
there is a thing that I don't understand, Monsieur Tassigny.

580
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,410
Satigny.

581
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,320
And it is...

582
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,640
... what does you in our barbaric country?

583
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,320
well...

584
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,910
... my felizarda position allows not to need me of working.

585
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:40,910
only have the time to pass. A luxury life is upset.

586
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,140
turned in the restless ones.

587
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,860
my vineyards in Liechtenstein and in Riviera.

588
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,300
but...

589
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,380
... this country...

590
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,090
... it is a challenge for me.

591
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,210
but Monsieur Tassigny...

592
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:57,570
Satigny.

593
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,210
even so are very strange.

594
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,840
sought again and I don't find him/it in my letters.

595
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,240
nor his/her family, nor his/her age...

596
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,040
nor from where came.

597
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,430
maybe your letters don't see for besides the Atlãntico.

598
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,950
Is it for me? - Oui.

599
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:18,790
thank you.

600
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,300
It is beautiful.

601
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,860
tons a year, in two crops.

602
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,020
have the advantage on the countries to north of the equator,

603
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,530
of we get ripe fruit in another time of the year.

604
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:38,650
God gives to all the right of struggling for the justice.

605
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:42,520
don't want us to await only for the reward in the Sky.

606
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,800
Own Jesus Cristo it was a revolutionary.

607
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,120
are entitled to a wage.

608
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,070
that is revolutionary?

609
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:52,670
of course is!

610
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,550
are entitled of not working on Sunday.

611
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,430
are entitled to the vote.

612
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:58,670
are entitled...

613
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,020
arrive. Return to the work!

614
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,890
return to the work, he/she already said!

615
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,680
tell them that you/they return to the work.

616
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,160
please, return to the work.

617
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,060
come here.

618
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,700
didn't teach your son to not to look the patrón in the eyes?

619
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,000
take off the shirt.

620
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,030
... Tassigny doesn't he/she eat connosco?

621
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:49,670
Satigny.

622
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,590
Conde Satigny.

623
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,260
he continues outside to see the crop of the corn.

624
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,020
have a great interest for the agriculture.

625
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,140
And in to know that possess.

626
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,730
today had to dismiss Pedro Segundo.

627
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,530
never again want to see him/it for here. - Reason?

628
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:13,200
picked him/it to try to return the workers against me,

629
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,200
to do revolutionary speeches.

630
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,760
only in consideration to his/her father, I didn't give him/her a shot.

631
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,360
my God!

632
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,870
all my life tried...

633
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:24,270
to help this people.

634
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,750
gave them everything...

635
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,750
and now that crooked one he/she speaks to them in their rights!

636
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,540
I know them, they need to be guided.

637
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,140
need justice and not of charity, dad.

638
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,740
are as children.

639
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,500
need a firm hand.

640
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,690
only notice like this. - You cannot avoid that the world changes.

641
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,130
but I can try.

642
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:46,970
decided to run for office to Senator for the Conservatives.

643
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,970
what leaning of this?

644
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:52,560
the politicians don't pass of thieves and criminals.

645
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,770
cannot close one of the windows?

646
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,310
aunt Ferula?
