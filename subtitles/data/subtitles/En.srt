Which boxes?

3
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:38,363
Those are-- Those are my photos, my negatives.

4
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:42,134
Okay, well, that's because it used
to be my closet, David, so--

5
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,440
What do you need the closet space for
anyway? Is she moving in there?

Hello?

9
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,913
Amy, are you up? It's almost noon.

10
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:34,586
So I ordered these big Wanguni lips--

11
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,522
the sculptor--

12
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,590
three months ago for the new room.

13
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:42,261
It's a glass sculpture by Bob Wanguni.

14
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:45,731
These giant lips-- He's known for his lips, Wanguni.

15
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:50,235
So today I get a call-- it's gonna take another
10 weeks for them to get here.

16
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,304
Ah.

17
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,342
So we're having a dinner...

18
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,611
for a possible client and his wife.

19
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,213
Okay.

20
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,515
They're staying here for the summer, with their son.

21
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,250
Mmm. And, um...

22
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,186
I'm not saying you-- you can't come.

23
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,958
- What are you not saying?
<i>- Well, I'm not not saying anything.</i>

24
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,494
I'm saying, of course, you can
come. You're living here.

25
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:18,297
- I'm staying here.
- Well, at some point,

26
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:19,965
I don't know what the difference is, hmm?

27
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:27,406
Look, honey, I need you to... shape up a little.

28
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:31,243
What? I need you to get something nice to wear.

29
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,245
Oh, Mom, I'm--

30
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,648
Look, I have offered to take you shopping many times.

31
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,986
I cannot have you walking around at this
dinner party in the same shabby T-shirt.

32
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,789
Come on. I need you to make an effort.

33
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,458
I just don't really feel like going shopping right now.

34
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,295
Do you think that Daddy feels like wining and
dining some New York lawyer at his age?

35
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,566
I'm just kind of having a hard
time at the moment, Mom.

36
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,001
I know.

37
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,906
Look, I-- I talked to Phyllis Nagel. You know Jennifer.

38
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,442
Jennifer's really having a hard time too.

39
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,844
Her new, uh-- second novel...

40
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:08,313
is being published by some dinky press.

41
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,649
She's very distraught.

42
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,586
<i>So she'taking something for it.</i>

43
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,555
Some...

44
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,924
antidepressant or something.

45
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:23,462
Just to help her with the difficult transition.

46
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:27,466
Amy, you haven't left the house in three months.

47
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,374
It's so good to see you out of the house, Amy.

48
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,979
Caley is gonna be so excited.
She insisted that you come.

49
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,649
Hmm. Did she?

50
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,819
Oh, Aims, I-- I ran into, um,

51
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,055
Monica Cohen, Jessica's mom.

52
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:56,695
She told me that Jessica is taking
a yoga teacher training.

53
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:59,831
I thought that might be something you could do.

54
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,568
Huh? I don't even take yoga, Mom.

55
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,337
Well, you could try.

56
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,072
You know, uh, Noah and Missy...

57
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,408
are gonna want you to babysit for them.

58
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,642
Pull over. What?

59
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,045
Oh, God. Oh, God.

60
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,588
Hi. Hey. Get a bucket.

61
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,691
Huh? Some water, ammonia, some rags.

62
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,859
Oh, God. It's awful.

63
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,428
Where's Amy?

64
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,867
It's totally genetic. Noah always
gets carsick when I drive.

65
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,571
Hear about this big client we're trying to get, Amy?

66
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,341
I told her she has to get something
to wear for the dinner.

67
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,743
She knows, Mom. She's done a thousand
of these things for David.

68
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,612
Noah. What? What, I can't even say his name?

69
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,582
Hi.

70
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,651
Oh, there she is! Hi.

71
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,554
Ooh, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna
get you, get you, get you.

72
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,558
Don't get me, Granny! I'm gonna get you!

73
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,094
Amy, seriously. You gotta snap
out of this thing for the party.

74
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:05,731
Look, if the office gets this client, Dad gets to retire.

75
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,668
He's gotta retire, Amy. I am suffocating.

76
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,803
Just get something nice to wear, okay?

77
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,913
Something to wear.

78
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,954
Hey, Amy. Hey, Gary.

79
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:32,457

took the Infinity to work out.

team when you were cocaptain.

Oh, I can't believe it.

107
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,498
Look at me. Oh, wow.

108
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,534

So, are you married?

00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:39,150
Um-- Well, I got divorced a few months ago.

00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,187
That's so sad. Who was he?

I-I-I don't see where this is going, Stan.

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,895

taking alimony from David.

00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:59,998
No, no, no. She felt humiliated.

and I can take care of her.

Are we all gonna move in somewhere together?

144
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,343
Well, she doesn't need him. Well,
she sure needs something.

145
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:14,212
She left all of her stuff there like a crazy person.

146

I don't-- I don't know where this comes--
She's uneducated, unmotivated--

147

She's not uneducated.

148
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,221
Well, that liberal arts degree
with that phony master's--

149
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,390
Where's that going to get her?

150
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,398
Yeah?

151
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,020
You know she doesn't mean it.

152
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,694
I just wish I didn't agree with her.

153

Oh, come on.

154
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,302

You know I'm not good at talking about things.

156

You know--

157
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,388
What can you do?

158
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,958
That's all I know how to say.

159
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,795
But it's kind of true too.

160
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,501
Thanks, Dad.

00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,372
It's his loss.

162
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,311
Eh. Just, you know, stick to the--

163
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:29,748
"What can you do?" Yeah.

164
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:39,023
Remember when we used to...

165
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:42,360
stay up late and watch all those
Marx Brothers movies together?

166
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,464
Huh? When you were little?

167
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,034
And you could never get up for school the next day.

168
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:52,904
Your mom would get so mad at me. Oh, my God.

169
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,446
What-- What are the, um, clients?

170
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,149
What's the company you're trying to get? Oh.

171
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:08,353
Yeah. Th-That's, um-- That's a big online
thing that's about to go public.

172
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,990
You know, if we get this client,

173
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:15,827
we could make back some of the
money we lost in the market.

174
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,297
I mean, we could keep the house and--

175
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,566
Well, I could actually retire.

176
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,502
Like we planned.

177
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:30,141
Your mother wants to take this
trip around the world this fall.

178
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,477
"Gallivanting the Globe" it's called.

179
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,147
Oh, uh, the trip has a name?

180
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,183
All the best ones do.

181
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,287
Apparently.

182
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,123
Look...

183
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,526
would you just...

184
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,429
get a nice dress or something, for Chrissakes?

185
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,299
Yes, I know. I-- Mm-hmm.

186
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,401
Look, here.

187
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,603
Oh. No, Dad.

188
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,072
I'll just borrow something. Please.

189
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,609
Then-- Then just keep it. Okay?

190
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:08,479
- Whose happiness are you buying?
- Mine.

191
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,152
Then I'll take it.

192
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,587
Take whatever you want.

193
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,256
Thanks, Missy. Yeah.

194
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:19,624
Um--

195
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,132
Hey, can I try this one?

196
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,135
Go for it, Aim.

197
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,526
Fuck.

198
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,663
Oh, it's a great house. How long have you been here?

199
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,199
Well, we've been here about five years. Uh-huh.

200
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,369
And we're going room by room. It's such a mess.

201
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,405
And the people before-- it's as if they
had no idea they were on the water.

202
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,307
There was no use of the views.

203
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,377
And it was supposed to be finished
last week, of course.

204
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,479
Of course. I mean, sometimes I think--

205
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,382
Aren't contractors aware...

206
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,951
that everybody is talking about them in this way?

207
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,120
Doesn't it bother them?

208
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,689
And does it bother you the way they
talk about lawyers, Stan? Oh.

209
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,428
Ah.

210
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,497
Amy, what do you do?

211
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,301
Um, not much.

212
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,542
No. I mean, um--

213
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,513
Originally, a long, long time ago, um, I was a lit major.

214
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,418
And then I went to grad school for photography.

215
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,286
Hmm. So--

216
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,655
I was just trying to see how many
things I could major in...

217
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,257
that would never make me any money.

218
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,728
Are you familiar with the work of Robert Mapplethorpe?

219
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,331
Yeah, I am. Yeah.

220
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,466
Well, uh, Jeremy here is an actor,

221
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,135
and he recently played Mapplethorpe in a play.

222
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,603
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

223
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,405
Oh, that's a good segue.

224
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,075
Well-- That's impressive.

225
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,278
But Jeremy, of course, got to know
his work very well and he loved it.

226
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,047
But I just find it so unsettling.

227
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,417
What do you think, Amy?

228
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,988
Um, yeah, some of the images are shocking. Yeah.

229
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,689
Mm-hmm.

230
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,428
But I think because he gives the shocking
images the same attention as--

231
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,198
as he does his-- his flowers,

232
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,301
you know, that the shocking images
become really kind of...

233
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,502
beautiful.

234
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,005
Yeah.

235
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,008
I don't know. I think he's a master, really. Honestly.

236
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,111
Amy would have made a great lawyer.
I've always told her that.

237
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:55,413
Well, I make a pretty good lawyer, right? Right?

238
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:59,250
Pretty good. Oh!

239
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,185
- More red?
- Yeah, thank you.

240
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,154
- It's good for you.
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,092
Yeah, the antioxidants, right? Uh-huh. That's right.

242
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,633
Well, you know, all those studies come
from the wine companies though.

243
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,369
- Oh, no.
- That can't be true, Amy.

244
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,338
That would be illegal, right?

245
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,809
Otherwise, companies would just go around
making unsubstantiated claims.

246
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,311
Isn't that right, Stan? You bet.

247
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,518
I read that too.

248
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,120
- Yeah?
- I did.

249
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,361
Jeremy, would we have seen you
in anything else, acting-wise?

250
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,531
He was in a TV show for a long time.

251
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,299
- It was for kids.
- Ooh.

252
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,234
Uh, it was called In the Garden.

253
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:55,473
I knew it. You are Mr. Green!

254
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,309
Oh, you know, Caley watches that show.

255
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,745
♪ In da Garden where da world is green ♪

256
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,480
Yeah?

257
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,682
♪ Lives a man who you have never seen ♪

258
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:07,151
- That's you, right?
- Oh, yeah!

259
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,087
I love it! Yes.

260
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,089
Do you ever do any Broadway musicals?

261
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,658
He's far too serious.
- You have such a good voice.

262
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,427
I wish he would though. Thank you.

263
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,197
Truth be told, I was actually an actress.

264
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,731
Really?

265
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,434
Oh, I know. Hard to believe.

266
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:28,139
I had to give it up though when, uh,
Jeremy's dad and I divorced.

267
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,242
It was just too difficult. I had to get a real job.

268
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,478
Thank goodness for Jeremy.

269
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,580
Otherwise I would have-- I don't know-- killed myself.

270
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,884
Jeremy, is everything okay with your food?

271
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,886
Jeremy's a vegan. Ah!

272
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,689
- Oh, no.
- Lord, I should have asked. I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:46,624
It is such a pain in the ass. Honestly. It's okay.

274
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,826
Well, Amy will eat anything you put in front of her,

275
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,195
although she'll starve herself for dessert, right?

276
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,531
Especially chocolates, right, Aim?

277
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,267
When she was a little girl, I used
to have to hide the chocolate,

278
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,369
'cause she would eat it all.

279
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,371
I'm sorry. I just--

280
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,883
She's been having sort-- sort of a rough time
recently. She's going through a divorce.

281
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:15,153
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. I was going on and on--

282
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,155
Oh, it's all right. It's all right.

283
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,357
Does she have any kids?

284
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,159
There was a miscarriage.

285
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
You.

286
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,514
Hi.

287
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,551
Hey.

288
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,520
I like-- I like your dress.

289
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,722
It's my sister-in-law's dress.

290
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,391
Yeah. Mmm.

291
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:09,307
Jeremy? Are you in there?

292
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,576
What are you doing? It's so dark.

293
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,277
Are you okay?

294
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,779
I'm just-- What, honey?

295
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,415
I don't know. I feel a little anxious.

296
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,584
Oh, my God, it's me.

297
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,987
I shouldn't have mentioned that show. I'm
so proud of you, it gives me Tourette's.

298
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:25,923
No, no. It's okay. Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

299
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,492
Honey, you feel really warm. No, it's okay.

300
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,595
Come on, let's go get you water.

301
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,234
- Hey, Larry, thank you so much for coming.
- It was so nice.

302
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,002
Oh, no, no, no. Thank you. This-- This was great.

303
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,737
Oh, thank you.

304
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,740
It was lovely. And thank you for
including the whole family.

305
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,508
Look, we're family people.

306
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,778
We haven't spent a summer in
Westport since Jeremy was 14.

307
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,414
Well, you know, uh, Noah and Amy...

308
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:54,285
could give Jeremy some pointers on some
of the new hot spots for young people.

309
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,987
Yes. Uh, except we're not young anymore.

310
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,389
Oh, stop. You're younger than we are.

311
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,791
That's not saying much, Stan. Good night.

312
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,027
Good night. So long. Amy.

313
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,862
It was lovely to meet you. Oh.

314
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,732
- I feel terrible about what I said before.
- Oh.

315
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:13,571
Listen, if you need to talk to someone about your
divorce or anything, just give me a call.

316
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,007
I've been there. You call us anytime, all right?

317
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,776
Of course. Good night. Good night.

318
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,486
Ah, you're up early.

319
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,855
Am I?

320
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,357
- What a great night, huh?
- Let's hope it helps.

321
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,559
It'll help. Wasn't it a great night, Aim?

322
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,728
Uh-huh. Nice people.

323
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,632
Are you working on Saturday?

324
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,869
Yeah. I have to go in.

325
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:49,440
Gwen Hammer called this morning, Amy. Who?

326
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,042
The woman who was here last night.

327
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,044
Jeremy Hammer's mother.

328
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:54,845
Larry's wife. Oh, yeah.

329
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:59,650
She wants to know if you'll show Jeremy around town.

330
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,986
Wh-What's there to show? I don't know, Amy.

331
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,422
She asked, so-- I think it sounds like a great idea.

332
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,457
See you later.

333
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,925
Bye.

334
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,960
So?

335
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,698
So?

336
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,400
I need to know what to say to Gwen Hammer.

337
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,103
Will you show Jeremy Hammer around?

338
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,044
Hi.

339
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,761
Sweet ride.

340
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,029
Thanks.

341
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:53,738
So, this is the quaint Main Street.

342
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,907
It's pretty quaint.

343
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,877
Well, it's very quaint. It's very quaint.

344
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,414
There's a quaint little inn so that,
uh, people from the city...

345
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,784
can experience quaintness...

346
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:08,886
for $500 a night.

347
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:13,023
You're divorced?

348
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,895
Uh--

349
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,597
I am.

350
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,133
What's that like?

351
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:26,470
Which-- Which thing? Being married or being--

352
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,774
Um, I--

353
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,777
I-- I don't know. I-- I-- I loved being married.

354
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,613
I was happy.

355
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,783
I guess my husband wasn't.

356
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,751
I had the--

357
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,954
rug pulled out from under me.

358
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:46,824
Or the wool pulled over my eyes, or one of those.

359
00:23:46,826 --> 00:23:48,559
I had the--

360
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,162
Maybe I had the rug pulled over my eyes.

361
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:57,134
My God, I don't know why I'm
telling you this. I'm sorry.

362
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,870
I asked.

363
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,673
I'm interested.

364
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,011
And-- And so you--

365
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,180
you did photography?

366
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:12,883
Yeah. Mm-hmm. I mean, like, a long time ago.

367
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,786
What were your pictures of?

368
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:19,690
Rivers.

369
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,626
Water. Mostly rivers.

370
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,061
Mmm.

371
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,999
I was-- I was going to do this, uh, thing.

372
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:33,938
Like a collection of my "work" or whatever.

373
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,041
You know, it was kind of like a thesis.

374
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:40,911
It was gonna be like my thesis, but I did not finish it.

375
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,013
Why not?

376
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:47,852
Well, I met David, and we got engaged and--

377
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:52,022
He was this big, like, celebrity,
like, entertainment lawyer,

378
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,925
so we had to have all these parties
all the time for his clients, and--

379
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,997
We bought a place. We had to redo the kitchen.

380
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,067
Do you want to go to the beach?

381
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,175
Amy?

382
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,829
Okay.

383
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,365
Well, good luck this summer.

384
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,969
Can I see you again?

385
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,672
Mmm, no.

386
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,174
I mean--

387
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:54,244
I think this was a bit, uh, crazy.

388
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:56,246
No. Mm-mmm.

389
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:57,314
Just--

390
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,249
Please?

391
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,918
"Please." Really, "Please"?

392
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,820
What?

393
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:04,688
My mother raised me to be polite.

394
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,628
She didn't do a very good job.

395
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,768
I'm just really busy. Busy?

396
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,237
Yep.

397
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,007
I'm busy.

398
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:26,143
"'Oh, dear. Oh, dear, I cannot hear.

399
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,978
Will you please come over near?

400
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,314
Will you please look in my ear?

401
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,417
There must be something there, dear.'

402
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,987
"'Say, look. A bird was in your ear.

403
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,823
But he is out, so have no fear.

404
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:44,328
Again your ear can hear, my dear.'"

405
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,097
Says the other character, right?
So I have to have other voices.

406
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,832
Right?

407
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,873
Hey.

408
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,879
Are you there?

409
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,884
Do you wanna come over tomorrow?

410
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,756
Mmm.

411
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,459
Don't worry. There's nobody here.

412
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,161
Just, um--

413
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,997
Is there a more private place we can... be?

414
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,399
Okay. All right, don't freak out.

415
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:26,036
I haven't been in this room since I was 12.

416
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,338
- Oh, my God.
- What?

417
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,208
This was a mistake.

418
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,844
Oh, my God.

419
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,779
Why?

420
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:39,183
Look, you are a lot younger than me,
in-- in case you haven't noticed.

421
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,288
I've been with older women before, okay?

422
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,057
- You have?
- Yeah.

423
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,960
Really? Who?

424
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:57,334
My on-set tutor, Mrs. Botstein.

425
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,002
Mmm.

426
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,015
This just-- It...

427
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,151
can't be, like, a thing.

428
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,056
A what? Do-- Like a--

429
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:20,758
Like a, you know. Like--

430
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,229
What, a shell game? No.

431
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,968
My dad is trying to get these
clients from your stepdad--

432
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,836
I have no relationship with that guy.

433
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:34,905
Okay, but I have a relationship with my dad.

434
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,974
And it happens to be, like,

435
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:40,911
the only good relationship in my life, so--

436
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,982
Well, nobody has to know.

437
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,353
I don't lie to my parents, okay?

438
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,321
I don't sneak around.

439
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:02,332
Gwen Hammer called, Amy, to thank
you for showing Jeremy around.

440
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:05,836
- She said he had a really good time.
- Of course he did.

441
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:10,374
He's playing Walt Whitman in
a play in New York this fall.

442
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,843
<i>Apparently he's very talented.</i>

443
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:16,246
Really, I, frankly-- I think she goes
a little over the top, you know?

444
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,816
Like he's God's gift.

445
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,118
Sounds like you two bonded. No, I wouldn't go that far.

446
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,087
I mean, she likes to talk. She's very open.

447
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,957
She's a therapist. You know how they are.

448
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:30,828
Yeah, she said she's worried about
him blowing his career. Yeah.

449
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,996
She says she's always worried about him...

450
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,932
because he's gay and everything.

451
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,534
- Mmm.
- Apparently it's very hard for gay teenagers.

452
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,339
Amy. Stan!

453
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,441
Heimlich!

454
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,285
Amy.

455
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,020
What is so funny?

456
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,058
Oh, stop.

457
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,495
Dad.

458
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,548
What?

459
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,252
You're awake?

460
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,254
I'm always awake.

461
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,022
What is it?

462
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,892
Um, j--

463
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,994
Just...

464
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,929
I have to go out.

465
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,132
I have to go to the drugstore.

466
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,636
There's Motrin and Aleve in the top
drawer, above the hair dryers.

467
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,037
No.

468
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,605
Um,

469
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,108
i-it's a prescription.

470
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,477
I forgot it, to pick it up.

471
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,147
What for?

472
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,285
I'm starting some meds.

473
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:04,655
You, uh-- You know, for-- for my depression.

474
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,125
Oh. Yeah.

475
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:14,131
So when you hear the garage door and the--
the ding-ding thing of the gate sensor...

476
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,033
that's what it'll be.

477
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,002
It's me...

478
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:23,307
going out to pick up my antidepressants.

479
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,563
I guess I was just...

480
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,333
really good...

481
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,601
at playing gay.

482
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,337
You know? Hmm.

483
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:56,206
I guess I was just really convincing.

484
00:32:56,208 --> 00:33:00,110
You know, like, it was just a gay
part in a gay play, but...

485
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,512
she--

486
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:06,450
she just latched onto the idea, like a--

487
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:08,752
like a pit bull, and she just wouldn't let it go.

488
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,623
Oh, God. And--

489
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,993
I had to take all my clothes off in the play.

490
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,495
All my clothes off.

491
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,032
And she brought all these people to come and see it.

492
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,301
And they all sat in the front row.

493
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,504
I saw them, they saw me.

494
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,042
So embarrassing.

495
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:35,078
But she just had this huge smile on her face and--

496
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,616
She was just-- She was, like, clapping so loudly.

497
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,353
She's like the loudest clapper.

498
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:47,324
But, I don't know. I've never seen her that happy.

499
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:51,261
She's really into being accepting, so...

500
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,130
I just let her think I'm gay.

501
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,333
And she gets to be accepting.

502
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:08,311
Yeah, sometimes it's just easier,
you know, just to be...

503
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,147
like what other people want you to be,

504
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,650
rather than fight it.

505
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,521
You know?

506
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,557
You ever feel like that?

507
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,833
What about your ex-husband?

508
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,701
Why did you guys split up?

509
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:35,138
Um-- Well,

510
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,474
he had an affair...

511
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,810
with a woman from his work.

512
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:41,478
Mmm.

513
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,580
I thought she was my friend.

514
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:50,787
They planned this, like, surprise
party for me, together.

515
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,456
Wow. Yeah.

516
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,658
"Surprise."

517
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,829
It was surprising.

518
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,566
Why did he do that?

519
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,840
I mean, I-- I assumed he was in love with her.

520
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,882
I don't know. I-- You know, I fucked up somehow,

521
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:23,186
and he wanted a divorce, so--

522
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,324
Well, I think he fucked up.

523
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:37,267
So why can't you stay out? I just--
I don't wanna get in trouble.

524
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,470
I'll get in so much trouble.

525
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,374
I can't.

526
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:52,249
I wanna see you.

527
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,287
You know?

528
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,396

Thanks for taking me to work out.

Well, getting fat doesn't do anybody any good.

Can I quote you on that? You joke,

but when I went to my Radcliffe reunion,
everybody was fat but me.

you out of the house, huh?

I--

I already feel like I'm really stoned.

554
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:09,052
I used to have to smoke pot for so long to get stoned.

555
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,757
Back in ye olden days.

556
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:21,765
That's when I saw U2 at Nassau Coliseum, dude.

557
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,981
Oh, shit.

558
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,052
I'm supposed to do this play.

559
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,556
You know?

560
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,593
I got such a big part in this play.

561
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,697
That's soon, I think, yeah?

562
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,800
Ooh.

I do too.

00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,043
I don't want to do it.

00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:42,912
Should we stop? Let's just stop.

569
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,583
I don't want to do the play.

Oh, my God. I do not want to do this play, Amy.

- I do.

576
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,507
I do. I fucking hate it.

577
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,841

and then people are clapping for you.

580
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:21,551
People are telling you what to say,
where to go and where to stand.

581
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,553
And then they say, "Good job,"

like-- like-- like--

583

just learned how to use the toilet.

So why? Why do you do it?

I don't know. I don't know.

586

Don't do it.

587
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,171
Really?

588
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:43,540
Just don't do it if you don't want to do it.

589

00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:14,771
Hello. My-- My name is Leonardo.

595
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:18,475
Let me enter the castle, please. You are not Leonardo.

596
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:23,179
I'm just a sad princess, and I need to come in.

597
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,981
Please, oh. You're not a princess.

- You're Auntie Amy.
- Ooh.

599
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:31,688
It's a very specific kind of rose in your cheeks.

600
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,056
Maybe it's the antidepressants.

601
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:35,725
Uh. What?

602
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:39,062
Mom told me. I think it's great for you.

603
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,965
It's not for me, personally, taking a
pill every time I have a problem.

604
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,833
All right. No, it's not that.

605
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:48,104
You just look-- I don't know-- sexy, is all.

606
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,040
Are you seeing someone?

607
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,243
What?

608
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:56,012
No.

609
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:00,583
- How could I be seeing someone?
- Hmm. Mom said she thought you might be.

610
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,185
Well--

611
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,654
She said she's been hearing the
gate sensors go off at night.

612
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,658
Uh, mm-mmm.

613
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,628
Well, if you're not, you should be.

614
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,863
We know this guy who's friends with Craig Mankewitz.

615
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,932
Oh. Not Craig Mankewitz.

616
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,800
Mmm. His name is Phil Bauer.

617
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:21,037
He's in my rotisserie baseball league.
He's divorced. He has one kid.

618
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,907
He's an investment banker in New
York, but he lives here now.

619
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,209
Your family would go crazy over him.

620
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,811
I already told your mom. Oh.

621
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,298
You got the shovel, the ax and the pick?

622
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,900
Where's the pick?

623
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,037
No. That's a-no pick. That's a hog.

624
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,906
A hog. Don't you know what a hog is?

625
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:01,244

I feel pretty stupid trying to write a novel.

628
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,850
Because my dad's a writer.

629
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:11,788
And... it just feels like...

630

Okay.

657
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:34,430
No, I'm serious.

658

You can take pictures.

Okay.

00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,159
Okay. We'll go away. Where do you wanna go? Yeah?

664
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,961
Where should we go?

665
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,232
Paris?

666
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,067
Mmm. Is that cliché?

667
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,936
Mmm, it's Paris.

668
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,342
Okay. How about somewhere un-cliché?

669

Poland.

Uh--

677
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:48,237
The wilds of Manitoba.

678
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,808
We'll be Canadian.

679
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,210
Are you ready for me?

00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,948

Hi!

685
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,927
Uh,

686
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,895
there was an understudy...

687
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:18,467
for Patti LuPone, so we decided not to stay.

688
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,037
Oh. We wanted to see Patti.

689
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,975
Okay.

690
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:29,512
Thank you. I'm-- You-- I'm gonna let you guys go.

691
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,582
I mean, myself go-- I will be going.

Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

693
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,158
Fuck, fuck.

694
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,326
Fuck!

695
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,865
Good evening.

696
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,534
Oh, you scared me.

697
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,272
Where were you tonight?

698
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,211
- I--
- Ah, it's none of my business.

699
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,326
Hey.

700
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:19,996
Gee, I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks.

701
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,970
Mom says you're taking antidepressants.

702
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:36,512
God, it's tough to be a parent.

703
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:40,349
You just want so much for your
kids, and you just can't--

704
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:52,428
If we get these cases, it can really happen.

705
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,933
We can stay in this house, finish the renovations,
get your mom a new car.

706
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,002
And I could...

707
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,105
retire.

708
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:06,242
Take this trip with your mother.

709
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:10,413
It would mean so much to both of us.

710
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,017
But the one thing, you know,

711
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:21,590
a father wants to feel that his kids
are all set when he retires,

712
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,392
you know?

713
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:26,028
Secure, married.

714
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,297
With a house.

715
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,468
A family of your own.

716
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,309
Yeah.

717
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,747
Yeah. No, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

718
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:50,720
It's going okay.

719
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,390
Oh, I do? That's good.

720
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:02,565
Um, I don't-- I don't know why I called exactly. I--

721
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,769
Yeah, I know.

722
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,572
Yeah, I know I have to sign the papers, David.

723
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:17,513
They're good.

724
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,548
I'm sorry.

725
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,620
No, I'm sorry. They miss you too. Yeah.

726
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,491
Yes.

727
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,361
Um--

728
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,767
No. Do you really want me to say that?

729
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:40,169
Okay. I mean, no.

730
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:43,406
No, they don't hate you. No, the opposite. It's--

731
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,410
Okay.

732
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,669
Hey.

733
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,674
What? Come here.

734
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,747
What? Huh?

735
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,482
You shouldn't have come here, okay?

736
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:28,150
I'm so-- We-- Somebody could fucking see you!

737
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:30,119
You just ran off. What do you want me to do?

738
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:33,756
What did you say to her? Nothing. I just-- I just left.

739
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,659
I just got my bike and I just went riding around.

740
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:39,295
Well, you need to go home and tell her something.

741
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:40,563
What would you want me to say?

742
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,500
Jeremy, I don't fucking care what you say.

743
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:47,803
Tell her some guy broke up with you and I
came over to help you pick up the pieces.

744
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:50,806
Yeah, and what? And then you
just took your clothes off?

745
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,708
Jeremy!

746
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,743
Tell her anything, okay?

747
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:57,746
Tell-- Tell her I'm doing some
fucking howling at the moon,

748
00:51:57,748 --> 00:52:00,416
primal-scream divorce therapy!

749
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:03,152
But you were singing "O Canada," Amy.

750
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:06,255
Oh! Amy, I don't-- Why--

751
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:08,491
Why can't I just tell her the truth?

752
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,797
If she says something to your stepdad, it
could ruin my dad's retirement, okay?

753
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,832
I could fucking ruin everything for him.

754
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:22,304
Oh, God! It's like-- It's like you're more
of a coward than I am, you know?

755
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,773
And you're supposed to be the
adult in this relationship.

756
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:31,514
We're not in a relationship.

757
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:40,589
This whole thing, it just got out of hand, okay?

758
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,591
I didn't mean for it to.

759
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,494
It just-- It just happened, and we both just went crazy.

760
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,730
I'm-- I'm sorry.

761
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:53,502
You just-- You just do whatever they want you to do.

762
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,605
And it is so pathetic.

763
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:04,180
You-- You don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

764
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:07,650
I mean, it's like you think you're so mature...

765
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:12,188
and so savvy, and you-- you're just not,

766
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,490
because you don't know a fucking
thing about the real world.

767
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:18,594
There is no difference between me and you, Amy.

768
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:25,267
Yeah, there is, Jeremy. Because
you're fucking 19 years old.

769
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:30,639
Okay? I was married to a man,
and I was in love with him.

770
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:33,876
I had a fucking life, and I was happy in it.

771
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,681
Do I have to spell this out for you?

772
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:41,584
You and I can't be in a relationship, okay?

773
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:42,818
Okay. Okay?

774
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,421
Okay! It's ridiculous.

775
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,856
I mean, what the fuck do you think?

776
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:51,460
Do you think we're gonna go off somewhere
and wear fucking sarongs?

777
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,896
All right. And visit with holy men and smoke opium.

778
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,898
Oh, forget it. Okay.

779
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,866
I don't even know what you think is gonna happen.

780
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,429
Amy, won't you at least go out with him once?

781
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,766
He lives in Westport. He has a big house here.

782
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,873
Now you know, if Daddy doesn't get this client,

783
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,043
we'll all be out on the street.

784
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,962
Hmm.

785
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:06,368
Hmm. I think I will have the ahi tuna steak.

786
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,004
No, I had tuna for lunch.

787
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,509
Shoot.

788
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:18,013
Can't have tuna for every meal,
or I'll turn into a thermometer.

789
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,583
What?

790
00:55:21,585 --> 00:55:24,453
It's a joke. It's stupid.

791
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:26,655
I was just-- 'Cause all the mercury in-- Oh.

792
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,324
the oceans, in the fish.

793
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:31,593
Of course. Yeah. No, I know.

794
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:33,996
Isn't it a shame? Yeah.

795
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,865
You know, I look at my-- my
daughter Sarah, she's eight,

796
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:41,570
and I, uh, think what are we doing
to our oceans, you know?

797
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:46,642
When fish, the most healthy thing--

798
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:48,043
It's just--

799
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,685
Because I love it. I could have it every meal.

800
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,654
Just, like, fish.

801
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,489
Hmm.

802
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:01,890
Love it, love it, love it, love it.

803
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,028
Salmon?

804
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,030
Give it to me, you know?

805
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:13,869
I can eat lox, gravlax, uh, poached. Oh, my God!

806
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,637
I could eat poached fish all day.

807
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:18,607
Yeah, I get-- I get kind of queasy from it sometimes.

808
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:19,808
Really? Mm-hmm.

809
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,677
Fish? Mm-hmm.

810
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,078
I wonder why.

811
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,148
Not me.

812
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,954
And you know it's one of those, uh, top 10 foods...

813
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:34,056
in terms of being good for you.

814
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,392
Uh,

815
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,526
almonds...

816
00:56:37,528 --> 00:56:39,528
is one of them, I think.

817
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,499
Uh, spinach.

818
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,537
Yogurt, which is...

819
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:54,543
kind of weird to me, 'cause I'm not a big yogurt fan.

820
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:58,414
And I'm not an angry guy, you
know. I'm about enjoying life.

821
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:03,152
And, you know, sometimes stuff happens.
So whose fault is that really?

822
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:05,687
It's, uh-- It's two people, you know?

823
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:08,857
It takes two people to tango, so to speak.

824
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:13,962
So I just think it's really unfair to--
to put all the blame on one person.

825
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:18,066
The good news is Sarah is totally fine with it, um, so--

826
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,668
That's great. At least there's that, yeah.

827
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,770
Oh. Mm-mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

828
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,673
You are just so cute, and this outfit is adorable. Okay.

829
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:27,643
It's my mother's. I borrowed it from
my mother. Oh, that's-- that's okay.

830
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,146
Sorry. Okay. I get it.

831
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:34,850
I'm sorry. Totally. I get it.

832
00:57:34,852 --> 00:57:39,455
Right after my divorce, I couldn't even imagine
dating anybody else, no way, no how.

833
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:42,157
Uh-uh. So-- Okay.

834
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,526
Can I see you again?

835
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,465
♪ The fox went out on a chilly night ♪

836
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,067
♪ And he prayed for the moon to give him light ♪

00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:54,970

839
00:57:57,675 --> 00:58:00,509

840
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,911
♪ Many a mile to go that night

841
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,614
♪ Before he reached the town-o

842
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,197
Ahh!

843
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,601
Oh!

844
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,836
Here I am, this therapist,

845
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,839
and I don't know what's going on with my own child.

846
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:34,710
It's so embarrassing. It's so humiliating. Gwen--

847
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:38,247
He says that you listen to him. You see him.

848
00:58:38,249 --> 00:58:40,682
He says that I'm in denial.

849
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,519
That I'm trying to make him into
something that I want him to be.

850
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:46,088
That I don't see him. You know what?

851
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,524
That's not even the point, I guess.

852
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:52,728
The point is he finally told me the truth.

853
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,699
Even though it's upsetting that I
didn't even know, the point is--

854
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,238
He doesn't like acting.

855
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,976
I mean, I deal with this stuff every day.

856
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:12,214
And here I am not realizing the effect
that I'm having on my own child.

857
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:18,320
"The greatest tragedy of the family
is the unlived lives of the parents."

858
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:20,088
Jung said that.

859
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:24,693
I say that to my patients almost every day.

860
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:28,063
Hey, how is your therapy going?

861
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:31,633
The, um, singing, naked, swimming thing?

862
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:34,102
Yeah, it's good. Good.

863
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,073
I'm so sorry about that.

864
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,578
Oh, no. You know, whatever works.

865
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,314
Geez, I wish that I had had something like that--

866
00:59:45,316 --> 00:59:50,852
so visceral and active-- when I
was going through my divorce.

867
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,790
Thank you for listening.

868
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,361
Come here. Give me a hug, will ya?

869
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,632
Thank you. Gwen.

870
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,008
Sorry about throwing the rock at you.

871
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,645
Ah. Ow! Yeah.

872
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:21,783
Please don't tell Jeremy that I was
snooping in his room. Ohh!

873
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:26,188
It's just he's been seeing some boy all
summer and they just broke up and--

874
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,624
I don't know, I was just looking...

875
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:32,361
to find something, I don't know.

876
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:34,296
Sure. Ahh.

877
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:39,801
Intimacy is such a rare thing.

878
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:43,372
And I want it for Jeremy so badly.

879
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:49,011
Even if it is with some big hairy guy.

880
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,118
Where is Jeremy?

881
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:03,725
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

882
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:21,677
Hey, Honky! Honky!

883
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,446
Get in here, you fucking idiot dog. Hi.

884
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:26,314
Oh. Sorry.

885
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:29,851
Hey. I'm just, um, looking--

886
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,219
Somebody's mom's here!

887
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,457
Yo! Somebody's mom's here!

888
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:37,426
No, sorry. It's the wrong house.

889
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:38,894
Wrong--

890
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:42,431
Oh! Off! Oh!

891
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:45,167
Ah, geez.

892
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:02,384
Hello?

893
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:17,933
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

894
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:22,504
Oh, I need to get out of here.

895
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:49,297
Ohh. Ow.

896
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:01,243
Where the fuck is bottom?

897
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:09,050
Where the motherfucking fuck
is motherfucking bottom?

898
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:19,060
Whoo!

899
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:22,297
- Whoo!
- Amy Minkie's in the house!

900
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,932
Whoo! Minsky!

901
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:25,934
- You go, girl!
- Whoo, yee-haw!

902
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:30,806
- Oh, I just got a brain freeze from that ice.
- You go, girl!

903
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,941
You need another, girl. I'll get you another.

904
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,976
Whoo. I haven't done this since high school.

905
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,444
Whoa!

906
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,213
Hey, what have you been doing since high school?

907
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:43,084
Yeah. You know-- Uhh.

908
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:46,388
She was totally married and had
everything. My mom told me.

909
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:49,891
Cute husband, big apartment.
Then he totally dumped her.

910
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:57,299
Yeah. But that was... pssk! You know?

911
01:03:57,301 --> 01:04:01,169
'Cause now I'm back here. It's whoo!

912
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,171
So fun, you guys.

913
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,607
Here, girl. No, I can't.

914
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,509
- Oh, you can do that!
- Yeah.

915
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:09,477
Yep.

916
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:12,914
I don't think I can. You can have it.

917
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:17,919
No, you are here to "par-tay," you divorcée!

918
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:23,892
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

919
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:26,194
Minkie, Minkie, Minkie, Minkie!

920
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,134
Sorry, Infinity.

921
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,142
Ohh.

922
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,113
Are you okay?

923
01:05:10,974 --> 01:05:12,908
Hey, what's wrong?

924
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:19,481
Oh, Karen--

925
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:22,017
I fuck everything up.

926
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,586
Oh, hey, come on.

927
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,622
I-- I screw everything up.

928
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:32,661
Everything in my life, Karen. Every fucking thing.

929
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:36,164
It's, like, amazing.

930
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:39,434
I fail everyone in my fucking life.

931
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,169
Everyone who loves me.

932
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:44,272
If somebody loves me, then I fuck it up.

933
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,476
Oh.

934
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,478
What are you talking about?

935
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,985
Love isn't like a prize you get at the circus...

936
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:59,554
for squirting water in the clown's face the longest.

937
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,659
If somebody loves you, they just love you, you know?

938
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:15,737
Shh.

939
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:20,608
Ohh! What the fuck?

940
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:24,279
Oh, no. Oh, no!

941
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:26,748
My lips!

942
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:31,052
Oh, my God! They cost a fortune!

943
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:35,123
Look. Look what you've done!

944
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:38,126
They-- They were-- They were
right in the front hallway.

945
01:06:38,128 --> 01:06:42,197
I left a note on the door. Are you drunk?

946
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:46,668
You are! Oh, God! Look what you've done.

947
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:51,106
I can't believe that you've done this.
You are so incredibly selfish.

948
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:54,709
Just-- I'm gonna clean it up, just-- No! Just leave it.

949
01:06:54,711 --> 01:07:00,048
Don't you-- Don't you touch anything.
Don't you ruin anything more.

950
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:03,218
Oh, my God! My God. Mom, I'm sorry.

951
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,353
But they were completely corralled in darkness.

952
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,490
You take no responsibility for anything. What?

953
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:10,658
That is not true.

954
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,028
Oh, yeah. Your father and I have taken you in.

955
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,031
We let you sleep late. We let you
loll around in that T-shirt.

956
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:18,433
And you've just-- you've just given up...

957
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:21,269
the way that you've given up on
everything you've ever started.

958
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,304
What have I ever given up on?

959
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:26,274
Oh. Well, let me-- let me count the ways.

960
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:28,810
Let's see, you-- Oh, tennis camp when you were 10.

961
01:07:28,812 --> 01:07:32,781
- I was the only one with boobs!
- You could get a bra that fit!

962
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:34,716
You didn't have to jump ship!

963
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:38,086
Oh, my God. I could give you a list
that would fill a roll of toilet paper.

964
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:40,188
All of those internships...

965
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:43,625
and the projects on the living room
floor that I had to clean up!

966
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:46,795
And your-- And your master's degree Daddy
said that you would never finish.

967
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:49,264
But he was so happy when you
were gonna marry David.

968
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:52,233
He said, "Oh, Ruth, yes! She's getting married.

969
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,102
She'll have someone to take care of her."

970
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:57,505
I thought you were finally gonna
wake up and see what you had.

971
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:02,744
David left me, Mom! Okay? Remember?

972
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:06,314
I didn't quit my marriage. He left me.

973
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:09,484
And why... do you think?

974
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,291
What?

975
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:19,160
You think because I did something
wrong, so he stopped loving me?

976
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:20,595
Is that what you think?

977
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,464
That I failed?

978
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:27,502
Well, that's not what love is, Mom.

979
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:31,639
It's not a prize that you get for coming
in the clown's face at the circus.

980
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,576
What?

981
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:40,115
Listen. If-- If you behaved in your marriage
the way that you behave here,

982
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:41,649
of course it fell apart.

983
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,285
Hey, I've been watching you for three months...

984
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:47,188
do nothing to help yourself, do nothing at all.

985
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:51,259
I have not been doing nothing
for the past three months.

986
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,230
How would you even know what I've been doing?

987
01:08:55,232 --> 01:08:59,134
You're so much more interested in those Wanguni
lips than you have ever been in me!

988
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:03,138
Do you think anyone in this house has
ever shown any interest in me?

989
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,407
Oh, my God, Amy. Do you-- What do you think life is?

990
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:09,177
Just one-- one ribbon cutting after another?

991
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:13,848
I keep this house together. I
keep this marriage together.

992
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,818
And I don't get any accolades or praise.

993
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,686
I'm like the family dog.

994
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:24,559
And all I would like-- one little thing
I would like after all these years...

995
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:27,662
is to spend some time with your father.

996
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:31,399
And you just keep finding ways to
make everything harder for me!

997
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,908
Don't forget to turn out the lights.

998
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,484
Well, I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent
washout-- uh, turnout.

999
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,453
And, uh, now I'd like to say a few words.

1011
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:41,302
You can stay here as long as you want.

1012
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:32,487
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

1013
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:35,456
Aims. Hey. Hi.

1014
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,626
You look nice, hon. Thank you.

1015
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,429
I feel overdressed, like--

1016
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:44,632
What are you talking about? You can't
overdress in New York. Come on.

1017
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,537
Thank you. Thank you.

1018
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,383
So look at this. Look at my shoe.

1019
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:04,485
You believe this? $700.

1020
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:07,622
All I did was walk from Union Square.

1021
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:09,857
It's terrible.

1022
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,794
What, you making fun of me?

1023
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:16,831
I bought these for a meeting I have tomorrow
with one of the Olsen twins.

1024
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,566
I don't even know which one.

1025
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:22,737
You should find out. If I can.

1026
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:25,006
Before tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you.

1027
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:31,379
So really, you really-- You look good. I was worried.

1028
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,715
Really?

1029
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:36,351
Yeah, you know, last time.

1030
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,088
Unsightly circles? What?

1031
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:43,091
No, no, I don't-- Come on, not like that. I-- You know.

1032
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,460
No, I know.

1033
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:49,097
Yeah. I, um-- I'm okay.

1034
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:51,632
I'm-- I mean, I'm better.

1035
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,101
Wait just a sec.

1036
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,574
Good.

1037
01:12:59,576 --> 01:13:01,109
Good.

1038
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,616
Can we talk openly?

1039
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:14,422
Um, I don't know.

1040
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,790
Can we order first?

1041
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:21,095
Just wait-- Just one second.

1042
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,399
Oh, God.

1043
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,868
Okay.

1044
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,943
What happened?

1045
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,415
What? Between us.

1046
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:45,086
Um, here? You-You-You want me to
talk about this-- about this here?

1047
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,922
I promise I won't cry.

1048
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:51,959
I'm not gonna-- I-- I just-- I wanna know, okay?

1049
01:13:55,130 --> 01:14:01,803
I don't know. I-I don't-- I mean I
just-- You know, I felt-- I felt--

1050
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:04,639
Amy, can we-- Come on.

1051
01:14:04,641 --> 01:14:07,975
Please? I-- I promise.

1052
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:13,047
We'd been together for so long, you know. I-I-I--

1053
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,954
All right, you wanna-- you wanna know why?

1054
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:24,759
I, um-- I knew everything that
was gonna happen to us.

1055
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,161
I mean, I knew everything that was gonna
happen to me, more importantly,

1056
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:28,963
because I was-- I was with you,

1057
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,466
and I just-- I didn't-- I didn't wanna know that.

1058
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:35,536
I didn't wanna-- I didn't wanna
see the end of my life like that.

1059
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:41,142
I loved you.

1060
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:47,048
You know. I mean, I-- We were-- We were compatible.

1061
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:51,719
We were great friends, right? And that
was-- that was great. That was great.

1062
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,223
But--

1063
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,801
So are you jumping out of planes now?

1064
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,104
No.

1065
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:14,141
No. Hey, can we order now?

1066
01:15:14,143 --> 01:15:16,744
Are you still seeing Kimberly?

1067
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,814
No. No, that-- No.

1068
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:22,183
That whole thing-- That was-- I mean,
really, that was-- that was crazy.

1069
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,054
You know, I thought I wanted to, um,

1070
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,659
be with someone successful, you know,

1071
01:15:31,661 --> 01:15:33,661
like someone in my field.

1072
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,231
Aims, all she did was talk about her fucking cases.

1073
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:40,735
It was like I couldn't get away from work.

1074
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:44,238
It was, like, no escape, no island.

1075
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,944
I started seeing someone for a while too.

1076
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,713
Really?

1077
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,248
Yeah.

1078
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,555
I, um--

1079
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:04,625
Sorry. What can you do? I mean, it's--

1080
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:23,110
What?

1081
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:26,881
I-- It's okay. I'm not sad.

1082
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:29,850
It's not-- I'm not sad. What are you doing?

1083
01:16:29,852 --> 01:16:32,653
I just don't feel like seeing you.

1084
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:34,589
You-- Why?

1085
01:16:34,591 --> 01:16:36,757
Amy?

1086
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:42,096
Because I feel bad about myself when I'm with you.

1087
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:46,601
I feel really bad, and I always have.

1088
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:50,304
But I didn't know it. I-- I was just so used to it.

1089
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:53,841
And I think...

1090
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:59,680
I just thought that that was being alive.

1091
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:06,153
To always feel bad and wrong and...

1092
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:10,358
just insecure and invisible.

1093
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,995
So thank you.

1094
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,297
Thank you for ending our marriage.

1095
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:20,101
David. Yeah?

1096
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:23,304
I really mean it.

1097
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,906
Thank you. Because I wasn't happy with you.

1098
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:27,842
And I would never have ended it myself.

1099
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,278
Truly. I--

1100
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,981
And you know what?

1101
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,851
I wanna change the papers.

1102
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,953
I'm not a fucking idiot.

1103
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:41,656
I invested a lot of time into you,

1104
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:46,127
and I just think I should be reimbursed.

1105
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,730
Okay.

1106
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,281
Amy, we're having a party!

1107
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:09,984
Oh! They picked daddy.

1108
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:11,819
Amazing, huh? Oh.

1109
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:16,424
I bought the tickets for the trip. Come,
have a glass of champagne.

1110
01:18:16,426 --> 01:18:19,427
Isn't it just great? Yeah, it's really great.

1111
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:21,328
It all worked out. You see, Ruth?

1112
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,798
And you were right. Your mother was worried.

1113
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,168
To "Gallivanting the Globe."

1114
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:31,839
To Mom and Dad, for taking me in.

1115
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,309
Thanks.

1116
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:47,455
♪ Come on, think fast

1117
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:55,463
Noah. Come here.

1118
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:58,999
Dad's retiring. Congratulations to everyone.

1119
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,870
I'm gonna be my own boss. Finally fuckin' free.

1120
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,272
I'm so happy for you. Hmm.

1121
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:08,409
Hey. Oh, my God. We talked to Phil Bauer.

1122
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:10,978
I think he's in love with you.

1123
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,447
He said that you were the greatest
listener he's ever met.

1124
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:18,919
Hi, Gwen!

1125
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:21,222
Are you okay?

1126
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:28,829
Can you-- I have to go.

1127
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,967
See? See? That's why I never eat shellfish.

1128
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:36,370
♪ To keep your love around

1129
01:19:36,372 --> 01:19:39,306
♪ I need you every day

1130
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:42,510
Jeremy.

1131
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:47,114
Jeremy. Shit.

1132
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,822
I didn't know that you were gonna be here, okay?

1133
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:56,824
I would-- I wouldn't have come.

1134
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,295
I was hoping that you would be here.

1135
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:05,432
What are you talk-- I thought-- I thought
that you didn't wanna see me.

1136
01:20:05,434 --> 01:20:06,967
Look, okay.

1137
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,037
This whole thing is just--

1138
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:15,075
It's embarrassing for me, okay?

1139
01:20:15,077 --> 01:20:17,378
And I'd just rather not even talk about it.

1140
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:23,083
You taught me how to be loved.

1141
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:35,329
I don't think that I even knew what
that meant to be loved...

1142
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:36,897
before I met you.

1143
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:41,101
And you're--

1144
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:46,307
you're not a kid, Jeremy, like I said.

1145
01:20:46,309 --> 01:20:48,375
You're not like some boy.

1146
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:56,383
I just had never been with a man before.

1147
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,054
And I didn't know what that was like.

1148
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:06,393
Fuck.

1149
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:11,165
That was a good thing to say.

1150
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,637
I don't want anything from you.

1151
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,874
I don't. And I know that we cannot be together.

1152
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:21,642
I know that, but--

1153
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:25,613
My God, when I'm 35, you--

1154
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:27,281
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You're gonna be--

1155
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:30,217
Right. I got it. But I have to say...

1156
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,656
I just fucking love you.

1157
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,360
I just fucking love you.

1158
01:21:39,362 --> 01:21:41,328
Okay.

1159
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,272
What are you doing?

1160
01:21:51,274 --> 01:21:54,074
I have to-- Oh, no, you're crazy.

1161
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,396
Shit.

1162
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:21,462
Hey, so I'm gonna be in the sublet for,
like, two months until I find a place.

1163
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:23,764
Okay.

1164
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:34,174
At least I didn't screw everything up for you.

1165
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,343
That's good anyway.

1166
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:45,352
So, retirement-- that's exciting. Finally.

1167
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,357
And the trip and--

1168
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,625
Oh, Dad.

1169
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:53,460
Huh?

1170
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:57,197
Are we ever gonna talk about this?

1171
01:23:58,466 --> 01:24:00,067
What is there to talk about?

1172
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,547
I gotta go.

1173
01:24:23,491 --> 01:24:25,059
Okay.

1174
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:30,230
What can you do?

1175
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:35,803
Mom?

1176
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,774
Mom?

1177
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,551
Mom?

1178
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:52,219
Yeah?

1179
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:58,659
Hey, I'm leaving.

1180
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:03,397
I never liked lapis. It's just cheap looking.

1181
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:11,238
I'm really sorry about everything, Mom.

1182
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:21,548
I'm glad that it all worked out for you guys in the end,

1183
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,351
and I'm glad that Dad got the clients,

1184
01:25:24,353 --> 01:25:27,221
and I didn't completely screw everything up.

1185
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:30,190
Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter.

1186
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,462
What do you-- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

1187
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:38,799
Well, we're not going on the trip.
We're not going on the trip.

1188
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,601
You're not? No.

1189
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:44,571
He's not retiring.

1190
01:25:47,575 --> 01:25:48,742
What?

1191
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:51,178
No, he doesn't want to.

1192
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,383
He doesn't want to, Amy.

1193
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:01,755
Mom. Nah.

1194
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:05,826
He never wanted to.

1195
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:08,829
He was never going to.

1196
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,665
So, I thought I would, you know, sit here and just...

1197
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,502
organize this shit!

1198
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:21,942
There's nothing else to do. There's nothing else to do.

1199
01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:24,311
Mom. No.

1200
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:27,214
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't care.

1201
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:30,617
Mom, come on.

1202
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:33,687
Hey, Mom, I'm so sorry. Oh, stop.

1203
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:36,390
I'm so sorry. Come here.

1204
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:38,258
Come on, come on.

1205
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:43,263
Oh, Amy.

1206
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:50,204
I'm so sorry, Mom.

1207
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:51,471
I'm sorry. No.

1208
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:55,475
I'm sorry for what I've done...

1209
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:57,911
to you.

1210
01:26:57,913 --> 01:27:00,514
I'm so sorry.

1211
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:42,256
We will see each other again, right?

1212
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:43,590
Mmm.

1213
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,394
You're not just gonna disappear forever, are you?

1214
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,997
No. No.

1215
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:53,333
Okay.

1216
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,703
So, Oberlin?

1217
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:59,773
Yeah.

1218
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,344
College is gonna be really exciting, Jeremy.

1219
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:07,914
Fuck off. Well, I'm just trying something, right?

1220
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:11,385
I'm trying to be--

1221
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:14,354
You'll fall in love, and I will kill myself.

1222
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:17,591
Yeah, that's better.

1223
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,559
Um...

1224
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:22,963
I wanted to tell you...

1225
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:27,034
I'm gonna finish my thesis.

1226
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:30,504
You are?

1227
01:28:30,506 --> 01:28:31,905
Yeah.

1228
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:37,711
I'm gonna go "Gallivanting the Globe"--

1229
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:41,782
What? with my mom.

1230
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:46,653
I'm gonna go with her and take
pictures of her next to rivers.

1231
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:51,425
There are some amazing rivers out there.

1232
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,498
The driver just got out of the car.

1233
