1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,500
Come on!

2
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Don't worry, my little friend.
Thallo will take you.

3
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,500
Someone coming.

4
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,800
Sounds like a man. A young man.

5
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,500
-Who has the eye?
-l do!

6
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,700
-Then give it to me.
-No! l want to be the first to see him.

7
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,900
What do you see, sister?
What do you see?

8
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes! A young man, not plump
but well-made.

9
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,900
Have no fear. l come in peace.

10
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:09,100
Come a little closer so that we
can get a better look at you.

11
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,100
-We are honored by your visit.
-What can we do to help you?

12
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,700
-l need your advice.
-Then you must come a little closer.

13
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,300
You see, my two sisters here
are somewhat deaf.

14
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,300
-l still can't hear him.
-Suppose we were to move...

15
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800
...a little closer to him.

16
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Now!

17
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,300
-Noise, what's that noise?
-What, what? Where is it?

18
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,700
Bubo! The eye! Go for the eye!

19
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
-Where is it?
-What is it?

20
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,300
-What's wrong?
-lt's gone! lt's got the eye! The eye!

21
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,100
-Don't drop the eye!
-Oh, no! Where's the eye?

22
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,800
-You have it!
-Never fear. lt is safe.

23
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,200
Give it to us. Give it back.

24
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,300
-On one condition.
-Anything!

25
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,100
-We must have it now!
-You will have it.

26
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,100
-After you answer my question.
-Ask, then.

27
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,800
How may a mortal man
face and defeat the lKraken?

28
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The lKraken is invulnerable.
100 men could not fight him.

29
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
An army could not kill him.

30
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Nothing is invulnerable.
There must be a way.

31
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Perhaps, one way.

32
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,100
But a way even more dangerous
than the lKraken itself.

33
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,000
-Tell me.
-Give me the eye and l'll tell you.

34
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
First, tell me.

35
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,700
The head of Medusa. The Gorgon!

36
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,400
One look from the head of Medusa
can turn all creatures into stone.

37
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,000
-No matter how huge and powerful.
-And her blood is a deadly venom.

38
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,800
A Titan against a Titan!

39
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,300
-You must win Medusa's head.
-She's not going to give it to you.

40
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,100
-As a present.
-As difficult and dangerous...

41
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,100
-...as to vanquish 1000 lKrakens.
-Your only chance against the lKraken.

42
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,700
Give us the eye.
We have answered your question.

43
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,600
One more question.
lf the eyes of Medusa...

44
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,100
...even after her death can turn
all living creatures into stone...

45
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,000
-...what about the blood?
-Deadly and poisonous.

46
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,300
But you have touched the eye.
As it has the power to give sight...

47
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,300
...so it can make your red cloak
proof against the blood.

48
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,100
The eye is all powerful. We can
tell you no more. Give us the eye.

49
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,100
-You have told me the truth?
-We swear it.

50
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,100
-The rest is for you. Seek Medusa.
-On the lsle of the Dead.

51
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,700
-At the very edge of the underworld.
-Give us back the eye!

52
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,900
-Give us the eye! We must have it!
-Here, catch.

53
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,900
-Where is it? l want it!
-lt's my turn!

54
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,000
Where'd it go?
Give it to me!

55
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,500
One of you has it!

56
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,500
The sands of time
run like quicksilver.

57
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,100
We'll be across these mountains
tomorrow, near the lsle of the Dead.

58
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
And then, Medusa.

59
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,100
l wrote a play about her long ago.

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,100
l was partial to tragedy in my youth.

61
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,300
Before experience taught me
that life is quite tragic enough...

62
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,800
-...without my writing about it.
-Medusa.

63
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,200
-She was priestess to Aphrodite.
-Yes, and a most beautiful woman...

64
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
...by all accounts.

65
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,000
She was seduced by Poseidon. They made
love in the temple of Aphrodite.

66
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,700
And that goddess was so jealous
that she punished Medusa.

67
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,800
She transformed her into
an apparition so horrible...

68
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,200
...that one look from her
will turn any living creature...

69
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,100
...into stone.

70
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,500
l'm so afraid for you.

71
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
lt must be done.
We've no other choice.

72
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,100
-Tomorrow you return to the city.
-No, l'm coming with you.

73
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,000
Then sleep now. We ride at dawn.

74
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,800
So little time together.
So little time.

75
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Sleep now. Sleep.

76
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,400
The river Styx.

77
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
The River of Death...

78
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,900
...has strange powers.

79
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,500
So l've heard.

80
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Time to see if the legend is true.

81
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,600
Here. You'll need this.

82
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,300
For Charon. The ferryman.

83
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,000
Remember, one look from her
is enough.

84
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,100
lf you must see her, use the inside
of your shield as a mirror.

85
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,600
Her reflection cannot harm you.

86
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,900
Never look her in the face.

87
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,100
Remember, now it's three against one.

88
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Guard well the shield.

89
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,700
For one day, it will guard your life.

90
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:51,200
Find and fulfill your destiny.

91
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,700
Thallo!

92
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,200
Hello, my wet friend.

93
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,200
No.

94
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,600
No, our task is not complete.

95
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,100
lf you can fly....

96
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
Good.

97
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,200
And if he's still alive...

98
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,500
...you must try to find Pegasus.

99
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,000
Great Zeus, below on Earth
it is now the eve...

100
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,700
...of the longest day.

101
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,400
Very well.

102
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,500
Release the lKraken.

103
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,400
Perseus has won.

104
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,200
My son...

105
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,300
...has triumphed.

106
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,700
-A fortunate young man.
-Fortune is ally to the brave.

107
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,200
What a dangerous precedent.

108
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,900
What if there are more
heroes like him?

109
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,000
What if courage and imagination
became everyday mortal qualities?

110
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,400
We would no longer be needed.

111
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,300
But for now, there is sufficient
cowardice, sloth...

112
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,700
...and mendacity down there on Earth
to last forever.

113
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,300
l forbid any revenge
against Perseus.

114
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,300
He has done well.

115
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
He will be rewarded.

116
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,800
This will make a fine heroic poem,
you know.

117
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,500
Or perhaps a play.

118
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Oh, don't worry.
l won't leave you out.

119
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Perseus and Andromeda
will be happy together.

120
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,200
Have fine sons...

121
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,100
...rule wisely...

122
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,100
...and to perpetuate his legend...

123
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,100
...I command that from henceforth...

124
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,800
...he will be set among the stars
and constellations.

125
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
He, Perseus, the lovely Andromeda...

126
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,300
...the noble Pegasus
and even the vain Cassiopeia.

127
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,900
Let the stars be named
after them forever.

128
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,300
As long as man shall walk the Earth
and search the night sky in wonder...

129
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,300
...they will remember the courage
of Perseus...

130
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,400
...forever.

131
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:50,300
Even if we, the gods,
are abandoned or forgotten...

132
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,600
...the stars will never fade.

133
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,600
Never.

134
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,200
They will burn till the end of time.

135
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:12,200
