00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:56,673
Grendel

2
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,245
Pappie!

3
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,637
Yahhhhh!!! Yahhhhhh!

4
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:42,559
Ahhhh! Owwee.

5
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:52,095
Aohhhhheeweee!

6
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,866
Yoeyeo!

7
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,711
Yahhhheeoooooooooweewaaaa!

8
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:21,957
Let this great horn tell the world
no man stands above the Danes.

9
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,132
All we look up on is ours.

10
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:31,866
Hrothgar much loved king of the Danes.

11
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:38,449
Under Odirs eye I blood you lucky
on all parts that leave this hall.

12
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:47,454
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

13
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:53,031
Blahhhhhhhhhehhhhhhahhhhh!

14
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:59,994
Ahhhhhh! Blehhahhhhh!

15
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,986
May all those who cross
these steps find a happy heart.

16
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,888
Yay!

17
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,490
Olaf!

18
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,812
Olaf! Pal!

19
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,135
Where were you when all this happened?

20
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:13,566
Asleep.

21
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,309
I'd had some beers.

22
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,311
What fucking thing would dare...

23
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,709
G'day

24
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,414
G'Day.

25
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,456
I'd love much to know man, whereabouts?

26
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,230
Fish beach.

27
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,094
Likely I'm the only one
who names it that.

28
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,400
Where I get fish.

29
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,499
I'm Beowulf

30
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,632
Beowulf?

31
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,681
Yea Beowulf the what?
Heh? The eel meal?

32
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,817
You've never had another?
Wash up like myself?

33
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,926
In the name of Breca? Ahhh.

34
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,589
We were out hunting walrus
a couple of days ago...

35
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,597
when a storm came up and ate our boat.

36
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,596
So this is just you coming in now?

37
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:03,733
Yeah

38
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:09,742
You've ever swum in the open sea?

39
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,848
I leave that to my boat.

40
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,477
Ahh. I'd like to think you'd botter me.

41
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,486
I can't see much life in that.
Do you do this a lot?

42
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,660
I take what comes.

43
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:27,731
Good then you'll have no qualms
if supper tastes like you.

44
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,200
Eat, be yourself.

45
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:43,070
So, what's it like being a hero?

46
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:48,644
Qualling things with axes and,
and that sword of yours. And what.

47
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,886
Kinda bloody madness. Heh

48
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,649
In truth I don't get all that mad.

49
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,416
So, ahhh hahh-hhhah,
A hero ahhh, A hero for supper.

50
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,180
Don't my shit shine.
Hah, hahhhh, hahhh

51
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,856
I'm in your debt

52
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:35,430
I'm in the fishes.
All these days have come for theirs.

53
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,305
The winds were kind.

54
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:55,113
No storm waylaid Sawthwood
from his hard walk home.

55
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,885
None in Geatland held so strong the love
of kin as Beowulf.

56
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,754
But coming home he heard the tale.

57
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,423
Friends to the west
slept with slaughter.

58
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,659
...from death upon the Danes.

59
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:16,533
Great Beowulf alone had best it bares
thought fearless in their mood

60
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,111
for men but now he brought a half score

61
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,238
or more Geat swords
to swing against this thing.

62
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,816
Let's hear the names

63
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,477
Breca the loud.

64
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,282
HahhhAhhhh

65
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,118
Right from the seas.

66
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,221
Lost no son in hoisting sword.

67
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,329
Hoisting swords?

68
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,556
He couldn't hoist his own sail.

69
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,798
The huncho. Queller of puffins

70
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,699
Hahhh.

71
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,530
...and beer.

72
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,604
Shook his shields to shake the world.

73
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,769
No. Just on that scum troll's head.

74
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,174
Beowulf.

75
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:13,522
Well as we've done these last few years
this sail holds grim bliss for me.

76
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,729
A thing that takes two hundred
in arms is no small thing.

77
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,374
But I will see Valhalla
or that thing's head on a pole.

78
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,741
Aye, aye, aye

79
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,683
So that Danes might say Geats don't
wield words where swords speak truer.

80
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,050
Ayyye. Yea.

81
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:48,089
Great as our own shield king Is,
there is another nearest kin to me.

82
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:55,736
None bleed for a better king
than Hrothgar I'd die happy.

83
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,364
Loved as he.

84
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,808
But we live happy even now.

85
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:11,545
So, Beowulf goes at dawn to the Danes
all you who go along, keep us proud.

86
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,387
Yeahhh!

87
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,855
And if you can find Hondscioh
a wife our sheep have had enough.

88
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,415
Troll!!!!!!!!!

89
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,303
Trollllllllll!

90
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:13,935
Trollll!!!!!! I call you out!!!!

91
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,176
Trolll!!!!

92
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,592
Trollllllllllllllll!!!!!!!

93
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:38,861
Meet me the like if you dare!
Or fight me in hell. You hairy creep.

94
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,172
Creep. Creep!

95
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,340
Ahhhmmm.

96
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,210
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

97
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,564
Are you wounded?

98
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,233
The thing wouldn't fight.
It spared me to witness this.

99
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,829
Then get up off your arse
with your Thanes insight.

100
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,203
This is no ground for a game.

101
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,574
Ahh, you're wrong where a king
who has had his balls hauled up

102
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,738
his guts it is the ground.

103
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,053
All the broken bone wretches
I've flung to death.

104
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,745
And to Valhalla.

105
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,888
I don't know.

106
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,994
Is that the look of
a man going happily up to the feast?

107
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,824
Or down to the worms?

108
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,162
You talk like a mad man.

109
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,101
No!
Just like the Danish king of daylight

110
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,707
Get up now or do we bury you here?

111
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,275
Is that your wish?

112
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:34,415
With your thanes in sight?

113
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,952
Whose wife would you have me be?

114
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:10,479
A burly sword of Christ to cleave you
thus, and thus and thus!

115
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,507
That's one shiny sword.

116
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,851
I'm told you're the Dane's king.

117
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,811
Connaught wishes you well

118
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,822
Celt, you're a ways from home

119
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:53,522
I am but safe with the sword of Christ.
Father Brendan.

120
00:23:53,832 --> 00:24:00,795
Christ. I heard of him.
You ever have much luck with trolls?

121
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,567
I'm of the thought
they've never crossed paths,

122
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,408
but if you're willing to bow
before Christ you shall feel

123
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,775
the blessing of his great strength.

124
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,314
My gods don't ask me to bow.

125
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,419
And nor should they dare
if they won't protect ye.

126
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:20,823
To fear god's fools is an honor.
I've come to drive this evil out.

127
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,019
With your stick?

128
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,924
With the fire of heaven!

129
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,829
Well if your heavers on fire
you'd better look to that.

130
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,895
You leave me
on a dish for the troll then.

131
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,468
Leave me.
And if I don't see mars stone.

132
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,870
I shall see god's! I shall see god!

133
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,240
Ahhh!

134
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,595
Selma, should I fear for my husband?

135
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,663
You've got nothing better to do?

136
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:14,040
Sweet don't play the bitch with me.
I don't ask much and I don't ask often.

137
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,943
No one dares dirty your name around me.

138
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,279
Nor yours around me.

139
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,429
Hrothgar dies happy, in his sleep.

140
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,965
That's a lift.

141
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:47,972
Selma, I could find
a place for you inside.

142
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,980
We chose our beds along time back.

143
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,039
Men!

144
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,976
Hold there!

145
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,981
As you wish.

146
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,550
Is this land Dane?

147
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,590
It is and you're not.

148
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:38,761
So unless you're ready for a shower
of arrows you tell who you are!

149
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,833
Two blows from this
and fifty men will be on this beach

150
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,868
before your next breath.

151
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,834
Fifty birds maybe.

152
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,308
Is that then your word?

153
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,908
I'm Beowulf.

154
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,578
Beowulf the Geat?

155
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,008
Ahh, here we go.

156
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,346
We come as friends for Hrothgar.

157
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,194
Well we welcome friends.

158
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,830
Bring what you need.

159
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,832
I'll have men look to your ship.

160
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,895
Welcome to Daneland

161
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:07,445
By Thor they have the spark of cows.

162
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,727
Who's that?

163
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,231
Selma, a witch.

164
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,700
The happy would keep
a boat length from her

165
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,199
Happiness isn't everything.

166
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,272
She sees people's deaths.

167
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,988
That is one beer hall.

168
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,527
If you like to drink with the ghosts.

169
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,098
Beowulf!

170
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:05,238
Oh my little Beowulf,
nobody tells me anything.

171
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,446
I somehow think of you as smaller

172
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,678
I was eight when I left.

173
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,882
Ahh you've grown. Ahh.

174
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,392
I'm sorry we didn't mean to wake you.

175
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,088
Wake me.

176
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,734
I'm a grief crippled king half drunk
in the middle of the afternoon,

177
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,497
what's there to wake?

178
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,807
By the gods it's good to see you.

179
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:43,213
Hahh, hahh!

180
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,943
Hah! Hah!

181
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,281
You think you need a beer?

182
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,222
-Ah, ya.
-Aye.

183
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,591
If Geat were seeking a wife,

184
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,418
this room would hold better
up than most.

185
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,297
So many.

186
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,592
Widows.

187
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,596
Widows far too early.

188
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,108
Ho, ho.

189
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,259
Ah...

190
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,326
With my King I welcome you all.

191
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,604
We can never forget this gift.

192
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:11,991
Hahh. Nannnnannnannnannnnanaaaan

193
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,761
From this night on
the only working flesh

194
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,859
this troll feasts on will be it's own.

195
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,131
Yae!

196
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,810
With the morning,
your curse will be less than a shadow.

197
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,607
Yas!

198
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:34,148
Well maybe not less,

199
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:40,618
but I mean to hold in my hand
the head that by my sword

200
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:44,159
no more steers a dead troll body.

201
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,196
Yas!

202
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,994
We'll hoist the shield now

203
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:57,872
Drive that hunger back down it's mouth.
Await, can chew on it's tongue.

204
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,474
It can chew on it's own stinking stone
of a heart,

205
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,273
...but no more Danes.

206
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,478
We mean to put an end to this fiend.

207
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,282
Yas!

208
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,651
As other's vowed

209
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,019
Unferth!

210
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,952
By you will dear Queen.

211
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,994
We're wiser in knowing the hearts of
those who tangled with that thing.

212
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,102
Those are dead.

213
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:36,969
I don't brag of wrestling with it.
Nor of Being able to kill it.

214
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:42,379
The troll broke down these doors with
twenty Danish warriors sleeping inside.

215
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,516
What gives thirteen Geats better hope?

216
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,729
We won't be sleeping.

217
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,591
Unferth!

218
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,696
Sit!

219
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,503
Or see your guts in a dish.

220
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:22,888
Now before the dark will sharpen us -
play, drink.

221
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,156
No.

222
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,376
Since it began we'll have Swedes,

223
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:44,003
Saxons even Sloths even coming
to see how weak we were.

224
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:52,189
Ya I know, I look like walrus shit.

225
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,651
Comes from fighting things you can't.

226
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,125
All bad dreams end.

227
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,096
We'll see you in the morning
for herring and egg.

228
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,595
Herring and egg?

229
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,298
Now, if there's anything
you need to tell me about it,

230
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,840
now would be the time.

231
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:20,681
I'll stay here. Amongst you.

232
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:29,149
We'll bring you the head -
throw it in with the herring and egg.

233
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,558
MMMMMMMMmmmm

234
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,256
Ahhhh, hahhahahhhaa

235
00:37:54,438 --> 00:38:00,775
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

236
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,578
Priest.

237
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,149
Where did you spend the night?

238
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,758
Why was such a dark wretch spared?

239
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,416
That's not what he asked.

240
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,022
Wise king.
You must know of the name of Clovis

241
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:30,690
The Frank?

242
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,326
The Frank, yes, yes, the Frank.

243
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,466
The Christian Sword over land ten times
what the Danes hold dear.

244
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,405
He's dead.

245
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,737
Yes, ten years now.

246
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,278
...but not before he saw God's grace.

247
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:48,148
The Visigoths of Aquitaine, the Romans
and the Syagrius, Burgundians,

248
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,312
Alamans all fell before him
and all because he had God's ear.

249
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,084
As I recall yours had a thousand swords.

250
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,060
Neighbors offered wine and pork
and no eyes at his ribs.

251
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,754
And no fucking trolls!

252
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,798
And no fucking trolls!

253
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:08,529
My skinny hand can only bless,
but trust me.

254
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:15,611
This thing shall meet it's end
in striking me or those of mine.

255
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,751
Madness has it's wonders.

256
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,120
The Celt sat straight in
the path of the thing.

257
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,179
It was not touched.

258
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,718
The Celt held no sword.
Perhaps the thing hates weapons.

259
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,592
The old men were armed, true.

260
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,064
Others here in arms have been spared.

261
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,000
I have been waiting for Odin
to bring me my death.

262
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,573
He hasn't.

263
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,274
In his wisdom?

264
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,101
This is where the blood trails led.

265
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,367
I tell you,
this troll must be one tough prick.

266
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,680
Do this climb every night after supper?

267
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,439
Why don't you blow your horn now,

268
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,872
I wouldn't mind
those fifty bows bragged of.

269
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,005
I could bring the bows.
But the men are gone.

270
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,713
Thorfinn!

271
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,781
Are you alright?

272
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,953
-I'm fine.
-Good

273
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,534
A little high up for driftwood.

274
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,860
What are we fighting here?

275
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,369
A Thing beyond our ken.

276
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,606
Could spread out...
meet back here in a year?

277
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:53,560
We're out of our world.

278
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,682
Padre, santi...

279
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:57,419
Go in peace my son, go in peace.
Next!

280
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,777
I was off in a dream.

281
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:24,377
Wish I could bring a better one.

282
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,990
Baptism they call it.

283
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,674
Unferth feels that he's fallen
from the grace of the gods.

284
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,743
It's not every mars wish
to sit in blood.

285
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:59,181
If this Christ can stiffen
Unferth's heart, what's the harm?

286
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,653
They swim only out of fear.

287
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:07,860
But still... they swim.

288
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:53,832
Dusk soon, eh.

289
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,577
You a herd dog?

290
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,940
I've been called worse.

291
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,482
I'm Beowulf...

292
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,146
Yes. The much-told hero from Geatland.

293
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,924
So who are your people?

294
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:19,429
None. I came here in my teens.

295
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,198
A whore to Unferth's uncle,
Alvis Three-Legs.

296
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,800
So you're not then Dane?

297
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,641
Oh I am.
My family was killed by Wulfing raiders.

298
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,511
Ah, my father too...
not killed, but...

299
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,186
I mean, but a feud
with the Wulfings brought us here.

300
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,223
I guess you werert made a whore.

301
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,924
I'm told you know of things to come.

302
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,827
Hmm, that's a wide sea.

303
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,728
Of deaths of things.

304
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,526
Seeing that everything living dies
you still give me the sight of gods.

305
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:59,267
Speak clean. You wonder of yourself.

306
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,741
More of the troll.

307
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,576
Not of yourself?

308
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,981
In some things I'd rather be blind.

309
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,846
You're worse than Loki
with your sheepshit twining.

310
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,550
The death of the troll will cost dear
both the Geats and the Danes...

311
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,452
as it bloody well should.

312
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:17,992
Why as it should?

313
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:23,122
The Danes have done their doom on him.
And you come here to kill.

314
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,957
Day's going down.

315
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:26,931
If we want to be ready...

316
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,235
Careful with what you don't understand.

317
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,567
Has this thing,
this troll killed any children...

318
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,200
-No.
-women?

319
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,609
Old men?

320
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:13,774
What are you saying?
It fights with a clean heart?

321
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:18,783
It kills the strongest first.
It shows us and kills the strongest.

322
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,787
Who cares if he spares the children?

323
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,154
They'll die anyways
without their fathers.

324
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,062
My wits still war
with how this all began

325
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:34,332
It came for the mead hall...
I can only guess.

326
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,531
The night we finished it,
before creep came,

327
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,577
we hadrt seen a troll in
fifteen twenty years.

328
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,543
So nothing was done to the troll itself?

329
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,239
Oh Beowulf!

330
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,283
It's a fucking troll!

331
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,919
Maybe someone looked at it
the wrong way!

332
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,422
Some Dane?

333
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,520
Who hands you this? Selma?

334
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:03,825
Come on.

335
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,265
She's been out in the wilds too long.

336
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:10,796
Her head is full of spiders,
her lap is full of moss.

337
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,135
It's said she sees things.

338
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,541
Well the crazy do see things.

339
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,615
I never begged anyone to come here
and take on our fight.

340
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,611
I don't hold you here...

341
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:23,744
I know you don't.

342
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,479
Then don't saddle my heart
with the talk of

343
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,955
why a fucking troll does
what fucking troll does.

344
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,885
Ahhhhh!!!!!

345
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,960
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!

346
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:06,790
Watch the sides!

347
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,272
Cone on crab slime,

348
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,043
show me these teeth.

349
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,424
O'er the night, the warriors waited,
sword and shield in ring wrapped grasp.

350
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:14,360
Then the fiend of bog and brine reached
those doors of ten mers weight,

351
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:21,233
...bade it creak by breath alone.
But then smelt God amongst the men.

352
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,999
Hardly had they hoisted steel,
this thing's rank guts gave out.

353
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,508
Great Beowulf, God's awful arm...

354
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:38,508
