1
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,583
It's time.

2
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,041
Hey there...

3
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,791
...good morning. How are you today?

4
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,375
Hey. What are you doing up?

5
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,500
Moo.

6
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,583
Is that Daddy?

7
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,541
Hey there, cowgirl.

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
She's a little feisty today.

9
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,000
Babies should be sleeping.

10
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:50,666
"I'm too hungry for my own good."
Yes.

11
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:55,750
I gotta get ready.

12
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,166
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

13
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,500
You know how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.

14
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,500
All right! Jesus.

15
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,500
-She go back to sleep?
-Yes. Ate like a pig.

16
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:18,833
I know I'm lucky. I ace this job,
the department's wide open.

17
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:23,416
Get my own division someday.
You should see their houses.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,375
Hello?

19
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,875
Well, yes.

20
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,250
Don't worry, I will.

21
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,250
He's right here.
It's Alonzo.

22
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,833
-Hello.
-Hoyt?

23
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,041
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,833
-Going to roll call?
-I'm leaving now.

25
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,083
-Hoyt?
-Yes, sir?

26
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,708
-Fairies go to roll call. We don't.
-Good to know.

27
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,958
There's a coffee shop on 7th.
Be there at 10.

28
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,541
Be in comfortable shoes.
Got a backup gun?

29
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,416
-Only the standard issue Beretta.
-Bring it. Cuffs too.

30
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,958
Maybe we'll do some business.
We 're aggressive.

31
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:16,625
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for this--

32
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
What's wrong?

33
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,500
Feels like football tryouts.

34
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,500
I wish it was tomorrow
so I'd know if I made the squad.

35
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:38,375
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,166
-I know it's gonna work out.
-You do?

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,958
Good morning, sir.

38
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,458
No, thank you, ma'am.

39
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,000
Get some chow in you.
My dollar.

40
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,416
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

41
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,791
Fine. Don't.

42
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,791
It's nice here.

43
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,125
May I read?

44
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,916
-I'm sorry, sir. I--
-Thank you.

45
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,375
-I'll get something to eat.
-Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

46
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,083
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

47
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,375
I'll like not being in a hot
black and white all summer.

48
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,291
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

49
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,041
-Like my story?
-Not your story, a story.

50
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,583
Since you can't shut up
so I can read, tell me a story.

51
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,958
-I don't know any.
-You don't?

52
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,583
-No.
-I'll tell you one.

53
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,958
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90 percent bullshit.

54
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,541
But it's entertaining. So I read it.

55
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,291
It entertains me. You won't let me
read it, so you entertain me.

56
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,458
Tell me a story now. Go.

57
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:37,875
-There was a DUI stop.
-A DUI stop?

58
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
Let me load up!

59
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,666
-A DUl? Oh, shit!
-Well, l--

60
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,833
-Listen, we were on midwatch--
-We who?

61
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,833
-Oh, me and Debbie.
-Who's Debbie?

62
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,083
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

63
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,375
-A female training officer?
-Yes, sir.

64
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,625
Okay. All right.

65
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,458
Was she black, white?

66
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,958
She was white.

67
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,250
-Lick-her license?
-A what?

68
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,666
A lick-her license.
Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

69
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,041
-Is she any good?
-She's pretty good.

70
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,541
-Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go.
-Right.

71
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,750
-It was a quiet night--
-Boom!

72
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,708
-What the fuck?
-You never know, that's the point. Go.

73
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,333
It was quiet and we're rolling...

74
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,958
...l'm driving. This Acura,
just a beautiful car...

75
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,666
...comes out a side street, all over
the median. I hit the wailer.

76
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,000
He drives for 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

77
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,958
Plates run clean,
so I test and arrest.

78
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,333
I'm belting in our unit,
and she's tossing his car.

79
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,083
She shows me a .38
and two loaded shotguns.

80
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,666
-No shit?
-No shit! So...

81
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,583
...she calls and I'm searching.
I find 500 grams of meth.

82
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,541
Turns out he's on bail
for distribution...

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,291
...on his way to smoke
his ex-partner before trial.

84
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,458
Boom.

85
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,083
-Prevented a murder.
-You got him. It's amazing.

86
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,125
It is. That you're out there...

87
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:12,291
...with a fine bitch for a year and
the best story you can tell me...

88
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,125
...is a drunk stop.

89
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:21,541
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

90
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:26,208
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

91
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,250
In the back, bam! Code X.

92
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,083
-I got a wife.
-You got a dick.

93
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,791
-You do have one, don't you?
-Yes.

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,291
Your dick lines up straight.
Right and left of it are pockets.

95
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one. Pay the bill.

96
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,208
Grab that menu off that window for me.

97
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,583
Get in, it's unlocked.

98
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:11,208
Throw that in the glove box.

99
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,125
-This is not from the motor pool.
-No. Sexy, though, huh?

100
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:20,250
-Where's the office, at division?
-You're in the office.

101
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,958
Going up.

102
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,708
Today is a training day.

103
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,958
Give you a taste of the business.

104
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,583
I got 38 cases pending trial...

105
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,916
...63 active investigations,
250 I can't clear.

106
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,208
I supervise five officers.
Five personalities.

107
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,000
Five sets of problems.
You could be six.

108
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,500
I ain't holding no hands.

109
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,500
You got today to show me
what you're made of.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,625
You don't like Narcotics,
get the fuck out of my car...

111
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,875
...get a job chasing bad checks.
You hear me?

112
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,500
-I hear you.
-Okay.

113
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,000
Why do you want to be a narc?

114
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,500
To serve my community by ridding
it of dangerous drugs.

115
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,500
Right, but why a narc?

116
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,458
I want to make detective.

117
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,500
Stick with me, you can do it.

118
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,000
Unlearn that academy shit.

119
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,958
Don't bring that here.
It'll get you killed.

120
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,416
I'll do anything you want me to do.

121
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,958
My nigger.

122
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,750
Roll your window down. Start there.

123
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,333
-Got to hear it, smell it, taste it.
-Right.

124
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,666
How's your Espanol?.

125
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,333
Learn that shit.

126
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,666
That will get you killed.

127
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,833
They plot all kinds of shit
behind your back.

128
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:12,291
You gonna teach me that
old-school Rodney IKing shit?

129
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,083
We don't roll like that no more.

130
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,500
Now we use this.

131
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,750
These niggers are too strong.

132
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,083
-Think I'm crazy?
-I don't know what to think.

133
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

134
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,583
Good.

135
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,083
Good.

136
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,041
Been married long?

137
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,916
-About a year.
-Yeah?

138
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,833
-You got a kid?
-A girl, 9 months.

139
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,541
I got four. Boys.

140
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,000
You need a son,
I'll hook your lady up. Can't miss.

141
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,166
Can we not talk
about my family, all right?

142
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,291
I respect that.

143
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,666
I'm married, I got my queen too.

144
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,250
I remember having a young bride.

145
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,583
You probably fuck her face-to-face,
don't you?

146
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,375
Let's not talk about her.

147
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:15,208
That's my point. You're so in love,
it's coming right out.

148
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,208
The day you bring
that here is the day...

149
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,958
...you don't make it back.
Hide it deep inside of you.

150
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,458
The maggots out here
will find it...

151
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,208
...use it against you
and chew you up.

152
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,541
Never wear the ring to work.

153
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,041
-I'm serious about that.
-Thanks.

154
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,791
What's here?

155
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,166
Transactions.

156
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,875
You see that guy trying to act
like he's not slanging dope?

157
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:17,000
-Yeah.
-That's my boy.

158
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,583
That's my boy, Neto.

159
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,000
Only 1 7, but he can kill.

160
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,666
-Works for me.
-He's an informer?

161
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,916
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

162
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,083
He gets to make some cash.
Lets me know when big things happen.

163
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,083
Big transactions.

164
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,750
-You trust him?
-Damn right I do.

165
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,208
Sprung his mom from INS detention.
Here we go. Watch this.

166
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:50,666
That's right. Come on down.

167
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,958
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

168
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,750
That's right.

169
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,291
-See the hand-to-hand?
-I saw it.

170
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,541
-When was your last felony stop?
-Two weeks ago.

171
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,875
You need practice.

172
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,250
-College kids.
-They'll get an education today.

173
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,416
I want them grabbing glass.
You take the back.

174
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,291
Stay off of the Rover.

175
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,875
Let's go.

176
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,916
-You little fuckers.
-Run, baby, run.

177
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,041
Police! Let's see your hands!

178
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,916
Put them up! Put them up!

179
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,500
Put your hands on the windshield!

180
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:47,166
-Put your hands on the glass.
-Driver, put it in park!

181
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:51,375
-It's a stick shift!
-Throw the keys out the window!

182
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,750
Put your hands on your chest!

183
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,750
All right, fork it over.

184
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,083
-What?
-You know.

185
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,791
The marijuana. Give it to me!

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,083
-Give it!
-Okay! Sorry, sir.

187
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:08,833
-Shut up! Give me that pipe.
-My mom gave me that pipe.

188
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:13,250
She can pick it up in jail.
Give me the cigarettes too.

189
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,625
-Control your suspect!
-Palms on the glass!

190
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:21,708
Move the hands, I'll slap you!
Face against the glass! Right there!

191
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,708
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

192
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,583
-Yeah!
-Then don't come down here.

193
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:34,375
I see you down here again,
I'll make you walk home.

194
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,500
I'll let the homeboys run
a train on her. IKnow what that is?

195
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:40,875
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:45,500
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for your cooperation.

197
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,083
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

198
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,916
Shit!

199
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,708
I like that shit.

200
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,875
I like how you move.
You were trained well.

201
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:11,833
Check that out. It's a bad dime.
See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

202
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,916
You see how immature it is.

203
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,458
That's classic Mexican garbage.

204
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,458
Let me see. It's old.
Probably last year's.

205
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,208
To be truly effective...

206
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:26,291
...a good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

207
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,041
A good narcotics agent should have...

208
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,291
...narcotics in his blood.

209
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,416
-What, you gonna smoke that?
-No, you are.

210
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,083
-Hell if I am!
-Yes.

211
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,958
-You're not?
-No.

212
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,708
-Why? You a Mormon?
-I'm not losing my job.

213
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,125
This is your job.

214
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,750
-Smoke it.
-No.

215
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,916
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

216
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:53,791
Listen, I became a cop
to stop people from using--

217
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,333
-That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.
-No, man.

218
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,458
-Jesus Christ!
-Yeah, right.

219
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,333
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

220
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,958
Turn shit down out here,
and your wife gets a flag.

221
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,541
What's wrong with you?

222
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,291
You know what?

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,375
I don't want you in my unit.
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

224
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,333
Poo butt-ass.

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,458
-What's the holdup?
-Move it!

226
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,041
Give me that thing.

227
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,875
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

228
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,000
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

229
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:54,875
Virgin lungs. Man up now.
Man up, nigger. Man up.

230
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,416
Go ahead. Get it.

231
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,958
-Come on!
-Shut the fuck up and just wait!

232
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,791
-Man the fuck up! Finish that shit!
-Geronimo.

233
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,625
Let's go, nigger. Let's go.

234
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,958
Oh, shit!

235
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,208
You okay, kid?

236
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:27,000
That's a man size hit you took.
When's the last time you smoked weed?

237
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
The last-- Twelfth grade.

238
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,458
We were....

239
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,125
-Well, we were....
-Smoking weed.

240
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,750
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

241
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,875
Left that out of your service jacket.

242
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,166
I know you got secrets.
Everybody got secrets.

243
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,291
-Didn't know you liked it wet, though.
-What's wet?

244
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,416
Butt-naked. Ill. Sherm. Dust.

245
00:18:55,583 --> 00:19:00,166
PCP. Primos. P-dog.

246
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,375
That's what you had.

247
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,916
You couldn't taste it?

248
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:10,333
-I never done it.
-I haven't, but you have now.

249
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,916
Shit!

250
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,416
Shit. I'll get piss-tested,
and I'll get fired.

251
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,458
The boss has our back.
We know before we piss.

252
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,916
-Shit!
-Boom!

253
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,500
Why did you do this?

254
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,333
You're an adult.
Nobody made you smoke.

255
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,458
You made a decision. Live with it.

256
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,291
Not like I put a gun to your head.

257
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,208
Man....

258
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:03,750
-Oh, man, shit.
-Come on, get your shit together now.

259
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,291
This is my dog's house.

260
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,666
We'll see what he thinks of you.

261
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,833
-Get your ass in here!
-Roger, what's up?

262
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,500
-How are they treating you?
-All right.

263
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,500
-I didn't wake you up?
-I never sleep.

264
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,708
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

265
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,458
Come on. Get in here.

266
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,083
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here!

267
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:38,541
-What you drinking?
-The best.

268
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,500
The best, I know. Best for the best.

269
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,583
I heard about Vegas.
Got a green light on your ass.

270
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,250
No problem.

271
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,833
Russians want you. I got your back.

272
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,166
I know that. Thank you.

273
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:57,791
Here. Get that medicine up in you.

274
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,958
-Back to the world.
-Back to the world.

275
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,875
Went and got yourself
a daisy-fresh rookie.

276
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,791
He's high as a motherfucker.
What did you give him?

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,500
-A little of Mexico's finest.
-Yeah.

278
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,708
Garbage.

279
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,916
-Where'd you grow up?
-North Hollywood.

280
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,041
-What's your last name?
-Hoyt.

281
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,166
Hoyt. Hoyt....

282
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,291
-Strong safety, North Hollywood High.
-Right.

283
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,708
-How'd you know that?
-How did you?

284
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,791
-I follow all the good players.
-No doubt.

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,541
Excuse me. Shit.

286
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,041
-Strong safety, huh?
-It's me. What's up?

287
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:03,250
I can't do anything.
Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

288
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,333
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

289
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:13,833
Man walks out of his house,
sees this snail lying on his porch.

290
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,750
So he picks it up,
chucks it into the backyard.

291
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:22,208
Snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up all to shit...

292
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,083
...lands in the grass.

293
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:27,458
Snail lies there dying.

294
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:30,458
But...

295
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,750
...snail doesn't die.
Soon it can crawl again.

296
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
And one day...

297
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:41,375
...snail heads back
to the front of the house.

298
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:45,458
Finally, after about a year...

299
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,583
...the little guy crawls
back on the porch.

300
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:51,791
Right then the man walks
out of his house...

301
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,083
...sees this snail again.

302
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,708
So he looks at it...

303
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,708
...and he says:

304
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
"The fuck's your problem?"

305
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,125
That's not funny.

306
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,458
What you laughing for then?

307
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,958
-I don't know, man. I--
-Hey!

308
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,666
Figure that joke out,
you'll figure the streets out.

309
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,958
Nothing to figure out.
It's senseless bullshit.

310
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:28,416
-You know-- I already figured it out.
-Really?

311
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,041
-Yeah.
-You already figured the streets out?

312
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,916
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

313
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,458
-Put the drink down. What is that?
-Hold on!

314
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,250
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

315
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,833
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries. I hear you.

316
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:49,291
Yeah, you gotta control
your smiles and cries...

317
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,500
...because that's all you have,
and nobody can take that away.

318
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,625
Oh, shit.

319
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:07,250
What you think, dog? Think this
greenhorn can handle undercover?

320
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:12,916
You were just like him.
Same silly-ass look and everything.

321
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,916
Saving the goddamn world.

322
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:19,416
Now that's some smiles
and cries for your ass!

323
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,208
-That was you.
-Shit lasted a week.

324
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,291
Gotta get back to it.

325
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,166
Thanks for the snort.

326
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:27,750
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

327
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,000
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

328
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,083
Stay home. Save some cheddar.

329
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:37,000
My dream's less than a year away.
Philippine lslands, here I come.

330
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,166
-Let me go too.
-You're invited.

331
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:59,208
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

332
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,375
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

333
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Who are you?

334
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,416
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

335
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,541
-I'm a cop. Watch out!
-Don't shoot nobody.

336
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,166
Get that beer in you for ballast.

337
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,916
-No, man.
-Get it in you. You'll feel better.

338
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,875
Stop the car!

339
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,000
Stop the car! I saw something!

340
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:49,583
-Just relax.
-Stop!

341
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,583
All right! Hold the fuck on-- Hey!

342
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,166
Fuck me, man! Shit.

343
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,166
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

344
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:09,125
-I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
-Get the--

345
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,958
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

346
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,666
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

347
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,541
Fucking ass prick!

348
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,166
My nigger!

349
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:01,125
Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

350
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:05,250
-Thanks for the help.
-You should've shot them.

351
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,666
What's happening?

352
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,166
-You're dead!
-Okay! Wait! Hold it!

353
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,250
-You too, white boy!
-Okay....

354
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:14,500
-My cousins will blast you fools!
-Calm down.

355
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,958
-Calm down. You okay?
-No, I'm not!

356
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,125
-Look at my nose!
-I see it.

357
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,958
Put ice on it. You'll be fine.
What're you doing here?

358
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:25,541
-I was just--
-They probably got AIDS.

359
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,291
Why you not at school?

360
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,625
I was going to a ditch party and--

361
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:32,250
You almost became the ditch party.

362
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,958
-Where your cousins from?
-Hillside Trece!

363
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,708
-Remember that!
-Tell your cousins to get your back.

364
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,083
Grab your bag and go home now.

365
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,500
-No! I need a statement--
-Don't need no statement.

366
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:47,708
-They'll fuck you up.
-We gonna let them go?

367
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,250
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

368
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:54,291
I got a punching bag at home.
They should be off the streets.

369
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:56,083
You hear that?

370
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,875
-Wanna go home or to jail?
-What you think?

371
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:04,750
Got room at the booty house.
You been there?

372
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,208
-You'll grab your ankles.
-Suck my dick!

373
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:12,291
-I know people.
-That's how it starts.

374
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,666
What about you? What you got?

375
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,416
-Got nothing?
-No.

376
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,916
-You sure?
-Yeah.

377
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:21,166
-Where's your horn?
-Got none.

378
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,791
You got money, though.

379
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,541
You lied to me!

380
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,708
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

381
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:37,416
Stand up, you. Stand the fuck up!

382
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,125
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

383
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,500
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

384
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,958
So you like raping girls?

385
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
-Like to rape girls?
-No, man.

386
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,750
-That's what you like?
-No....

387
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,250
That what you like? Don't lie.

388
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:11,791
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

389
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,583
Look at me.

390
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:18,500
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

391
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,791
Isn't that what you said?

392
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,208
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

393
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,708
You didn't say that?

394
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,375
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

395
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:32,666
-No, please!
-Where is it? I can't find it.

396
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,125
Pull your pants down.

397
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,750
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one.

398
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,750
Your choice. Just make a decision.

399
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:49,916
All right.
Put your hands on your head.

400
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:55,500
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

401
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,666
Lucky I got other business.

402
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:07,166
I'd cut your fucking dick off
and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

403
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:11,250
Damn! I'm thirsty.
I want a beer. What about you?

404
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:13,083
You want a beer?

405
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:19,291
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

406
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,000
Pussy-ass bitch!

407
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,875
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

408
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,416
You won't see shit coming!

409
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,958
I'll dent your mouth,
I'll crack your head open.

410
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,750
You fucking pig! Come on!

411
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,875
-That girl's 14.
-She all woman, though.

412
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:55,583
You tax that ass for days, man!
IKeep walking, bitch!

413
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,500
You want a beer?

414
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:12,333
-No, I don't want a beer, man.
-No? You mad?

415
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,125
Want to book that $60, huh?

416
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,916
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

417
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,500
Where the suspects? Go get them.

418
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,375
You let them go.

419
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,125
-I let them go?
-You did.

420
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,375
You want to run and gun,
stay in Patrol.

421
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:40,375
This is lnvestigations.

422
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,333
Garbage men handle garbage.

423
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,166
Professional anglers
go after the big fish.

424
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,750
Chasing them crackhead
motherfuckers....

425
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,500
-They'd have killed you.
-They belong in jail.

426
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,250
Why? They got beaten,
lost their money.

427
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,708
Hillside's éses will smoke them.
What more you want?

428
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,791
-I want justice.
-That's not justice?

429
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,916
-That's street justice.
-So?

430
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,375
-Let them kill each other?
-God willing.

431
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,833
Fuck them!
Everybody looking like them.

432
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,958
Reality is, the good guys...

433
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:11,250
...they die first.
The school kids and moms...

434
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,666
...family men, don't want to catch
any bullets.

435
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:18,333
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf.

436
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,291
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf,
understand?

437
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
What?

438
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,583
-Protect the sheep by killing wolves.
-I heard you.

439
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:28,500
-You didn't hear me.
-All right. Whatever.

440
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,375
Whatever the fuck-ever!

441
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:46,291
Do you ever lock anybody up?
You seem busy keeping people out.

442
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,125
You don't know shit!

443
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,583
Shit, they build jails because of me!

444
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:55,916
Judges gave over 1 5,000 man-years
of incarceration time...

445
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:59,500
...based on my cases.
My record speaks for itself.

446
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:01,541
How many felons have you got?

447
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,958
I rest my case.

448
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:15,208
-I'm not smoking crack, all right?
-I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

449
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:17,500
Put the $60 in there too.

450
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:21,833
That'll come in handy.
We'll use it like a credit card.

451
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,416
No matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

452
00:33:35,666 --> 00:33:39,458
Reminds me when I was
chasing down bad guys.

453
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:42,208
Pretty amazing shit you did
back there.

454
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,333
Thanks.

455
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:49,250
I noticed you applied that chokehold
though, huh?

456
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,000
That's a no-no procedure.

457
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,458
-I was getting my ass kicked.
-You did what you had to do.

458
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,208
You did what you had to do.

459
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,791
That's right.

460
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,500
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

461
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,291
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

462
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:18,125
No, I said a wolf,
not a rooster, a wolf.

463
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:25,291
-That's a rooster, give me a wolf!
-Give me a beer!

464
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:27,541
There you go! That's my nigga.

465
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,083
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

466
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,208
You have the magic eye.

467
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,333
You up your street IQ...

468
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,041
...you'll do some damage,
I guarantee.

469
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,041

-Bullshit.

628
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:43,500
She's screaming
about having us killed!

629
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:48,500
I'll be on the 6:00 news
in handcuffs because of you.

630
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:52,041
With the scandals,
it is open season on misconduct.

631
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,875
-They'll nail us to the wall.
-Pull over.

632
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,333
-Pull over.
-Here?

633
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,333
-Yeah, pull over.
-Shit!

634
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,041
What?

635
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,250
Listen.

636
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:25,625
You're in a privileged position
to learn.

637
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,833
IKeep your mouth shut, eyes open.

638
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:31,125
Want to do some good,
this is the place to learn.

639
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:35,333
You can't take it, maybe you
should go back to your division.

640
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,750
Get a nice job lighting flares
or measuring car wrecks.

641
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:43,750
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

642
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:46,291
...or a sheep.

643
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,041
Get your ink...

644
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,250
...or go give him a hand.

645
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:30,166
What are we doing here?
We'll get killed.

646
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:33,791
-You know about this place?
-It's the Jungle, right?

647
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
They say don't come with anything
less than a platoon.

648
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,458
This is the heart of it.

649
00:47:48,875 --> 00:47:50,791
Jungle. Damu headquarters.

650
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:53,458
Stoners.

651
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:56,375
A lot of murder investigations
lead here.

652
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:58,750
One way in, one way out.

653
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,416
Thought we were going to eat.

654
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,750
Don't ever come here without me.
I'm serious. For your safety.

655
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:14,166
-How'd you get a golden pass?
-I treat them fair.

656
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,791
They know if they cross the line,
I tax that ass.

657
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,500
What's that, up there?

658
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:36,583
They flipping pigeons
to signal I'm here.

659
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:05,250
-What's up, Bone?
-What's up?

660
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,208
-What's up?
-It's all good.

661
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:10,666
I appreciate what you did
for my nephew.

662
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,500
For sure. For sure.

663
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,125
You better call me.

664
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,708
I'm sick of it.
I can't stand him!

665
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:26,375
-Who are they?
-Nobody. I got them under my thumb.

666
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:30,500
-What's up, Alonzo?
-All right, Spider. What's happening?

667
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,958
Hey, what's up, girl? Look at you.
Go ahead.

668
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:36,375
All that jelly and no toast.

669
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,083
-Who lives here?
-Just one of my lovelies.

670
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,750
A loving touch, you know?
Don't worry.

671
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,041
New guy, Jake.

672
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:14,208
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my house.

673
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:17,791
-Give him some food. Take care of him.
-Of course.

674
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,125
-Of course. How are you?
-Good, good.

675
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:29,666
I have cable.
You watch whatever you want, okay?

676
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,500
-Thanks.
-This is your house.

677
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,500
I'll be right back.

678
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,958
-How you doing?
-Fine.

679
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:57,416
Now, this is all EI Salvadorian food.

680
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,416
Thank you. It looks great.

681
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,708
I have to go.

682
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,500
Yeah, all right.

683
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,458
Let's go.
We got a meeting in 1 5 minutes.

684
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:55,458
-I just need to--
-Forget it. Let's go.

685
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,041
I'll see you, buddy.

686
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,041
You okay?

687
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:05,041
Here, use this.

688
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,000
-Who's here?
-L.A.P.D.'s finest.

689
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:10,416
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

690
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:11,625
Come on.

691
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:29,416
Good to see you.

692
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:33,541
That's my new guy. Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

693
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,291
Need to talk to the feds,
go to him first.

694
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,291
He'll take your back for you.

695
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,208
Stan Gursky,
he runs the D.A. shooting team.

696
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,916
Think about him
before you shoot someone.

697
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:47,291
If you're wrong,
he'll use your nuts for dice.

698
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,458
Right here,
Detective Doug Rosselli...

699
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:54,375
...handles theft cases
for the French-poodle crowd.

700
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:56,500
He's a good man.

701
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,916
-Pleased to meet you.
-Good man.

702
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:01,500
-Should l...?
-Shoo.

703
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:03,875
Get yourself a steak or something.

704
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,666
All right, gents.

705
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:11,500
I don't know why I'm meeting you.
I don't talk to dead men.

706
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,583
I ain't dead yet.

707
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,458
Fucking prick. Excuse me.

708
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,208
Why the long face, Doug?

709
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,250
-Feds seize your house or something?
-Fuck yourself.

710
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,500
Tell him the story.

711
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,666
Come on, tell the story.

712
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:32,458
-If it's so funny, you tell him.
-It's your story.

713
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:35,166
Asshole.

714
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:40,541
All right.
There's a serial burglar.

715
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:45,041
Chased him for a year.
A real slickster.

716
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:47,625
Captain's riding my ass
the whole time.

717
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:50,666
-Sentencing was today.
-Judge is female.

718
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:52,541
That's right. Landers.

719
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,083
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

720
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,333
No?

721
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,166
Guy gets ahold of some peanut butter,
packs his ass-crack with it.

722
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,083
He's standing before the bench,
waiting to give his statement.

723
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:13,500
Shoves his hand down his pants,
comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

724
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,541
Bailiffs won't come near him.

725
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:25,916
Now he looks the judge
right in the eyes...

726
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,291
...and licks his fingers clean.

727
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,583
Holy shit.

728
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:34,250
So the judge says:

729
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,125
"This man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

730
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:40,166
-Sends him to Psychiatric.
-She fell for it.

731
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,208
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

732
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,791
By the time she found out,
the guy's already been transferred.

733
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,708
-Proceedings closed.
-Yeah, closed.

734
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:58,250
He'll do six months
in the puzzle factory...

735
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,875
...and they'll let him go.

736
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,208
Never, ever do a day in prison.

737
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,375
Give him credit. He worked the system,
deserves his freedom.

738
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:08,458
Yeah? Think so?

739
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,125
Or not.

740
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:13,041
I'll tell you what.

741
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,958
I'll find this guy on the street...

742
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,875
...and I'll do him.

743
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:24,750
Better take his bullets away,
Stan.

744
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,083
Shit!

745
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:33,541
Heard you had an expensive weekend
in Vegas.

746
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,875
How did you ever screw up so bad?

747
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:41,000
It's nothing.
I didn't know. It's not my town.

748
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:43,625
The Russians don't care
if you're a cop.

749
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,166
They'll whack you.
You ought to get on a plane.

750
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,500
Why?

751
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,958
-It's an easy fix.
-How?

752
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:53,083
I'll just cash in an account.

753
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,875
-Whose?
-One of my old ones. My first one.

754
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,666
The guy's a high-security risk.

755
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,083
If I'm not around,
who will keep him off the radar?

756
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:07,708
I'm just taxing him, that's all.
Okay?

757
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,416
It's your call.

758
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,375
Don't dick this up.

759
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,666
I do not want to see you
on the front page like the others.

760
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,041
Yeah, I understand.

761
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,416
Who's driving?

762
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,041
Me. Gray Mercedes.

763
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,000
Get the car.

764
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,375
Black Monte Carlo there,
back windows shot out.

765
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,541
It's me.
Listen, we got the green light.

766
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:58,125
Fax a copy
of the warrant to the clerk.

767
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:02,791
Get it signed by the judge, and I want
you and Paul to bring it to me.

768
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,333
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools.
Picks and shovels.

769
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,541
Make sure he signs them out
from maintenance. Copy?

770
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,500
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

771
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,708
So how much cash was in that jacket?

772
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,000
Forty G's.

773
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,166
What's that for?

774
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:25,166
-Really want to know?
-Yes, I do.

775
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:30,250
Nothing's free in this world.
Not even arrest warrants.

776
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,458
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

777
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:47,041
Check this out.
Nice suit, Mark.

778
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,083
-Beautiful suit.
-Yeah, fuck you guys!

779
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,958
All right. Nice, nice.

780
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,875
What's up, Alonzo?

781
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,750
-The picks and shovels?
-In the trunk.

782
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,250
Digging a ditch?

783
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:19,875
No, you are.
Nice suit you got on there.

784
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:21,833
That's what I said.

785
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:25,208
-What up, killer?
-What's up with you?

786
00:59:25,416 --> 00:59:28,666
-Heard you ran into trouble.
-It's all good.

787
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,125
Don't worry, everything's fine.

788
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:34,750
Shit, if we can get away with it,
I'm with you.

789
00:59:35,708 --> 00:59:40,125
-Who the fuck is this?
-Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

790
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:42,708
You're a long way from Starbucks.

791
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:48,708
-Why the fuck is he here?
-Gotta get his cherry popped.

792
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:50,750
Stay the fuck out of my way.

793
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:53,750
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

794
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:57,833
Here it is, all legit,
signed by the judge, okay?

795
00:59:58,083 --> 01:00:00,333
Thanks to the Sandman.
Now listen.

796
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,041
Safety is first.

797
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,708
He gives us shit,
we give him lead.

798
01:00:04,916 --> 01:00:08,166
Let's do this right
so we can all go home.

799
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:11,041
Time to punch in, ladies.

800
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:59,166
Freeze! On the floor!

801
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:01,708
-Down!
-What are you clowns doing?

802
01:01:01,916 --> 01:01:04,208
Hey, new guy, watch him!

803
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:08,125
-I'm on him.
-You know what you're doing?

804
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,500
Drop your gun!

805
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,333
Five. Four. Three.

806
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:15,583
Boom!

807
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,750
Give me a reason.

808
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,666
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

809
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,708
What's up, Roger?

810
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:29,208
-What's going down, brother?
-Oh, it's all good, baby.

811
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,166
It's all good.

812
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,958
That's for you.

813
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:43,166
What am I supposed to do with this?
Wipe my ass?

814
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,750
Bad news, dog.

815
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:51,000
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

816
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,250
Please.

817
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,583
Had lunch with the wise men.

818
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,791
You gotta render unto Caesar.

819
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,333
-Those vampires want my pension.
-No, no.

820
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,791
Just a tax.

821
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
They got their boats and mistresses,
house payments.

822
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:16,875
Nothing I can do.
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

823
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:19,208
You're their bitch.

824
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:22,041
-What about me?
-I got your back.

825
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:26,166
Don't worry, we won't
take anything you'll miss.

826
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:30,083
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

827
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,500
No you ain't, cop.

828
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,500
In the kitchen, fellas.

829
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:38,041
Give me the bitch.

830
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,583
You guys hold him down.

831
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,625
-Who'll pay for my floor?
-The city.

832
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,875
Right here.

833
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:34,083
That's what I'm talking about.

834
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,541
What's in here? Coke?

835
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,250
You'll see.

836
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:49,125
Grab that hammer
and knock this lock off.

837
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:53,666
One, two....

838
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:03,875
That's $250,000 you're holding.

839
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,458
Over four million in here.

840
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,500
A $3 million bust on day one.

841
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,833
-You said four.
-Minus tax, brother!

842
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,458
Nothing's free in this world.

843
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,916
Buy your wife a car.
Put the kids through college.

844
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:22,166
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

845
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,416
Somebody didn't sleep
through Ethics.

846
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:29,916
You don't want a piece of this?

847
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,125
No, right?

848
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,458
Not like this.

849
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,541
No.

850
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,416
No?

851
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:49,375
First time, you're not comfortable.
I'll hold it for you.

852
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:52,333
-What about you?
-Oh, I'm comfortable.

853
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,833
-How about you?
-I'm very comfortable.

854
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,166
Let's wrap this up.

855
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:04,000
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

856
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:11,333
Alonzo, what are
those pricks thinking?

857
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:15,791
That I'm gonna stand still and
let them horsefuck me?

858
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:19,166
Could put you out of your misery.

859
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,833
Hey, Jake, here.

860
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,541
Sit down.

861
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,500
Here's a secret:

862
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,750
When you kill someone on duty...

863
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:37,625
...they have to be your slave
in the afterlife.

864
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,458
There you go.

865
01:05:43,708 --> 01:05:45,333
Start an entourage.

866
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:50,125
-Shoot him?
-Yeah.

867
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:52,916
Come on, kid. Do me a favor.

868
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,750
Come on.

869
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,166
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

870
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,541
Are you serious?

871
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:01,541
Hey, close the blinds.

872
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,875
-All right, I'll shoot him.
-Go.

873
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:19,291
-Pow!
-Boom!

874
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,750
Shoot him.

875
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:25,541
No, man.

876
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:30,041
IKids these days.
Not gonna do it?

877
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:32,666
All right, give it to me.

878
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,083
Rookies!

879
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:37,208
You want shit done,
you gotta do it yourself.

880
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:39,583
Holy shit!

881
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,208
Come on, breathe.

882
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,500
Breathe, there you go.

883
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,708
Just let it go.

884
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:52,416
Breathe, dog!

885
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,958
He's finished.

886
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:05,583
-Where's the stinger?
-Right here.

887
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,250
All right, Jeff.

888
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,166
You took fire coming in.

889
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,708
I need some time off, but....

890
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:19,208
-Watch the shades.
-All right.

891
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,000
-Ready?
-IKiss me.

892
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,708
One....

893
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:29,458
-You okay?
-Yeah.

894
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,000
I gotta give you one more, though.

895
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:33,250
Do it.

896
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,750
Fuck!

897
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:39,041
It's not what you know,
it's what you prove.

898
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,541
Here it is.
Mark and Paul kick the door.

899
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:45,541
Jeff's in first.
Roger fires twice.

900
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,625
What, one go through?

901
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:54,875
-You shot him!
-You fucking shot me, man!

902
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:57,250
-Don't worry.
-Call an ambulance!

903
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,166
Go to jail, or go home?

904
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,500
All right, here's the scenario.

905
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:05,958
Mark and Paul kick the door.
Jeff runs in.

906
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,333
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

907
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,000
Hoyt is in second,
drops Roger with the shotgun.

908
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:15,250
-Who shot Roger?
-New guy.

909
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:16,875
-New guy.
-You two?

910
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:20,333
-Hoyt.
-Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

911
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,791
Done. Paul, call them up.

912
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,708
1 1 -49. 998. Shots fired.

913
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:28,458
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

914
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,916
5951 Baxter Street.

915
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:35,833
Congratulations. You're gonna get
a medal of valor for this.

916
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,458
-I didn't shoot him.
-Four cops saw it.

917
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,833
But I didn't. You did.

918
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:48,958
"An L.A.P.D. narcotics officer
was killed today...

919
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,666
...serving a warrant
in Echo Park."

920
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:53,375
Give me the bitch.

921
01:08:56,541 --> 01:09:00,708
"A spokesperson said
the officer is survived...

922
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,583
...by a wife and child."

923
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,375
There's more. You get the picture?

924
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,041
Yeah, I get it.

925
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:12,500
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

926
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,083
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

927
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,750
Y'all see this?
That's it!

928
01:09:17,958 --> 01:09:21,291
-I'll put a bullet in that melon.
-Wait, wait.

929
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:24,000
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

930
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:26,291
Shoot me.
He's coming with me.

931
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,250
-I'll shoot!
-He's a fed.

932
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:32,750
No, he ain't. He's just a kid
that got the drop on y'all.

933
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:37,375
Let's take a deep breath
and just diffuse this. Jake?

934
01:09:37,541 --> 01:09:40,208
I didn't sign up for this!

935
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:43,958
I know you're angry.
Everybody, put the guns down.

936
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:46,583
-Hell, no.
-Choirboy first.

937
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,083
Listen! That's an order!

938
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:51,125
Put them down!

939
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,833
Use your ears, Jake.

940
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:03,875
Sometimes we take this shit
all the way.

941
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:06,500
It's the nature of the business.

942
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:11,416
You'll never have to pull
the trigger again, all right?

943
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:14,666
-Mark, where are you transferring?
-S.I.S.

944
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,375
Detective.

945
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:20,458
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.

946
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:23,458
We make the big seizures, Jake.

947
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:27,625
But if you're in my unit,
you gotta be in it all the way.

948
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:30,791
I thought you were man enough
to handle this shit.

949
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,708
Five decorated officers say
that you shot Roger.

950
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:38,625
They will check your blood
for intoxicants.

951
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:40,666
What are they gonna find?

952
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:44,500
You've been smoking PCP all day.

953
01:10:44,666 --> 01:10:48,458
-You've been planning this all day.
-All week, son.

954
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:52,083
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

955
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:56,041
You wanna take a walk?
You won't make it out of here.

956
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,791
If you're cool, you're a hero.

957
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,916
You're above suspicion.

958
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,375
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

959
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:07,291
We need to kill him now
and say Roger got him.

960
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,500
No, we ain't killing nobody.

961
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:14,833
This is a good man. I can feel it.

962
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:18,875
Just had a little freak-out,
that's all.

963
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:20,916
I say he's cool.

964
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,750
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

965
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:26,125
You do have a decision to make.

966
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:30,458
Because this place is gonna
be overrun with blue suits.

967
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:35,250
So why don't you please
go outside, clear your head.

968
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:39,000
Or shoot me.

969
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,416
Hey, Paul?

970
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,625
You're dead, motherfucker!
You hear me?! Dead!

971
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:17,166
Well, lay off the device.

972
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,833
All right.

973
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,791
Make sure that tub is clean.

974
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:25,000
All right?

975
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:30,083
All right, later.

976
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,791
You all right?

977
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,791
It behooves you not
to dick around on this one.

978
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:48,291
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty.

979
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,458
-Now, what happened--
-What happened was murder.

980
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,166
And armed robbery.

981
01:13:54,416 --> 01:13:56,500
We had badges, so it's different?

982
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:59,500
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

983
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:04,208
That man was your friend,
and you killed him like a fly.

984
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:06,083
My friend? Tell me why?

985
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:09,291
Because he knows my first name?

986
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,166
This is the game.
I played his ass.

987
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:14,500
That's our job.

988
01:14:14,666 --> 01:14:19,416
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world's better off without him.

989
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:25,208
This man was the biggest
major violator in Los Angeles.

990
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:29,625
I watched that cocksucker for years
and now I got him.

991
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,708
This is chess, not checkers!

992
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:43,166
What'd you think?
We'd roll up in a black and white?

993
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,291
Slap the cuffs on him?

994
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,416
He's a high roller, dog.

995
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:53,208
-Take the money.
-I'm not taking it.

996
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,791
-Just take it.
-No!

997
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,875
Look, I don't give a fuck, but
the boys'll feel better.

998
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,333
Fuck their feelings!

999
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,041
Jake, we're a team.

1000
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,125
A team?

1001
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,833
You guys are fucking insane.

1002
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:11,583
I'll go back to the Valley,
I'll cut parking tickets.

1003
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:18,291
-It can't be like this.
-It is.

1004
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,166
I'm sorry, but it is.

1005
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:22,583
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

1006
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:27,666
I became a cop to put away
dealers and criminals, not to be one.

1007
01:15:27,875 --> 01:15:29,458
You sound just like me.

1008
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:32,541
I know what you're
going through and feeling.

1009
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,208
-You're scared.
-I'm not.

1010
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:38,750
Yes, you are. Everyone goes
through that the first time. I did.

1011
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:44,000
The sooner you match
what's in your head...

1012
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,875
...with what's in the real world...

1013
01:15:47,083 --> 01:15:48,916
...the better you'll feel.

1014
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,708
In this business...

1015
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:54,416
...you gotta have dirt on you
to be trusted.

1016
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:59,666
When all this is behind you, a whole
other world will open up for you.

1017
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,291
I walk a higher path, son.

1018
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,208
I have the keys to all the doors.

1019
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,125
What do you mean?

1020
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:14,416
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns.
You're a leader.

1021
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,333
You want my job?
You got it.

1022
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:20,166
You want to lock up poisoners?
This is the place to do it.

1023
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,166
But you gotta take your time.

1024
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:27,250
You'll make detective,
you'll grow wise.

1025
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:30,375
And then you can change things.

1026
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,333
But it's gotta be from the inside.

1027
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:41,041
Let's go downtown to the station.
Talk to my guy, Stan.

1028
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:44,958
He'll go through what you
gotta say to the D.A.

1029
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:35,375
What are we doing now?

1030
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:39,791
I told an informant I'd take care
of his family for him.

1031
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:45,458
Bring them food, stuff like that.

1032
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:48,958
Gotta help out the family.

1033
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,750
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some good.

1034
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,500
You know where you're at, dog?

1035
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:06,666
The fuck you looking at?

1036
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:43,833
Hey, we got some things
for the family.

1037
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,083
IKitchen's this way.

1038
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,875
Put it on the counter.

1039
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:10,250
-Where's the head?
-Right through.

1040
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,458
I'm gonna go to the head.
Two seconds, we're gone.

1041
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:24,500
Hey, let me get the CD player.

1042
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:27,708
No, the CD player's mine.

1043
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:29,333
Dreamer! Come here!

1044
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:33,458
Count that shit, all right?

1045
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:36,666
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

1046
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:39,791
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

1047
01:19:42,458 --> 01:19:44,166
-You looked!
-I didn't.

1048
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,708
You calling me a cheater, ése?

1049
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,541
Deal again, Sniper.

1050
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,750
You play cards, cop?

1051
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,416
No, not really.

1052
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,791
Want a beer?

1053
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,291
Have a cold one.

1054
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,833
No, thanks, I'm good.

1055
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:04,625
Come on, sit down.
Play a card game with us.

1056
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:07,416
Don't be rude, ése. You're a guest.

1057
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:09,500
Why don't you play one hand?

1058
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:12,625
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

1059
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:14,708
We gotta roll in a second.

1060
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:16,875
Alonzo's taking a shit.

1061
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,458
All right, I'll play one hand.

1062
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:25,208
Is this five-card draw?

1063
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,458
Yeah, jokers are wild.

1064
01:20:28,666 --> 01:20:31,083
Why don't you tell us something?

1065
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,791
How long you been a pig?

1066
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,333
My bad. My bad.

1067
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,375
I meant a police officer.

1068
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:41,666
I've been a pig for 1 9 months.

1069
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:44,000
Is that right? You like it?

1070
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:47,250
I should've been a fireman.
One more.

1071
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,875
-What you got, dog?
-Three of a kind.

1072
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:55,458
I didn't get shit.

1073
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,541
Boo-ya, baby!

1074
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:01,208
Two pair!

1075
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:04,791
What the fuck?

1076
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,208
He won.

1077
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,416
I got two pair!

1078
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:15,000
Three of a kind beats two pair,
you fucking dumb truck.

1079
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:20,250
You're fucking stupid.
Take your medication.

1080
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,750
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

1081
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,333
See why we don't play for money?
Because of this vato.

1082
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,041
-Show me your cohete.
-What?

1083
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:33,708
Your gun, homes.
Underneath your shirt.

1084
01:21:34,166 --> 01:21:36,250
What is it, .380 stainless?

1085
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:38,083
-9mm Beretta.
-Like that?

1086
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,833
-Just like it.
-Yeah?

1087
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:44,875
Here's the problem.

1088
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:49,208
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

1089
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:54,000
Come on, ése,
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

1090
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:59,041
Let me check it out.

1091
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Learn that in the Academy?

1092
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:13,916
Neat trick.
This is nice.

1093
01:22:14,083 --> 01:22:18,000
Nice.
You could fuck a vato up with this.

1094
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:23,083
What you do is, you aim like that.

1095
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,416
I'm just playing.

1096
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:31,291
Yeah, I gotta go.
Alonzo!

1097
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,208
IKick back and party.

1098
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,916
Ain't nothing out there for you.

1099
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,208
What are you talking about?

1100
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:43,541
Hey, white boy.

1101
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:48,208
If you ask me homes,
that's just, of course, if you ask...

1102
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:50,375
...Alonzo played you, ése.

1103
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:53,041
Big time.

1104
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:55,666
Wait, where you going?

1105
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,500
It's your deal.

1106
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:11,041
It's all there.

1107
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,250
-Sure?
-You can count it yourself.

1108
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,083
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

1109
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,958
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.

1110
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,375
Who'd he jack, homes?

1111
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,125
I don't know.

1112
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:35,083
He jacked Roger.

1113
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:36,708
Blasted that fool.

1114
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:40,666
Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless vato.

1115
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:42,666
But I like that.

1116
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,166
That's why I never shake his hand.

1117
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,000
He don't respect nada.

1118
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:52,500
IKnow what the money's for?

1119
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,625
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

1120
01:23:55,875 --> 01:23:59,208
Last week in Vegas, some Russian
starts talking shit.

1121
01:23:59,416 --> 01:24:02,250
Alonzo, he just snapped.

1122
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:04,625
Beat his ass to death.

1123
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:08,416
Turns out, that Russian,
he's a somebody.

1124
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:13,333
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians
for a million.

1125
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,583
How do you know that?

1126
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:21,916
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

1127
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,541
But he's still on their list.

1128
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:27,625
Nobody thought he could
get the cash.

1129
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:32,041
Good thing he did.
They're looking for him.

1130
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:38,458
If he don't turn up downtown with
the cash by midnight....

1131
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,333
Your vato...

1132
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,833
...he's dead.

1133
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:43,708
Hey, pig.

1134
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:46,375
Ever had your shit pushed in?

1135
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,458
Simple question.

1136
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,791
-No?
-No.

1137
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,666
-Had my shit pushed in.
-Yeah, man.

1138
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:56,625
I had my shit pushed in, bro!

1139
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:58,416
Big time!

1140
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,625
Smiley?

1141
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:05,625
Sure, I always get love
from the homeys.

1142
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,416
You guys fucked him up!

1143
01:25:17,583 --> 01:25:18,875
Go next door.

1144
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:21,291
Get the fuck out of here!

1145
01:25:23,416 --> 01:25:25,583
You fucked up.

1146
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,750
You're under arrest!

1147
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:32,416
For being a cop, dogging me
in the mouth in my own pad.

1148
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:36,583
You got the right
to be bitch-slapped!

1149
01:25:39,916 --> 01:25:41,291
Drag him to the tub.

1150
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,125
Punk motherfucker!

1151
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,291
Raid his ass!

1152
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:09,916
Do it!

1153
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:11,791
It's gonna be loud.

1154
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:17,666
Let me get his money.

1155
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,958
-Wait.
-Hurry up.

1156
01:26:26,791 --> 01:26:28,625
Smiley, check it out.

1157
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:31,250
Is that your little cousin?

1158
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:40,666
-What's this?
-I found it!

1159
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:42,416
-Who had it?
-I found it!

1160
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:44,208
Where?

1161
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:48,041
I found it in MacArthur Park!
MacArthur Park!

1162
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,000
Wait up, I can't even see.

1163
01:26:55,208 --> 01:26:56,541
Shut the fuck up!

1164
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,708
Get in your last prayer.

1165
01:26:58,916 --> 01:27:00,500
Listen to me, man.

1166
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:02,333
She was being raped.

1167
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:05,416
Two crackheads were attacking her...

1168
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:08,458
...and I stopped them!
I swear to God!

1169
01:27:08,625 --> 01:27:12,333
-You're lying to me!
-I am not lying!

1170
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:14,833
She was being raped!

1171
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:16,333
I stopped them!

1172
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,083
Please! I got a kid.

1173
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:21,083
-Shut up, fag!
-Blast his ass.

1174
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:24,750
I have a little girl!

1175
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,458
Do it!

1176
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,375
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your
bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

1177
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:34,500
Ain't right involving her.

1178
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:35,708
You fucked up.

1179
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,166
If you're lying to me...

1180
01:27:42,375 --> 01:27:43,916
...l blow your balls off.

1181
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,625
-Hello.
-Hey, Letty.

1182
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,750
-What's up?
-Hey, Smiley.

1183
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,541
Just doing homework. You want Tony?

1184
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,166
No, I want you.

1185
01:27:52,375 --> 01:27:55,208
-You go to school today?
-Yeah.

1186
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:57,625
-You didn't ditch?
-Nope.

1187
01:27:57,833 --> 01:28:00,416
I went to every class. Why?

1188
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,458
I heard different.

1189
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:06,708
Cops talk to you today?

1190
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:12,416
-No, no.
-All right, Letty...

1191
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:14,125
...don't bullshit me.

1192
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:20,791
I got jumped by two crackheads.

1193
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,125
-You got jumped?
-I think they wanted to rape me.

1194
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,500
But nothing happened, okay?

1195
01:28:27,708 --> 01:28:29,708
Because this cop came.

1196
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:32,083
They almost killed him...

1197
01:28:32,291 --> 01:28:34,291
...but he kicked their ass.

1198
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,750
Describe him.

1199
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:40,750
He was a white boy.
He looked real young.

1200
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:43,500
-You're okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1201
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:44,958
-Hey, Letty.
-Yeah?

1202
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:46,416
We're not done.

1203
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:47,708
Okay.

1204
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,208
What's up?

1205
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:52,083
You gonna blast him?

1206
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:57,083
Vato was telling the truth.

1207
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:58,916
Life's a trip, qué no?

1208
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,166
This is some trippy shit.

1209
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:17,583
That's for getting my cousin's back.

1210
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,333
Cover your head.
You'll mess up my floor.

1211
01:29:23,083 --> 01:29:26,000
You know this was just
business, right?

1212
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:31,166
Right?

1213
01:29:32,666 --> 01:29:34,625
Right.

1214
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:49,125
What you doing here?
You know you don't belong here.

1215
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:55,625
-What's up?
-Must be lost, motherfucker!

1216
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:59,916
Gonna need more than that
up in here, boy!

1217
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:14,416
You got business here, rookie?

1218
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:16,791
I'm here for Alonzo.

1219
01:32:23,875 --> 01:32:26,541
Hey. Is your dad home?

1220
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,125
-In the bedroom.
-He's in the bedroom?

1221
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:31,833
All right, you wanna open up the door?

1222
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:35,500
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

1223
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,416
Yeah, anything good on?

1224
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:49,875
-Do you want me to call my mom?
-No, I don't.

1225
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:52,833
I'll tell you what I want.

1226
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,250
Find a good hiding spot.

1227
01:32:55,458 --> 01:32:58,166
Do you have a favorite place to hide?

1228
01:32:59,041 --> 01:33:02,416
-The closet.
-In the closet? That's perfect.

1229
01:33:02,958 --> 01:33:06,708
Okay, open up the closet.
All right. Good, good.

1230
01:33:06,875 --> 01:33:09,041
Can you sit down in there?

1231
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:13,375
All right. Now stay in here
and be very quiet.

1232
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,291
I'll be right back. All right?

1233
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:44,416
It's all good, baby.

1234
01:33:51,666 --> 01:33:53,208
You, against the wall.

1235
01:33:53,416 --> 01:33:56,541
Move real slow.
Put the money in that bag...

1236
01:33:56,750 --> 01:34:00,625
...take your weapons and place them
inside that pillowcase.

1237
01:34:02,541 --> 01:34:06,375
Congratulations, son. You made it.

1238
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:08,750
You passed the test. You're a narc.

1239
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:12,291
Put the gun down before you give
her a heart attack.

1240
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,833
I said put the money in that bag.

1241
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:18,041
Place your weapons
inside that pillowcase.

1242
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,125
Fuck your appointment
with the Russians.

1243
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:23,375
Oh, okay.

1244
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:26,583
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

1245
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:29,333
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

1246
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,458
You're gonna book me?

1247
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,291
You smoked the dust.

1248
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,291
You ran out, and you're the one
that shot Roger.

1249
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,583
-Here you go.
-And the one on your ankle?

1250
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:44,750
Want the one in my back pocket too?

1251
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:50,750
One problem: You got no witnesses.

1252
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:54,541
Who are your witnesses, huh?
Roger? Smiley?

1253
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,458
You think they'll help you?

1254
01:34:57,041 --> 01:35:01,500
It's not what you know.
It's what you can prove.

1255
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,791
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

1256
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,041
-Where's your evidence?
-There.

1257
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,625
Oh, shit!

1258
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:21,500
It's on now, Jake.

1259
01:35:22,708 --> 01:35:24,083
Don't move.

1260
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,250
Where you at, Jake?

1261
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:30,208
Come on out, dog!

1262
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:46,166
-Ah! I see you.
-Shit!

1263
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:55,125
I'm surgical with this bitch.
How you want it?

1264
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:59,458
That fool in the wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

1265
01:36:01,916 --> 01:36:04,833
-Mommy.
-Alonzito!

1266
01:36:07,666 --> 01:36:08,916
You see what I see?

1267
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:13,833
Officer Hoyt, job number one:
Preserve life.

1268
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:16,625
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

1269
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:18,958
We're walking out together.

1270
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:39,750
Alonzito! Alonzito!

1271
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,583
-You all right?
-I want my mommy.

1272
01:36:46,791 --> 01:36:48,333
I know, I know, I know.

1273
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,875
Just sit tight, all right?

1274
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:54,625
It's gonna be all right. I know.

1275
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:57,583
Shut the fuck up!

1276
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,333
All right, let me see your hands!
Where is he?

1277
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:05,583
-The window.
-Come on!

1278
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:08,041
-Get your kid, stay down.
-Alonzito!

1279
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,833
Hey, man, you tripping?

1280
01:42:00,208 --> 01:42:03,166
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

1281
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:06,250
My nigga.

1282
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:13,125
Hey, first Damu puts one
in his head...

1283
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:16,625
...l'll make you a rich man!

1284
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:19,041
Come on now.

1285
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:20,458
Who wanna get paid?

1286
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:23,625
Who wanna get paid?

1287
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,125
They're not like you.

1288
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:32,291
You know what I learned today?

1289
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:36,958
-I'm not like you.
-That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

1290
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:42,000
Good. So, what now? Huh?

1291
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:44,791
What you gonna do, shoot me?

1292
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,791
You gonna bust your cherry
killing a cop?

1293
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,875
There it is, Jake.

1294
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:57,583
Hit me.

1295
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:03,083
You never killed nobody before.
It ain't like stepping on ants.

1296
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:05,208
Takes a man to kill.

1297
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:08,791
Are you man enough to kill?

1298
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:12,291
Hit me right there.

1299
01:43:16,541 --> 01:43:20,375
Get me, Jake. Get me.
Hit me. Hit me.

1300
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:25,125
You can't do it.
Somebody drop this fool for me.

1301
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:45,250
You got us twisted.
You got to put your own work in.

1302
01:43:46,458 --> 01:43:50,041
-All right. It's like that, Bone?
-It's like that.

1303
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:57,083
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

1304
01:43:57,291 --> 01:44:00,083
-I don't believe you'd shoot me.
-Don't do it.

1305
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:04,250
-Don't.
-I don't believe you got it in you.

1306
01:44:14,625 --> 01:44:17,500
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1307
01:44:17,708 --> 01:44:19,625
You ain't gonna do a thing.

1308
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:22,958
You ain't gonna shoot no cop
in the back.

1309
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:26,208
-Don't do it.
-You know what you'd get?

1310
01:44:26,416 --> 01:44:29,583
The gas chamber.
You know what it smells like?

1311
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:34,000
Pine oil. That's where you headed,
to pine oil heaven.

1312
01:44:34,208 --> 01:44:36,625
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

1313
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:40,291
I don't think you got it in you.
I'm gonna go get it.

1314
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:45,541
Shit! Ah, you motherfucker!

1315
01:44:45,958 --> 01:44:47,875
The next one will kill you.

1316
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:51,208
Son of a bitch!
You shot me in the ass!

1317
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:52,875
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1318
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:54,500
Okay, okay.

1319
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:58,333
All right. Come on, I need
the money. Give me the money.

1320
01:44:59,125 --> 01:45:02,041
-Give me that money!
-It's not gonna happen.

1321
01:45:02,958 --> 01:45:05,416
You gonna take my own money from me?

1322
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:09,125
That's my evidence.
You wanna go to jail or go home?

1323
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,333
I wanna go home, Jake.

1324
01:45:15,166 --> 01:45:17,958
Give me the money,
and let me go home.

1325
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:21,166
-You wanna go home?
-Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

1326
01:45:21,375 --> 01:45:23,500
Give me the money,
and let me go.

1327
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:27,958
Give me the money,
and let me go home, Jake.

1328
01:45:28,166 --> 01:45:29,541
That's right, come on.

1329
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:34,541
You don't deserve this.

1330
01:45:35,958 --> 01:45:37,291
Okay, motherfucker.

1331
01:45:42,791 --> 01:45:44,625
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

1332
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:47,750
Get up out of here. We got your back.

1333
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:49,791
What?

1334
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:52,625
-It's like that.
-Oh, no, you didn't!

1335
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:56,375
Wait a minute! No, you--
Hey, hey, Jake!

1336
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:59,958
Hey! Jake! Jake!

1337
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:02,041
Jake, come back here!

1338
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:04,500
Jake!

1339
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:10,208
You disloyal, fool-ass,
bitch-made punk.

1340
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,083
I need my money!

1341
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,833
Jake!

1342
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:24,291
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

1343
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:28,041
All right! I'm putting cases
on all you bitches!

1344
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:31,500
Huh? You think you can do this shit?
Jake!

1345
01:46:32,291 --> 01:46:34,541
You think you can do this to me?!

1346
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:39,291
You motherfuckers will be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay...

1347
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,708
...when I get finished with you!

1348
01:46:42,291 --> 01:46:44,291
Shoe program, nigga!

1349
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:47,125
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

1350
01:46:47,333 --> 01:46:49,333
I'm the man up in this piece!

1351
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,875
Who you think you fucking with?!

1352
01:46:53,083 --> 01:46:57,541
I'm the police! I run shit here!
You just live here!

1353
01:46:58,666 --> 01:47:01,125
That's right, you better walk away.

1354
01:47:01,333 --> 01:47:03,916
I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down!

1355
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,125
IKing IKong ain't got shit on me!

1356
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:22,083
That's all right. That's all right.

1357
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,250
Shit, I don't fuck--

1358
01:47:24,458 --> 01:47:27,541
I'm winning anyway. I'm winning.

1359
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,208
I'm winning anyway. I can't lose.

1360
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:35,750
Shit, you can shoot me,
but you can't kill me.

1361
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:43,833
Oh, what a day.

1362
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,083
What a motherfucking day!

1363
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:39,833
An L.A. police officer
