00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:25,432
Ten more minutes.

2
00:02:26,468 --> 00:02:28,002
Are you ready?

3
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:33,334
Get the fuck out of here!

4
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:45,954
Stop! Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

5
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,177
"Jrabbren"

6
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:50,136
I said "krabren".

7
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,095
No! No!

8
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:55,084
Jrabbren.

9
00:02:55,122 --> 00:02:56,158
J-j-j--
I can't say that shit!

10
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,501
Hey, Phil!

11
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,767
How many times we got
to go through that?

12
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,950
Could we just change
that last line?

13
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:10,773
We'll have to do it again.

14
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,497
Man, fuck this shit!

15
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,683
Hold on.

16
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:18,752
George... Listen to me.

17
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,207
You're not the champ anymore,
you understand me?

18
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:24,583
In fact, right now
all you are is broke.

19
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,270
Now, we traveled a long way.

20
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,112
I'm trying to get you
back on your feet.

21
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,605
I'm trying to get you paid.

22
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,794
So do me this favor.

23
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,792
Please, just do what he asks.

24
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,134
Let's give it another shot, huh?

25
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,132
- But listen--
- No, no, no.

26
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,436
No "but listen".

27
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,239
You just do your job, we smile...

28
00:03:38,277 --> 00:03:40,924
go out to dinner with
these corporate cocksuckers...

29
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:42,880
and you go home a richer man.

30
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,291
# Money, money, money #

31
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:32,556
Whoa.

32
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:38,540
Hmm.

33
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:39,883
Oops!

34
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,908
Our customers are very excited.

35
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,749
When the hell does
the fight start?

36
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,398
It should start any second.

37
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,355
What are we giving?

38
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:54,229
The bets from the clubs
are 5 to 1, Boyka.

39
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:59,523
Markov says this, uh, new fighter
is extremely good.

40
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,633
Heard that one before.

41
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:05,699
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

42
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:09,918
Boyka! Boyka!
Boyka! Boyka!

43
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,779
Boyka, Boyka!

44
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:41,181
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

45
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,752
Broadcasting
live and exclusively...

46
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,974
to select establishments
across Russia and Europe.

47
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,084
In this evening's bout...

48
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,462
weighing in at 104 kilos...

49
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,684
fighting out of Kyrov
penitentiary in Siberia...

50
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,830
with a record of 14 wins
and no defeats...

51
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:00,822
convicted of
second degree homicide...

52
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:02,893
our challenger...

53
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:05,885
Arkady Daviiiic!

54
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,061
And defending
his unbeaten run...

55
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:15,935
of 34 consecutive fights
without defeat...

56
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:19,196
convicted of 3 counts of
homicide in the first degree...

57
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:21,689
weighing in at 92 kilos...

58
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:24,566
our own undisputed champion...

59
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:29,323
Uri Boyka!
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

60
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:33,082
Boyka, Boyka!

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,959
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

62
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,874
Boyka, Boyka!

63
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,790
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

64
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:26,747
Gentlemen, remember...

65
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:29,394
no biting, no eye gouging,
and no hair pulling.

66
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:31,619
Fight!

67
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:36,989
Uh!

68
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:37,948
Unh! Ah!

69
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:39,406
- Uh! Argh!
- Ah!

70
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:42,436
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

71
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:44,853
- Ha!
- Unh!

72
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,771
Argh!

73
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,415
- Argh!
- Boyka!

74
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,709
Aaah!

75
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:56,821
Uh!

76
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,161
Ugh! Uh!

77
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,000
Uh!

78
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,606
Argh!

79
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,828
Argh!

80
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:09,825
Unh! Oh!

81
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:10,784
Bah!

82
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,316
Boyka, Boyka!

83
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,349
Boyka, Boyka!

84
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,111
To success!

85
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,279
Here he is.

86
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,583
Excuse me.

87
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:35,449
George, you are an hour
late for the dinner.

88
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,521
Oh, my bad. I forgot
all about this dinner.

89
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,902
Mr. Chambers.

90
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,127
The ad execs are
getting pissed off.

91
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,198
Come in. Have a drink. We'll go.

92
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,157
All right.
Let me change clothes.

93
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,423
- Gimme 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes?

94
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:46,727
On top of an hour?

95
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,568
Hey, listen, this brown nosing
and breaking bread bullshit--

96
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:50,256
That's your job.
I did mine already.

97
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,254
They can kiss this ass.

98
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:52,980
Tell you what, 20 minutes.

99
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:54,322
Raah!

100
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,588
Argh!

101
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:56,547
Uh!

102
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,506
Uh!

103
00:08:57,545 --> 00:08:59,079
Argh!

104
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:00,652
Unh! Uh!

105
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,649
Ah!

106
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,334
Argh!

107
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,439
- Unh!
- Yes!

108
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:10,433
- Unh!
- Argh!

109
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:14,691
Argh!

110
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,758
Get up! Finish him!

111
00:09:18,796 --> 00:09:20,330
Now!

112
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:21,634
Aaaah!

113
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,890
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

114
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:50,941
Unh!

115
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,089
Uh! Oh!

116
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:54,892
Argh!

117
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,230
Uh! Ugh!

118
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,764
What the fuck are
you doing in my--

119
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,260
Ugh!

120
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:13,650
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

121
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:14,648
Stop!

122
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:16,029
Boyka, Boyka!

123
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:28,342
Argh!

124
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,339
Uh!

125
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,298
Argh!

126
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:31,372
Unh!

127
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:38,239
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

128
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:41,001
Raaah!

129
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,916
Raah!

130
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:46,026
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

131
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,079
There.

132
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,034
If we cannot get
better odds against Boyka...

133
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,565
we will have to shut down
by spring.

134
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,675
It cannot keep
going on like this.

135
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:19,590
Don't worry. It won't.

136
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,695
They said nobody saw
these guys, George.

137
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,613
What, they ain't got
no surveillance cameras out here?

138
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,610
I don't know.

139
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,758
You really don't think
I did this shit.

140
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,236
Another easy fight, eh, champ?

141
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,691
No one's ever
gonna stop you, huh?

142
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,754
When you get out
of here some day...

143
00:11:44,793 --> 00:11:46,979
you'll be the richest man
in Kiev.

144
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:48,514
I just hope
you'll remember me--

145
00:11:48,552 --> 00:11:49,971
Aah!

146
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,229
It was an accident.

147
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:58,180
Put out your hand.

148
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:00,137
No.

149
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,014
Boyka.

150
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,011
Did you hear?

151
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,239
Hear what?

152
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,655
He is coming.

153
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,957
The police is already
in his room.

154
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,261
He'll be here
tomorrow.

155
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:16,670
Aaah!

156
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,844
This is your Bible?

157
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,603
Why, yes, sir.

158
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:44,557
I take the Good Book
with me everywhere I go.

159
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:45,823
Mmm.

160
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,618
That is not mine.

161
00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:59,364
Then this must
not be yours, too.

162
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:01,819
No, it isn't.

163
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:08,302
What the hell
is going on here?

164
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,644
They're setting me up.

165
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:17,009
American boxer George Chambers
has been transferred...

166
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,810
to a maximum security
jail to await charges.

167
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:22,994
Convicted of a controversial
assault charge 6 years ago...

168
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:26,830
the former Heavyweight Champion
of the World was also cautioned...

169
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:29,246
in 1993 over the possession
of illegal painkillers.

170
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:31,663
Our sources have indicated
that the quantity...

171
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,041
of narcotics involved
is well over the threshold...

172
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:35,422
for a trafficking charge.

173
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,107
This is Maria Alonso
reporting from Russia.

174
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:44,546
He just arrived.

175
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:05,260
Fuck are y'all lookin' at?

176
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,451
Yeah.

177
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:56,164
Good evening, Mr. Chambers.

178
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:59,463
I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

179
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:03,452
Now, you and I both know you don't
give a damn how my journey was.

180
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,600
I understand you have
been to prison before...

181
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,442
in the United States.

182
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:10,242
And don't pretend
that you don't know...

183
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,316
who the hell I am, either.

184
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:12,965
I was a big fan of yours...

185
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:15,420
during height of your career.

186
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,221
In fact, we all are very
excited you are here.

187
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:19,640
Don't get too excited,
'cause I plan on walking...

188
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,941
straight outta here as soon as
this shit's straightened out.

189
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,972
Perhaps.

190
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,276
But in the meantime...

191
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:28,156
you should know that
in this facility...

192
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:29,844
we think very highly of fighters.

193
00:16:29,882 --> 00:16:32,567
In fact, we even have
our own champion.

194
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,869
You ain't hearing me,
Colonel Klink.

195
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:36,902
I told you. I don't plan
on staying here long.

196
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:17,179
Fuck y'all. Heat this shit up.

197
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,739
You take shower now.

198
00:17:24,813 --> 00:17:28,035
Go...fuck...yourself.

199
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:32,063
Ugh!

200
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,060
Ugh!

201
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:34,940
Argh! Ow!

202
00:17:35,899 --> 00:17:37,088
Ugh!

203
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:39,658
Ugh!

204
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,695
Hmm.

205
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:06,587
Ha ha ha!

206
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:13,606
Champ, gift from Boyka.
Warm piss.

207
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:14,987
- Unh!
- Ugh!

208
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:15,946
Argh!

209
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:19,897
Ugh!

210
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:20,972
Unh!

211
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,621
Argh!

212
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:24,002
Oh!

213
00:18:42,146 --> 00:18:43,412
Are you all right, chum?

214
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,826
Turn around, get the fuck
out of my face!

215
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:49,550
Got it.

216
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:58,104
Ugh!
This is bullshit!

217
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:42,908
I don't mean
to bother you, but...

218
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:44,442
you better get up.

219
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:49,237
Look, if you
don't leave your cell...

220
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:52,306
when they unlock the door,
they'll lock it again.

221
00:19:52,344 --> 00:19:54,224
You won't eat or get air
for the rest of the day.

222
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,594
Not that either
of those things...

223
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:00,822
are particularly
pleasant out here.

224
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,740
Yo, dude...

225
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,658
Iet's get one thing straight.

226
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:08,033
Now, I don't need to learn
the ropes around here...

227
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:09,836
you feel me?

228
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,138
Sure, Mr. Chambers.

229
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:13,787
Of course.

230
00:20:58,515 --> 00:20:59,857
Move!

231
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:01,929
Hey, man, what the fuck?
Man, you blind, too?

232
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:03,425
Ignore him.

233
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:05,803
He's a bit crazy.

234
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,337
Been here too long,
you know what I mean?

235
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:10,138
Lives underground. Only
comes up here at mealtimes.

236
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,306
Not exactly five star, is it?

237
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:47,270
Uh...do you mind
if I join you?

238
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:03,458
Yo, dude, why do you keep
staring at me like that?

239
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,759
I'm sorry.

240
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:07,524
It's just--

241
00:22:07,562 --> 00:22:09,519
Well, it's incredible
that I'm sharing a cell...

242
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,705
with George Chambers here.

243
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,727
Steven Parker.

244
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:25,016
I suggest you stand up.

245
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,739
Unh!

246
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,631
Look, I don't want
to be pushy, man...

247
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:40,935
but you don't want
to mess with Boyka.

248
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:02,148
You, stand!

249
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,894
You stand up...now!

250
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:11,891
Mmf!

251
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,311
- Unh!
- Ugh!

252
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,997
Boyka, huh?

253
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,633
Now, what kind of
bitch ass name is that?

254
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,774
You were great champion. I know.

255
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,957
Long time ago. Long time.

256
00:23:46,147 --> 00:23:49,714
But in here, I am the champion.

257
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,095
And you...

258
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:55,660
You are just my bi--

259
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,359
Raaah!

260
00:24:22,665 --> 00:24:24,314
Let's go, motherfucker!

261
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:26,846
Bring it! Bring it!

262
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,457
Let's go right now!

263
00:24:28,496 --> 00:24:30,107
Fuck you!

264
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:35,055
Why did you stop me?!

265
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:37,357
You think I'm afraid of
that fucking oaf?

266
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:39,697
Uri, I told you you'll
have your own shot at him.

267
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:42,113
I had my shot at him!

268
00:24:42,152 --> 00:24:44,300
And then your guards
stepped in to save him!

269
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:45,604
How do you think that looks?!

270
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,023
Look, we help.

271
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,634
I didn't ask you.

272
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,621
You cannot stop me from
doing what I have to do.

273
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,693
No one wants to stop you.

274
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,496
We're just telling you
we have to be sure...

275
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:59,452
it is in the ring!

276
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:02,252
Argh!

277
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:05,474
Some bad news.

278
00:25:05,474 --> 00:25:07,124
They're not offering bail.

279
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:08,466
Did you call Ruben in L.A.?

280
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:10,768
George, Ruben is
an American attorney.

281
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,034
He can't help with this.

282
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:14,335
Did you even call-- Listen.

283
00:25:14,374 --> 00:25:17,634
You better tell me something
I wanna hear right now.

284
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:18,900
I've already been
to the embassy.

285
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,204
They're very upbeat.

286
00:25:20,281 --> 00:25:21,892
But they're telling me
the process can take...

287
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:23,197
anywhere from a month--

288
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,769
A month?!

289
00:25:24,808 --> 00:25:27,109
What the fuck
you talking about?!

290
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:29,449
Now, Phil, I swear to God...

291
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,482
you better turn around and
get me a team of lawyers...

292
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,825
and get me
the fuck out of here!

293
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:33,976
I will.

294
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:36,124
It's just gonna take
a little bit more time.

295
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:38,655
You fucking clown!

296
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:41,149
You know what it feels like
to be in here for nothing, huh?

297
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:42,645
You're bullshittin' me!

298
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:45,752
Just be patient, George!
I'm doing everything I can!

299
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,728
My dear friend, Markov.

300
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,339
So, where are we?

301
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,603
He's uncomfortable.

302
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,137
That's a good first step.

303
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:03,397
I don't need first steps.
I need them to fight.

304
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,929
There's already bad blood
between him and Boyka.

305
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:07,540
I think he'll--he'll-- he'll fight.

306
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:08,499
- You think?
- Yeah.

307
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:10,149
Well, that's a nice surprise.

308
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,182
"Think" isn't
good enough, Markov.

309
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,908
I have to start making
arrangements now.

310
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:14,867
Eh...sure.

311
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:16,171
Th-th-the only
problem is, eh,

312
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,010
this idiot hopes
he'll go free any day.

313
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:20,468
Yeah...

314
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,232
Well, I'll handle that.

315
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,380
You just take care
of the fight.

316
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,337
- And Markov...
- Yeah?

317
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,630
Don't disappoint me, ok?

318
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,571
I said, enough!

319
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:41,412
What the fuck's going on?!
Why are you doing this?!

320
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:46,053
Ugh!

321
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,895
Ow, unh!

322
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:04,965
Argh!

323
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:07,765
Ugh, uh!

324
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:10,450
Argh!

325
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,407
Unh!

326
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:13,404
Aah!

327
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,859
Aaargh!

328
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:16,971
Ow!

329
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:22,610
Ugh! Unh! Ugh!

330
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,605
Ow!

331
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:41,406
Thank you.

332
00:27:41,445 --> 00:27:43,363
What the hell was that about?

333
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:45,166
Nothing.

334
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:48,311
But thanks for
your help anyway.

335
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,268
Well, don't take it
personally, junkie.

336
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,454
I just don't like seeing
people getting bullied.

337
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:54,410
Unless it's me
doing the bullying.

338
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:58,093
Listen, Mr. Chambers...

339
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:00,586
there's something you ought
to know about this place.

340
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:03,195
E-even when you're getting
out any day, of course.

341
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:06,685
What?

342
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:08,412
It's owned by the mob.

343
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,020
I mean...
One man, really.

344
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,820
He owns the cons,
he owns the cops.

345
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,969
Ha! He's name is Gaga.

346
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:17,273
Ha ha ha!

347
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:19,037
- Gaga?
- Yeah.

348
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,226
So why are you telling me?

349
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,065
Just thought it best
if--if--if--if you...

350
00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:25,443
If I what?

351
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:26,517
Go with the program.

352
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,509
Best way to stay healthy.

353
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:31,849
Hey! I got my own way
of staying healthy.

354
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:32,962
What's that?

355
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,343
Knock the other
son of a bitch out...

356
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,184
before he gets a chance
to do it to me.

357
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:51,375
What happened?!

358
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:54,597
What?!

359
00:29:00,312 --> 00:29:02,652
You think you come in here
and do what you want?!

360
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:04,877
Fuck you! This is my world.

361
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:06,603
Motherfucker,
keep your world.

362
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,792
I don't want this shit.

363
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,480
And anyway, why you talking
to me right now, man?

364
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:11,283
Either throw your hands
or step the fuck--

365
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:13,048
- If you're so tough, then fight me!
- Bitch ass motherfucker!

366
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,467
In the ring!

367
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,426
Man, fuck the ring!

368
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:16,615
We can do this shit right now.

369
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,802
Bitch-ass punk!

370
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:26,052
Fuck you! Fight me in the ring!

371
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,277
Right now!
I'll take you right here!

372
00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:29,581
- Come on!
- Come on!

373
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:30,655
What you got for me?

374
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:31,844
Fuck you!

375
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:33,800
I'll fight you right now,
motherfucker! Come on!

376
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,833
- In the ring!
- Fuck that!

377
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:39,861
You have to concentrate
on one fight at a time.

378
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,050
Forget the American--

379
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,426
Shut up! Do your fucking job!

380
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,410
Heavyweight Champion
of the World.

381
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:52,635
I'll rip his fucking head off!

382
00:29:53,862 --> 00:29:55,397
Of course you will.

383
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,775
But tonight you rip
someone else's head off, ok?

384
00:29:57,813 --> 00:29:59,156
Shut up!

385
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,647
Boyka.

386
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:03,989
So what are the bets?

387
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:06,675
250,000 across
the first 3 rounds...

388
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:08,669
and another 20 across 4 and 5.

389
00:30:08,784 --> 00:30:11,354
Could be a lot better.
Give me the phone.

390
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,152
Markov.

391
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,495
What the hell's going on?

392
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,835
Fight starts in 15 minutes.

393
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:20,369
I'm walking to
the arena right now.

394
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:21,712
That's not what
I'm talking about.

395
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,476
What the fuck's going
on with Chambers?

396
00:30:23,514 --> 00:30:25,317
We're doing everything
we can, Gaga.

397
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:28,463
You better do more, my friend.
You better do more, understand?

398
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:29,422
Yes.

399
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,458
Boyka, Boyka!

400
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,096
Fight!

401
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:41,237
Unh!

402
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:43,270
Unh! Ugh!

403
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,382
Ugh!

404
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:45,801
Boyka! Boyka!

405
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,297
Raaah!

406
00:30:47,374 --> 00:30:49,868
Boyka! Boyka!

407
00:30:49,906 --> 00:30:50,827
Unh!

408
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:52,553
Unh! Uh!

409
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:58,153
Arghhh.

410
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,301
Unh!

411
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:03,485
Raah!

412
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:04,905
Boyka!

413
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:06,861
Ugh!

414
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:10,505
Unh! Ah!

415
00:31:11,963 --> 00:31:12,922
Uh!

416
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,878
Ow!

417
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,330
Argh! Argh!

418
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:21,821
Boyka!

419
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,235
Unh! Ow!

420
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:26,846
Argh!

421
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,572
Ow!

422
00:31:30,337 --> 00:31:32,217
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

423
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:35,247
Unh! Yaah!

424
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:36,475
Yah!

425
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:37,472
Ow!

426
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,886
Arrrrgh!

427
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:42,689
Unh! Unh!

428
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,374
Ow!

429
00:31:48,136 --> 00:31:50,169
Unh!

430
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:53,660
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

431
00:31:53,698 --> 00:31:55,386
Boyka! Boyka!

432
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:57,150
Unh!

433
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,104
Boyka! Boyka!

434
00:32:00,142 --> 00:32:01,984
Unh! Unh! Unh!

435
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:05,935
Stop! Stop!

436
00:32:05,973 --> 00:32:07,354
Unh!

437
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,998
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

438
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,763
Argh!

439
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,629
Argh!

440
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,120
Unh!

441
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,555
Warden wants to see you.

442
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,355
Only person I wanna see
is from the U.S. embassy.

443
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:52,810
You see warden now.

444
00:32:58,449 --> 00:32:59,869
Ugh!

445
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:13,831
Motherfuck--!

446
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,788
Ugh!

447
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:18,626
That's enough.

448
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,964
Mr. Chambers...

449
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:26,452
you are making things
very difficult on yourself.

450
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,441
There's a way you can make
your time here much easier.

451
00:33:31,554 --> 00:33:34,661
You've seen now
our resident champion...

452
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,886
Uri Boyka, in action.

453
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:39,341
We want to arrange a fight
between the two of you.

454
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:40,875
I ain't fighting, man!

455
00:33:40,913 --> 00:33:43,637
I wouldn't take part in
this circus brawl bullshit...

456
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,517
you got going on here anyway.

457
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,588
The hell you call that shit?

458
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,429
A sport?

459
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:52,460
As I was saying,
if you fight...

460
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:55,145
you'll find that
things could become...

461
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:57,408
much more pleasant
around here.

462
00:33:57,446 --> 00:33:59,441
Who knows? You could
even find yourself...

463
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:02,433
on a plane heading home.

464
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:07,612
Fine. Have it your way.

465
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:14,516
Sewage duct for whole prison.

466
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,319
Very old.

467
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,352
Clogged every day.

468
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:20,884
Go!

469
00:34:21,881 --> 00:34:23,301
Uh, hell no!

470
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,449
Go!

471
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,326
Get that shit out of my face!

472
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:33,313
Go get it.

473
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:36,650
Fuck you!

474
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,158
If you don't work,
then we'll make you work.

475
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,117
Heh.

476
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:50,114
What?

477
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,638
Don't give these
gorillas an excuse.

478
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,151
It's not worth it.

479
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:36,031
Give me number.

480
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:37,987
On your shovel.

481
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,631
Eighteen.

482
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:47,961
You bring it back to me
when you've finished each day.

483
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:51,950
Make sure you clean the shit
before you give it back.

484
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:52,098
Not bad for
an old Russian dude.

485
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,937
I've had time to practice.

486
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,599
Oh, Christ!

487
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:24,780
Man, you truly stink.

488
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,542
Fuck you.

489
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:30,649
Maybe I should ask
for a gas mask.

490
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,913
Or maybe transfer
to another cell.

491
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:35,253
What, and miss out on
my sparkling conversation?

492
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:39,127
Looks like Crot gave you
quite a hard time.

493
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,278
Who?

494
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:41,850
The guy in the wheelchair, Crot.

495
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,152
Crot is Russian for mole.

496
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,341
You know...

497
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:49,599
that guy used to be a commando
in the Russian army.

498
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:52,630
I'm told that he was quite
a mean motherfucker back then.

499
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:54,126
He even killed a prison guard.

500
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:56,235
That old dude?

501
00:37:56,312 --> 00:37:57,846
Yeah.

502
00:37:57,885 --> 00:38:01,069
There's no way they're gonna
let him out of this shit hole.

503
00:38:01,107 --> 00:38:02,219
Hmm.

504
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,792
But you, on the other hand...

505
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,976
you're one of the lucky few
that does have a way out.

506
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:08,549
Yeah? How so?

507
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:12,155
Take Markov's offer.
Fight Boyka.

508
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,739
Jesus, don't you
guys ever sleep?

509
00:38:58,685 --> 00:38:59,606
Aah!

510
00:38:59,644 --> 00:39:01,293
Look at you, junkie fuck.

511
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:03,020
C-can't--

512
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:03,979
Argh!

513
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:05,628
You're lucky
to still be breathing.

514
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,740
Unh.

515
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,579
If he doesn't fight soon,
your luck will end.

516
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:14,911
Ah!

517
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:30,754
We bring you a message
from Boyka.

518
00:39:34,244 --> 00:39:35,625
Argh!

519
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,812
Unh! Ow!

520
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:40,459
Ow!

521
00:39:40,497 --> 00:39:43,029
Ugh!

522
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,215
Aah!

523
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:49,933
Argh!

524
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,772
Hey!

525
00:39:58,373 --> 00:39:59,293
Ugh!

526
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:08,269
Argh!

527
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,497
Ow!

528
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:11,300
Unh!

529
00:40:12,297 --> 00:40:13,218
Oh!

530
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,056
Uh!

531
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,514
- Uh!
- Uh!

532
00:40:18,473 --> 00:40:19,394
Ow!

533
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:21,542
Ow!

534
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:26,030
Argh!

535
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:37,193
Move.

536
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:39,609
Move.

537
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,544
Ugh!

538
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,917
Argh!

539
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:56,257
Enjoy your new home.

540
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:04,965
What?

541
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:07,420
He's in the hole.

542
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:10,297
People change their minds
in that place.

543
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:11,448
Good.

544
00:41:15,054 --> 00:41:16,204
Ugh.

545
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:17,662
Ow!

546
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:42,327
Hey.

547
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,938
Stand up.

548
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:45,780
Stand up. I have soup.

549
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:59,589
Pills.

550
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:03,770
Chew and swallow.

551
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,573
Help with your fever.

552
00:42:06,993 --> 00:42:08,412
Why are you doing this?

553
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,023
Shut up and drink.

554
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,440
And take this, too.

555
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,114
Hey.

556
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,561
Why are you doing this?

557
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,208
Why do you care why I do it?

558
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:31,274
'Cause where I'm from,
ain't nothin' free. Why?

559
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:33,039
You never help anyone?

560
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:37,335
Probably not.

561
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:39,215
Motherfucker,
you don't know me.

562
00:42:39,253 --> 00:42:41,401
That's why I bought
my mother a ten-bedroom house.

563
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,358
I don't do for nobody, shit.

564
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:45,582
You probably do
that for you, too.

565
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:47,731
Hey, you know what
your problem is, old man?

566
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:51,106
You been here too long.
You lost touch with reality.

567
00:42:51,183 --> 00:42:55,134
Your problem is that you're
not accepting reality.

568
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,474
Reality is, I was framed.

569
00:42:57,551 --> 00:42:59,047
I don't belong here.

570
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:00,888
And I ain't gonna
be here much longer.

571
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:04,149
You still don't understand.

572
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:06,872
They will never
let you out of here.

573
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,205
Get him cleaned up.

574
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:00,998
It is Beluga caviar.

575
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:03,913
25,000 American
dollars per kilo.

576
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:06,176
Looks like rat shit to me.

577
00:44:06,214 --> 00:44:08,132
Smells like it, too.

578
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:10,204
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Chambers?

579
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:12,275
You're the big dog, right?

580
00:44:12,314 --> 00:44:15,804
Yeah. I'm the big dog.

581
00:44:15,843 --> 00:44:18,029
Ruff! Heh.

582
00:44:18,068 --> 00:44:20,868
I am the big dog
that brought you here.

583
00:44:20,906 --> 00:44:24,359
So...Mr. Big Dog...

584
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:26,315
what makes you think
I won't jump up there...

585
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:27,773
and make you a dead dog?

586
00:44:27,811 --> 00:44:29,652
Because I know
you're not stupid.

587
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,938
Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Chambers.

588
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,009
I'm a business man.

589
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:43,538
And, uh, this is
a business situation.

590
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:44,536
Please.

591
00:44:46,991 --> 00:44:49,024
I brought you here.
I can let you out.

592
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:51,939
The choice...is yours.

593
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:54,893
You want me to fight
that clown Boyka, right?

594
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,734
It will make me
very happy, yeah.

595
00:44:57,732 --> 00:44:59,112
And if I don't?

596
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:00,608
Well...

597
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:03,064
you could end up in this place
for a very long time.

598
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,017
Maybe meet with an accident.
Perhaps stay forever.

599
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,894
Well as we speak, I got
my man working on turning...

600
00:45:08,933 --> 00:45:11,771
this thing into the biggest
media circus you ever seen.

601
00:45:11,848 --> 00:45:14,034
Your man?

602
00:45:14,073 --> 00:45:14,993
Which one is this?

603
00:45:15,032 --> 00:45:16,183
My manager.

604
00:45:25,044 --> 00:45:26,386
Phil, what the fuck
are you doing up--

605
00:45:27,614 --> 00:45:29,839
Listen, George, everything
is going to be all right.

606
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:31,910
Gaga here has a great plan.

607
00:45:31,948 --> 00:45:33,137
We're all gonna make
a ton of money.

608
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:35,477
Oh, shit.

609
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:37,319
They told me the whole thing
would be quick.

610
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:38,623
That you'd be out in a week.

611
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:43,149
The money is huge. It's what
we've been waiting for.

612
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:45,873
You just need to stop being
so goddamned stubborn...

613
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,407
and take the fight.

614
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:51,282
Motherfucker! I'll kill
your motherfuckin' ass!

615
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,161
Backstabbing son of a bitch!

616
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,885
Don't be stupid.
Take the fight!

617
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,762
Shut up, dead man!
Shut the fuck up!

618
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,565
Fuck you!

619
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:12,149
I have good news.

620
00:46:13,722 --> 00:46:14,643
Tell me.

621
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:17,059
I'm so bloody excited, George.

622
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,018
Why?

623
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:19,323
Why?

624
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:22,046
You're going to fight
Boyka, that's why.

625
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:25,460
Hey...

626
00:46:25,537 --> 00:46:28,452
You don't need
a cornerman, do you?

627
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:30,293
Why, you got
somebody in mind?

628
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,748
George...

629
00:46:32,787 --> 00:46:34,513
I'm the only one you
can trust around here...

630
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:36,508
you know that, don't you?

631
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:52,734
Can I ask you something, George?

632
00:46:52,772 --> 00:46:53,808
What?

633
00:46:55,419 --> 00:46:58,334
If you got out of here...

634
00:46:58,373 --> 00:47:01,020
what's the first thing you'd do?

635
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:03,705
You mean "when" I get
out of here, right?

636
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:04,971
Of course.

637
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,883
I don't know, Stevie.

638
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:14,177
I'd try to see my wife.

639
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:18,051
You're married?

640
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,038
I like to think so.

641
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,644
She ever visit you here?

642
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:29,099
Once.

643
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,658
She's got a boyfriend now.

644
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:38,305
Commodities or something.

645
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:39,878
That's messed up, Stevie.

646
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:44,634
Doesn't hurt anymore.

647
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:46,361
Used to, you know?

648
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,123
Not anymore.

649
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,457
When are you getting
out of here, man?

650
00:47:55,145 --> 00:47:56,411
Ohh...

651
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,247
twelve years.

652
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:02,318
Damn!

653
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:04,888
Stevie...

654
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:07,535
you ever think about
cleaning your shit up?

655
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,591
What for?

656
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:54,641
Wow.

657
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,252
See, Stevie,
don't hold it like that.

658
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,247
Hold it like this.
You hold it like this...

659
00:48:58,285 --> 00:48:59,436
you'll rip your shoulder
out of the socket.

660
00:48:59,474 --> 00:49:01,162
So hold it like that,
you got it?

661
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,425
- I think so.
- Don't worry.

662
00:49:03,464 --> 00:49:05,612
All right. Jab.

663
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:07,108
Cross.

664
00:49:07,146 --> 00:49:08,489
Jab.

665
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:09,946
Cross... jab.

666
00:49:09,985 --> 00:49:10,905
# I'm gonna crush you #

667
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:12,248
# Thank you much #

668
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:14,588
# You can't compete with me,
I'm gonna flush you #

669
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:16,736
# Send you out to sea,
so take a number, line 'em up #

670
00:49:16,774 --> 00:49:19,229
# I'll cut you down like a tree,
I'm gonna crush you #

671
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:20,764
# Flatten out your brain,
gonna rush you #

672
00:49:20,841 --> 00:49:23,219
# You gonna get such pain,
they're gonna brush you #

673
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:24,638
# Dust you off the ring #

674
00:49:24,677 --> 00:49:26,940
# Bow down low 'cause there
can only be one king #

675
00:49:26,978 --> 00:49:29,702
# I'm dropping bombs on you
like a blitzkrieg crew #

676
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,039
# And you can't see through
the fog of this storm of power #

677
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:36,069
# 'Cause I am the man
of your life's last hour #

678
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:38,179
# You gonna feel my game
until you scream #

679
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:41,862
Ugh.

680
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:03,381
Hey. Hey.

681
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,724
Hey!

682
00:50:04,762 --> 00:50:07,524
Hey!!

683
00:50:07,563 --> 00:50:10,133
Oh, for fuck's sake, man.

684
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,086
I did everything
you asked, didn't l?

685
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:15,158
He's going to fight.

686
00:50:15,196 --> 00:50:17,881
We have one more job for you.

687
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,224
Understand?!

688
00:50:19,262 --> 00:50:21,756
Ha ha ha!

689
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:28,239
How did I do?

690
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:31,077
Not bad.

691
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,527
Time.

692
00:50:35,604 --> 00:50:36,908
Let's do this.

693
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:41,127
Have our friend in London...

694
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,930
put half a million on Boyka.

695
00:50:42,969 --> 00:50:44,465
Boyka?

696
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:49,029
But, sir, 80% of the money
coming in is on the American.

697
00:50:49,068 --> 00:50:50,602
Whatever you say, sir.

698
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:51,753
Gentlemen!

699
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:55,167
The fight you've
all been waiting for.

700
00:50:55,205 --> 00:50:59,118
To my right, fighting
out of the United States...

701
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:02,110
with a record of 38 victories...

702
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,872
and no defeats...

703
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:06,445
George...

704
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,705
Iceman Chambeeeers!

705
00:51:16,342 --> 00:51:17,454
And to my left...

706
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:20,983
a man who needs no introduction.

707
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:23,592
Our...own...

708
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,123
undisputed champion...

709
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,773
Uri...

710
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:28,962
Boyka!

711
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:31,263
Boyka! Boyka!

712
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,105
Boyka! Boyka!

713
00:51:33,143 --> 00:51:36,941
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

714
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:41,429
Boyka! Boyka!

715
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,835
Gentlemen, remember...

716
00:51:47,873 --> 00:51:52,246
no biting, no eye gouging,
and no hair pulling.

717
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:54,164
I'll beat you at your own game.

718
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,005
Fists only.

719
00:51:56,044 --> 00:51:58,039
Just don't bleed on me too much.

720
00:51:58,077 --> 00:52:00,033
Fight!

721
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:14,341
Boyka! Boyka!

722
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:16,528
Uh! Uh! Uh!

723
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,698
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

724
00:52:26,118 --> 00:52:27,729
- Unh! Unh!
- Ah!

725
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:34,595
Kill him! Come on!
Come on! Kill him!

726
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:53,315
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

727
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:54,926
Ow!

728
00:52:57,649 --> 00:52:58,877
Mmf! Uh! Uh!

729
00:52:58,915 --> 00:52:59,836
Unh!

730
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:01,485
Keep your hands up!

731
00:53:01,485 --> 00:53:02,444
Unh!

732
00:53:02,483 --> 00:53:03,480
Ugh!

733
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:10,845
Ugh!

734
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:12,840
Unh!

735
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:15,295
Ugh!

736
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:21,893
Oh!

737
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:25,345
One!

738
00:53:25,383 --> 00:53:28,145
Two!

739
00:53:28,184 --> 00:53:30,754
Three!

740
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:32,173
Four!

741
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:33,784
Argh!

742
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,743
Hey!

743
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:49,665
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

744
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:51,890
Boyka! Boyka!

745
00:53:55,457 --> 00:53:56,378
Argh!

746
00:53:56,416 --> 00:53:57,452
Boyka! Boyka!

747
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:00,176
Yaah! Yaah! Yaah!

748
00:54:00,214 --> 00:54:01,979
- Ugh!
- Argh!

749
00:54:01,979 --> 00:54:03,666
- Unh!
- Yah!

750
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:09,229
Ow!

751
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:17,284
Yaah! Ugh! Ugh!

752
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:20,775
Argh!

753
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:40,684
Ugh!

754
00:54:49,545 --> 00:54:51,271
Towel.

755
00:54:54,915 --> 00:54:56,181
Bucket.

756
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:00,247
Water.

757
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,740
Come on, Stevie!

758
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:11,141
Argh!

759
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,025
Boyka! Boyka!

760
00:55:28,403 --> 00:55:30,398
Fight!

761
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:34,886
- Unh!
- Yaah!

762
00:55:39,988 --> 00:55:41,560
Ugh!

763
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,056
Boyka! Boyka!

764
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:46,432
Unh!

765
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,391
Ugh, uh!

766
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:48,350
Ow!

767
00:55:55,025 --> 00:55:56,981
Ugh!

768
00:55:57,019 --> 00:55:57,940
Uh!

769
00:55:57,978 --> 00:56:00,318
Boyka! Boyka!

770
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:05,343
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

771
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:15,279
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

772
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,674
Uh!

773
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,212
Ugh!

774
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:48,383
What happened?

775
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:52,372
You were drugged.

776
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:56,016
Stevie.

777
00:56:57,129 --> 00:56:59,162
That motherfucker!

778
00:57:10,938 --> 00:57:12,741
That's your ass, Stevie.

779
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,429
You son of a bitch!

780
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:35,565
Stevie!

781
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:46,076
Oh...Ugh.

782
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:47,534
Man!

783
00:57:54,592 --> 00:57:56,356
Goddamn it, Stevie.

784
00:58:03,184 --> 00:58:04,412
You fuckin' pussy, get up!

785
00:58:07,979 --> 00:58:09,168
I am pussy?

786
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:10,127
Ha ha ha!

787
00:58:10,166 --> 00:58:12,160
I am pussy?
Look at your face!

788
00:58:12,237 --> 00:58:13,963
You are a fuckin' pussy.

789
00:58:14,002 --> 00:58:16,188
That fight was bullshit
and you know it.

790
00:58:16,227 --> 00:58:18,336
You had Stevie drug me,
and that's how you won.

791
00:58:24,704 --> 00:58:27,504
I am the best fighter
in the world.

792
00:58:27,543 --> 00:58:30,420
I do not need your junkie
friend to help me win.

793
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:33,143
Can you believe
this fuckin' American?

794
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,442
You drug your opponents and
you call yourself a fighter?

795
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,398
I do not know what
you're talking about.

796
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:40,278
You make big excuse
because you lose!

797
00:58:41,275 --> 00:58:43,193
You should be happy
I did not finish you.

798
00:58:43,232 --> 00:58:46,147
You guys can't get
enough of each other.

799
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,433
Move over back to your cell.

800
00:58:54,471 --> 00:58:56,696
Man, fuck you!
You said I'd get out.

801
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,650
I know nothing about
this arrangement, George,

802
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:01,875
but surely, I'll look into it.

803
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,754
You lying mother--!

804
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:04,752
Ow!

805
00:59:06,094 --> 00:59:08,396
You told me I was gonna
get out of here! Get off me! Get off!

806
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:09,393
To the pole!

807
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:17,640
Ugh! I'm gonna
have your ass, punk!

808
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,175
I'm gonna have
your ass, punk!

809
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:22,205
Wait till I get outta here!
Yeah, you, punk! You!

810
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,274
Markov!
You motherfuck--!

811
00:59:25,351 --> 00:59:27,882
You understand
what I'm--unh!

812
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:28,841
You--! Unh!

813
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,800
Ow!

814
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,296
Ow! Ugh!

815
00:59:32,524 --> 00:59:34,557
There's a rumor.

816
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:38,163
The American was given a bottle
of water with something in it.

817
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:41,308
I'm told you know
something about it.

818
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,490
Boyka...no.

819
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,369
Is it true?

820
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,438
Answer him.

821
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:52,049
But--

822
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:54,773
Look at this!

823
00:59:54,811 --> 00:59:55,847
Look!

824
00:59:57,151 --> 00:59:58,148
Egyptians!

825
00:59:58,187 --> 01:00:00,910
Greeks! Asians!
American boxers!

826
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:03,480
All made fighting
into a science.

827
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:04,823
Ugh!

828
01:00:04,823 --> 01:00:07,239
I am the next stage.

829
01:00:07,316 --> 01:00:08,544
And you think I need you...

830
01:00:08,582 --> 01:00:11,459
to drug my opponents?

831
01:00:27,148 --> 01:00:29,910
Wipe this fuckin' trash
off my floor.

832
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:48,553
Listen.

833
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,391
I was wondering when you're
planning on releasing him.

834
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,192
I mean, since the deal is done.

835
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:59,140
Since when did you start...

836
01:00:59,178 --> 01:01:00,981
caring about Mr. Chambers, Phil?

837
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:02,823
Well, it's not that.

838
01:01:02,861 --> 01:01:05,469
It's just, people are
starting to ask questions.

839
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:06,927
Questions.

840
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:08,692
What do you want, Phil?

841
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:11,684
Well, given the, uh...

842
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:15,520
unexpected hassles,
the delays...

843
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:16,862
I'd like another 250.

844
01:01:16,901 --> 01:01:19,547
Ah, ok. 250 it is.

845
01:01:19,586 --> 01:01:20,928
Oh! That's great.

846
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,148
240. 250,000.

847
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:26,222
Thank you.

848
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,669
I guess this is good-bye, then.

849
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,278
Have a nice trip, Mr. Gold.

850
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:35,428
Thank you.

851
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:49,123
Oh!

852
01:02:56,597 --> 01:02:57,633
Now what?

853
01:03:00,855 --> 01:03:02,505
What the hell
you looking at?

854
01:04:35,565 --> 01:04:38,059
It has been brought
to my attention...

855
01:04:38,097 --> 01:04:40,936
that a few of you
have been interfering...

856
01:04:40,974 --> 01:04:43,544
with the punishment
of inmate Chambers.

857
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,501
All those responsible...

858
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:48,838
identify themselves now
by raising their hands.

859
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,686
Step forward!

860
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,900
Anyone else?

861
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:15,344
Ah-ha.

862
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:18,989
I see.

863
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:37,785
Very cute.

864
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:39,703
So now you'll stand out here...

865
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:42,158
in the fucking cold
and think about it!

866
01:06:00,494 --> 01:06:02,297
Shut up. I told you
to do nothing...

867
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:03,716
nothing without asking me first.

868
01:06:04,905 --> 01:06:06,056
Shut the fuck up!

869
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:07,207
If anything happens to him...

870
01:06:07,245 --> 01:06:09,086
I will strip you naked...

871
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:11,004
and hang you by the balls
from the watchtower.

872
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:12,193
- Heh.
- Open the door.

873
01:06:12,193 --> 01:06:13,920
- Gaga--
- Now, Vlad!

874
01:06:18,906 --> 01:06:20,211
It was never meant
you'd be put out...

875
01:06:20,249 --> 01:06:22,551
in the cold like that,
Mr. Chambers. I apologize.

876
01:06:23,164 --> 01:06:26,233
We had a deal.
I fight, I go free.

877
01:06:26,271 --> 01:06:28,803
No, the deal was...

878
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,143
you win, you go free.

879
01:06:32,486 --> 01:06:34,250
I was drugged and you know it.

880
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,897
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

881
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:41,308
Maybe next time you fight Boyka...

882
01:06:41,308 --> 01:06:44,224
you should pick
a better cornerman.

883
01:06:44,262 --> 01:06:45,490
Fuck you!

884
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:48,674
There ain't gonna be
a next time.

885
01:06:48,674 --> 01:06:51,666
Listen to me, George.
It's very simple.

886
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:59,338
I make my money.
You make your exit.

887
01:07:01,486 --> 01:07:02,982
Fuck you!

888
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:05,935
Fuck me?

889
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:08,927
As you wish.

890
01:07:11,536 --> 01:07:13,416
Enjoy the rest
of your stay here...

891
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:14,413
Mr. Chambers.

892
01:07:20,052 --> 01:07:21,011
Hold on.

893
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:26,841
No drugs.

894
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,102
Not me, not Boyka.

895
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,288
We fight straight up.

896
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:34,322
Of course.

897
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:35,587
Look, George...

898
01:07:35,626 --> 01:07:38,311
keeping you here any longer
is a bit of a hassle for me.

899
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:40,804
You're, uh, too visible.

900
01:07:40,843 --> 01:07:43,681
All I want is one more fight.

901
01:07:43,681 --> 01:07:45,139
One.

902
01:07:46,098 --> 01:07:47,325
And Phil?

903
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:48,898
Heh.

904
01:07:48,937 --> 01:07:50,433
You don't have
to worry about Phil.

905
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:53,616
Where he is, money...heh...

906
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:55,880
Money is not a factor.

907
01:07:59,102 --> 01:08:02,171
Anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Chambers?

908
01:08:06,812 --> 01:08:08,001
Yeah.

909
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:11,607
I'm gonna need one
more thing from you.

910
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:18,391
George?

911
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,260
You know where
this coat come from?

912
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,710
'Cause I hear it come from...

913
01:09:28,787 --> 01:09:33,083
selfish asshole who never
does anything for anyone else.

914
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:35,538
Why?

915
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,456
Why you think?

916
01:09:37,494 --> 01:09:39,067
It's cold as a motherfucker
around here.

917
01:09:40,487 --> 01:09:43,095
You know, George,
I saw first fight.

918
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:45,665
I saw something
in first round.

919
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:47,928
Something
in your eyes.

920
01:09:47,967 --> 01:09:50,575
Before you started
to look drunk.

921
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:52,723
Ok, Crot,
what did you see?

922
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:55,370
What did you see, George?

923
01:09:57,748 --> 01:09:59,628
Tsk.

924
01:09:59,705 --> 01:10:01,162
OK.

925
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,886
Maybe I underestimated
the guy a little bit.

926
01:10:03,924 --> 01:10:05,612
But I know how he fights now.

927
01:10:05,612 --> 01:10:08,182
And that same stuff ain't
gonna work on me a second time.

928
01:10:08,182 --> 01:10:09,448
I'm gonna figure somethin' out.

929
01:10:09,486 --> 01:10:12,402
Maybe...you need a little help.

930
01:10:13,553 --> 01:10:14,473
Oh, you gonna help me?

931
01:10:16,506 --> 01:10:19,076
I'm no fighter, George.

932
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:21,838
But I was once trained
how to hurt people.

933
01:10:21,877 --> 01:10:24,101
I know a thing or two
about grappling...

934
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:25,751
military close combat.

935
01:10:25,789 --> 01:10:28,551
Things you might need
in this type of fight.

936
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:32,771
You know what, Crot?
Thanks, but I'm OK.

937
01:10:33,116 --> 01:10:34,190
Hey, this is all
street fighting anyway,

938
01:10:34,228 --> 01:10:35,571
and that's what I'm from.

939
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:37,374
I'll just go home on his ass.

940
01:10:37,412 --> 01:10:41,133
Besides, all that kickboxing
and grappling stuff...

941
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,706
- it's overrated.
- Aah!

942
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:45,468
# I move weight like a freight
truck, build the muscle #

943
01:10:45,506 --> 01:10:47,002
# You can't escape your fate,
we ain't scared to tussle #

944
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:48,728
Aaah!

945
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:49,802
# I put the pressure
on your offense #

946
01:10:49,841 --> 01:10:51,452
# You can't advance,
I'm a pro #

947
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,715
# Hit the bench, bro,
you had your chance #

948
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:56,362
# Do my dance in the end zone,
and hone my skill #

949
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,009
# If I don't take it
all the way, no one will #

950
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:01,119
# Get back, you outta line,
you outta your mind #

951
01:11:01,157 --> 01:11:03,190
# You outta time,
keep searching, brotha #

952
01:11:03,228 --> 01:11:04,878
# How do you find
another man #

953
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,834
# As efficient
as this machine I am? #

954
01:11:06,873 --> 01:11:08,752
Beat me at my own game, huh?

955
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:12,818
I'm gonna beat you at yours.

956
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,544
Hmm.

957
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:16,117
Now listen, George.

958
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:18,189
Man is like pyramid...

959
01:11:18,227 --> 01:11:20,644
but upside down.

960
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:24,671
You cut his legs--
Finish.

961
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,200
OK.
How do we...begin?

962
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:33,034
Now get on top of me.

963
01:11:33,072 --> 01:11:35,067
Sorry, man, I'm just
not attracted to you.

964
01:11:35,105 --> 01:11:37,407
Maybe it's the beard.

965
01:11:38,558 --> 01:11:41,128
You want to train
or you want to joke?

966
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,163
# Bring it on #

967
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:43,698
# And I'm ready to eat #

968
01:11:43,775 --> 01:11:45,232
# So if you're scared,
get outta here #

969
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:46,728
# Before you get beat #

970
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:47,687
# Bring it on #

971
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:49,260
# Yeah, the heat is on #

972
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:50,718
# You better get
your best to the plate #

973
01:11:50,718 --> 01:11:51,677
# Or it be the gong #

974
01:11:51,753 --> 01:11:53,173
# Calculate the magnitude #

975
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:54,937
# Of the situation
you're facing #

976
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:56,855
# No time for pacing,
there's no time for wastin' #

977
01:11:56,894 --> 01:11:57,814
Unh!

978
01:11:57,853 --> 01:11:59,425
So this is a basic arm lock.

979
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:02,993
When you punch, I grab.

980
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:05,755
I wrap arm.

981
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:08,133
Put pressure, you see?

982
01:12:11,048 --> 01:12:14,040
You know the old man
is training the American?

983
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,917
Is that supposed to scare me?

984
01:12:16,956 --> 01:12:19,564
He can learn any fucking
thing he wants.

985
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:20,792
Yaah!

986
01:12:22,249 --> 01:12:24,474
He's still not going
to leave that ring alive.

987
01:12:29,154 --> 01:12:30,113
# Bring it on #

988
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,532
# Do you accept the challenge? #

989
01:12:31,532 --> 01:12:32,837
# Bring it on #

990
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,294
# I'm-a test your balance #

991
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:35,330
- Argh!
- # Bring it on #

992
01:12:35,368 --> 01:12:36,596
# You can't stand the violence #

993
01:12:36,634 --> 01:12:37,977
# Bring it on #

994
01:12:38,015 --> 01:12:39,473
# Put your tail between
your legs, leave in silence #

995
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:41,161
- # Bring it on #
- Argh!

996
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,120
# You can't handle the heat #

997
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:43,194
# Bring it on #

998
01:13:07,322 --> 01:13:08,780
Hey, man, sorry. Uh--

999
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:10,467
No, it's OK.

1000
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:20,441
Potato vodka.

1001
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:32,524
I make it in my toilet.

1002
01:13:33,752 --> 01:13:35,363
No, man, I'm gonna pass.

1003
01:13:37,242 --> 01:13:39,122
Of course, you are in training.

1004
01:13:41,577 --> 01:13:43,610
So what's up
with the photograph?

1005
01:13:53,737 --> 01:13:55,578
She's beautiful, isn't she?

1006
01:13:56,883 --> 01:13:57,803
Who is she?

1007
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,182
My niece.

1008
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,984
She's almost nineteen, now.

1009
01:14:02,023 --> 01:14:03,711
She ever visit you here?

1010
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:05,207
No.

1011
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:07,738
Never.

1012
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:08,736
Why not?

1013
01:14:11,459 --> 01:14:12,917
She doesn't know that I'm here...

1014
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:14,413
that I exist.

1015
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:17,328
I never want her
to come to this place.

1016
01:14:20,474 --> 01:14:23,121
Hey, I was just wondering...

1017
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:24,425
what happened?

1018
01:14:24,463 --> 01:14:26,113
How did you get yourself
in this place?

1019
01:14:28,951 --> 01:14:31,215
When I was in the army...

1020
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:33,324
my younger brother...

1021
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:37,275
he robbed party headquarters
near our house.

1022
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:40,459
It happened when
I was home on leave.

1023
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:44,909
He come home one day...

1024
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:47,326
and I see it in his eyes.

1025
01:14:47,364 --> 01:14:50,816
He tells me he just
made a big mistake.

1026
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,885
- Your brother?
- Yes.

1027
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:56,417
Well, why the hell isn't
he here instead of you?

1028
01:14:56,455 --> 01:14:58,603
Victor was brilliant.

1029
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,636
He had a future...

1030
01:15:00,713 --> 01:15:02,669
And a wife.

1031
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,281
A pregnant wife.

1032
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:06,851
Me?

1033
01:15:08,615 --> 01:15:11,224
I was only a trained
killer for Brezhnev.

1034
01:15:13,027 --> 01:15:14,484
So...

1035
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:16,824
you basically traded
your life for his.

1036
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,860
No, no.

1037
01:15:17,898 --> 01:15:20,200
I-I was given only four
years for the robbery.

1038
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:22,732
But when I got here they
tried to drive me crazy.

1039
01:15:22,808 --> 01:15:24,995
So finally, I decided to escape.

1040
01:15:25,033 --> 01:15:26,529
I tried twice, actually.

1041
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:28,102
The second time
there was a fight.

1042
01:15:28,179 --> 01:15:29,598
A guard got killed.

1043
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:32,897
I was also shot, paralyzed.

1044
01:15:32,974 --> 01:15:35,620
They put me here in solitary.

1045
01:15:35,659 --> 01:15:37,538
Soviet style.

1046
01:15:37,577 --> 01:15:39,878
You see, George?

1047
01:15:39,917 --> 01:15:42,257
I accepted my reality.

1048
01:15:44,175 --> 01:15:46,860
This is where I belong.

1049
01:15:46,898 --> 01:15:49,737
And this is where I will die.

1050
01:15:51,693 --> 01:15:53,611
I don't get it, Crot.

1051
01:15:54,992 --> 01:15:56,143
It's Nikolai.

1052
01:15:56,143 --> 01:15:57,601
Huh?

1053
01:15:57,601 --> 01:16:01,858
My name, it's Nikolai.

1054
01:16:01,897 --> 01:16:03,776
And I know you don't get it.

1055
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:09,147
# Oh, yeah #

1056
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:11,985
Argh!

1057
01:16:12,024 --> 01:16:14,172
# It's an illusion #

1058
01:16:15,131 --> 01:16:16,550
Ugh!

1059
01:16:25,143 --> 01:16:26,562
Ow!

1060
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:27,828
Ugh!

1061
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:31,779
- Ow!
- Argh!

1062
01:16:33,313 --> 01:16:34,656
Argh!

1063
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:38,952
Now on top of shoulder.

1064
01:16:40,026 --> 01:16:41,484
Lock with head.

1065
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:44,591
Now press on top of knee.

1066
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:47,813
Press, George.

1067
01:16:47,852 --> 01:16:49,348
Harder!

1068
01:16:49,386 --> 01:16:51,036
If I press any harder
it's gonna break.

1069
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:53,030
Good, maybe I start
to feel the leg again.

1070
01:16:59,897 --> 01:17:01,393
Boyka.

1071
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,612
Boyka.

1072
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:06,533
Chambers.

1073
01:17:07,530 --> 01:17:09,180
Chambers.

1074
01:17:12,824 --> 01:17:14,512
Boyka.

1075
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:15,701
Chambers.

1076
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,619
Chambers.

1077
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:29,127
You are trippin'.

1078
01:17:32,042 --> 01:17:34,689
Tonight, I settle it forever.

1079
01:17:35,648 --> 01:17:38,103
I beat this man again...

1080
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,596
then there is no question.

1081
01:17:43,051 --> 01:17:45,967
I'm the most complete
fighter in the world.

1082
01:17:46,005 --> 01:17:48,115
Remember, George...

1083
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:49,764
when fight is over...

1084
01:17:49,841 --> 01:17:51,836
you need to leave fast.
Don't look back.

1085
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,441
Listen...

1086
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:56,861
Nikolai, l, uh...

1087
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:01,272
- I'm glad that--
- No, shut up.

1088
01:18:01,272 --> 01:18:03,037
Stay mean for fight.

1089
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:09,404
Yeah, you're right.

1090
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,547
I'll see you later.

1091
01:18:13,586 --> 01:18:14,775
George...

1092
01:18:20,912 --> 01:18:22,293
I'm glad, too.

1093
01:18:27,855 --> 01:18:31,116
Once again, please welcome...

1094
01:18:31,154 --> 01:18:36,026
former Heavyweight Boxing
Champion of the World...

1095
01:18:36,064 --> 01:18:37,023
George...

1096
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:39,555
Iceman Chambeeers!

1097
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:43,544
Chambers! Chambers!

1098
01:18:43,621 --> 01:18:45,616
And now, let's welcome...

1099
01:18:45,693 --> 01:18:50,411
our own undefeated
Heavyweight Champion...

1100
01:18:50,488 --> 01:18:53,096
Uri Boykaaaaa!

1101
01:18:54,093 --> 01:18:55,896
Boyka! Boyka!

1102
01:18:55,935 --> 01:18:56,855
Boyka! Boyka!

1103
01:18:56,894 --> 01:18:59,656
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1104
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,650
- Boyka! Boyka!
- Chambers!

1105
01:19:13,005 --> 01:19:16,112
Boyka! Boyka!

1106
01:19:19,027 --> 01:19:20,485
Fight!

1107
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:21,482
Unh!

1108
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,400
- Unh! Ah!
- Uh!

1109
01:19:30,075 --> 01:19:31,302
Unh! Unh! Unh!

1110
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:37,555
Argh! Unh!

1111
01:19:39,665 --> 01:19:40,739
Ugh!

1112
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:41,928
Argh!

1113
01:19:41,966 --> 01:19:42,925
Yeah!

1114
01:19:42,964 --> 01:19:43,923
Unh!

1115
01:19:45,265 --> 01:19:47,068
- Argh!
- Unh!

1116
01:19:47,106 --> 01:19:49,446
Argh!

1117
01:19:51,173 --> 01:19:52,630
- Unh! Ah!
- Uh!

1118
01:19:53,628 --> 01:19:54,932
Argh!

1119
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,658
Ugh!

1120
01:19:57,732 --> 01:19:58,653
Move in!

1121
01:19:58,691 --> 01:20:00,954
Boyka! Boyka!

1122
01:20:00,993 --> 01:20:02,105
- Argh!
- Yah!

1123
01:20:02,143 --> 01:20:03,102
Ugh!

1124
01:20:05,136 --> 01:20:06,938
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

1125
01:20:09,509 --> 01:20:10,966
Argh!

1126
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:11,925
Ow!

1127
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:20,019
Stop! Round's over!

1128
01:20:24,622 --> 01:20:26,080
Not bad for first round, George.

1129
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:27,883
But why you don't
use your new technique?

1130
01:20:27,921 --> 01:20:29,187
I'm working on it.

1131
01:20:30,146 --> 01:20:32,409
Boyka, make him wait.

1132
01:20:32,448 --> 01:20:35,325
Remember, take his leg.

1133
01:20:38,739 --> 01:20:40,196
Fight!

1134
01:20:43,457 --> 01:20:44,608
Unh!

1135
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:48,329
Argh!

1136
01:20:50,362 --> 01:20:52,126
Unh! Uh!

1137
01:20:54,543 --> 01:20:56,000
Unh! Ugh!

1138
01:20:57,496 --> 01:20:58,686
Arrrgh!

1139
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,481
Ugh! Unh!

1140
01:21:03,519 --> 01:21:05,590
- Argh!
- Ow!

1141
01:21:05,629 --> 01:21:07,125
Ugh!

1142
01:21:08,621 --> 01:21:10,999
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

1143
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:12,725
Boyka! Boyka!

1144
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:14,029
Unh!

1145
01:21:15,487 --> 01:21:16,523
Ow!

1146
01:21:17,904 --> 01:21:19,438
Arrrgh!

1147
01:21:23,197 --> 01:21:24,118
Argh!

1148
01:21:25,729 --> 01:21:27,455
Argh!

1149
01:21:27,494 --> 01:21:28,721
Argh!

1150
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,680
Take him!

1151
01:21:35,626 --> 01:21:36,930
Argh!

1152
01:21:47,172 --> 01:21:48,860
Listen to me, George.

1153
01:21:48,898 --> 01:21:50,011
You must finish him...

1154
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:51,737
or you will rot in
this stinking hole...

1155
01:21:51,814 --> 01:21:53,195
for the rest of your life.

1156
01:21:53,271 --> 01:21:55,305
Like me!

1157
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,335
- Go!
- Ugh!

1158
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:01,902
I am the champion.

1159
01:22:03,322 --> 01:22:05,662
They will never let you
out of here.

1160
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,807
Do you understand me, George?

1161
01:22:08,845 --> 01:22:09,958
What are you waiting for?

1162
01:22:09,996 --> 01:22:11,300
The bell.

1163
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,446
Argh!

1164
01:22:17,783 --> 01:22:18,742
Ow!

1165
01:22:19,778 --> 01:22:20,737
Yaaah!

1166
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:24,113
# You can't advance,
I'm the storm at night #

1167
01:22:24,228 --> 01:22:26,951
# Bring it on
and be ready to fight #

1168
01:22:27,028 --> 01:22:28,409
# Do you accept
the challenge? #

1169
01:22:28,447 --> 01:22:29,560
# Bring it on #

1170
01:22:29,636 --> 01:22:30,864
# I'm-a test your balance #

1171
01:22:30,902 --> 01:22:31,900
# Bring it on #

1172
01:22:31,976 --> 01:22:32,897
# You can't stand
the violence #

1173
01:22:32,935 --> 01:22:34,355
- Ow!
- # Bring it on #

1174
01:22:34,431 --> 01:22:36,234
# So put your tail between your
legs and run off in silence #

1175
01:22:36,273 --> 01:22:37,385
# Bring it on #

1176
01:22:37,423 --> 01:22:38,689
# You can't handle the heat #

1177
01:22:38,689 --> 01:22:39,763
# Bring it on #

1178
01:22:39,802 --> 01:22:41,605
# This cannibal
is hungry for meat #

1179
01:22:41,643 --> 01:22:42,871
# Bring it on #

1180
01:22:42,909 --> 01:22:44,712
# And I'm ready to eat,
so if you're scared #

1181
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,515
# Get outta here
before you get beat #

1182
01:22:46,515 --> 01:22:48,740
# Bring it on #

1183
01:22:51,003 --> 01:22:52,652
Chambers! Chambers!

1184
01:22:52,691 --> 01:22:54,647
# Is to shine more bright
in the sunlight #

1185
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:55,836
# I'm the storm at night #

1186
01:22:55,874 --> 01:22:58,329
# Bring it on
and be ready to fight #

1187
01:22:58,368 --> 01:22:59,864
# Do you accept the challenge? #

1188
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,396
Unh!

1189
01:23:02,472 --> 01:23:04,045
Argh!
Argh!

1190
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:05,886
Now on top of shoulder.

1191
01:23:05,925 --> 01:23:06,845
Argh!

1192
01:23:06,884 --> 01:23:07,804
Lock with head.

1193
01:23:07,843 --> 01:23:08,763
Argh!

1194
01:23:08,802 --> 01:23:10,643
Argh!

1195
01:23:10,681 --> 01:23:11,717
Press harder!

1196
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:13,980
Fuck you!

1197
01:23:15,246 --> 01:23:16,243
Argh!

1198
01:23:17,663 --> 01:23:18,775
Press, George.

1199
01:23:20,118 --> 01:23:21,077
Harder.

1200
01:23:22,304 --> 01:23:23,493
Ugh!

1201
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:24,644
If I press any harder
it's gonna break.

1202
01:23:26,447 --> 01:23:27,636
I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

1203
01:23:28,864 --> 01:23:30,206
Aaaah!

1204
01:23:30,206 --> 01:23:31,702
- Yes!
- Aaah!

1205
01:23:31,779 --> 01:23:34,272
Aaah!

1206
01:23:34,349 --> 01:23:35,577
Aaaargh!

1207
01:23:35,615 --> 01:23:36,612
Argh!

1208
01:23:36,689 --> 01:23:38,147
Aah!

1209
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:45,358
Don't touch me!

1210
01:23:49,194 --> 01:23:55,102
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1211
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:57,710
Chambers! Chambers!

1212
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:02,659
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1213
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:05,037
Chambers! Chambers!

1214
01:24:05,075 --> 01:24:06,763
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1215
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:09,870
Chambers! Chambers!
Chambers! Chambers!

1216
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:13,745
Chambers! Chambers!

1217
01:24:13,821 --> 01:24:15,893
You made a fortune.

1218
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:20,112
Yeah. I had a feeling
our luck would change.

1219
01:24:20,112 --> 01:24:21,186
Hmm?

1220
01:24:26,595 --> 01:24:28,168
Chambers! Chambers!

1221
01:24:44,701 --> 01:24:47,002
Congratulations, Mr. Chambers.

1222
01:24:49,035 --> 01:24:50,532
I'm outta here, right?

1223
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:54,367
Yes, you are.

1224
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:58,357
One moment.

1225
01:25:01,617 --> 01:25:02,576
What's this?

1226
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:05,147
Your cut.

1227
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,404
Listen, George,
it was never my intention...

1228
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:11,322
to make your stay here
so unpleasant.

1229
01:25:11,361 --> 01:25:14,161
I'm sorry for that.
One more moment.

1230
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:16,885
Do you mind if we take
a photo together, me and you?

1231
01:25:16,923 --> 01:25:19,570
Not for me. My nephew.

1232
01:25:19,608 --> 01:25:21,373
Big fan of yours.

1233
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:23,636
Let me tell you something.

1234
01:25:23,636 --> 01:25:26,244
I'm not gonna forget
what you did to me.

1235
01:25:26,283 --> 01:25:27,855
Ever.

1236
01:25:27,894 --> 01:25:29,658
And I will see you again.

1237
01:25:29,697 --> 01:25:31,768
That's my word.

1238
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:33,494
But right now...

1239
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:35,412
I'd like to get
the hell out of here.

1240
01:25:35,451 --> 01:25:36,870
Sure.

1241
01:25:47,496 --> 01:25:48,723
One moment.

1242
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:54,362
Where the fuck is he going now?

1243
01:25:58,927 --> 01:26:01,075
I wouldn't try anything
stupid, Mr. Chambers.

1244
01:26:01,075 --> 01:26:02,341
There are guards outside.

1245
01:26:02,379 --> 01:26:05,256
Relax, I just need to talk
to you about something.

1246
01:26:05,256 --> 01:26:06,791
What?

1247
01:26:11,854 --> 01:26:13,312
I wanna make a deal.

1248
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:23,822
Came to say good-bye, huh?

1249
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:27,121
Yeah.

1250
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:31,226
You did well.

1251
01:26:32,722 --> 01:26:35,599
I did all right.

1252
01:26:35,637 --> 01:26:37,517
Do you still have
that jacket I got you?

1253
01:26:37,555 --> 01:26:39,013
Of course.

1254
01:26:42,043 --> 01:26:44,306
I will hold on to it forever.

1255
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:46,301
Well, now that's up to you...

1256
01:26:46,378 --> 01:26:48,564
but you better grab it
and put it on right now.

1257
01:26:49,523 --> 01:26:50,444
Why?

1258
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:53,628
Because, Nikolai...

1259
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:56,658
there's an 18-year-old girl
who needs to meet her uncle.

1260
01:26:56,696 --> 01:26:58,806
And it's cold as
a motherfucker out there.

1261
01:27:17,487 --> 01:27:19,866
I don't know about this, George.

1262
01:27:22,129 --> 01:27:23,740
It's all right, Nikolai.

1263
01:27:23,778 --> 01:27:26,042
You got a lot of time
to let it sink in now.

1264
01:27:35,325 --> 01:27:38,393
I'm telling you, George,
it's a mistake.

1265
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:39,928
No, it ain't.

1266
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,174
No, I can't.

1267
01:28:32,212 --> 01:28:34,590
Ah! Yes, you can.

1268
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:35,741
No, I can't.

1269
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:38,081
- Go.
- Oh, George.

1270
01:30:08,572 --> 01:30:10,029
# Oh #

1271
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:12,791
# I move weight like a freight
truck, build the muscle #

1272
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:15,246
# You can't escape your fate,
we ain't scared to tussle #

1273
01:30:15,323 --> 01:30:17,855
# I put the pressure on your
offense, you can't advance #

1274
01:30:17,893 --> 01:30:20,617
# I'm a pro, hit the bench, bro,
you had your chance #

1275
01:30:20,655 --> 01:30:23,378
# Do that dance in the end zone
and hone my skill #

1276
01:30:23,455 --> 01:30:25,987
# If I don't take it
all the way, no one will #

1277
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:28,519
# Get back, you outta line,
you outta your mind #

1278
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:30,360
# You outta time,
keep searching, brotha #

1279
01:30:30,398 --> 01:30:32,278
# How do you find
another man #

1280
01:30:32,278 --> 01:30:34,158
# As efficient
as this machine I am? #

1281
01:30:34,196 --> 01:30:37,150
# I was born immortal,
to be the king of the sport, a portal #

1282
01:30:37,188 --> 01:30:39,298
# Just follow me
to the next dimension #

1283
01:30:39,336 --> 01:30:41,906
# You get lifted like
these plates I'm benchin' #

1284
01:30:41,945 --> 01:30:43,479
# Go ahead,
put your two cents in #

1285
01:30:43,517 --> 01:30:44,898
# Your worries
are worthless #

1286
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:47,507
# Takes a strong-like mind
to understand my purpose #

1287
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:49,616
# It's to shine
more bright than sunlight #

1288
01:30:49,655 --> 01:30:50,997
# I'm the storm at night #

1289
01:30:50,997 --> 01:30:52,839
# Bring it on,
if you ready to fight #

1290
01:30:52,877 --> 01:30:53,836
# Bring it on #

1291
01:30:53,874 --> 01:30:54,948
# Do you accept the challenge? #

1292
01:30:55,025 --> 01:30:56,138
# Bring it on #

1293
01:30:56,214 --> 01:30:57,749
# I'm-a test your balance #

1294
01:30:57,825 --> 01:30:58,746
# Bring it on #

1295
01:30:58,823 --> 01:31:00,319
# You can't stand the violence #

1296
01:31:00,396 --> 01:31:03,157
# So put your tail between
your legs and leave in silence #

1297
01:31:03,196 --> 01:31:04,116
# Bring it on #

1298
01:31:04,155 --> 01:31:05,536
# You can't handle the heat #

1299
01:31:05,612 --> 01:31:07,032
# Bring it on #

1300
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,336
# This cannibal
is hungry for meat #

1301
01:31:08,374 --> 01:31:09,640
# Bring it on #

1302
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,520
# And I'm ready to eat,
so if you're scared #

1303
01:31:11,558 --> 01:31:13,515
# Get outta here
before you get beat #

1304
01:31:13,553 --> 01:31:14,665
# Bring it on #

1305
01:31:14,704 --> 01:31:16,200
# Yeah, the heat is on #

1306
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:19,115
# You better get your best
to the plate or it be the gong #

1307
01:31:19,153 --> 01:31:21,685
# Calculate the magnitude of
the situation you're facing #

1308
01:31:21,762 --> 01:31:24,102
# No time for pacin',
there's no time for wastin' #

1309
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,058
# What, you thought
it would be a cake walk? #

1310
01:31:26,097 --> 01:31:28,245
# I won't make it easy
for you to hate-talk #

1311
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:29,472
# The trash is big #

1312
01:31:29,549 --> 01:31:31,467
# No, I couldn't let
you do it no longer #

1313
01:31:31,544 --> 01:31:34,382
# So I built up mass
and my passion is stronger #

1314
01:31:34,459 --> 01:31:37,221
# To the point that
I need an extra me to hold it #

1315
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:38,333
# So think
that you could try #

1316
01:31:38,372 --> 01:31:40,059
# But ain't no need
to fold it #

1317
01:31:40,098 --> 01:31:42,630
# Or bend it any which way,
nothing is happening #

1318
01:31:42,668 --> 01:31:45,315
# Just me groovin' here,
I'm-a keep on rappin' #

1319
01:31:45,353 --> 01:31:48,115
# And then the competition has
to retire, no other chance #

1320
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:50,685
# Who can do it like I do it?
No other voice #

1321
01:31:50,723 --> 01:31:53,370
# If you need some help, call
the doctor, get some medicine #

1322
01:31:53,409 --> 01:31:54,828
# I'll expire you,
bring you back to life #

1323
01:31:54,866 --> 01:31:56,055
# And make you dead again #

1324
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,014
# Bring it on #

1325
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,587
# Do you accept the challenge?#

1326
01:31:58,626 --> 01:31:59,738
# Bring it on #

1327
01:31:59,776 --> 01:32:01,234
# I'm-a test your balance #

1328
01:32:01,311 --> 01:32:02,308
# Bring it on #

1329
