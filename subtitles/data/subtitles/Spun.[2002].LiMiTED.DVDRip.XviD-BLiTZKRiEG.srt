No, I got it.
I got it, I got it.

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,740
I got it. Thank you.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,660
You're very helpful, okay?
Yeah, yeah, and cute.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,100
- Who is it?
- It's Ross.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,020
- Are you by yourself?
- Yeah, I'm by myself.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,180
You sure?

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,980
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm by myself.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,020
Yeah, that's it.
Just stay right there.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,060
Get in here. Hurry up.

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,380
- How much do you need?
- What you gave me last time was cool.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,180
- How much you want?
- Whatever you got.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,300
You know what?

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,180
I lost my shit. I have to find it,
so if you don't mind relaxing a little bit?

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,820
- No, I can come back.
- No, no. It's okay.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,380
- You sure?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,580
It's great to see you. Why don't
you sit down and talk to...

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,060
To Nikki. Talk to Nikki.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,740
Nikki, this is Ross.
Ross, this is Nikki.

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,020
You know Frisbee over there.

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,300
What?

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,580
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

28
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,340
And you just stay, relax, just sit down
and let me find my shit, okay?

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,420
So...

30
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,460
...what you looking at?
- I just need a little bit.

31
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,420
- What do you mean? Half or something?
- I don't need that much.

32
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,940
I don't even have that much money.
I just need a dime.

33
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,820
- Oh, I got it.
- I got it.

34
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,100
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,140
- Who is it?
- Giggles.

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,700
LA Sadgirl.
From Circus Liquors.

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,900
- I'm busy right now.
- You're busy? Can we stop by later?

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,500
What part of busy don't you understand?
I don't got anything. Goodbye!

If Spider doesn't get his shit together,
I can probably help you out.

41
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
I got it!

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,580
No, don't answer my phone.
Don't answer my phone!

43
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,260
Hello?

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,860
No. He's unavailable at the moment.

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,260
You'll have to call back later.

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,260
Much, much later. Later.

47
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,900
Who is it?

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,460
It's just me, Spider.

49
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,940
Hey. Go away, fat boy!

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,300
- I said, go away, fat boy!
- Okay, okay. I'll see you later.

51
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,820
- Mike, who called on the telephone?
- Why don't you sit down...

52
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,900
...and talk to your friend Nikki.

53
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,740
- Hey, Cookie.
- What's up?

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,940
Oh, shit. Damn.

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,500
- Shit. What am I gonna do, Nikki?
- Spider Mike...

56
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,260
...who called on the telephone, please?

57
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,500
Spider Mike went
to Circus Liquor earlier.

58
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,180
Maybe he dropped the dope...
Spider?

59
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,900
Did you ride your bike to Circus Liquor?
You did?

60
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,780
Okay. That's only a block
and a half away.

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,220
Why don't you stop freaking out
and backtrack.

62
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,300
- I bet you dropped the shit.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,340
- Yeah.
- I bet you dropped it on the way back.

64
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,380
You were on your bike,
and you just dropped it.

65
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,220
You know, you're right!
Yeah!

66
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,380
- Yeah, you dropped it.
- Yeah!

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,220
- He dropped it.
- I did. I dropped it.

68
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,780
I love this dude.

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,780
Suck my cock!

70
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,500
Fuck, I love this guy.

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,020
Michael? Who called
on the goddamn phone?

72
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,860
I don't know, you fucking asshole!

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,460
Holy shit!

74
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,220
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- You!

75
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,380
What the hell is the matter with you,
you little slut?

<i>Genghis Cunt!</i>

77
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
Spider, you son of a bitch!

78
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,100
Don't you fucking hit me
with shit again!

79
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,940
Look, everybody just stay sitting down.
Nobody goes out...

80
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,060
...and nobody comes in.
You understand?

81
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,300
I saw a lot of cop cars
out there earlier.

82
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,260
A lot of cop cars.

83
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,100
There were a lot of cops
out there earlier.

84
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,580
If you look...
If you look...

85
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,380
Where?

86
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,780
- I don't see anything, man.
- No, if you just look...

87
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,900
- I don't see anything, man.
- No?

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,620
- There's nobody there.
- They were there.

89
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,300
Where are they if they're there?

90
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,220
- I don't know.
- Because there's nobody there, man!

91
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,540
Little fuckhead.
There's no piggy scare, you stupid...

92
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,460
You fuck!

93
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,860
Fucking relax, all right?
Just stay sitting down, goddamn it!

94
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,540
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking phone!

95
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,420
Nobody moves!

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,940
So, Ross. Girlfriend frustrated?
Little unsatisfied?

97
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,940
Can't you keep it hard?
Need a little lift?

98
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,380
- I'm not seeing anyone.
- Who was that April chick...

99
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,820
...waiting in your car when you were
here a week ago?

100
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,380
April and I hook up occasionally,
but she's not my girlfriend.

101
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,140
My girlfriend is out of town,
in the city.

102
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,940
She got a cool corporate job offer
this summer, so she's up there.

103
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,660
Wait. Like, April...

104
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,540
Like, naughty girl, kind of nice girl,
blondie stripper April?

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,900
- That April?
- Yeah. How do you know her?

106
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,100
Hello?
Nikki, it's for you.

107
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,020
Hey, baby.
Spider spaced our shit off again.

108
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,500
If he doesn't find the shit, he'll have
to cough up another 500 bucks.

109
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,020
Just keep your eye on him. I don't
trust that little fag anymore. Yeah.

110
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,140
- How's my baby doing?
- I'm okay, baby.

111
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,860
I just can't wait to get back
to the room, though.

112
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,620
I can't wait to lay
a yard of dick on you, honey.

113
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,660
I love you, baby.

114
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,140
If it's the same April
I think it is...

115
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,380
...then we work together at Jiggles.

116
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,860
Yeah, same April.

117
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,900
Cool.

118
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,180
Those are nice sunglasses.
Let me try those.

119
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,900
Here.

120
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,660
You try mine.

121
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,900
They look nice on you.

122
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,060
Sometimes I wonder if Spider
really loses the shit...

123
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,060
...or if he's trying to dick us.

124
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,340
- Dick you?
- Dick my boyfriend, really.

125
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,300
You'd never dick me.

126
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,060
Would you, Ross?

127
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,900
No. No. I'm sorry.

128
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,220
- No.
- You're tense.

129
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,380
- I just want to get hooked up.
- I understand.

130
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,500
That really pisses me off. Spider better
find some fucking eyeballs quick.

131
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,580
You know this is the third time
he's spaced our shit off?

132
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,660
Kill, kill!

133
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,460
Did you find it? Did you find the shit?

134
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,980
That's it, man. That's it.
Everybody get out. Come on.

135
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,180
- I'll call you as soon as I figure this out.
- Ross stays.

136
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,820
Please, everybody get out.

137
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,340
Hold on. I just have one more monkey.
I really gotta kill this monkey.

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,140
If you say monkey one more time,
I'm gonna shove my hand up your ass...

139
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,260
...and shut your mouth
permanently. Got it?

140
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,220
Now get the fuck out of here.

141
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,220
- He asked me to leave...
- I know.

142
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,900
What are you doing?
He's the last one!

143
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
He was the last one!

144
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,980
Fine, man. I'll go to Main Street
and score my shit.

145
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,220
Yeah, get your little chicken feed.

146
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll go to Main Street
because they have good shit.

147
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,620
You like that little chicken feed?
Is that what you want?

148
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,180
Little chicken feed, huh?

149
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,860
You're a fucking asshole!

150
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,980
Hey! Hey!
What happened?

151
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,300
Where have you been?
Did you find it?

152
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,820
- I don't know where it is!
- Why not?

153
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,380
If I did, I would have had it on me.

154
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,100
If that was the case,
wouldn't I have walked in with it?

155
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,700
- This is the third time you lost the shit.
- That's so fucking unfair!

156
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,580
You're always blaming me.
You always knock me down.

157
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,140
Maybe if you'd put me up,
I wouldn't be such a fuckup!

158
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,820
Fine!

159
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Fucking...

160
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,100
It's okay.

161
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Fucking shithead! Loser!

162
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,700
Fuck! Don't call me a loser, Cookie!

163
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,780
Loser!

164
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,940
Frisbee, sex and travel, man.
I told you to sex and travel.

165
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,420
- Take a fucking hike, you understand?
- It's me.

166
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,220
Oh, hey, man. Hey, man.
Look, I'm really fucking sorry, man.

167
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,580
I haven't got anything.
Why don't you just split?

168
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Fucking loser. Loser! Loser!

169
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,340
Hey, baby. It's me.

170
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,380
Loser.

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,460
You see, your friend out there,
she said that...

172
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,700
That she could hook me up
with her own stash.

173
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,140
What is with you and Nikki?

174
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,820
If she hooks you up with some
of her own personal stash...

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,980
...it's not gonna be
her own personal stash.

176
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,740
Yeah. There's this guy here
named Ross, and he's got a car.

177
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,140
- What kind?
- Volvo.

178
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,060
- And what color?
- Brown.

179
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,060
Bring him by, and tell that insect
I said to chill the fuck out.

180
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,620
Spider, he says,
"Chill the fuck out!"

181
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,900
This guy's got the knowledge, man.

182
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,620
He's the man.
Few people have what this guy has.

183
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,340
He's like a gold mine.

184
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,220
<i>I'll talk to you later.
I love you.</i>

185
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,500
Bye.

186
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,220
- Everything cool? Can we do this?
- Yeah. You ready?

187
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,260
You better get back here and fuck me,
bastard, if you want any kind of dinner!

188
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,220
You better get your skinny ass
back here!

189
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,980
I guess it's time to go
make up with Mama, huh?

190
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,980
Sounds like a good plan.

191
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,060
- You know where I live, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,260
- This one right here?
- Right. Park right over there.

193
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,700
Okay, wait right here.
I'll be right back.

194
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,260
Wait here, hon.
Don't leave.

195
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,220
Baby. Hi.

196
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,820
Hey.

197
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,300
- What's up?
- How you doing?

198
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,020
- Here's for bringing the girl back.
- Oh, shit. Thanks.

199
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,700
- She get your number?
- Yeah, I gave her my number.

200
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,300
- We'll call you when we need you.
- Thank you so much. You just call.

201
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,340
Bye. I'll see you later.

202
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,580
<i>Ross? It's your mother. I'm coming
in a couple of weeks to visit.</i>

203
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,980
<i>Call so we can make some plans,
okay? Love you. Bye- bye.</i>

204
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,140
<i>Ross? Hi, it's April.
I'd love to see you.</i>

205
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,700
<i>I'm dancing today.
Stop in if you can find the time.</i>

206
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,180
<i>Hey, it's me, Amy.</i>

207
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,580
<i>Happy belated birthday.</i>

208
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,420
<i>I didn't send you anything,
because you owe me $450.</i>

209
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,100
<i>Come on, Ross, you've owed
this to me for over a year.</i>

210
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,500
<i>Anyway, I didn't call to bitch. Just
to say, mail me the money, all right?</i>

211
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,500
<i>You have my address.</i>

212
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,420
<i>Come on, take care of it.
Take care of yourself. Bye.</i>

213
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,380
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

214
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,340
Hey, baby.

215
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,740
I just love your smell, honey.

216
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,580
<i>It's April. I'd love to see you.
I'm dancing today...</i>

217
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,340
<i>Ross. Ross.</i>

218
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,020
<i>Ross.</i>

219
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,020
<i>Let's see you guys
give it up some.</i>

220
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,180
<i>There's no finer specimen
than the female...</i>

221
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,180
Hey. April's over at the bar.

222
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,300
- You must be holding.
- My place.

223
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,380
<i>- Yeah?
- Hey, Volvo.</i>

224
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,660
We have a little situation
here with the dog.

225
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,260
- Honey, is he coming?
- Can you...

226
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,820
<i>- ... give Nikki a ride?
- Yeah.</i>

227
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,180
I'll be right over.

228
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,580
It'll take me about...
About 15 minutes.

229
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,540
- He's on his way.
- You better untie me if you're leaving.

230
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,020
Now, I've gotta go out
for a second.

231
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,900
Ross, you have to untie me.

232
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,140
- I don't have to untie you.
- I have to be at work.

233
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,860
I'll be back before you have to go
to work.

234
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,460
What are you doing?

235
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,180
I'm actually gonna come back
with some shit. Okay, baby?

236
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,420
You know how good
you were last night?

237
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,500
You were real good.
Shut up! Please.

238
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,820
Look at me. Look at me.

239
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,900
Okay, look.

240
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,020
Just stay here.

241
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,780
For crying out loud,
where the hell is he?

242
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,460
Just, this is really important, okay? Bye.

243
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,340
Hey, you want a little song maybe?

244
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,860
We have your favorite, okay?

245
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,660
Okay, ready?

246
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,100
I'll be back.

247
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,820
Ross, come in quick!
Get in here quick!

248
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,820
- Would you look at Taco?
- That dog's green.

249
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,060
He's dying, Ross. We have
to get him to the vet right now.

250
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,500
Oh, Jesus.

251
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,060
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Come on!

252
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,140
What happened?

253
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,140
She'll calm down. Just take the dog
to the doggy hospital.

254
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,460
Ross, come on, let's go!

255
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,500
What happened to the dog?

256
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,620
A little too much
secondhand smoke.

257
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,820
Ross? Please!

258
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,540
Maybe we should open a window.

259
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,420
Come on, motherfucker!

260
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,780
Volvo boy, just take the dog
to the damn hospital...

261
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,380
...and shut the door on your way out.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

262
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,500
- No, my baby. No, Taco.
- What was going on?

263
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,900
He's the fucking cook, okay?
He makes the shit.

264
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,140
How do you breathe in there?
I almost passed out.

265
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,860
- Could you hold Taco, please?
- Jesus Christ, Nikki!

266
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,300
You're fine. Just hold him.

267
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,380
- He smells like shit!
- I have to do a rail.

268
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,460
- On the fucking dash?
- I need to do a rail right now.

269
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,780
What the fuck am I gonna
tell the vet, Ross?

270
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,020
Okay.

271
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,780
Hi. Hi.

272
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,060
Somebody has to help him right away.

273
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,020
We'll rush him right back
to Dr. K, but first we'll need...

274
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,820
...the initial examination fee
of $54, ma'am.

275
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm sorry, it's policy.
We take cash, credit cards or checks.

276
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,020
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

277
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,900
Hey, Amy, it's Ross.
How are you? I'm doing really good.

278
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,020
Oh, are you the doctor? Hi.

279
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,620
Hi, thank God.

280
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,540
- Dr. K, this is...
- Taco.

281
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,860
- Here. Can you just...?
- So. So, so, so, so...

282
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,340
I got a job...

283
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,060
...and I'm... I'm working for a chemist.

284
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,900
And he's working me really hard,
and I haven't slept.

285
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,340
- What seems to be the problem?
- I really don't know.

286
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,540
I need you to call me when you get this.
I really need you to call me, okay?

287
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,820
Can you please fix him?
Because I'm really worried, okay?

288
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,500
- We'll just keep him overnight.
- Thank you.

289
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,740
Okay, I love you.
Okay, bye. It's Ross.

290
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:43,420
- Okay. Oh, I love you too, baby. Bye.
- We'll keep him overnight.

291
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,660
Sorry. Thank you. Have a good day!

292
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,100
Frisbee, honey?

293
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,380
Sweetie? Could you come
get me something to eat?

294
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Do you hear me? Frisbee, honey?

295
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,940
Frisbee, honey, what are you doing?
Could you get Mommy a soda?

296
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,260
When I get back, there better be
a joint in my drawer.

297
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,180
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

298
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,140
It's Ross, honey. Let him in!

299
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,980
- Honey?
- What?

300
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,220
Turn the fucking music down, please!

301
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,180
It's Ross. Turn down the fucking music
and let... Never mind.

302
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,780
- Never mind!
- What?!

303
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,220
You don't even give a flying fuck
about Taco, do you?

304
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,220
Asshole.

305
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,300
How'd it go?

306
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,340
Vet said he wants to keep
the dog overnight.

307
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,420
Didn't look very good.
You should really open a window.

308
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,620
- Yeah?
- Did you touch her?

309
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,500
What do you mean?

310
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,860
- You know goddamn well what I mean.
- No, I don't.

311
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,300
She got a nice-looking body,
doesn't she?

312
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,540
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

313
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,220
You know goddamn well...

314
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,060
- Okay.
...what I'm talking about.

315
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,900
Hey, look at this.
Wow, look at this shit.

316
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,700
Goddamn! Look at this.

317
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,180
Look at it. Damn, look at that.
Look at this part right here.

318
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,780
Look at that. That's cruel shit.
Look at that shit, man.

319
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,260
Actually, maybe the road stops here.
I can't give you that ride.

320
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,340
I need a ride.

321
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,580
Ross has gotta run me down
to the truck stop.

322
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,980
Maybe take a cab. Here.

323
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,500
I'll take a cab.

324
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,060
Goddamn, baby, you look hot.

325
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,740
What do you care?

326
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,540
Baby!

327
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,180
- She's a fine-looking woman, huh?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah, great.

328
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,780
No, I mean... Hey, it's cool.

329
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,820
- What do we need at the truck stop?
- I gotta get some ingredients.

330
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,020
So anyway, I heard that he was
carrying some of these fixings...

331
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,340
...for that metalphetamine stuff,
whatever the hell they call it.

332
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,260
Goddamn druggies!

333
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,300
I mean, I was never into that.
I can't understand how they do that.

334
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,020
But anyway,
so he was traveling down I-5...

335
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,380
...and he was probably speeding.
He usually was.

336
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,660
He's going too fast,
and then, all of a sudden...

337
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,060
...after this big curve,
you just couldn't find him.

338
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,060
I mean, he's just off on the road
and everything...

339
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,340
...and it was so dark,
and so I heard...

340
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,740
...that they followed the sound
of his music.

341
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,820
From the radio.
It was playing so loud...

342
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,500
...and he was just pacing back and forth
and pacing back and forth, and...

343
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,900
And he was just gushing with blood.

344
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,220
- But he said he was okay...
- Lady, got any more of these fuckers?

345
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,660
Oh, yeah. We got...
They sell like crazy.

346
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,340
We always keep an extra case
stashed under here.

347
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,580
Now I gotta order another one.

348
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,220
I'm new. If you could just hold on,
I got to designate me a reorder.

349
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,980
What are you gonna do
with all those?

350
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,060
Lady, how much do I owe you?

351
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,020
$ 135.

352
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,060
What do you need all those for?

353
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,580
Well, I was thinking maybe
I'd take a little trip to Russia.

354
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,740
They don't sell them over there,
and they got a little emergency going.

355
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,060
A lot of tired drivers, you know?

356
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,420
Do their thing, you know?
So I thought I'd be a nice guy and just...

357
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,140
That all right with you?

358
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,740
That's a nice Christian thing to do.

359
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,260
- You have a real good day.
- You have a real good day too.

360
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,820
Bye.

361
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,660
That's a dollar.

362
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,660
Thank you. Have a good day.

363
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,980
Did we get enough ingredients?

364
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,980
It's never enough.
It's enough to get back to work.

365
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,340
What's the longest you've
ever stayed up on this shit?

366
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,340
- About 11, I don't know, 12, 13 days.
- Fuck, man.

367
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,620
- That's it.
- That's a lot of days.

368
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,140
- Do you shave your balls?
- Let's go by the market.

369
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,100
I wanna get some beer.

370
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,460
I told you bitches how many times?

371
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,540
I told you bitches how many times?

372
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,540
I'll cut one of your tits off.
You go to Spider Mike's...

373
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,580
...you'll wish you never fucked with me.

374
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,020
Spider Mike's shit sucks.

375
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,460
White boys don't know how
to cook that shit.

376
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,620
Angel, we looked everywhere
for your nowhere ass.

377
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,980
We had to go to that
Wonder Bread's house.

378
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,580
He wasn't holding nothing.

379
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,820
He wouldn't even open
the fucking door.

380
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,700
- You know where I hang.
- All right, we won't go there.

381
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,780
- Just leave.
- Yeah, get out of here.

382
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,380
I'll cut Spider Mike
if I catch you in his place.

383
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,980
You better go. You better get out,
or I'm gonna call the cops!

384
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,700
- We're gonna call the fucking cops.
- Okay, okay. I'm going. I'm going.

385
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,780
- I forgot something.
- No.

386
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,060
Come here for a second.

387
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,060
- Come here for a second.
- No.

388
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,660
Something I gotta tell you.

389
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,260
You're lucky that's all I do!

390
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,580
<i>Hey, Seòor el Fucking Camino.</i>

391
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,460
Who the fuck are you?

392
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,940
Goddamn.

393
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,580
You all got any Cools?

394
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,020
Give me a pack of Cools.

395
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,900
I'll take the beer. Got any
sunglasses in the lost and found?

396
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,340
- Here.
- What do I owe you?

397
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,940
Take them quick before
his posse comes.

398
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,300
- Sexy cowboy.
- All right. Thanks.

399
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,860
- Take it. Take care.
- You all have a good one.

400
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,340
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Sexy.

401
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,020
- Bye.
- Bye.

402
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,140
So how many more stops
we have to make?

403
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,260
We gotta go to the porn shop.
Get some fuck videos.

404
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,860
I just really need to make
a phone call at some point.

405
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,420
Just keep driving, lover-boy.

406
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,380
All right, look for videos that got
blond chicks with long hair...

407
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,420
...big titties and small asses.

408
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,340
And the small ass, man, that takes
priority. Unless the tits are perfect.

409
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,780
If the tits are perfect,
then we go with the tits.

410
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,340
- How about this one?
- No, man.

411
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,940
That's the perfect example
of what I don't like. You see that?

412
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,700
That's a loose ass. There's nothing
I hate more than a loose ass.

413
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:56,020
<i>You know I take the pussy
seriously. Let me tell you.</i>

414
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:02,140
<i>You gotta take the pussy seriously.
I mean, there's a priority for a tight ass.</i>

415
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,740
But if it's hairy, I go for the tits.

416
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,460
<i>But if the tits are hairy,
hey, it's right back to the pussy.</i>

417
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,340
<i>But you've gotta speak
to that pussy, son.</i>

418
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,060
You know, really talk to it.
You make a vow to it.

419
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,700
Now, no nation has
ever been so ready...

420
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,500
<i>...to seize the power and the
freedom of the pussy as our own...</i>

421
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,060
<i>...and we must all care for that pussy.</i>

422
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,820
<i>Today, we do more
than just celebrate the pussy.</i>

423
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,460
<i>We re-dedicate ourselves
to the very idea of pussy.</i>

424
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,460
<i>I mean, friends, ask not
what the pussy can do for you...</i>

425
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,220
<i>...but what can you do for the pussy.</i>

426
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,380
Ain't that right, Volvo?

427
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,260
Here we go.

428
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,340
This is a long one.
This one's got bonus scenes.

429
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,580
Hundred and twelve girls,
522 penetrations.

430
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,980
Chinese guys with huge cocks,
chicks with dicks.

431
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,980
Now, hey, that's a fucking video.

432
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,740
Hey, buddy boy.

433
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,500
How much for the masterpiece?

434
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,900
$29.99.

435
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,980
- Want a bag?
- Whatever.

436
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,860
Have a good one.

437
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,700
We need a phone.
I need to make a fucking call.

438
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,500
- Come on. Use the phone at the club.
- We're going to the club?

439
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,980
What do you think?
We got the right place?

440
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,660
Man, I don't know. You're driving.
You got the directions.

441
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,420
Stop bitching about that.

442
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,460
- I'm sorry.
- Just quit riding me, old man.

443
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,140
- I'm not fucking old.
- Just don't make me look bad...

444
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,100
<i>...with this camera crew, all right?
- Hey, remember...</i>

445
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,940
<i>... we're on a live feed.</i>

446
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,340
Guys, we're gonna hold off
for a couple of minutes.

447
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,140
<i>Real cops. Real people.
Real trouble.</i>

448
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,340
Looks like we got our guy here.

449
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
All right. We got him.

450
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,380
Hang on.

451
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,460
Is that the chef?

452
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,220
She doesn't fit the description.
I think it's the fucker on the bike.

453
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,180
It doesn't matter.

454
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,340
<i>- Yeah, guys.
- Hey.</i>

455
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,540
<i>- We gotta move in.
- We're right behind you.</i>

456
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,980
- We received several tips.
- And numerous phone calls.

457
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,340
We believe that a large amount
of methamphetamine is being...

458
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,180
...manufactured at this residence.
- At this location.

459
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,540
- We gotta move in.
- Come on. Come on.

460
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,380
- Open the goddamn door. Come on.
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

461
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,500
- Get the fuck down!
- Bitch! Bitch!

462
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,780
Hands on top of that motherfucking
mullet now! Drop the cheese puffs!

463
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,300
- He's over here!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

464
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,860
Freeze! Shit! Fuck.

465
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,380
- Fucking shit, man.
- Up in the air! Up in the fucking air!

466
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,460
Don't you look at me!
Don't you fucking look at me!

467
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,780
I gotta make that call.

468
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,020
Beer.

469
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,620
Nikki is her name, sex is her game.

470
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,540
To not put your hand in your pocket
and get some dollars...

471
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,180
...and take a lap dance
would be a great shame.

472
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,820
Let's hear it for Nikki.

473
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,100
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

474
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,060
<i>Hey, it's Ross. I'm out.
Leave a message after the tone.</i>

475
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,500
Hey, April, it's Ross.
April, I know you can hear me.

476
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,740
I'm so sorry I forgot about you.

477
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,140
<i>I'm here right now at the club.
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

478
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,820
Hang tight, baby.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

479
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,340
Fuck!

480
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,340
- Ross, thank you.
- No problem, Nikki.

481
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,580
- Bye.
- See you.

482
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,740
Okay, Volvo boy,
I've gotta get back to the office.

483
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,620
So Nikki'll call you when we need you.

484
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,260
Have a good night.
Have a good one.

485
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,980
Bye.

486
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,540
Bye, guys.

487
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,060
I'm sorry. I know I fucked up.

488
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,300
Look, baby, please
don't be pissed, okay?

489
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,420
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad.

490
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,100
I got caught up, and it took much longer
than I thought it would. I apologize.

491
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,020
I'm gonna take this off. Will you
please not yell? Will you please not yell?

492
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,580
- I'm gonna talk to you.
- You motherfucker!

493
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,060
You have no idea
what I've been going through!

494
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:25,780
You've no idea where I've been. I've
been alone. Will you listen to me?

495
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,460
No crying, no cry...

496
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,500
- I lost $200 because of you.
- Please be quiet. Now.

497
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,420
- Hey, smurf.
- Hi.

498
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,660
- What's going on?
- I'm watching television.

499
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,380
- I'm sorry I kept it on so loud.
- Pretty funny show, yeah.

500
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,460
It's pretty cool. Check it out. It's on
Channel 4. I'll see you later. Bye.

501
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,300
What's the plan, Stan?

502
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,020
What am I thinking?

503
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,460
- Honey, you don't have a plan.
- No, I got a goddamned plan.

504
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,380
First we're gonna get this batch
over to Spider.

505
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,300
Then we're gonna get our money.
Then I'll pick up your little dog...

506
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,340
...and then I'm gonna fuck
your little ass proper.

507
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,500
- His name is Taco.
- Who?

508
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,860
And you bet your ass
we're gonna pick him up.

509
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,220
Yeah, hey. You got any girls?

510
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,180
Listen, they gotta have nice titties,
nice big titties. Small ass.

511
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,020
<i>- It's for the motel, right?
- Yeah.</i>

512
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,860
<i>- We've got one for you.
- All right.</i>

513
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,260
<i>You got it.</i>

514
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,900
Tag!

515
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,500
- You're it, partner.
- Tag?

516
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,380
Like the game you used to play
when you were a little kid.

517
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,780
It's easy.

518
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,660
- It's your turn to tag somebody now.
- Tag?

519
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,540
We need two names from you.

520
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,100
Then we will go easy on you
and your mother.

521
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,820
- My mother?
- If you agree to help us...

522
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,500
...she'll be in front of her television
by cocktail hour, okay?

523
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,020
- Cocktail hour?
- Fucking echo going on in here.

524
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,100
- Do you hear it?
- You gotta help us now!

525
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,540
Okay, partner?

526
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,780
You gotta play the game!

527
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,060
- Understand?
- Look, look, look, look.

528
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,740
It's not even my shit.
It's not my shit. It's my mom's shit.

529
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,180
- I'm holding it for my mom.
- Come on, Frisbee.

530
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,820
You ain't working
with us here, dude.

531
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,060
Look, we've confiscated your bike,
okay? We've got your porn, your...

532
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,980
- Fucking CDs.
- Your music.

533
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,740
- You ain't got a job.
- You'll never get your stuff back...

534
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,100
Unless you cooperate and...

535
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,500
- Play the game.
- The game?

536
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,660
The fucker drives a fucking Lexus.
He's not gonna ride my ass for free.

537
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,780
The fucker drives a fucking Lexus.
He's not gonna ride my ass for free.

538
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,660
Get your shit together, or I'm going
to Dial-A-Bun! No, you listen to me!

539
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,260
Why don't you fucking listen to me?
I want my cash up-fucking-front!

540
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,420
Honey? Did you order over
some bimbo bitch?

541
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,500
- She's at the door.
- Just open the goddamned door.

542
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,860
- Damn.
- You were right.

543
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,340
I was totally stressed out about Taco.

544
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,700
I'm thinking maybe we could
try out the new batch...

545
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:55,620
...and get a little nasty.
- That's my girl. Come over here.

546
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,540
Do you know I have a really bad...?

547
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,660
Look at that onion, baby.

548
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,300
- Get the goddamned door.
- I am.

549
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,300
No cash or no fucking ass, all right?
Now get your shit together.

550
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,380
Hold on. You know, I have a really
bad yeast infection.

551
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,220
I'm still fucking working, okay?

552
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,900
Hold on.

553
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,940
Are you gonna let me in?

554
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,340
Honey, what the fuck
are you looking at?

555
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,020
Your fucking whore-bitch face, bitch!

556
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,140
Fuck! You know what?
I'm not doing it.

557
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,460
I just got a fucking door
slammed in my face, all right?

558
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,460
Goddamn.

559
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,060
- What's the problem?
- You don't give a fuck about Taco.

560
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,300
And you sure don't
give a fuck about me.

561
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,300
All you care about is
your stupid, precious batch of fuck.

562
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:53,620
And maybe, just maybe, getting your
fucking rocks off every now and then.

563
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,340
Goddamn it, don't start in with
your psycho bullshit here, all right?

564
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,140
You wanna go back to Las Vegas with
them Gucci-wearing motherfuckers?

565
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,660
- You want me to go to Vegas?
- I don't give a fuck. Go to Florida...

566
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,980
...with them rich sugar daddies
of yours.

567
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,020
Just get your little white ass
and get the fuck out of my face!

568
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,420
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you. Go back to your mother.

569
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,540
<i>That fucking cunt.</i>

570
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,500
I'd rather be anywhere in the whole
fucking world other than this room...

571
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:25,260
...waiting for you to blow up the
whole goddamned place! Fuck you!

572
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,700
Fuck you!

573
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,060
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I can't stand this shit anymore!

574
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,500
I can't believe you...

575
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,700
...called a bitch up here, ordered her
up like a goddamned piece of pizza!

576
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,460
Goddamn it, it was for you!

577
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,340
Fucking did it for me?

578
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,380
- What'd she look like anyway?
- Fuck you!

579
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,780
- Hello?
- Hey, Volvo boy, I need another ride.

580
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,020
I don't know. What do you need?

581
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,540
The shit hit the fan over here
pretty good. Can you get over here now?

582
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,060
- How soon?
- I need you now!

583
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,540
Are you leaving?

584
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,660
- I gotta go.
- Ross, untie me, please.

585
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,420
- No, no, no.
- No.

586
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,700
I'll be right back. I wouldn't hurt you.

587
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,700
April, now just calm down, okay?
You know I wouldn't hurt you.

588
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,820
They need me again.

589
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,340
I'll be right back. Do you hear me?

590
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,980
Stop it!

591
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,500
I'll be right back. I don't wanna do
this. I have to do this, okay? Fuck!

592
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,740
- Did Ross say how long he'll be?
- Hopefully soon.

593
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,060
I can't wait for him
to get his ass out here.

594
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,420
So I guess...

595
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,860
...it's over. We're finished.

596
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,380
We're through, right?

597
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,300
Well, you might be through.
I ain't never through.

598
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,980
Bye.

599
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,140
- Bye? Where are you going?
- I'll be in the car.

600
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:26,620
Where's she going?

601
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,780
- She's going wherever you take her.
- Wherever I take her?

602
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,820
Run this over to Spider.

603
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,580
Take her, please, wherever the fuck
she wants to go.

604
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,180
- What the fuck's going on around here?
- Nikki can't handle her shit.

605
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,140
She's been partying
with the candy for 10, 11 days.

606
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,180
And then the bitch crashes
and starts freaking out.

607
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,100
She'll split for a day or two, then
she'll come back. She's just spun.

608
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,380
This is for you.

609
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,300
This is the Hawaii.

610
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,620
So I gotta pop by Spider's
and drop this shit off.

611
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,260
You can either come with or I could
take you somewhere, whatever is best.

612
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,220
It's that fucking bastard.

613
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,740
How can somebody
be such a selfish, insensitive...

614
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,980
...fucking motherfucking bastard?

615
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,820
He never cared about anything!

616
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,540
The only time he was nice to me
was when I first met him.

617
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,740
When, of course,
I've never done speed before.

618
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,980
And he was nice
to Taco to boot, okay?

619
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,220
Fucking fuck-face fucker.

620
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,780
It's Nikki and Ross.

621
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,380
Hey, come on in. Come on.

622
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,740
- Got something for me?
- Yeah.

623
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,020
Why did Taco have to go to the vet?

624
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,140
So how is he doing?

625
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,660
- I mean, he didn't die?
- Fuck, no!

626
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,700
- Come on, come on. Come on, man!
- Okay, Spider, this is it.

627
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,380
- He'll be all right, right?
- Right. He'll be fine.

628
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,540
He's gonna be great.
He is.

629
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,500
- Here you go, all you.
- All me?

630
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,500
I'm hoping Ross brings me
to the vet in the morning.

631
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,940
Then everything's gonna be
just perfect.

632
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,140
- That's good.
- Good shit, huh?

633
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,260
Goddamn!

634
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,300
Looks like the peanut-butter dank
we used to get back in the day, man.

635
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,660
What's the real deal between you
and Nikki? What's she doing with you?

636
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,580
So why are you with Ross?

637
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,060
- It's too hot.
- Because I have a car.

638
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,100
- I've been helping her out with my car.
- He brings me places.

639
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:15,140
- Special stuff I left behind.
- Helping her out, taking her around.

640
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,900
- He wants to drive me around.
- Yesterday, the dog got sick.

641
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,020
It was fucked up.

642
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,260
The dog got sick, but we got that
cleared up. I've been going ride...

643
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,820
Going on rides with him
and helping him out. I just...

644
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,300
Oh, shit, Cookie!

645
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,380
Don't. No, no, no.

646
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,820
Don't do that.
Don't smoke it like that.

647
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,380
It gives you Alzheimer's, doesn't it?

648
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,580
Give her a ride in my car,
and I'm gonna run errands.

649
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:40,780
Just came here to...

650
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,860
Right now I'm on my way
to the bus stop...

651
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,380
Yeah, yeah, I understand, man.

652
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,660
I understand. Yeah.

653
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,220
Amy.

654
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,260
- I just thought maybe we could...
- Really? Oh, come on.

655
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,900
You know I hate fucking hippies, man.

656
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,620
You know why I hate hippies?
Because I was downtown...

657
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,380
...and this kid just comes running out
and gets hit by a bus, right?

658
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,460
And the bus just crushes him
and crushes him...

659
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,460
...and runs over him, and the kid's
just squiggling on the ground.

660
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,380
Amy.

661
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,660
And blood is coming out of his ears,
and he's just laying there...

662
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,460
...and then this hippie dyke chick
comes out with crystal...

663
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,060
...and she rubs it all over him.

664
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,900
I wish that I had more energy.

665
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,300
Amy.

666
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,220
And the kid is just laying there,
and he's choking on his own blood.

667
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,420
It's like, "Come on,
you dumb, stupid chick.

668
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,140
What are you doing with your crystals?
He needs a doctor."

669
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,380
- I wish I could sleep forever, man.
- I wish. I wish.

670
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:52,860
You know, I've seen some crystals
do some pretty trippy shit, man.

671
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,900
Really?

672
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,820
I was out with one of my girlfriends
once in Vegas...

673
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,300
Amy.

674
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,540
And we were hanging out,
and we picked this guy up.

675
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,540
I think he was a Mexican.

676
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,420
I wish I was black.

677
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,140
And we both fucked him.

678
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,300
Amy.

679
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,860
Anyways...

680
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,220
...she got crabs really bad.

681
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,580
And I was wearing this crystal around my
neck all night long, and I never got them.

682
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,420
- Magic crystals.
- Amy.

683
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,780
No, Nikki, Nikki.
What happened was...

684
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,420
...that your friend fucked him first,
and the crabs jumped onto her bush...

685
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,300
...before they got a chance to get
onto yours. That's what happened.

686
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,540
You got lucky you got sloppy seconds.

687
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,820
There's no such thing as
magic-crystal-hippie-crap bullshit.

688
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,420
Ross?

689
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,700
Ross?

690
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,060
Did you ever get crabs, Ross?

691
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,740
Amy.

692
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,020
Amy.

693
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,300
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.

694
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,740
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

695
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,900
- Just... One... Wait.
- Okay.

696
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,540
- Ross, I'm ready.
- I gotta make a phone call.

697
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,660
Spider, do you think I can make
a phone call, use your phone?

698
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,220
There's no phone. No phones, man.
We don't have a phone. Doesn't work.

699
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,660
- Okay.
- Come here, you.

700
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,580
Oh, God.

701
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,500
Boy, I'm really hammered.

702
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,420
- I'll see you soon.
- See you real soon.

703
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,820
- Take good care of her, okay?
- I will. Definitely.

704
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,420
I don't know, guys. This...
It looks really obvious.

705
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,260
This thing pokes out right here
and everything. I don't...

706
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,180
They're gonna notice something.

707
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,060
Hey, Frisbee, don't worry.

708
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,860
Cookie, I'll call you.

709
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,220
Weetis. I love it.

710
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,140
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you too, man.

711
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,060
- Great.
- I hope he's okay.

712
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,140
All you gotta do
is keep your clothes on.

713
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,580
I mean, we're working
together on this. All right?

714
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,620
It's fine, pal.

715
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,900
Hey, hey. Hold on. Hold on.

716
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,020
We got two suspects
leaving the premises.

717
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,140
Hey, Frisbee...

718
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,260
...is that Spider Mike
and what is it, Cookie?

719
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,980
That?

720
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:45,300
No, no. I don't know them.
I mean, I don't know who they are.

721
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,180
- You wouldn't tell us a story, would you?
- No, no, no, no.

722
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,380
It's okay. I'm not lying.
No, I don't...

723
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,180
- lf you lie, you lose.
- Yeah. If you lie, pal, it's game over.

724
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,660
I don't know those people.
I don't know who they are.

725
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,220
Get the license plate.
They just took off.

726
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:07,020
No, you don't need to get the license
plate. It's all right. It's okay.

727
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,980
Frisbee, all you fucking gotta do
is keep your clothes on...

728
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,020
...and everything is gonna be just fine.

729
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,260
You just go in there like
nothing's changed, you hang out...

730
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,820
...you make a buy, you just walk out.
It's easy as that, chief.

731
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,340
No. You don't know Spider. He's...

732
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,540
- Fuck! This isn't gonna work!
- Give me your hand.

733
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,980
Give me your hand.

734
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,140
Chill. Just chill. Yeah.

735
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,740
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

736
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,140
That's power.

737
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,740
- We got your back.
- You're doing the right thing.

738
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,940
We're proud of you.

739
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,580
You're not gonna try
to take a dump now, are you?

740
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,060
I feel like I can finally go.

741
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,900
It's been so long
since I've taken a dump.

742
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,460
Jesus Christ, come on!

743
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,340
Come on, I haven't been this hard
in a long time. Come on!

744
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,260
Fucker.

745
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,540
<i>Hello?</i>

746
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,460
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, hello.</i>

747
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,860
Yeah.

748
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,220
Can you just help me come
really fast?

749
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,740
What? You want me
to put something on?

750
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,900
All right.

751
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,100
Let me see what I got here.

752
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,020
Yeah, I think I got something.

753
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,500
I got something perfect.

754
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:52,860
I got something that's gonna be clean
and practical. You're gonna like this.

755
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,820
Jesus Christ, come on!
Put your mouth on it.

756
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,500
<i>I'm gonna put my man-glaze
all over your fuckin tits.</i>

757
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,100
<i>- What is he doing? Jesus!
- You guys can hear me, right?</i>

758
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,380
<i>Can I hear you back?
I can't hear anything.</i>

759
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,300
Don't look at the car all the time.
Just go in.

760
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,580
- Oh, Christ!
- Jesus! What the fuck is he doing, man?

761
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,100
<i>I'm okay.</i>

762
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,820
Oh, yeah. Come on, lick my ass.
Come on.

763
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,300
Oh, fuck.

764
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,420
God!

765
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,500
Baby, come on.
Come on, don't be mad.

766
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,340
<i>- You've got me so wet.
- Yeah, come on, baby.</i>

767
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,500
Come on, baby.
Come on, open up the door!

768
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,700
I'll let you lick me where I pee.

769
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,380
Oh, yeah, do it.

770
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,580
<i>I'm gonna fuck the shit
out of you, yeah.</i>

771
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,780
- Oh, fuck!
- Who are you talking to?

772
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,380
<i>Oh, goddamn!
Oh, you're so fucking tight.</i>

773
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,140
- Are you on the phone?
- Oh, shit!

774
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,380
What the fuck is he doing?

775
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,700
Oh, yeah. Come on, take it, baby!

776
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,940
What the hell is he doing?
Quit looking at us.

777
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,020
Open the fucking door!

778
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,900
<i>You can hear me? Yeah?</i>

779
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,980
- Is he stupid?
- Yeah.

780
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,140
I'm going to knock.

781
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,660
I can't do this.

782
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,540
Get inside the house!

783
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,140
Okay. Okay.

784
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,100
Is Spider here?

785
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,300
Come in.

786
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,740
- Come on.
- I'm in.

787
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,700
<i>Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.</i>

788
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:53,940
How you doing, Frisbee?

789
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,340
Come on.

790
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,660
Sit right down. Sit down.

791
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,260
- Oh, you look so good!
- I do?

792
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,660
<i>- Shit! Fuck! I'm coming!
- Come for me, baby.</i>

793
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,620
Yeah, baby. Fuck, I'm gonna come.

794
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,740
- Come on, fuck me! Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

795
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,500
<i>- Come on, do it to me. Do it to me.
- Come on, say my name!</i>

796
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,900
Come on, say my name. Yeah!

797
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,420
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no. I...

798
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,700
<i>- I was... I should see Spider.
- Frisbee?</i>

799
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,780
Hello?

800
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,340
He's fucking this up. Come on!

801
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,300
You step away from her.

802
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,620
Don't I turn you on, huh?

803
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,860
- Come on, take me. Yeah!
- Cookie! What the fuck?

804
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,540
No. I'm going to...
I should talk to Spider.

805
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,820
What the fuck is that?

806
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,380
<i>- It's nothing.
- God, he's fucked!</i>

807
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,980
- God!
- What's wrong with your piece? Relax.

808
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:43,900
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck? Michael!

809
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:46,220
- What the fuck?
- Hello?

810
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,260
- It's my new Walkman.
- What is that?

811
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,940
- It's just my new Walkman.
- Fuck!

812
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,060
- You cheating little shit!
- Hello?

813
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,660
Where are the cops, Frisbee?

814
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,700
Trying to steal my girlfriend?
Is that what you're trying to do?

815
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,660
Michael! What the fuck
are you wearing?

816
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,180
- Shut up!
- Help!

817
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,540
- Get the fuck in here!
- You got a wire on you, man?

818
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,900
You bringing the cops here?

819
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,660
This is where we go in!

820
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,300
- All right, I just...
- Hold on.

821
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,940
The fuck...

822
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,260
- What the fuck was that?
- What the fuck is that?

823
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,380
Oh, my God, it's the cops!
They're coming!

824
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,540
- How can you do this to us, man?
- Put the fucking gun down, man.

825
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,460
Move your hand from your fucking balls.
I'm gonna shoot one ball!

826
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,900
I'm gonna take one of your balls.
Let me get one. Come on!

827
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,340
No! Put the gun down, man!

828
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,300
Let me get one of your balls!
Come on!

829
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,580
Holy shit!

830
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,700
Shit! That's gotta hurt, man!

831
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,580
Freeze! Don't fucking move!

832
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,540
I didn't shoot him.
I didn't shoot him.

833
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,700
God!

834
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,860
Shut your mouth,
and keep your hands in the air.

835
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:18,500
- What the fuck are you wearing, man?
- You fucking shot me!

836
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,780
- Now, that's gotta hurt.
- Fuck!

837
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,900
I hope you die, you fuck!

838
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,500
You shut the fuck up!

839
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,380
I'm sorry.

840
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,060
Hey, honey, you're back for me,
aren't you?

841
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,860
Fuck you, pussy boy.

842
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,140
Fucking asshole!

843
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:50,460
Come on, man, let me put
my clothes on. Come on, you fuck.

844
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,300
Fuck your cornholio good,
you fucking scummy asshole!

845
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,180
I'm gonna fucking die!

846
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,460
Okay, yeah, right, no.
I just got word.

847
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,460
There's a hotel room of the Las Palmas,
it's up in flames.

848
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,580
They got the perp at a porno shop.

849
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,540
I can't feel my legs!

850
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,100
Who the fuck is that freak
down at the Las Palmas Motel?

851
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,500
I'm cold, man.

852
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:18,620
I'm talking to you. Who the fuck
is that freak down at the motel?

853
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:24,020
- I don't fucking know.
- Take your fucking hands off me!

854
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,900
All right, cover me.

855
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,740
Hey, I love you, man.

856
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,540
Fucking pigs!

857
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,340
I'm so burned...

858
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
...I can't close my eyes.

859
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,100
I take little naps...

860
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:50,340
...like 10 to 15 minutes.
Just, like, a little shutdown time.

861
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,660
I mean, I still don't ever sleep, but...

862
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:55,420
- That works for you?
- Helps a little bit. Yeah.

863
01:06:55,580 --> 01:07:00,460
- So where are you going anyway?
- I'm going down. Down to Vegas.

864
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:04,860
- I got, like, friends and family there.
- That's good.

865
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,780
He's in the back.

866
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,700
Oh, goddamn.

867
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,980
Getting fucked in a porn shop.

868
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,100
<i>I'm going to see my son.
My son, my son, my son.</i>

869
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,620
I'm going to see my son.

870
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,940
Jacob.

871
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,180
I'm going to see my son, Jacob.

872
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,260
Your what? You have a son?

873
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,700
- Here. You want a little bit right now?
- Yeah, yeah.

874
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:07,060
Here, here.

875
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,260
Yeah! Wide awake!

876
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,100
Where's the kid?
Is he with your mom?

877
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,980
He's 3 years old.

878
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,420
<i>He doesn't live with my mom,
because my mom's a fucking cunt.</i>

879
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,980
- You'll be okay, Nikki. You'll be cool.
- You think so?

880
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,020
Yeah, man.

881
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,780
I'm gonna be okay.
I'm gonna be okay.

882
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,020
You're gonna be okay.

883
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,620
The state took him away.

884
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:42,140
It's weird because stuff happens, and
you don't notice it while it's happening.

885
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,020
Life is sort of passing by.

886
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,940
I held him once.

887
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,420
I held him once.

888
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,460
Yeah, he felt so nice in my arms.

889
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,300
And then they took him away.

890
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,020
I'm gonna hold him again.
I'm gonna hold him real tight.

891
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,500
I'm gonna hold him
so tight that no one...

892
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,460
...could take him away
from me ever again.

893
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,900
Hey, Volvo, bring on your balls.

894
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:18,060
<i>You said you'd take care of this.
I really need the money.</i>

895
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,020
<i>Take care of it.
Take care of it.</i>

896
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,420
You know what's cool?
My girlfriend, Amy, and I...

897
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,460
...we're so attracted to each other,
so in love with each other...

898
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,020
...and she really misses me.

899
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:29,140
I can tell from the voice
on her answering machine.

900
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,420
She really misses me,
and I love her so much.

901
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,180
It's really great.
We're so attracted to each other.

902
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:36,660
Amy, I love you!

903
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,220
I'm gonna be a really great mother.
You think...?

904
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,900
You sick motherfucker!
Sick! Sick! Sick!

905
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,620
You know my girlfriend?
I miss my girlfriend, Amy, so much.

906
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,940
So...

907
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:53,980
- Amy's the best.
- I'm gonna be a great mom.

908
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,580
I'm gonna be the greatest mom...

909
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,060
Amy and I are so good together.

910
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,220
Wide awake.

911
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,300
- Do you want a little bit?
- Yeah, yeah.

912
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,500
I need another line.

913
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,500
- You know what the best part is?
- What?

914
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,940
- I'm not hooked.
- I know.

915
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,540
I can stop at any time.

916
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,380
<i>Everything's gonna be wonderful.</i>

917
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,700
I am so excited.

918
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:44,380
Hey, you got busted like a bitch, boy.

919
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,660
I'm not Spider Mike right now, okay?

920
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,340
I shot him in the balls, though, huh?
How about that?

921
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,740
I shot him right in the balls,
that Judas fucking bastard, man.

922
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,620
You bring people into your circle,
bring them into your house...

923
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,620
...and they walk all over you, right?

924
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:02,460
- Not like you. You're my friend, right?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, whatever.

925
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:05,500
Well, someone must like you,
you lucky son of a bitch.

926
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:07,900
Let's go.

927
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,260
- Cop, you're gonna let me out too, right?
- Oh, sure.

928
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,340
What do you mean, "Yeah, sure"?

929
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,500
- Cook, come on, get me out, man.
- See you later, cockroach.

930
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,540
Come on, Cook. Come on, man.

931
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,740
We're friends. Don't leave me here.
Cook, come on.

932
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:26,340
Yeah, well, thanks. Thanks a lot,
you fucking old bastard.

933
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,940
Piece of shit.

934
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,500
What about me, man?
Nobody thinks about me, right?

935
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:34,980
You tied her up?

936
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,820
I can't believe it.

937
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:42,140
- How long?
- Four days.

938
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,380
- What?
- I don't know.

939
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,780
No, maybe...
It was maybe three days. Three...

940
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,860
Four days. Fuck!
I don't know! Fuck!

941
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:52,700
I've heard some cruel shit in my day,
but that is some pretty fucked up shit.

942
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:53,820
I know.

943
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,420
- I thought you were a normal guy.
- I am a normal guy.

944
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:58,020
No.

945
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,340
Hey, look! Look, girl, it's that guy.
Check him out.

946
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:15,140
- He looks like shit!
- No way, girl. He looks nice.

947
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,380
Listen, man, I want to thank you
for bailing me out.

948
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,500
Don't mention it, and I mean that.

949
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,780
So where are you at?
What are you doing?

950
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,820
<i>I'm a couple hours south of you.
I'm on my way now.</i>

951
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,340
You like him, don't you?

952
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,100
I turned another goddamned
motel into an ashtray.

953
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:35,780
Barbecued it, huh? Attaboy!

954
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:39,180
So, what's this?

955
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:44,100
You're on your way?
Is this my two hours' notice?

956
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,580
- April?
- Ross, where's Nikki?

957
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,940
I dropped her off at the bus station
about a half-hour ago.

958
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,380
She's probably halfway
to Vegas or something.

959
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,340
Good. We need to take a ride.

960
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,620
Fuck, man, I can't do that right now.
My room's fucked. I haven't slept...

961
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,860
You need a ride somewhere,
asshole? Well, you know what?

962
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,620
<i>Ross is giving me a ride today.</i>

963
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:30,100
Okay? We're gonna go to the bus
station, we're gonna pick up Taco.

964
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,500
Oh, baby needs to buy some more
chemicals? Poor, poor, poor baby.

965
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,260
Poor little baby. Call a taxi.

966
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,700
Loser! Loser! You lose!

967
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,620
- Fuck, Nikki.
- I'm sorry.

968
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,500
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry, man.

969
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,060
Listen, you little motherfucker,
don't you ever fucking lie to me again!

970
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:52,100
I know, I'm sorry. She was staring at me,
giving me the evil eye. I don't know...

971
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,380
Listen to me.

972
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:57,820
I want you to drop that crazy bitch off
right now and meet me at the market.

973
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,260
I just wanted to tell you...

974
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:02,020
No, just meet me
at the goddamned market! Bye.

975
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,260
You wanna fuck him, don't you?

976
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,900
I can smell the snail trails
all over the store.

977
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,980
Fuck you!
You always talking shit like that.

978
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,300
Listen, can I use your backroom?

979
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,100
- Yeah. It's right back there.
- Go ahead.

980
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,740
- You like him, eh?
- Shut up. Stop bothering me.

981
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,460
You're always bothering me.

982
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,860
One guy looks at me too...

983
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,980
My baby! Ross, look.

984
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,380
I missed you so much.

985
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,420
- Yes, you did.
- Hi, Taco.

986
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:52,380
Looks like a perfectly healthy
green dog.

987
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,100
This is great.

988
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,180
Come on, sweet pea.

989
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,460
- Las Vegas, huh?
- We're gonna go to Vegas.

990
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:12,180
- Oh, I wish he was there.
- That would be good, right?

991
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,380
- So Las Vegas is how long by bus?
- It's a seven-hour bus ride.

992
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,260
Well, around seven hours.
Not so bad.

993
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,700
- Oh, I don't have any cash.
- Here, sir.

994
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:28,860
- I had a really good talk, you know?
- I had such an amazing time. Thank you.

995
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,860
Ross, if you ever make it
out to Vegas...

996
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,180
...you have to call me.
Do you pinkie promise?

997
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:37,420
- I pinkie... I pinkie promise.
- Thank you.

998
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,900
Because I don't know if I'm ever
gonna come back here.

999
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,660
- Really?
- Yeah.

1000
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:45,180
You know he wasn't mad at you, right?
He wasn't.

1001
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,860
- Come here, baby.
- That's not real.

1002
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,260
I like you even though
you're not a normal guy.

1003
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,020
I like you even though
you're not a normal girl.

1004
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,780
So let's just say goodbye.

1005
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,980
I just wanna say that I enjoyed
all this time that I spent with you.

1006
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,540
- Really?
- Yeah.

1007
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,580
Okay.

1008
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:10,740
Come here.

1009
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,140
Be safe.

1010
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,700
Well...

1011
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,180
- Good luck with Amy.
- Well, good luck in Las Vegas.

1012
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,580
- Just be yourself, okay?
- Thank you.

1013
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,420
All aboard, please.

1014
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

1015
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,780
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

1016
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,260
Hey, Amy, it's Ross. I called before,
but it was busy, so I'm calling again.

1017
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,340
You know, I really need to talk to you,
so if you're there, pick up.

1018
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,540
I wanted to talk to you because
I haven't heard your voice...

1019
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,940
...and so I wanted to talk to you.
So please...

1020
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,020
...if you'd give me a call,
that'd be wonderful, and I love you.

1021
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:56,780
It's your machine,
and pick up if you're there.

1022
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:00,980
All right, it's Ross. I'll call back. Okay.

1023
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,860
- Have you seen...?
- He's in the backroom.

1024
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,660
- Chilling out.
- Back there?

1025
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:25,100
Yeah, back there.
You guys keep it quiet, okay?

1026
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:26,740
- Yeah.
- All right.

1027
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,700
Did you get the girl and the little dog
to the bus stop?

1028
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:42,020
- Yeah. She split?
- She's gone.

1029
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:43,740
She said she might come back.

1030
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,500
Hey, they always spin their way back,
you know?

1031
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,700
What do you want?

1032
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:50,300
<i>I thought I saw that guy.
Where is that pinche puto?</i>

1033
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:54,100
I don't know, but you better leave.
He could still be close by.

1034
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,660
- Can I have a beer?
- Oh, fuck, yeah.

1035
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,020
- Did he leave? He better watch himself.
- Holy fuck!

1036
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:08,220
That's fucking April!

1037
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,060
I bet you that fucking bitch
is afraid, huh?

1038
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,540
And she's with
my fucking dyke neighbor!

1039
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:17,340
Get out of here!

1040
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,820
Hey, fuck you!

1041
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,780
- You don't need nothing?
- We don't need nothing from you.

1042
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,500
Who you gonna get it from then, huh?
Spider Mike?

1043
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,420
<i>The pinche maricón
was raided last night.</i>

1044
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,780
He got raided?

1045
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,780
I told you once already, just leave.
You better leave...

1046
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:32,540
...or there'll be trouble.
- Right.

1047
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,940
- Take your cigarettes and just go.
- Fuck the smokes!

1048
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:37,500
What I want is respect
from you bitches!

1049
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:39,700
Respect is earned, mud flap.

1050
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:44,180
Screaming at these women
is no way to earn any respect.

1051
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:48,380
These aren't women.
These are my fucking bitches, bitch!

1052
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:00,180
Man, look at that. Some of them dykes
are pretty goddamn good, huh?

1053
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,300
- You girls okay?
- Yeah.

1054
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:08,020
I don't like resorting to violence,
but men, they're evil.

1055
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,260
They need healing.

1056
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,260
- Here's for the beer.
- Okay.

1057
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:14,940
- Have a nice day.
- You too.

1058
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,900
Hey, want a bump?

1059
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,620
- Yeah, I need that right now.
- There you go.

1060
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:36,060
So Spider got busted.

1061
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,940
Yeah and that little faggot, Frisbee,
was wearing a goddamned wire.

1062
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:44,500
Get me out! It's bad! It's gone bad!

1063
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,980
Holy shit!

1064
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:49,500
Spider broke a cap off,
nailed him right in the nuts.

1065
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,740
Oh, shit!

1066
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,220
- Is he dead?
- No, he lived.

1067
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,100
That's gotta hurt.

1068
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,900
Jesus Christ, that's gotta hurt.

1069
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,140
- Is Cookie all right?
- She got busted.

1070
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,780
So where we going?

1071
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:12,980
Let's go to the city.

1072
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,060
The city? I don't... I can't, man.

1073
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,140
I can't go. I haven't slept in days.

1074
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:21,260
I'm too fucking high. The car is
on empty. I'm on E here. I just...

1075
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:24,300
- Why do we need to go to the city?
- Listen, pussy boy...

1076
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,100
...you're broke. I'm broke.

1077
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,940
My old lady split. Your old lady took off
with some fucking dyke.

1078
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,980
- So?
- So we gotta get some money.

1079
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:35,500
We gotta go there.

1080
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:37,740
That's where they got
dope and what we need.

1081
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:40,620
And when we go there,
then I'll take care of you, all right?

1082
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,660
No, that's cool.
No, we should go there...

1083
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,940
...because my real girlfriend,
Amy's, there.

1084
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,940
We're supposed to hang out,
so it's actually kind of perfect.

1085
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,660
We'll go to the city.

1086
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:25,100
I gotta stop and make a call.

1087
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,940
Goddamn it, pay-phone boy.
We're just up the road a bit.

1088
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,860
Just keep on driving.

1089
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,100
All right, wait here. I'll be right out.

1090
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,700
Four hundred diamond chips.
I've counted them.

1091
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,860
Given to me by a Hell's Angel.
I think his name was Charles.

1092
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:06,180
Hi! We've been waiting for you.
Where've you been?

1093
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,420
Okay, both of you, out of here.

1094
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,820
Out of here. Out of here. Out of here.

1095
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,620
Are you alone?

1096
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:22,620
I got a little helper with me, a little kid.

1097
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,860
Kid?

1098
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,780
Are you into that? Kids?

1099
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,580
<i>Hi, it's Amy. I'm not here, so leave
a message and I'll call you back.</i>

1100
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:34,900
<i>Hey, Amy, it's me.</i>

1101
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,460
I'm gonna be at the park
in about 20 minutes...

1102
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,300
...and I really wish you'd talk to me.

1103
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:42,860
Okay. Well, here's a little something.

1104
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,580
Nice.

1105
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:47,940
- That's good.
- And here's another.

1106
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,740
- Nicer.
- That's even better.

1107
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:53,780
I want you to know I have changed.

1108
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:57,660
I'm really, you know, trying to be good,
and I have your money.

1109
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:03,140
So I love you, and maybe
you'll come, okay? Bye.

1110
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:07,900
Everything you'll need, you'll find
in that jug, that can and that case.

1111
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:12,100
Okay.

1112
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,500
- Nice.
- Nice.

1113
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:25,340
- Okay, girls.
- Goodbye, lover-boy.

1114
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,180
Mark.

1115
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:32,420
Take a lesson, you two.

1116
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:36,380
That's a real man. Oh, yes!

1117
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,700
I love him.

1118
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,780
Okay, where to?

1119
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,140
I'll make you a deal.

1120
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:21,060
Six months' worth of dope.
Just give me a ride where I gotta go.

1121
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,980
Sounds good. Is it okay if I go
and see my girlfriend?

1122
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,580
I gotta see Amy first.

1123
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:26,780
Yeah, let's go.

1124
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,220
All right.

1125
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,820
Where's my money?

1126
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,660
Money.

1127
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:21,060
- There's plenty more where that's from.
- That's it?

1128
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,020
- Yeah.
- Impressive.

1129
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:24,740
Now you only owe me 350.

1130
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:28,700
Yeah, well, I got a job, you know,
now, and I'm working really hard.

1131
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:31,620
You know, I just...
God. Can I hold you just for a second?

1132
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,900
- Are you on crank?
- No!

1133
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,100
You're spun, aren't you?

1134
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,340
- No, I'm working hard!
- I can't deal with this!

1135
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:40,380
- No, I can't... What?
- I can't deal with this.

1136
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,980
What are you talking about?

1137
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,460
- I got a life now, okay?
- Look...

1138
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,460
Don't touch me!

1139
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,820
I'll call you.

1140
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:56,140
Fuck!

1141
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:20,820
I'm crashing pretty hard right now.
I'm really tired.

1142
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:24,180
That's not good.

1143
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:44,420
I remember a time,
I'll tell you, I was about...

1144
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:49,100
I was little. I don't know, 4, 5 years old,
something like that.

1145
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:54,420
We had this old dog
that had a litter of puppies.

1146
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,340
And I walked
in the bathroom one day...

1147
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,660
...and my mother was standing there,
kneeling down.

1148
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,900
The dog had a litter, about eight,
and my mother was bending over...

1149
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:08,500
...and she was killing each one
of these little puppies in the bathtub.

1150
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:12,380
And I remember, I said, "Why?"

1151
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:19,940
She said, "I'm just killing
what I can't take care of."

1152
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:27,060
Then my mama said to me...
She looked at me, she said:

1153
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,540
"I wish I could do that to you."

1154
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:37,220
Maybe she... Maybe she should've.

1155
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,140
Yeah.

1156
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:50,140
