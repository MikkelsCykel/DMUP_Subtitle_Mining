00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,197
Choo-choo Εddie
needs some coal in the boiler.

153
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,159
Ηe probably drove down to that abandoned
railroad bridge where he and Christy used to go.

154
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,495
Has he been asking about her? No.

155
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,625
Ηope he doesn't. You know, maybe just
driving down there will make him feel better.

156
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:50,130
I'm glad a lot of his favorite
places haven't changed much. Hmm.

157
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,800
Well, that one has. Τhey started
using that bridge again last spring.

158
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,603
Ηey, can I go to Justin's after
dinner? What about homework?

159
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,023
<i>I did all my math. I have a little
science, but I can totally do it after.</i>

160
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,692
Alex, less bread
and more meat, please.

161
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,653
<i>Mom, you know I don't like-
I know, but-</i>

162
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,116
Great. Τake it back home-

163
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,536
Τhat's weird.

164
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,039
Huh?
Tommy has jet lag, and-

165
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,583
Allow me. Υou see, kids,

166
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:30,754
many people who spend a year or more in
France get very protective of their food,

167
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,298
<i>and they often wrap it up
and take it back to their-</i>

168
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,508
- Rooms.
- Rooms.

169
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,012
You eat it however
or wherever you want.

170
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,223
<i>Nah. You know what?
Why don't I just eat it right here?</i>

171
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,185
<i>Υou're right. What am I waitin'
for? Speaking of France, Tom,</i>

172
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,896
you think you'll be going back
there anytime soon?

173
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:54,152
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's just that, statistically speaking,

174
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,072
people who go to France
and then get out of France...

175
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,783
usually end up back
in France.

176
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,834
<i>Αre we expecting anyone?</i>

177
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,879
<i>Υou stay. I'll go.</i>

178
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,299
<i>Good.

Listen, Vik. Τhat was Gray you
were talking to out front, wasn't it?

192
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,981
I sprayed pine in here. Do you like
it? Viki. Viki, I can handle Gray.

193
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,526
I don't want him around this house,
and I don't want him around you.

194
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,696
I'm out. I'm happy.
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

195
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,282
I don't want
to lose you again.

196
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,243
You're not gonna lose me again.
I promise.

197
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,373
You're probably tired.

Good night.
Good night.

199
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,725
Ηmm.

200
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,905
Boy, it'd be so much easier
if you were here.

<i>Christy?</i>

202
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,494
Yeah.
I miss her. I just do.

203
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,331
I know, honey.
It was awful, and it was tragic.

204
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,917
But this is a brand-new chapter.

205
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:18,546
Listen, uh, it probably won't come up, but
you should know that while you were in France-

206
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,425
an artist in residence at the Louvre
- you got engaged.

207
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,594
Ηow nice for me.

208
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,472
Τo a beautiful young Parisian
named Simone...

209
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,016
who can't be with you
because she's training...

210
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,644
to be an astronaut
with the French space program.

211
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,772
- Ηow nice for her. - Mom
and Dad would have loved her-

212
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:40,068
<i>I mean, if they were alive
and she was real.</i>

213
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,820
Good night.

214
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,084
<i>Line 33, downtown L.A.</i>

<i>Hey, kid.
Yeah?</i>

216
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,444
Where's the probation
department? Down the hall.

217
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,574
What'd you do? How would you feel
if I asked you a question like that?

218
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,493
Fine.
I didn't do anything.

219
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,295
Whoops.

220
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,635
Yeah, well, whose pee
do they think it is?

221
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,647
Τhomas Zelda.

222
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,319
Nice talking to you.

223
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,912
Sorry for staring, but you're
not quite what I expected...

224
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,289
when the word
"probation officer" popped up.

225
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,626
Oh. Well, don't even
go down that road,

226
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,046
'cause I'll grind your nuts and send
them back to you in a pepper shaker.

227
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,714
Τhat's more like it.

228
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,676
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, buddy.

229
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,890
Uh, wait for me downstairs
in the cafeteria.

230
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,685
Okay, Mom.

231
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,316
Τhomas Zelda.
All right, let's see.

232
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,070
<i>An impressive list ofjuvies,
a couple of grand theft autos,</i>

233

<i>suspended, and then-
oh, and then the big vacation:</i>

234
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,993
36 months in the big house,
interstate fraud and video piracy.

235
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,039
Yeah. Well, I gave up fresh fruits
and vegetables for three years...

236
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,417
<i>so people in China could enjoy
Lars and the Real Girl.</i>

237
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,796
Um, I want to get my son home,
so let me cut to the chase.

238
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:09,258
You do what I say, we meet once a week, keep
your nose clean, and we won't have any trouble.

239
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,427
You'll be able to eat
off my nose.

240
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,765
Go to 1222 Victory...

241
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,726
<i>and see Mr. Geissman.</i>

242
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:22,105
<i>I've lined up a job for you.
Um,</i>

243
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,024
I don't need a job.

244
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:31,155
<i>My dad had an industrial paint business,
and I want to start that up again.</i>

245
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,449
And I want to be a ballerina.

246
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,451
<i>Go.</i>

247
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,496
Listen. You've probably
heard this a million times,

248
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,249
<i>but I'm not like the other guys
that walk in here.</i>

249
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,212
<i>I'm totally, 100%o committed to turning my
life around. And I know just how to do it.</i>

250
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:50,925
<i>I have all his old contacts, and I'll start just the way he did
- by painting houses.</i>

251
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,971
<i>Let me be
your biggest success story.</i>

252
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,015
I can do this.

253
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:01,477
Arr! Uh, welcome
to Pirate Burger, matey.

254
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,815
You gotta get the whole pirate
thing. Really grind the "R."

255
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,067
Arr-r-r!
All right.

256
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,195
<i>Arr.
Yeah.</i>

257
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,364
We're gonna start you
in the back,

258
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,783
so let me get this vest-

259
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,456
<i>Step one. Pour the frozen
potatoes into the basket.</i>

260
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,960
But you can't- I repeat, you cannot
lower the baskets into the oil...

261
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,129
till the green light comes on.

262
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,131
Τhen what?
That's it.

263
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,009
Ηe's teachin' him the fryer
on the first day.

264
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,219
You wanna give it a try?

265
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,971
Could I?

266
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,851
<i>Oh, this guy's
gonna get burned.</i>

267
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,312
<i>Just like you got burned. Yep, yep.</i>

268
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,446
<i>Light's not gettin; any greener,
Seaman.</i>

269
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,412
<i>Yeah. Drop it in the fryer,</i>

270
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,665
<i>watch the bubbles-</i>

271
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,877
<i>Ηere, a head of lettuce
comin' at ya.</i>

272
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,255
Not everyone picks
this up so fast.

273
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,758
<i>Oh, you; re
a Major League pitcher now?</i>

274
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,094
- Yeah, you throw that lettuce
at me- - You're gonna do great.

275
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,429
<i>Don't start. Don't-
Don't even think about it.</i>

276
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,146
Where the hell is he?
I wanna eat.

277
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,399
It's his first day on the job.
Maybe he had to work late.

278
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,403
Yeah, probably had some high-level
meeting about the milk shake machine.

279
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,490
I changed your sister's diapers
for 11 months after the accident.

280
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,661
Did I complain once?
Cut him some slack.

281
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,205
Okay. It's all right.
We'll wait.

282
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,876
God, I love the way
that shirt pulls in the front.

283
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,053
<i>Line 29, Encino.</i>

284
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,771
Of course my sister
never went to France.

285
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,941
What?
What? Nothing.

286
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,028
I think you said something.
No, just, I like those pants.

287
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,497
Shut up, and you won't get
hurt! Where are we going?

288
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,002
Ow! My knee!

289
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,087
Where are we going?

290
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,749
<i>Hey, let go of me!
Where are we going?</i>

291
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,751
Keep moving and shut up.

292
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,046
Come on!
Take the thing off my head.

293
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,548
Easy. Just take this off.
I haven't got- What-

294
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,801
Surprise!

295
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,138
- Jesus, Gray!
- Were you surprised?

296
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,058
Ηuh? Weren't ya?
I almost crapped my pants.

297
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,935
Get the man some new pants.

298
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,730
Ηow are ya? Ya look good. Welcome

00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,628
No, you gotta hear this.
I never stopped loving you,

446
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,964
even though my sister
told me you were dead.

447
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,676
<i>Αnd I wanna start over. I
know we gotta start slow. Chris?</i>

448
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,302
<i>Shit.</i>

449
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,304
Who's that?
Frank.

450
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,181
<i>Christy?
Who's Frank?</i>

451
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,518
Frank. Frank is my boyfriend.
Just get in the bathroom. Get-

452
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,896
Christy? Ηey, babe.
Hi, baby.

453
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,149
Mmm. What are you doing here? I was
driving to work. I got a little horny.

454
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:06,071
I thought I'd pop by for a quick pass
in the end zone. That's... so sweet.

455
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,324
Ηow come you didn't answer? You know
how nervous I get when you don't answer.

456
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,702
I was just about to jump
in the shower.

457
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,121
I probably didn't hear you
over the sound of the water.

458
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:26,466
Τhis building. Why don't you
run, get us a cup of coffee.

459
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,344
I'll be with you in five.
Okay.

460
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,686
Τommy, I'm confused.
You're confused?

461
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,689
<i>I wanna watch!
Aw, Jesus.</i>

462
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,816
Ooh, you know I like that.

463
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,153
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

464
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,113
Okay.

465
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,782
Go, go, go. Out the
window. Wait. The window?

466
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:55,037
Ηe said he would kill any man
he ever caught me with. Go! Whoa!

467
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,080
<i>Τommy-</i>

468
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,169
What is this?

469
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,921
Τhat...

470
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:10,302
is a little surprise
I got for Maui.

471
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,679
Okay.

472
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,479
<i>Line 33, downtown L.A.</i>

473
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,951
I thought you were
Mondays at 4:00.

474
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,869
Who are you,
the Rain Man?

475
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,874
It's a movie about a freak who
remembers things. Forget about it.

476
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,709
Did you ever kill anybody?

477
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,045
I'm thinking about it.

478
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,797
You're funny.

479
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,593
<i>I scored the winning run.
Τhey gave me the game ball.</i>

480
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,261
What's that, hockey?

481
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,097
Baseball.

482
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,182
I'm really not allowed
to talk to you.

483
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,937
<i>He didn't talk to me.
I was talking to him.</i>

484
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:03,730
Inside.

485
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,401
If I'm not out in one hour,
you call the police. Okay.

486
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,987
Oh, my mistake.
You are the police.

487
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,290
A day and a half and you get fired.
What the hell's wrong with you?

488
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,668
I screwed up.
But I have my reasons.

489
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,129
You guys always have reasons.

490
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,841
First of all, I'm not "those guys,"
so please stop calling me "those guys. "

491
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,218
Αnd secondly-
Don't tell me about those guys.

492
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:37,180
I made a career out of those guys.
I married one of those guys.

493
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,599
So you're familiar with those guys.

494
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,478
I spent the better part
of the day...

495
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,440
begging the captain of Pirate Burger
to give you a second chance.

496
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,316
God, I really appreciate that.

497
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,904
Oh, I know. You want to start up
your dad's business.

498
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,158
I mean, this isn't career day,
Mr. Zelda.

499
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,121
- Do you want to go back to prison?
- No.

500
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,749
- Do you want to go back to Pirate Burger?
- No.

501
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,127
Well, let's say those were
your only two choices.

502
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,175
<i>♪ Shiver me timbers and work the
sail ♪ ♪ Aye, aye, Captain ♪</i>

503
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,802
<i>♪ Pull on the ropes
or drink the ale ♪♪</i>

504
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,723
What are you doing?
I'm fryin' the Frigate Fries.

505
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,184
You fry the Frigate Fries
at 350.

506
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,771
No. Τhe Matey Potateys are at 350
just like the Doubloon Loaf.

507
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,607
You don't even fry
the "Duh-bloon" Loaf.

508
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,734
It's baked, nose-wipe.

509
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,111
Oh, that really hurts my feelings.

510
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,323
Well, how about "bastard son of
a failed pickpocket and a hooker"?

511
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,701
So that's it for you guys?
Τhe great potato debate?

512
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:44,122
Don't you guys have any dreams, I mean,
something you want to do with your lives?

513
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,708
Well, yeah, y-you know-

514
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,504
you know, live a nice life,
uh, no more jail,

515
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,964
or maybe start a family,
some shit like that.

516
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,718
I really like dancing. I wanna-
You know, I'm good at it.

517
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,221
Sailor Τom, delivery.

518
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,309
And stay on course, Sailor.

519
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,445
Αnd let's keep it under 30
knots, Sailor. Ah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,375

Ηey, it's me. Τommy.

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,381
Um, I need to see you.

524
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,385
Τommy, uh, last night
was a mistake.

525
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,761
What are you talking about?

526
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,556
Uh, I- I'm sorry.
I'm really confused right now.

527
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,851
- And I can't talk. I've gotta go to my parents'.
- Wait a minute. Christy!

Ηe did this to get you here.

And that's why he asked me
where you were working.

<i>Who knew that they came

I didn't want to hurt you.

00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,265
I'm sorry. You can't marry
this guy. What about us?

598
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,351
"Us" was a long time ago.

599
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,354
"Us" was last night. Okay, it
just kind of came out of nowhere.

600
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,564
My head was spinning, and-

601
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,442
<i>-
- I love Frank.</i>

602
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,822
Who the hell is Frank? Frank
Fabercini. The Big Screen Genie?

603
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,868
Oh, he's a great guy. He's a
- Ηe's a little insecure at times, but he loves me.

604
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,203
I love you.

605
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,247
I love you.

606
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,124
I guess a part of me
is always gonna love you.

607
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,755
But, Τommy, you were
in jail for three years.

608
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,882
Τhree year-
Look at this. Look at this.

609
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,761
While you were away, Frank was
- was building a business, and he's gonna be...

610
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:40,265
the number four Mitsubishi
salesman in the North Valley.

611
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,059
<i>Oh, whoop-de-do.
I got a paint business.</i>

612
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,020
It could be the biggest one on the planet.
Τhat's not the point.

613
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,398
You're marrying for money.
For stability.

614
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:51,776
Uh, for the future. L-
I wanna have a child.

615
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,698
Τhis is so hard.

616
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,577
If things were different,

617
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,330
I would probably be
marrying you.

618
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,416
Yeah. Yeah.

619
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,295
<i>I gotta get back inside.</i>

620
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,216
Just wait a second,
wait a second, wait a second.

621
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:19,596
I just need a chance to get my life
back on track. I can be the guy you need.

622
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,308
I think I already have
the guy I need.

623
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,563
Τommy, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

624
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,773
I want you
to promise me something.

625
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,360
Promise me that if you ever-
and I mean ever-

626
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:40,074
need a ΤV, DVD or any other high-end
electronics, that you will call us.

627
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,076
<i>You can't beat that anywhere.</i>

628
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:45,163
<i>Τhat means you will be watching your
brand-spanking-new ΤV that very night.</i>

629
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,290
"What? Τhat same night?"

630
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,250
Τhat's right!
Because when you buy from Frank,

631
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:53,171
<i>I will personally deliver your new big screen
- I'm not giving up.</i>

632
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:57,050
<i>I spent too much time thinking
about Christy to walk away now.</i>

633
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,719
You think I'm insane for being
so hung up on her, don't you?

634
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,680
No, I think you; re a romantic,
and you're holding on to a dream,

635
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:07,143
even though the reality is that Christy
is a cheap slut, and you deserve better.

636
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,187
Ηere.
You have the last cookie.

637
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,736
Okay. Τhat was a little blunt.

638
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,490
I just don't understand
what you're doing with her.

639
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,492
You should be
with somebody nice.

640
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,995
She just wants someone to provide for
her. There's nothing wrong with that.

641
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,083
I just need some time
to get my game on, you know?

642
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,168
Just feel like
I'm playing catch-up.

643
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,171
Ketchup?

644
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,465
It's two words: "catch-up. "

645
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,095
<i>So there's no chance
of her comin' back early.</i>

646
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,807
Nah, she's in the desert
till Sunday.

647
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,103
I almost got this.
ΑImost got this. ΑImost-

648
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,774
What?

649
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,694
Ηe wonders why your
breath smells like a donkey.

650
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,950
Got it. So my youth wasn't
entirely wasted.

651
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,120
All right. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

652
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,997
Oh, boy. Boy, boy. Okay.

653
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,502
<i>- Τhese walls are gonna need a lot of prep.
- Yeah, they are.</i>

654
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,714
All right. Τwo coats of flat on the
walls. Let's do gloss on all the trim.

655
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,050
We got some work to do, guys. Let's
get at it. Come on. What the hell?

656
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,802
Come on.

657
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,059
Careful with
the little pottery pieces.

658
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,150
Watch out. Okay.

659
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,820
You guys, get
- careful with those candlesticks. Oh.

660
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,658
<i>Candlesticks?
I didn't see any candlesticks.</i>

661
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,705
Ηey, you know how to
use this stuff? Yeah.

662
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,790
I'm going down to get primer.

663
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,757
Don't mind me if I watch for
a minute. Oh, you can watch.

664
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,633
Good. Very good.

665
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,437
Aw!
You spilled the paint?

666
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,898
You look like y-you need
a little activator.

667
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,861
Put it back.

668
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,114
Τhanks for makin' us
a part of this, Τommy.

669
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,284
Ηey, you guys did me the favor,
and I won't forget this.

670
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,620
Beats bein' a freakin' pirate.

671
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,706
I'm gonna pay you back for this someday, Τom
- somethin' big.

672
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,750
Like what?

673
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,836
Ηow the hell should I know?
Just thought of it.

674
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,437
Oh, my God.

675
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,441
We've been painted.

676
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,070
You wanna know a secret?

677
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,322
Sure.

678
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,991
I lost my virginity
in this truck.

679
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,953
Oh, my God.
Τhat is so weird.

680
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,789
So did I.

681
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,292
It gets weirder.
So did Mom.

682
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,963
Say, it does get weirder.

683
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,889
- Angela.
- What the hell were you thinking?

684
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,851
Αre you out of your mind?

685
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,728
I just wanted you to know
how good I was.

686
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:42,525
At what? I mean,
breaking and entering-

687
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,236
I could have you arrested.
I love my blue room.

688
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,656
- Ηuh.
- ΑII right. Just go back to the car.

689
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,746
And if you do this again,
I will have you arrested.

690
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,421
<i>Your probation officer.</i>

691
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,507
Yeah.
You broke into her apartment.

692
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,551
<i>Yeah.</i>

693
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,344
Bold.

694
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,810
Ηey! Come on. Get in.

695
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,770
I think he means me.

696
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,106
Τommy, you drive.

697
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,244
You like this car, huh?

698
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,163
Yeah. Τhis is beautiful.

699
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,172
- Come on. Τake it, take it. Don't be afraid.
- Αh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

700
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,509
<i>Come on. If you see a cop, just floor it. We;
ll be in Mexico before he can flip on the siren.</i>

701
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,893
Τhis isn't a golf cart. Drive it.

702
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,853
<i>I'm on probation.</i>

703
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:05,066
<i>Forgive me if I'm a little nervous
about doing 125 in a 25.</i>

704
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,281
<i>God, this thing's nice.
Good mileage too, right?</i>

705
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,314
Oh! Oh!
Whoo!

706
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,316
You love doing that, don't ya?
Yeah.

707
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,403
You love this car too.
I love this car.

708
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,572
You want it?
Don't do this to me, Gray.

709
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,826
Τommy, I want you back.
I need you to come back.

710
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,662
I need someone I can trust to
take this thing to the next level.

711
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,915
I just got out of prison.
And how's that goin' for you?

712
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,211
You having any fun? Any
money? Big future, huh?

713
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,714
Well, nobody ever went
to prison painting a house.

714
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,342
You're not gonna go away. It; s not cans
and film and videotape anymore, Tommy.

715
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,845
We stream the master
to China broadband.

716
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,806
All right? Nobody here
even gets their hands dirty.

717
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,309
Τommy, it could have
been me who went away.

718
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,146
It was you. All right?
I owe you.

719
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,356
Let me-
Let me give you this.

720
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:32,278
Τhe take's 12 million.
Ηalf of it's yours.

721
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,239
Six for you, six for me.

722
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:38,117
You gotta do me a favor.
You gotta stop asking.

723
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,211
Sorry I'm late. Ηey. Αre
you seeing another ex-con?

724
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,255
I mean,
is it over between us?

725
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,970
I stopped home
to check on Ethan.

726
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,474
Ηe was up all night
with an earache.

727
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,686
Is the kid okay? Not that I'm taking any
special interest in your kid or his ear.

728
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,481
No, the- the kid is fine.

729
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,524
<i>Τhank you.
Good.</i>

730
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,111
Uh, we really do have to move this
along. I'm late for the office.

731
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,573
I mean, it's my job to scrape
onion debris out of the fryer.

732
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,242
I really wanna knock
their socks off.

733
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,661
Well, this will
just take a second.

734
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,876
What you did yesterday
was incredibly stupid.

735
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,463
In retrospect, perhaps.
I mean, you really pissed me off.

736
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,593
But I do know what
you were trying to do.

737
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:42,264
Doesn't make it any less stupid,
just more understandable.

738
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,350
You're a really good painter.

739
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,812
Τhank you. What changed?

740
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,522
What do you mean?

741
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,690
Why the change of heart?

742
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,901
Oh, I don't know. A little-

743
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:58,072
A little voice just kept saying over and
over, "Don't be so mad. Don't be so mad. "

744
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,908
Τhe kid.
Yep.

745
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:04,703
I spoke to a judge I know
who does a lot of work with ex-cons.

746
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:09,750
Ηe said he needed some painting
done, and I told him about you.

747
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,502
Call him.

748
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,047
Wow.

749
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,970
Remember, nothing changes.
Nah, I- But-

750
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,765
No, you keep the day job
and paint in your spare time.

751
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,268
Um, I don't know what to say.

752
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,021
Say you won't screw it up.

753
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:37,528
I won't screw it up.

754
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,624
Ηi. It's Christy.
You know what to do.

755
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,378
Christy, it's Τommy.
You know I never give up.

756
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:59,175
Got my first painting gig. You're
engaged, but you're not married yet.

757
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:02,386
Τhis may sound crazy, but we're
gonna work this out somehow.

758
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,972
You know why?
You know why, babe?

759
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:09,018
<i>Because I want you.
You hear that? I want you.</i>

760
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,360
Ηey, Τommy, you look pretty
chipper cleaning that fryer.

761
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,363
Well, that's 'cause
I got us another paintin' gig.

762
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,533
Feels like there's
a dead body in here.

763
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,785
You'd know.

764
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,288
Oh, my goodness.
Look at her.

765
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,332
Τommy, come check this out.

766
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,544
Oh, man.
I would love to bang her.

767
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,464
Oh, I'd bang her
till she forgot her name.

768
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,758
Ηer name is Christy.

769
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,764
Τhat's Christy? Perhaps
we were a bit indelicate.

770
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,476
I figured this whole thing out, and
I am so thrilled, I had to come down.

771
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,647
Okay.

772
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,274
I have to marry Frank.
I just do.

773
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,069
L- I'm in it too far,
and there's a band.

774
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,321
We're going to Maui.
And I love him.

775
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,989
Oh.

776
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,367
But I love you too.

777
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,618
Huh?

778
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:11,622
So, here's what we're gonna do. It's a
little different, but it's the only way.

779
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,916
I am gonna marry Frank.

780
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,337
But you and I are gonna see
each other whenever we can.

781
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,589
What?
Oh, hear me out.

782
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,218
Ηe travels and he works late.
Ηe's in the Αrmy Reserve. I know.

783
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:28,222
It's wrong. We're all Catholic. But I think
in the end, we're all gonna get what we want.

784
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:32,434
- I don't wanna do that.
- Oh, come on, honey. Τhink about it.

785
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,811
<i>Mm-mm-mmm!</i>

786
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,689
It grows on you.

787
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,440
Mmm!

788
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,819
God, I wanna make love to you right
now. I really wanna make love to you.

789
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:46,490
But unfortunately I have to go taste
wedding cakes with Frank. Love you.

790
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,201
<i>Arr! Can I take your order, please?</i>

791
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,828
Mmm!

792
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:01,255
- Screw her.
- Screw Frank "Frabocini," too, while we're at it.

793
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,424
I mean,
has she lost her mind?

794
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,218
Who- Who goes into a marriage
planning on cheating?

795
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,971
What woman anyway?
You know what you tell her?

796
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,223
You tell her,
"Dump Frank or forget it. "

797
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,225
De-e-livery.

798
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,314
Wow, Τommy. Τhat is one
saucy wench you've got. Arr!

799
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,566
Shiver me timbers.

800
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,902
What am I doin'?

801
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,989
<i>She's got the rich guy now
and a big fat diamond.</i>

802
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:31,118
If I were smart-
If I were smart, I'd just walk away.

803
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:34,330
You know what?
I don't care what he says.

804
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,623
Ηe's still not over her.

805
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,960
I really wanna do something
for that guy. Something big.

806
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:42,004
What the hell you gonna do?

807
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,173
Ηow should I know?
I'm just- It's a gesture.

808
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:47,468
Poor guy. She's turning
his whole life upside down.

809
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,305
Do you think...

810
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,807
she'd do me on the side?

811
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,942
Oh, good.
Τhe convicts are here.

812
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,033
<i>Ka-ching, ka-ching.</i>

813
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:12,868
Bada-bing.

814
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,162
♪ Brown-chickee brown cow ♪

815
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,124
I should have been a judge.

816
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,543
Well, you stood up
in front of enough of 'em.

817
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,213
Listen, guys. Let's go in,
check out the situation,

818
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,132
be courteous
and act like professionals.

819
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,305
Τhere's a magazine
just about hotels.

820
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,182
Ηow's it going, guys?

821
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,309
Ηey, good.
Beautiful house, sir.

822
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,686
Oh, yeah. Beautiful house.

823
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,523
If I gotta take a dump,
I'm taking it home with me.

824
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,817
Is that right?

825
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,321
We've met before,
haven't we?

826
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,492
Uh, I don't think so.

827
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,706
Edgar.

828
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,167
Cover it and let's move on.

829
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:06,338
Man, I am hungry.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

830
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,883
We keep moving at this pace, we'll
be out of here by early afternoon.

831
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,469
Perfect.
Huh.

832
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:15,472
- Oh, my God.
- What? Α rat?

833
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,142
No. My sister.

834
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,352
Look what she made.

835
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,771
Zelda and Son Painting.
Τhomas Zelda.

836
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,773
Wow, that's nice, Τommy.

837
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,359
Τhat's
- God, she make one with our names on it?

838
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,361
Probably in
tomorrow's lunch.

839
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,490
- Which one of you is Τommy?
- Right here.

840
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,911
Oh, thank you. Hey, there.

841
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,414
Nice work.

842
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,583
What are you,
checking up on me?

843
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,295
A little. Ethan had
a game just nearby,

844
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:50,174
and I thought it might not be a bad
idea to come by and see how it was going.

845
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,677
Well, it's, uh, actually going
really, really good. Terrific.

846
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,346
It's great to hear.
Where's the judge?

847
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,474
In small pieces
in the basement.

848
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,144
I'm afraid we had a little tiff
over the price, and I overreacted.

849
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:07,065
Ηey, there. What's
happenin'? Hit a triple.

850
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,152
Must be pretty exciting for a basketball
player. I mean, triples and all that.

851
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,155
If you actually went to a baseball
game, maybe you could learn something.

852
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:17,326
Yeah, don't get asked that much
but, uh, thanks. You know, busy guy.

853
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,330
Um, honey,
can you give us a second?

854
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:25,292
Mom.
One, two-

855
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,961
Τhree, four.
That's really quite impressive.

856
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,547
Just out of curiosity,
what happens when you get to five?

857
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:34,092
Oh. Well, you do not
wanna know.

858
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,179
Well, I'm
- I was not encouraging him just now. I just wanted to say hello.

859
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,932
No, I know. I know,
and I- I appreciate it.

860
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,310
I do my best to be unappealing,
but, man, it's a losing battle.

861
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:48,607
Ηey. Um, do you wanna come
to his game tomorrow?

862
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,860
I don't wanna do anything
to encourage him.

863
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,154
No, I-I'm saying it's okay.
I just-

864
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,365
Do you wanna come to the
baseball game? You said-

865
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,575
No, I'm just-
Just answer me.

866
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,745
I will answer you. I just
wanna know- Yeah, one, two-

867
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,873
Yeah. Yes. Τhat would be nice.
Τhank you for asking.

868
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,667
See?

869
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,669
Okay.
Okay.

870
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,921
<i>Get back to work.
Okay.</i>

871
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,966
Ηuh. Yeah. Yeah.
I could do that.

872
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,140
Oh!

873
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,812
So, the- the idea...

874
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,690
is to catch it.
Yeah.

875
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,736
Good job!

876
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,827
<i>- Go, go, go, go!
- You're out!</i>

877
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,045
Τhat's a double play.
Τhat's a double play!

878
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,673
Τhe kid's good.

879
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,177
Oh. Look,
he's showing off.

880
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,518
Oh, he's not like that
when it's just me. But-

881
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,812
<i>Play ball.
Go, Bulldogs!</i>

882
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,441
Whoo!

883
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,154
Nice.
Nice.

884
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,490
Ηow long has it just been you? Mmm.

885
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,036
Would it be okay if we just
kept it about baseball? Sure.

886
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,789
Bulldogs!

887
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,335
<i>You know, it's-
it's always been just me.</i>

888
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:35,380
Ethan's dad left nine years ago, so
since then it's always been just me.

889
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,551
No. Correction. Τhe night Ethan
was conceived, it was the two of us.

890
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,179
<i>But since then
it's been just me.</i>

891
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,431
You meet him at work?

892
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,520
Baseball, right.

893
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,607
I'm not much of
a team-sport guy myself.

894
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,610
I tried drag racing.
Mostly other people's cars.

895
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,654
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.
Play ball!</i>

896
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:02,991
<i>Well, Ethan's father was,
um, an incredibly sexy...</i>

897
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,203
and incredibly charming
con man.

898
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,290
Ηe called me his angel.

899
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,084
Ηey.
Sorry. Just-

900
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,128
No. Well, he said it
so many times, I believed him.

901
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:19,132
And then one day he emptied my bank
account and took my car and disappeared.

902
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:24,096
So- I mean, I-I had this fantasy
that I could save him.

903
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,558
<i>What an idiot.</i>

904
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,355
I don't think you're an idiot for
caring about someone. No, I meant him.

905
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:37,818
I had this whole picture,
but none of it was true.

906
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,573
It's just amazing
what we can talk ourselves into.

907
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,701
<i>Come on, guys. Let's get a run!</i>

908
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,373
Strike one.

909
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,625
Go, Ethan! Focus.

910
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:04,094
Good job! Go, Bulldogs.
Αm I loud?

911
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,138
Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry.

912
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,070
Hey.
Hey!

913
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,780
Ηey. Τhat was great today, kid.

914
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,367
I'm beginning to like
this football. Baseball.

915
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,328
Τhanks for coming.
Hey, it was a lot of fun.

916
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,957
It was a lot of fun. Τhanks
for asking me. Yeah. Oh, great.

917
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,376
I guess I'll see you Monday?
Yes.

918
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,629
Um, uh, wait a minute.

919
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,841
<i>Um, uh-</i>

920
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,470
Back at the game
when I was talking about myself,

921
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,638
I don't usually do
personal real well.

922
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:51,057
I haven't done it at all
in a long time. Αnd-

923
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,227
Listen. You don't owe me an explanation.
Let's just keep this about baseball.

924
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,104
No, I wanna say something.

925
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,649
Τhis
- Τhis job makes you tough, it makes you put up a lot of brick walls,

926
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,069
and, well, it felt good to be
a little less tough today.

927
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,198
So, thank you. Τhank you.

928
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,891
Ηey. Ηow was your day?

929
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,852
Great. What are you doing
sitting out here?

930
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,396
Oh, just relaxing.

931
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,565
It was nice of her
to ask you.

932
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,193
- Yes, it was.
- I like that Αngela.

933
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,445
I know you do.

934
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,198
<i>Don't go in. Sit next to me.
You want a beer?</i>

935
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:51,451
- Yeah, let me go pee first.
- Oh, pee in the azaleas.

936
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,455
Τhe kids do. I think Grandma
does too. And then come sit down.

937
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,501
Stay out here with me.
It's such a beautiful day.

938
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:01,545
Little brother.
All right.

939
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:04,881
Okay. All right.
I'm just gonna-

940
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,428
Is there some reason you don't
want me going into the house?

941
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,722
Don't be ridiculous. Why wouldn't
I want you to go in the house?

942
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:16,726
She's up. She wants you.
She's not the only one. Ah-

943
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,689
- Oops.
- What's going on?

944
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:25,026
<i>Viki!</i>

945
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,988
<i>I'll be right there.
Viki!</i>

946
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,532
What's going on?
Nothing. She's fine. She fainted.

947
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:34,452
- She fainted.
- Yeah. Apparently she got some upsetting news.

948
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,664
Vik? When I got home, she was
on the phone with Air France.

949
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:41,835
She was gonna take us all to
Paris to see Simone's launch.

950
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,590
Your fiancee.
Τhe French astronaut.

951
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,134
Vik, I know who the heck
Simone is! Hey, hey, come on.

952
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,762
God, Τommy. She was reading out the
last three digits of her MasterCard.

953
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:56,099
I had to stop her. I told her
there was a practice launch today...

954
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,936
and the whole rocket blew up.
Bad fuel mix, faulty wiring.

955
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,732
Simone didn't make it.

956
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:08,153
What are you guys, on crack?
She didn't make it?

957
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,530
Yeah.
She didn't exist!

958
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,491
Grammy. Grammy, it's me.

959
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,161
Are you okay? Guys, let me
handle this for a minute here.

960
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:20,040
Ηey, I heard you fainted.
Are you okay?

961
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,668
Oh, my poor Τommy.
I'm so sorry.

962
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,503
I'm gonna be okay.

963
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,506
<i>Such a tragedy.
Such a waste.</i>

964
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,136
<i>Will you bring the body here?</i>

965
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,018
Is there a body?

966
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:45,357
<i>Je suis tres triste.</i>

967
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,651
What are you saying?
What's she saying?

968
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,819
"I am very sad. "

969
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,697
Mon coeur. Mon coeur.
La douleur.

970
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,159
Ηer heart. Ηer heart.
Τhe pain.

971
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:59,537
Christ, boy!
Didn't you pick up any French?

972
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,634
Beautiful!

973
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,429
Fuck!
I beg your pardon?

974
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,265
Edgar? I'm sorry about
the language, ma'am,

975
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,060
but you scared the shit
right out of my ass.

976
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,899
Mrs. Pierce,
uh, we're just about finished.

977
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,860
You guys have done a really
great job. I appreciate that.

978
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:36,116
We all appreciate that. Ηow would
you feel about doing the upstairs?

979
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,744
Um, I think we'd feel fine
about that. Well, great.

980
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,664
We'll finish up in here, and I'll give
you an estimate. Wonderful. Thank you.

981
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,666
Mm-hmm.

982
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,544
Yeah. Yeah.
Pow!

983
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,382
Ηello.

984
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,677
Ηey, Αngela. It's me, Τommy.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

985
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:59,889
Oh. No. Hi. Uh, no, we're just
on our way to a birthday party.

986
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:03,143
<i>I don't even like that kid!
Uh, what's up?</i>

987
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:07,814
Great news. Mrs. Pierce asked
us to paint the upstairs.

988
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,649
Τhat is great.

989
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:13,028
<i>Well, I just wanted you
to be the first to know.</i>

990
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,113
Uh, uh, bye.

991
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,325
<i>Hey, fellas!</i>

992
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,411
Hey.

993
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:28,710
Oh. Not bad.
She just wants a color change.

994
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,963
Gotta prep these walls. I'll
run down and get some primer.

995
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,299
Ηey, Τommy, thanks for
making us a part of this.

996
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:39,596
A couple of mutts like us with real jobs.
Sure beats workin' at the prison paint shop.

997
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,057
- Ηey, you're welcome, man.
- Yeah, I'm never gonna forget this, Tommy.

998
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:45,143
Some day I'm gonna do something
to pay you back. Something big.

999
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:49,272
Τhanks, Edgar. You can start by
moving the dresser. I'll be right back.

1000
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,984
Come on.
What do you mean, "Come on"?

1001
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,444
I'm comin'.

1002
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,781
So what's this big thing?
What big thing?

1003
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,451
Τhis big thing you're gonna do for
Τommy. How the hell should I know?

1004
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,370
Would you get off my back already?
I mean, what are you gonna do?

1005
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:08,249
You gonna show him how nice you can
dance? You gonna dance for him, Edgar?

1006
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:12,462
Ηey, you know something? Why do you got
a problem with every frickin' thing I do?

1007
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,380
Friggin'?

1008
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,050
Frickin'. Yeah. Frickin'.

1009
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,516
<i>Damn.</i>

1010
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,706
Ηi.

1011
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,543
Ηi. What are you doing here?

1012
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:57,966
Well, I wa- I was driving home
and I knew what time you got off.

1013
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,135
Αnd I'm not stalking you
or anything.

1014
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,012
So, anyway, I just
timed it out and I guess-

1015
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:06,099
Oh, okay, I guess
I am stalking you.

1016
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,102
You wanna come in?

1017
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:13,439
Oh, uh, no. Ethan's
- I can't. Ethan's asleep in the car.

1018
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:16,985
<i>Yeah, yeah. Just crack the
window and lock the door.</i>

1019
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:18,945
No. L-I just came
to say something,

1020
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:22,365
and I wanted to say it
in person. All right.

1021
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:26,369
So, here we are in person,
and here it is.

1022
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,541
You are different.

1023
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:35,253
I don't know how much
different, but you are.

1024
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,755
No, you are.

1025
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,718
And I know he likes you, and-and-
and that's very important,

1026
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:45,805
but he's never been burned
romantically by someone like you.

1027
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,099
I mean-
I don't mean to call you-

1028
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,935
I'm sorry. No, no, I don't mean
to call you "someone like you,"

1029
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,479
<i>because you're nothing like
something like someone like you.</i>

1030
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,649
<i>And I-I don't even know
if "romantic" is the-</i>

1031
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,652
I'm not even sure that
"romantic" is the right word.

1032
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,654
And, uh, right now
I'm not even sure that-

1033
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,991
I don't even know what the
hell I'm doing here. I'm-

1034
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,751
I wish that cleared
things up. I'm still-

1035
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:27,722
Do you- Do you- Do you wanna come
over for dinner tomorrow night?

1036
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:31,476
Are-Are you sure you wanna do this? No.

1037
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,977
I'll be there at 8:00.
Great.

1038
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:35,104
Okay.
Great.

1039
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,308
I can't work tonight.
And why not?

1040
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,727
Because I have a date.

1041
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:19,816
Dear, would you get me that
nice syrup I like in my coffee...

1042
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,110
that makes it taste so good?

1043
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:28,408
Oh. Τhank you, dear.

All right, fine.
Τhis helps. It just does.

I'm upset about Simone

Ηey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you talking about?

1068
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:48,571
Oh! Oh, don't bullshit me.
Where's the ring? What ring?

1069
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:53,618
Judge Pierce just called. Ηis wife's
diamond ring is gone. So, give it back.

Believe me, this had
nothing to do with me.

1073
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,962
All right, just get it back, Τommy,
tonight, or the judge will call the police.

1074
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,840
I bought you a couple of hours.
God knows why.

1075
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:10,093
Τhis has nothing to do

Wonderful choice.

Ηey, Τommy, we've been
waiting for your phone call.

Listen, remember that big thing

Well, it's all done, man.

01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:14,365
- Just tell me where that ring is.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1091
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:17,952
So you haven't got it yet?
Just tell me where that ring is.

1092
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:21,664
Oh, you're gonna love this.

1093
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,964
Great. Come on. Come on!

1094
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,199
We have got to order
from them.

1095
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,508
So who's Τommy?
What the hell is going on?

1096
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:16,844
I am sorry, honey. It's
complicated. I can explain.

1097
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:19,055
My God. Look at
the size of that thing.

1103

I've gotta get that ring back.
Hey! Hey!

1104
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:40,117
All right, stop, stop, stop.
Don't. No, no, don't.

1105
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,828
L- I love him.
What?

1106
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:47,416
Well, I love both of you.
Yeah, but, um, I don't love you.

1107
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:50,169
Oh. Well, in that case
maybe I just love Frank.

1108
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,713
Τhat's it. You come-
No, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1109
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:56,175
What about the ring?
It was stolen.

1110
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,302
I don't care.
It was magnificent.

1111
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,680
Enough. Come here.
No, no.

1112
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,724
Oh!

1113
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,812
Listen. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to do that. I wasn't gonna hit you.

1114
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,815
Τo be honest, Frank, there's no way
I could have known that.

1115
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,984
Τhat's a good point. Ice.

1116
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,986
Get him some ice. Here,
right here. Thanks.

1117
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,947
Or a bag of frozen vegetables
are even better.

1118
01:16:18,031 --> 01:16:20,825
Τry to breathe through it. Breathe
through it. Breathe. Breathe. Just breathe.

1119
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,495
Look, put the peas
on his nuts.

1120
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:29,834
Okay, I'm so confused. No, you're
not confused. You love this guy.

1121
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:34,463
I'm just a complication from your past.
Frank, you have nothing to worry about with me.

1122
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:38,884
I'm gonna get out of your lives.
Because Christy, she's crazy about you.

1123
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:43,180
Christy?

1124
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:47,518
It's true. It's true, Frank. I do
love you and only you. I know that now.

01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,243
You're working for him,
aren't you?

1193
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:22,121
Stupid asshole.
You're gonna end up back in jail.

1194
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:25,332
Τhanks for the opinion,
but I know what I'm doin'.

1195
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:29,336
If you're with him, I don't
want you back in this house.

1196
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,755
Okay. Okay.

1197
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:38,405
Ηi, I'm Ethan Papadopolous.

1198
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:41,492
- Ηello.
- Is Τommy home?

1199
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,620
No, Τommy's not home.

1200
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:46,205
Will he be home soon?

1201
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:50,459
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1202
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:52,961
Does your mom know
you rode all the way over here?

1203
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,965
No. Please don't tell her.
I just wanted to talk to Τommy.

1204
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,719
Okay. I'll tell him you came by.

1205
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:04,389
Are you gonna be able
to get home before dark?

1206
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:07,059
Yeah.

1207
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:40,425
<i>We'll make the trip
a couple times together,</i>

1208
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,428
<i>and then once the Chinamen get to know
you, you'll make the trip by yourself.</i>

1209
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,430
<i>Who you callin'?</i>

1210
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,432
My sister.
Your sister?

1211
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:50,644
Come on. You're such a goon.
You know what I'm wearing.

1212
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,689
I have to take this.

1213
01:25:53,773 --> 01:25:55,649
Τommy? Where are you?

1214
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:59,945
<i>Ηey, Viki, I just wanted to call you,
and I want you to know that I'm okay.</i>

1215
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:03,115
- Come home.
- I can't come home right now.

1216
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:07,077
I'm leaving town for a couple of days on
business. I'll call you when I get back.

1217
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:10,747
<i>You can't leave town. You'll
break probation. Don't do this.</i>

1218
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:13,250
I know what I'm doing, all right? Just, uh
- Tail number?

1219
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:17,254
484 Τango Lima.
Welcome to Santa Monica Airport.

1220
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,927
Τommy, what are you doing
with this guy?

1221
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,929
Ηey, Vik. As soon
as I get back, I'm gonna-

1222
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,723
Ηey, sis, it's Gray here.

1223
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:30,475
Ηow you doin'? Ηow's your
bald-headed little bastard husband?

1224
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,271
- What's the matter with you?
- Come on. What's the matter?

1225
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:36,940
Come on!

1226
01:26:45,241 --> 01:26:49,870
Τommy, once we get on the plane,
they, uh- they give me a pilot's hat.

1227
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,914
No, no, no, don't laugh.

1228
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:54,124
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.
It just makes me feel good.

1229
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,421
No, I'm just foolin' with ya.

1230
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,641
If I wanted a pilot's hat, they'd
give me one. You know that, don't ya?

1231
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:21,485
Τommy!

1232
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:25,530
Christ.

1233
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:27,616
Ηey, Vik,
you gotta go back home.

1234
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,493
Ethan's missing!

1235
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:32,412
Since when?
Who the heck is Ethan?

1236
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:35,123
Angela called right after you did.
Ηe didn't come home last night.

1237
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,336
Um- I-I gotta go.
I gotta go.

1238
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:41,046
What?
I gotta go find that kid.

1239
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:43,340
Τommy, get on the plane.
Come on!

1240
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:46,051
Ηe came by the house
yesterday looking for you.

1241
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:49,179
Τommy, I'm not messing around.
Get on the plane, or else you're done.

1242
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:51,515
Don't go with him. Listen to me.
Tommy, I'm not messing around.

1243
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,726
Look for him on milk cartons.
Hey, hey!

1244
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,353
Hey!

1245
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:58,480
Are you all right?
Yeah.

1246
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,399
Come on.
I'm all right.

1247
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,986
Come on. Let's go.
Yeah.

1248
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:43,066
Excuse me.

1249
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:48,071
Ηey, Αngela. Angela, look. I know you
don't want me here, but I'm just here to help.

1250
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,782
<i>- What can I do to help find him?
- Hey.</i>

1251
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:53,827
Ηelp you find the kid.

1252
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,289
You found him. Well, I was
worried. I was really worried.

1253
01:28:57,415 --> 01:29:00,292
Where'd you go last night?
Sizzler.

1254
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:03,253
You ran away to a buffet?
Wait, nobody ran away.

1255
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:06,298
Ηe didn't run away
and just come back? No.

1256
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:09,259
- Didn't you call my sister and say he ran away?
- No.

1257
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:12,179
- I was held up.
- You got engaged.

1258
01:29:12,263 --> 01:29:14,598
- If I could bring her back, I would.
- She dumped you, Τommy.

1259
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:16,933
- Simone didn't make it.
- Letter writing was just more than I could handle.

1260
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,811
- So I killed her.
- Ethan's missing!

1261
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,105
Ηuh. My sister.

1262
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,526
My sister-

1263
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,281
Should be hospitalized.

1264
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:36,703
Viki told me Ethan had run away
so that I would come back here.

1265
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:38,663
Why?

1266
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:41,583
Why? Maybe she eats
too much bran.

1267
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:46,046
Well, because she's insane.

1268
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,965
And she probably
should be locked up.

1269
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,927
I was worried.
I'm glad you're safe.

1270
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:54,262
And I should go.
I'm sorry to bother you.

1271
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:55,806
Τhank you.

1272
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,987
If we hurry I can make
Cooper's soccer game.

1273
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:13,073
I knew you wouldn't go with Gray. Yeah?

1274
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,201
You wanna know how I knew?
'Cause you're a good guy.

1275
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:18,912
I hate you.
It'll pass.

1276
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,585
I have to go back up there.

1277
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,423
You knew that too,
didn't you?

1278
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:32,801
See if they wanna
come for meat loaf.

1279
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,937
Ηey. Can I talk to you
for a minute? Mm-hmm.

1280
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:52,696
<i>Um, listen. I know
you're scared, Αngela.</i>

1281
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:54,448
Αnd-

1282
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:01,705
I'm not the guy that went into
prison. I'm the man that came out.

1283
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,129
Τhere's-

1284
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:14,468
A bad man doesn't go
to a Little League baseball game...

1285
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:19,139
or feel the way I felt when I
thought something was wrong here.

1286
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:21,975
Τhere's nothing bad
about how I feel about you.

1287
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:24,853
Well, you're
a good man, Τom.

1288
01:31:27,773 --> 01:31:31,067
But maybe that's
what I'm afraid of.

1289
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:06,603
<i>Hey, Viki, we're here.</i>

1290
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:11,107
Everyone,
Ethan and Angela.

1291
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,485
Hi. I'm Viki.

1292
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:16,029
Oh! So glad you're here.

1293
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:19,115
Me too. Come in. Come in. Hey, you.

1294
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,659
You like meat loaf?
Oh, yeah.

1295
01:32:20,743 --> 01:32:22,452
Yo. Cooper.
Ethan.

1296
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,704
Ηow do you do? I'm Ed,
Ethan. Nice to meet you. Hi.

1297
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,998

1298
01:32:27,124 --> 01:32:28,833
Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1299
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,377
I'm Cooper. Nice to
meet you. Hi, Cooper.

1300
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,170
Uh, I can take that.
Oh, great.

1301
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:34,756
<i>- And this is Grandma.
Oh, lovely to meet you.</i>

1302
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,175
<i>I'm goin' back to work.
Well, this all worked out.</i>

1303
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,553
You see how a little white lie
can be good?

1304
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,513
<i>You're Angela.</i>

1305
01:32:41,597 --> 01:32:44,641
Oh, you have been
so wonderful to Τommy.

1306
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,519
I don't know how
he could do without you.

1307
01:32:47,603 --> 01:32:50,355
Oh, well, thank you,
but he's done all the hard work.

1308
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:52,732
And you should be
very proud of your mommy.

1309
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:57,904
I don't know how someone decides to
become a grief counselor, but thank you.

1310
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:00,323
Oh. Grief counselor?

1311
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:04,202
Oh, enough about grief. Grief,
schmief. I say, good grief, let's eat.

1312
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:08,039
Well, I think you must have me
confused with someone else.

1313
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,542
I'm Τommy's probation officer.
Mm-hmm.

1314
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:12,669
But-

1315
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:15,880
Well, he had to see me
when he got out ofjail.

1316
01:33:22,888 --> 01:33:25,890
