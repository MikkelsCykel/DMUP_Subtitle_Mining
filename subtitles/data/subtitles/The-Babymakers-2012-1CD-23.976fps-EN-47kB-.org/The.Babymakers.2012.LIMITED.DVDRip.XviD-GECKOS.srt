T ommy, the baby.

Hm?

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,574
It's your turn.

Don't do that.

00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,106
The second we walked
in here, I could feel
my wallet start whining.

28
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,013
If we're gonna get
the steak, you wanna
get the Oregon Pinot?

29
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:01,178
Yeah, I saw that.
It's 200 bucks though.

30
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,222
Babe, it's
our anniversary.

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,020
Have you had a chance
to decide on some wine
this evening?

32
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,685
You have no
Iive entertainment.

33
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,786
You are correct, sir.

34
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,957
And I have no money.
An idea, and you
can say no.

35
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,527
Is it possible
for me to dance off
a portion of our tab?

36
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,971
Dance it away?

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,235
It would be
unusual.

38
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,469
Look how cute he is.

39
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,909
Has this worked before?

40
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,537
Not that I can
remember.

41
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,241
Are you sure?
Because he's
very good.

42
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,543
Really?

43
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,983
No.

44
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,383
You're an idiot.

45
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,251
I'm an idiot?
You married me.

46
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,482
So?

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,152
Three years!

48
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,490
I know.
Three years.

49
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,427
Well?

50
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,831
[clears throat]
I knew you were
gonna bring this up.

51
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,233
So, you remembered?

52
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,601
Absolutely,
I remember.

53
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,003
So, you're ready?

54
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,007
Yeah, I'm totally ready.

55
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,940
You're ready
to be a dad?

56
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,572
A dad? What?
I thought we were
talking about anal.

57
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,617
Is the three year
not the anal anniversary?

58
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,676
No. It is. Okay.

59
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,689
Okay, if you really want to,
I'm willing to give it
a try.

60
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,749
Seriously?

61
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,351
Yes. We need to stop
by the sex shop on
the way home.

62
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,956
I need to get a strap-on.
Do you prefer regular
or ribbed?

63
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,695
You are good.
You had me there.

64
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,361
Seriously, I'II
give it a try.

65
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,428
I just don't know
if it will fit.

66
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:31,637
Of course it won't fit.
That's the fun. Pain.

67
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,613
We could do that,
or we could just
have a baby.

68
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,947
Ah, you did remember.

69
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,383
I did.

70
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,216
You really wanna
have a baby?

71
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,778
Yeah, I really do.

72
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,118
We're gonna have
a family.

73
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,681
We are gonna have
a family.

74
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,454
You can teach him
how to play baseball.

75
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,790
And how to pick up chicks.

76
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,056
What if it's a girl?

77
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,563
I Iove girl on girl.

78
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,499
Get it out.
Just get it
all out.

79
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,163
Um, so Audrey,
when do you wanna
get started?

What?
What's wrong?

88
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,707
What?

89
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,872
Nothing.
Nothing.

90
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,712
Are you bored?

91
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,117
Are you tired
of having sex with me?
Are you disgusted?

92
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:51,179
Can you get
out of me, please?

93
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,747
Ouch.

94
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,225
Why isn't this
working, Tommy?

95
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,957
Something's wrong.

96
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,693
Maybe it's 'cause
you don't really
wanna have a baby.

97
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,065
How can you say that?

98
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,230
I've been working my ass off
for nine months trying
to get you pregnant.

99
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,037
So it's a job?
I'm sorry, how much,
how much do I owe you?

100
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,043
Is it 40,
50 bucks?

101
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,808
Wow. 50 bucks?
That's it?

102
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,874
You know, you could
possibly get a back
alley H-J for that,

103
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,976
but not this, sister.

104
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,715
I'm sorry
I Iow balled you.

105
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,882
Well, you did.
That was a serious
Iow ball.

106
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,982
I'm not a crack whore.

107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,654
You're the one who said
having sex with me
was Iike a job.

108
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,253
I never said that.
You said that.

109
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,764
You weren't
thinking it?

110
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,322
No.

111
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,265
It felt Iike it.

112
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,169
It's not what
I was thinking,
because I'II tell you,

113
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,901
sex with you is--
it's beautiful,
you know.

114
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,840
And it's wonderful.

115
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,935
And it's amazing.

116
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,177
Sex with you is Iike--
it's Iike, it's Iike--

117
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,684
(Tommy)
It's like
a full time job.

118
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,845
Maybe you
oughta get tested.

119
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,015
[Iaughing]

120
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,527
T ested? No.
I'm good.

121
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,858
Oh, you're good?
How do you know
you're good?

122
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,593
Excuse me, Wade.
I'm shooting good stuff.
I know this for a fact.

123
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,700
AII right.
I never told
anyone this,

124
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,038
and I swear to God
I'II kill everyone
if you say anything,

125
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,376
but when I decided to ask
Audrey to marry me, I couldn't
afford a decent ring, right?

126
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,972
So I told her
that I joined
a softball team.

127
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,984
You suck
at softball.

128
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,816
I hate softball.
I told her I joined
the softball team.

129
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,984
What I did instead,
I drove back to Pasadena
to a sperm bank. Right?

130
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,790
I donated sperm.
Every week for
20 weeks.

131
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,888
Eighty-five bucks
a pop they paid me.

132
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,456
At the sperm bank,
they don't take
bad sperm.

133
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,729
They test the shit
out of it.

134
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,998
Hey, dude,
85 bucks a pop?

135
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,040
If someone were
to rob that place

136
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,974
and sell the sperm
on the street, they
can make a fortune.

137
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,671
Jesus, Zig Zag.
Have you been
downtown Iately?

138
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,011
There's enough sperm
on the street to choke
Doogie Howser.

139
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,142
Hey, bring out
the pictures, man.

140
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,482
You brought the pictures
of the ex, right?

141
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,751
The pictures of Tanya?
Bring 'em out. I've seen
that shit.

142
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,587
She's my girlfriend now.

143
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,853
She's aware
you're showing
these pictures?

144
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,657
Yeah, probably.

145
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,358
Holy shit, dude.
Look at those nipples.

146
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,426
No offense, but I can tell
how T ommy might be able
to pull this girl.

147
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,027
But with Wade?

148
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,868
Did you say
"no offense"?

149
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,999
Is she
a chubby chaser?

150
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,009
That's more offense.
You keep offending.

151
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,341
I'm sorry,
but okay, offense.

152
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,847
Just tell us how
you got this chick.

153
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,511
You see, T ommy and I
are cut from the same
cloth, my friend.

154
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,181
Good cock,
bad cock.
Come on.

155
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,688
Honey, is he even
ejaculating properly?

156
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:47,392
Because I read on the Internet
that guys are faking it.
It's Iike a trend.

157
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,900
Mine does
not fake it.

158
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,560
Nobody Iikes
a gloater.

159
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,036
How do guys
fake it?

160
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,131
They keep a bike bottle
in the bed and then they
squirt it over your back.

161
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,073
I saw it
on YouTube.

162
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,544
Tommy is not faking it,
but something's wrong.

163
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,137
I'm kinda worried.

164
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,240
Are you using your
fertility calendar?

165
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,875
Yeah, I have
an app for that.

166
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,817
I Iove apps.

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,979
You know, 90% of the time,
it's the guy's fault.

168
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,149
It's definitely T ommy.
You need to get that
junk checked.

169
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,888
Hey, listen, guys,
can we keep this
between us?

170
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,829
T ommy's a Iittle
sensitive about all
this stuff.

171
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,229
I won't say anything.

172
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,493
Who am I
gonna tell?

173
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,336
Hey, Coach Stubbs.
How're you doing?

174
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,235
Tommy Macklin.
How the hell are you?

175
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,671
Not too bad.

176
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,435
How's that pretty
wife of yours?

177
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,341
Good, good.
How's the team
this year?

178
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,846
Honestly? We suck
about nine different
kinds of ass.

179
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,610
We're pulling
for you either way.

180
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,015
Thanks. We're pulling
for you, too.

181
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,681
For who? For me?

182
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,351
Well, I understand you have
a Iittle trouble knocking
up the Mrs.

183
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,793
You know what
works really well?
Hot peppers.

184
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,956
Eat as many
of 'em as you can.

185
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,195
Just make sure you
don't go munching on
her biscuit right away.

186
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,963
You'II kill
the poor woman.

187
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,698
[Iaughs]

188
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,706
You gotta keep
the sperm cool, yah?

189
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,208
You can't Iet the balls
get overheated.

190
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,370
That's why they hang
on the outside.

191
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,538
Like an air cooled
Volkswagen engine.

192
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,276
(man)
Shiitake mushroom,
ginger root, cucumber.

193
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,615
You mash it all up.
You allow it to boil
for three long hours,

194
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,985
and you gently Iower your
ball sack down in there,

195
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,717
and Iet them steep
for ten minutes.

196
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,725
BIue Mountain, Jamaican
remedy that.

197
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,727
What the hell are you
doing to me, Audrey?

198
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,730
Did you go and tell
the whole world?

199
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,562
No, I told three people.
I told Mona, Greta,
and Karen.

200
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,125
You didn't
tell three people.
You told three women.

201
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,400
What's that
supposed to mean?
Where's the ginger root?

202
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,169
Why do you think
there are no female
serial killers?

203
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:42,078
Because after they kill
the first guy, they gotta
go tell somebody.

204
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,013
That's actually
a good point.

205
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,643
[telephone ringing]

206
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,589
Hello?

207
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,420
Oh, hi there.

208
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,858
Uh, yeah.

209
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,920
Mm, well, I hadn't
heard that.

210
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,158
No. No, thank you.

211
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:03,201
Yeah.

212
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,261
I Iove you, too. Okay.

213
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,431
Who was that?

214
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,770
That was your mom.

215
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,935
She said I should try putting
Ben Gay on my scrotum to heat
up the sperm.

216
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,105
She just--
Do you think
that would work?

217
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,875
No.

218
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,611
Why does everybody
have advice for me?

219
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,119
Maybe, maybe
it's you.

220
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,284
Where are all the calls
of everybody telling you
to pour hot sauce

221
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,020
on your...vagina?

222
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:32,963
Okay. I made us appointments
with Dr. Vickerey to get us
both checked out.

223
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,899
He 's supposed to be
the best, so you gotta
get your sperm checked.

224
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,232
Honey, there's nothing
wrong with my sperm.

225
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,033
Really?
How do you
know that?

226
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,903
'Cause there's
a party down there!

227
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,374
Do you hear that?
[beating]

228
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,139
Seriously, this thing
smells Iike shit.

229
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,043
Can you
Iower 'em in?

230
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,308
I think you
just do one
at a time.

231
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,819
How am I gonna do
one at a time?

232
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,478
I don't have them.
I don't know.

233
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,391
(Tommy)
I'm telling you,
it is a waste of time.

234
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,155
Just do it.
Prove her wrong.

235
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,094
Show her you got
awesome sperms.

236
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,598
Dude, Audrey's
making you check
your sperm?

237
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,430
T ell her I said
to Iighten up.

238
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,231
[laughing]

239
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,567
No, I just have
trouble in groups.

240
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,005
It's hard to keep it going
when there's a bunch
of other people around.

241
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,735
You've never been
to an orgy?

242
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,074
No. Have you?

243
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:24,742
Nah. But I had sex
with two different chicks
in the same week. Bifecta!

244
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,910
I went to an orgy once.

245
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,285
Not with Audrey.
[Iaughs]

246
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,918
There's just gonna be a bunch
of other guys jerking off
in all the other rooms.

247
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,757
I don't feel Iike it.

248
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,694
But didn't
you do that
for a Iiving?

249
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,925
No, not for a Iiving.

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,831
But you got
paid to do it.

251
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,130
Okay, fine, but I knew
the guy who owned
the place,

252
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,263
and he Iet me come in
after hours when
it was empty.

253
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,534
Dude, get this.
My brother's a lawyer.

254
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,475
He represented this pervert
that works at one
of those clinics.

255
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,207
Sick bastard
hid cameras in
the smoke detectors.

256
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,977
Cops raided his house.
Found stacks of DVD's

257
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,883
of guys choking
their cobras.
[hisses]

258
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,887
[Iaughs]
What?

259
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,947
Wade, Iet's go.

260
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,617
Cool. Let's get
a hot dog.

261
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,322
I'II catch you guys
in a few. I'II follow.

262
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,456
Why do we hang out
with that douche bag?

263
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,898
Doesn't it bother you
that he used to go out
with Audrey?

264
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,835
I used to go out
with Tanya and you
still hang out with me.

265
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,702
Yeah, but at Ieast
you don't Iook Iike
a blond squirrel.

266
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,240
I do not.

267
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,575
You know what?

268
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,478
Don't worry about
this jerking off thing.
You're gonna be fine.

269
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,540
I have a Iittle
inspiration for you.

270
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,520
For old time's sake.

271
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,923
Oh, no, no.
I can't.

272
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,994
Yes, you can.

273
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,859
That's not right.

274
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,922
But those nipples
are world fucking class.

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,367
They are. They're Iike
Iittle tits on top
of big tits.

276
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,530
No, take them.
I can't.

277
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,098
Okay. Sure?
You're too good.
You're too good.

278
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,701
And by that I mean
you're an unbelievable
pussy.

279
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,941
Maybe so.
Maybe so.

280
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,351
Well.

281
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,116
Excuse me.
I go whack my ding-dong
into a plastic dish

282
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,522
with a bunch
of dudes all
around.

283
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,617
Okay. Don't do it
while you're driving.

284
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,787
# I just need #

285
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:22,459
# Your love injection #

286
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:28,804
# I don't need
Your affection ##

287
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,138
Dr. Vickerey
is the best
in the business.

288
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,973
If he can't
impregnate your
wife, no one can.

289
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,570
You'II be
in room four today.

290
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,445
Pedro!

291
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,883
[foreign accent]
Sorry. I-I am sorry.
I was, uh,

292
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,047
just making
a phone call.

293
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,250
I'm sorry, Mr. Macklin.

294
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,883
(Pedro)
I wasn't
jerking off.

295
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,395
As you can see, we have
several different forms
of stimulation,

296
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,262
both homo
and hetero.

297
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,562
I'II take hetero.

298
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,568
Well, you have
20 minutes.

299
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,608
Relax and take
your time.

300
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,668
Hey, doctor,
where is the Iubrication?

301
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,180
Oh, no, we can't run
a risk of contamination.
You will just have to dry.

302
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,274
And you can't use
saliva either.

303
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,683
The human mouth
is quite filthy.

304
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,311
Okay.

305
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,515
I'II just be right
here if you need me.

306
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,990
Okay.

307
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,961
Right where?
Like right there?

308
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,123
Oh, well, I can
go away for a few

309
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,429
No, it's, it's--

310
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,479
Damn, it's hot.

311
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,216
Yeah. Let's
take a break.

Gal, as pretty
as you are, we 're
still missing one thing.

316
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,148
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

317
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,848
You gotta meet
my friend, Big Jim.

318
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,517
Ooh. I sure hope
he 's handsome.

Nice to meet you, Jim.

322
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,422
You are big.

Mr. Macklin,
could you please
turn that down a bit?

327
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,940
It's a touch loud.

328
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,450
[horse neighs]

329
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,952
(Tommy)
I have to go home.

330
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,788
Babe, all you had
to do was jerk off
into a cup.

331
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,884
What's the big deal?
I mean, seriously.

332
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,988
H ow many times have you
masturbated in your Iife?
A hundred?

333
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,896
Uh, sure.
About 1 00, yeah.

334
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,958
I called and they said
you can do it at home.

335
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,799
You have to get
the sample there
within 30 minutes.

336
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,466
I've timed the drive
and it's 18 minutes,
so don't waste time.

337
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,772
I'm teaching
a class at 4:00,

338
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:22,244
so you have the whole
place to yourself to do
your Iittle jerky business.

339
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,808
Sort of takes the fun
out of it when you tell
me I have to do it.

340
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,319
I prefer sneaking around
when you're not here

341
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,015
and pretending
I don't do it.

342
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,250
Yeah, okay.

343
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,332
Hi. What's your name?

344
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,001
[foreign accent]
Roberto.

345
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,170
Could you help me
with my lotion?

346
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,908
My boyfriend usually
does it but we just
broke up.

347
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,959
Thanks.

348
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,928
Si, senora.

Shit, shit.

354
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,319
Hi, there.
How are you
on this blessed day?

355
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,221
Hi. Good.

356
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,556
Great. If you have
a moment, we'd Iike
to tell you

357
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,959
about our personal
savior, Jesus Christ.

358
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,626
You know, I don't know
if right now is the best
time to talk about Jesus.

359
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,137
It's not a good time
to talk about Jesus?

360
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,164
God's only son died
for his sins but it's
"not a good time. "

361
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,507
Well, I guess some people
just think they're more
important than Jesus.

362
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,070
I don't think I'm more
important than Jesus.

363
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,650
But unless he can
miracle a baby up
into my wife's vagina,

364
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,412
then I gotta take a pass.

365
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,250
Thank you
though so much.
Okay, bye.

366
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,753

Tommy? You're home?

369
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,121
Hi.

370
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,958
What's going on?

371
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,624
Oh, you kinda caught me
doing something naughty.

372
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,200
Really?

373
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,133
My college roommate,
Jenny, is here.

374
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,228
And we've been talking
about old times,

375
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,967
and Iaughing
about how we used
to share everything.

376
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,633
Say hi, Jenny.

377
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,233
Hi.

378
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,744
Hi.

379
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,872
Anyway, since
we share everything,

380
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:13,247
Jenny was wondering
if we could share you.

381
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,582
Oh, okay.

382
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,212
He said yes.

383
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,559
Go ahead, Tommy.

384
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,929
Really?

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,332
Thanks, Audrey.

from behind.

387
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,666
Oh, cool.

Oh, Jesus!

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,252
Do you have enough
time for me now, Tommy?

392
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,920
Why?

What's up, Tommy?

407
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,791
The pictures, the ones
of Tanya, I Ieft them
on the bathroom sink.

408
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,325
You gotta
go get 'em.

409
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,189
Yeah, dog.
I knew you'd
use 'em.

410
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,024
I used pictures
of cantaloupes.

411
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,291
Did you say
cantaloupes?

412
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,629
I got some
flat tires.

413
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,191
Some flat tires?
Are you high?

414
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,635
You've gotta go
to my house and
get those pictures.

415
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,967
Of the cantaloupes?

416
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,473
The pictures of Tanya!

417
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,600
You said you
didn't use them.

418
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,043
The back door's open.
The pictures are in
the bathroom.

419
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,943
Okay, I got
one more set to do.

420
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,845
Do this now!

421
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,611
AII right.
Chill out.
I'm on the move.

422
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,777
You chill out.

yes to me.

Right. Yeah.
I heard about that.

it's okay.

But it's gonna
be fine

how these things are
gonna work out.

Hey, slow down, asshole!
I got kids!

444

Well, I'd better
get her back.

I'II see you
at Tommy's

Wade, did you get

I couldn't find them.

In the shower.

What's with
the pants?

00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,989
(Audrey)
Hey. How
did it go?

472
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,789
Uh, great.
I had a few
flat tires, but--

473
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,988
A few flat tires?

474
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,394
Yeah.

475
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,897
Did you get it there
on time?

476
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,796
Of course I got it
there on time.

477
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,665
Thank you for doing
that for me.

478
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,001
I'm happy to.
I'm just glad
that tomorrow

479
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,337
we have proof
that my guys
are good to go.

480
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,343
Me, too.

481
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,175
Can I put
my penis in your
vagina right now?

482
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,407
Yes.

483
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm feeling
really potent.

484
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,414
-Oh, are you?
-Yes, I am.

485
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,751
I'm afraid your
sperm count is too
Iow to conceive.

486
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,356
But that is
impossible.

487
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,987
I know some men
find it difficult
to hear that but--

488
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,691
Hold on.
How can we tell
that it's not--

489
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,756
I've already
examined Audrey.

490
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,598
Her tubes are clear.
Her hormone Ievels
are perfect.

491
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,935
And she has,
in my opinion,

492
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,703
two of the pinkest, plumpest,
and most beautiful ovaries
I have ever seen.

493
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,540
Thank you.

494
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,604
[giggles]

495
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,774
Are you hitting
on my wife?

496
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,545
Is that what he was
doing? It seemed
like it was.

497
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,281
Sorry about him.

498
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,290
Okay, so what exactly
is wrong with my sperm?

499
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,191
This is a slide
of a normal sample.

500
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:14,129
And this
is your sample.

501
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,563
They look drunk.

502
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,397
They do, don't they?

503
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,801
Where are
they going?

504
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:22,465
O-okay, so just
for argument's sake,

505
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,372
Iet's just say you're
right. How did they
get that way?

506
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,536
One possible cause
is testicular trauma.

507
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,978
Have you
ever experienced
anything Iike that?

508

[groans]

510
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,652
No, no.
Not that I
can recall.

511
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:45,753
Oh, well then,
I'm going to order you
a scrotal exploration.

512
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,663
A scrotal what now?
What is that? What?

513
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,168
Sometimes a tear will form
in the tunica albuginea

514
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,673
resulting in extrusion
of the testicular contents.

515
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,439
We simply insert a small
camera into the penis,
through the urethra--

516
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,073
This sounds amazing.
How about this, and I'm
just spitballing here,

517
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,515
why don't we take
my ball sack and
scrape it up

518
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,610
against a cheese grater?
Or maybe go out
to your car

519
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,622
and slam my dick
in the trunk.

520
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,022
Do you feel Iike
that might help?
Or--

521
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,286
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:20,024
I can assure you,
Mr. Macklin, this is
a mostly painless procedure.

523
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,964
Yeah, I'm kinda
getting caught up
on the word "mostly."

524
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,696
It's just--
It's a lot
to take in.

525
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,870
Okay, okay.
So, Iet's say

526
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,203
nothing comes
in this scrotal
exploration.

527
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,777
Then my suggestion
would be that you
find a donor.

528
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,205
But we 're not
there, yet, so.

529
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,477
I think you're right.
We're not there, yet.

530
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,645
We're not even close
to being there, yet.

531
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,315
I think you've
freaked out my
wife, sir.

532
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,950
And we're gonna be--
we're gonna be
Ieaving now.

534
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,953
Too far. Okay.

00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,464
Oh, sorry.

536
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,732
What's up with Audrey
and Tommy? Why aren't
they talking to each other?

537
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,574
It's this whole baby thing.
I think it's time one
of us stepped up.

538
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,739
I think one of us
should offer our
sperm to our buddy.

539
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,806
That's the right
thing to do.

540
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,684
AII right.
As his best friend,
I will toss it in there.

541
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,986

No, seriously,
no offense.

542
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,856
Hey, hey, this isn't
genetic, okay?

543
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,090
It's called Iaziness.
My sperm is thin, fit.

544
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,098
Whatever. We all know
whose sperm he's
gonna choose.

545
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,031
What?

546
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,764
What, 'cause
I'm black?

547
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,501
Ah, 'cause we wouldn't want
Tommy to have a biracial
baby, right?

548
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,840
The kid might grow up
to be the president.
Or Halle Berry.

549
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,380
Okay, fine.
We settle it
this way, okay?

550
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,712
We all jack off
into a cup, right?

551
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,776
And we swirl it around,
and then may the best
man win.

552
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,879
May the best
man win what?

553
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,619
Uh, just--
The World Series?

Awesome party, T om.

556

What if I get drunk
and take all my
clothes off?

557
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,132
It might be
so-mething nice.

558
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,197
That is
good, right?
AII right.

Bye.

Hey, can I
get you a drink?
You have a drink.

562
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,877
Do you need
anything? Food or?

563

Todd and I have
been talking and we
heard about your problem.

568
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:36,495

to offer our services.

is offer you our sperm.

571
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:46,004
What?

572
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,012
Tommy, we 've been blessed
with three smart, beautiful,
healthy children.

573
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,277
Honestly, when T odd first
brought it up, I was
unsure, too.

574
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,617
When Audrey said no
to Todd's proposal
all those years ago,

575
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,122
Seems Iike yesterday.

576
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,181
she gave me
a gift.

577
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,760
And this is my chance
to repay her.

578
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,456
So, what do you say?

579
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,097
What do I say?

580
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,937
Um--

581
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,201
Honey, Iet me.

582
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,981
Dude, I am sorry.
Huge misunderstanding.

583
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,447
We did not mean
to offend.

584
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,177
We were just
trying to be nice.

585
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,719
I just thought
if you're gonna
have a donor,

586
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,119
might as well be
someone you know.
That's all.

587
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,717
Right? That's it!
There's no reason
to be rude.

588
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,660
I'm not asking
to stick it in
Audrey directly.

589
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,790
I mean, unless
you're into that.
Some guys are.

590
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:45,393
I don't know.
I bet Julie would be
fine with it if you are.

591
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:48,233
Or not. Whatever.
Just Iet me know.

people, right, man?

Hi, there.

00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,012
I'm ready for
that drink now.

596
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,016
Okay.

597
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,178
You'd be there to monitor
the whole thing.

598
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,590
You know, honey,
I clipped an article
in recipes and things

599
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:14,597
about how overpopulation
is contributing to a general
decline in male sperm count.

600
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,997
Thanks, Mom.

601
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,936
You know what l
was thinking, sweetie?
Tommy's an only child.

602
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,599
Yeah, that might be
the problem right there.

603
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,370
His whole family
might have bad sperm.

604
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,775
But he 's lucky
he made it.

Hi!

607
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,011
How are you?

608
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,210
Good.

609
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,946
Thanks for getting it.

610
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,116
Oh, yeah, pork
fried rice there.

611
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,957
Wait a second.
I was--Oh, okay, I know
what I was gonna say.

612
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:47,190
Okay, you know
our Iittle problem,

613
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:49,790
our very personal
and private problem?

614
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,461
Well, it has nothing
to do with me.

615
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,301
I don't need to put
hemorrhoid cream on
my ball sack, Wanda.

616
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,567
I don't need
to eat hot peppers.

617
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,372
And I don't need to have
a camera shoved up my
wiener hole, darling.

618

My sperm is
perfectly fine.

I say that it is.

00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,318
Food.

622
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,150
Who can deny
science Iike that?

623
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,952
Okay, you want science?
I'II give you some science.

624
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,894
You know that softball team
I played on? There was no
softball team. Softball.

625
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,661
I drove
to a sperm bank,
and I donated sperm.

626
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,600
I did.
Twenty times.

627
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,230
And each time,
they paid me
cold hard cash.

628
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:32,606
They wouldn't very well
pay me good money
for bad sperm, would they?

629
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,941
See how that works?

630
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,073
Now Iet's eat. God!

631
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,275
You did what?

632
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,749
What?

633
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,615
Tommy, what did
you just say?

634
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,348
I fell in Iove
with a gorgeous woman

635
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:52,520
who deserved
an amazingly
expensive engagement ring

636
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,533
that I couldn't afford.
And at 85 bucks a pop,
honey, it just seemed like--

637
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,696
T ommy, you
have children.

638
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,966
Twenty children
out there.

639
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:03,973
(Clark)
A t least.

640
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,306
Thanks, Dad.

641
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,608
You don't understand.
I gave 20 samples.
That doesn't necessarily--

642
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,639
It doesn't
necessarily mean that--

643
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,447
No, I am sure that
most of that sperm

644
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,954
is sitting right there
in that bank right now.

645
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,014
Tommy, you have children.

646
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,487
Oh, Tommy.

647
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,499
Come on, CIark, you understand
what I was trying to do,
don't you?

648
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,002
You get it, right?

649
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,064
I understand
completely, Tommy.

650
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,237
I understand that you
bought my daughter's
engagement ring

651
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,903
with beat-off money.

652
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,416
Got her a cum diamond.

653
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,688
(man)
Pasadena Andrology and
Cryobank. May I help you?

654
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,593
Hey, how're you doing?
I'm here 'cause I need
some sperm.

655
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,859
Okay. I could set
you up with one of our
sales reps and they--

656
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,265
You know what?
That's not gonna
be necessary.

657
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,428
I actually just need
some of my own sperm.

658
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:10,440
Your own sperm?
I think we can cut out
the middle man here.

659
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,342
No, no. I'm a donor.
I donated some sperm
about five years ago,

660
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,347
and I was hoping
to get that back.
I hope there's some Ieft.

661
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,780
What's your
name, buddy?

662
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,942
Thomas Macklin.

663
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,618
What do you know?
We have one batch Ieft.

664
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,188
Yeah!
That is great.

665
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,696
You know what?
You guys paid me
$85 per batch,

666
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,856
and I feel that
it's only right
for me to--

667
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,900
Oops, I'm sorry.

668
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,300
It Iooks Iike
we already sold it.

669
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,962
[stammers]

670
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,300
My bad.

671
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,465
To-to who?

672
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,802
To whom?

673
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,308
Seriously?

674
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,877
I don't know
if that's right.

675
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,310
You're right.
It's "to whom."

676
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,473
It's whom?
Ah, okay.

677
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:56,213
Anyway, we sold it
to this couple three
weeks ago.

678
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,053
We're performing
the insemination on
dee-dee-dee-dee,

679
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,149
Monday.

680
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,218
Whatever it is
they're paying you,
I'II give you double now.

681
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,663
This isn't eBay, sir.
We don't get into bidding
wars over sperm.

682
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,825
Okay.
You know what?

683
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,495
I don't wanna have
to do this 'cause
I'm not a dick,

684
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,234
but it just so happens that
I'm a good personal friend
of Kevin Baldrey, the manager.

685
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,570
Ooh. You hear
that, Lyle?

686
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,508
Is that right?

687
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,841
He's a personal friend
of Kevin Baldrey.

688
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:25,438
I'd Iike to speak
to him right now.

689
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,417
You and Kev aren't
so close, otherwise you'd
know he doesn't work here.

690
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,853
He got fired for
putting hidden cameras
in the masturbatories.

691
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,187
What? He--

692
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,523
He hid them in the smoke
detectors so he could
videotape guys jerking off,

693
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,459
and he put them
on the Internet.

694
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,259
Are you saying
that, uh--

695
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,926
There's only one
way to find out.

696
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,869
Looks Iike that website's
back up now that Kevy
fled to Amsterdam.

697
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,429
Oh, really?
Check that out.

698
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,634
Yep. There you are.

699
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,768
Macklin.

700
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:57,371
So much for the theory
that Ieft handers are
more intelligent.

701
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,278
Sir, back away
from the desk.

702
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,045
Can I see?

703
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,382
Do you always make
that face when
you climax?

704
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,886
You Iook Iike
a baby burp.

705
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,549
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

706
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,956
[shouts]

707
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,224
Get him out
of here.
Jeez.

708
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,158
[groans]

709
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,828
Say hi to Kev for me.

710
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,670
# Happiness starts
With a smile #

711
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,303
# It's contagious #

712
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,348
# Catch it now ##

713
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,078
How are you doing?
I'm Iooking for a
Mrs. Leslie Jenkins.

714
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,847
I'm Leslie Jenkins.

715
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,513
I'm sorry.
I thought that--

716
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,524
It's alright.
It's a Southern name.

717
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,854
Do I know you?

718
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,588
No, you don't.

719
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,529
I'm Tommy Macklin.
I'm your sperm donor.

720
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,193
Oh. Oh!

721
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,760
Can I sit down
with you and your
wife for a minute?

722
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,398
Honey, come here!
You're gonna Iove this!

723
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,047
Jeffrey, this
is Tommy Macklin.

724
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,343
How're you doing?

725
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:09,546
Tommy Macklin?
Oh. Oh!

726
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,520
Do you have
a Iight beer?

727
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,114
Then we found out
my sperm was no good.

728
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,693
It caused a Iot
of stress in our
relationship

729
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,355
because obviously
we wanna have
a baby naturally.

730
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,625
We don't know anything
about naturally.

731
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,530
Not an option.

732
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,365
Yeah. But I
don't understand.

733
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:28,200
Between the two
of you guys,

734
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,797
you've got twice
as much sperm
as most couples.

735
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:34,969
Twice as much? More like
ten times as much with the
human fire hose here.

736
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,243
I've Iearned to take
my contacts out, if you
know what I mean.

737
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,376
It's Iike stepping on
a full tube of toothpaste
with you.

738
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,821
That's wild.
So, why don't you just use
some of Jeffrey's sperm?

739
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,154
[laughing]
No, no, no. No.

740
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:51,092
My family has
more alcoholics
than Celebrity Rehab.

741
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,323
PIus he's OCD and ADD.

742
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:56,832
Mildly. Anyway, we wouldn't
pass my DNA on to our worst
enemy's baby,

743
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,492
much Iess our own.

744
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:01,504
Okay. So then what
about yours, Leslie?

745
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:06,235
That was plan A.
But as it turns out, my sperm
is--what's the word they used?

746
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,073
Confused.

747
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,737
My sperm is
confused, too.

748
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,406
I cannot
believe that.

749
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,450
We saw the pictures.
It was crazy.

750
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,281
You know what?
I am confident we
can work something out.

751
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,118
I'm happy
to reimburse you
for any expenses,

752
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,751
and for the cost
of finding a
new donor.

753
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,853
Well, that's very
sweet, Tommy, but
to be honest

754
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:28,431
we're quite happy
with the donor we chose.

755
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:33,095
See, Leslie has a hang up
about having a baby that
Iooks Iike him. Shallow.

756
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,933
Guilty as charged.

757
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,870
When we found out
he couldn't produce,

758
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:39,636
we started Iooking
for a donor with
similar features.

759
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,476
And in the end we,
well, we landed on you.

760
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,380
What about $2,000?
That seems fair.

761
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,816
I just really need
that sperm back.

762
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,787
[exhales]
T ommy, I'm
really sorry,

763
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:56,316
but to find the right donor,
I don't think we could go
through that process again.

764
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,124
We've never had
more arguments.

765
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,891
I thought we were
gonna break up.

766
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,126
We almost did.
But we didn't,
did we?

767
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,896
No. Tommy, if there's
one thing I know,
it's this.

768
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,904
Love will find a way.

769
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,667
It worked for us
and it will work for you.

770
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,733
In fact, Leslie, why
don't you show T ommy
some of the runners up?

771
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,302
There's some guys
in there that Iook
a Iittle Iike you.

772
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,814
You could tell your wife
you got your sperm back.

773
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:22,683
Maybe slip a Iittle
something to the doctor.
She'd never know, so.

774
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,654
Anyway, I've gotta get
jogging before nightfall.

775
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,350
PIeasure meeting you.

776
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,017
Best of Iuck.

777
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,084
I'II get
the folder for you.

778
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,497
I can get you
your sperm back.

779
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,269
Uh, but I thought
we just said that--

780
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,844
Come inside.

781
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,211
Goddammit, Tommy. I feel
horrible about this.
I really do.

782
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,182
Jeffrey said---

783
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,684
Forget Jeffrey.
I wear the pants
in this relationship.

784
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,618
And I would Iike
to see you have
your family.

785
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,689
Really?

786
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,385
Yes. I'm sure
we can reach some kind
of mutual agreement.

787
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,520
It's simple, isn't it?
You want your sperm back,
and I want you.

788
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,621
Jeffrey always says
I'm a narcissist.

789
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,563
That's probably why
I'm so attracted to you.

790
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,567
It'd be Iike having
sex with myself.

791
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,535
Having sex?

792
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,072
I want to be
inside you, Tommy.

793
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,732
What?

794
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,300
I want to enter you.

795
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,312
Are you-are you
not getting this?

796
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,813
I--

797
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,906
Have you ever had
anal sex, Tommy?

798
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,975
I can't say
that I have.

799
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,486
It's Iike getting
your prostate checked.
Have you done that?

800
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,079
I haven't.

801
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,988
You should. Detection
equals prevention.

802
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,423
Okay, okay.

803
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,826
Come on, Tom.
We're guys here.

804
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:42,421
Let's do this.
Don't be so homophobic.

805
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,263
I'm not homophobic.

806
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,166
You're afraid to have sex
with another man.

807
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,830
It doesn't get more
homophobic than that.

808
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,998
I don't think you're
using that word right.

809
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,441
AII right.
I'II tell you
what I'II do.

810
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,911
You enter me.

811
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,107
What the hell?
I'm feeling generous.

812
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,414
It's my final offer, Tom.
What do you say?

813
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,852
[lawn mower
engine running]

814
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,187
I say fuck him.
It's just a hole.
Stick it in.

815
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,260
Can we be
serious, please?

816
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,262
Or Iet him fuck you.
Who gives a shit?
Fuck or be fucked.

817
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,094
CIose your eyes,
stick it in, and
think of baseball.

818
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,031
That'II make it
Iast longer.

819
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,534
What do you got to Iose?

820
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,003
I can think
of a few things, Wade!

821
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,199
Shit, I would do it.
But everybody knows

822
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:25,775
that gay guys
don't Iike fat people.

823
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:29,142
They're "fatophobic."
"PIumpophobic."

824
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,944
"PIumpophobia" or whatever.
Have you ever seen a
gay fat guy before?

825
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,952
No, they don't exist.
They're Iike unicorns.

826
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,614
Have you ever seen
a fat unicorn before?

827
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,883
Me either.

828
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,720
Help me!

829
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,191
When they said
you couldn't have
your sperm back,

830
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,820
they robbed you
of your future.
Right?

831
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,491
And you have every
right to steal it back.

832
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,899
Are you talking
about robbing
a sperm bank?

833
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,731
"A" double right,
you bet I am.

834
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,396
No, that's crazy.

835
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,564
Crazy?
Or brilliant?

836
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:58,005
Crazy.

837
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,474
Brilliantly crazy.

838
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,170
No, just crazy.

839
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,009
And brilliant.
Don't think
about yourself.

840
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,742
Think about your
unborn child.

841
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,476
If you don't do
something soon,

842
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,416
the Iast good seed
you have on Earth

843
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,818
is gonna be implanted
deep inside some surrogate.

844
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,484
And good Iuck
getting it back then.
Fuck or be fucked, Tommy.

845
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,357
Fuck or be
fucked, Tommy.

846
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,592
No, wait a second.
How are we gonna rob
a sperm bank?

847
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,428
I've been thinking
about this.

848
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,263
I know just the guy
who can help us.

849
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,361
Walk with me.

850
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,013
How do you know
this guy again?

851
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,576
How do we
know this guy?

852
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,884
Shut up, Zig Zag.
Keep your mouth shut.

853
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,221
This whole thing
was my idea in
the first place.

854
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,057
What?
Your idea?

855
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,963
You think you can come up
with a crazily brilliant
idea Iike this?

856
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:59,560
Okay. The guys
in the meat department
introduce me to him.

857
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,298
Apparently he's
the real deal.

858
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,862
Former bag man
for the Indian mafia.

859
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,874
What does
that mean?

860
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:07,536
That's racist.
They Iike to be called
Native-Americans.

861
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:10,409
No, he's Indian.
Dot head Indian,
not feather Indian.

862
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,812
That's even
more racist.

863
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,076
You're a racist.

864
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,881
Bag man means you fuck
with him, you end up
with a bag on your hip.

865
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:19,980
- Bag on your hip? What
the fuck does that mean?
- You shit in a bag.

866
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:25,323
And then they tell me
that they can't even
sell me back my own sperm.

867
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,727
And then they kick me out.

868
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,663
Yeah, and they pepper
sprayed me in the face.

869
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,998
Pushed me into the bushes.
I have prickers everywhere.

870
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,163
I mean, if I don't
get my sperm back, man,

871
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,433
my marriage is over.

872
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,773
You know, these bastards
are assholes,

873
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,005
and they're stealing
my future,

874
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:47,914
and they're taking away
my constitutional right
to do whatever I want

875
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,418
with my own sperm.

876
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:50,783
You know?

877
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,118
Do you see
what I'm saying?

878
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,249
Yes, I do.

879
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,919
You're saying you bought
your wife's engagement ring

880
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,360
with beat-off money.

881
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,760
[Iaughs]

882
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,595
Classic, right?
[Iaughs]

883
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,295
I Iike you.

884
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,201
You're a married man.

885
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,603
I always want
to be a married man.

886
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,471
But I never found Iove.

887
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,636
What can you do?

888
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,940
I will help you.

889
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,207
Hey, all right.

890
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,440
Thank you, Ron Jon.
See?

891
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,948
Wow, thanks, man.

892
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,314
Cost is 5000.

893
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,945
5000? I really had
no idea.

894
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,148
Could you excuse us.
Give us a sec.

895
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,989
What are you doing?
You're blowing the deal.

896
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,051
$5000 to rob
a sperm bank?

897
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,390
How much do you
think it costs?

898
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,125
-I don't know.
-Exactly.

899
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,463
Are you gonna
put a price tag
on your family?

900
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,195
Shit.

901
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,396
You must have
a rich uncle
around somewhere.

902
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,837
I've got $1 1,000 saved up
in the house fund.

903
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,240
I could possibly borrow
five and pay it back
before Audrey found out.

904
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,244
Now you're talking sense.

905
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:50,677
This is it.

906
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,010
Now be cool.

907
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,516
So, we were
just chatting.

908
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,180
And we feel Iike,
yeah, sure,
yeah, good.

909
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,587
What about $3000?

910
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,592
Mr. Macklin,
make no mistake.

911
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,992
We are committing
a felony here.

912
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:10,659
There is grave
risk involved.
Do you understand me?

913
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,532
Yeah, 5000 then.
5000 seems good.

914
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,730
Very nice!

915
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,601
Very, very, very nice!

916
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,767
-Thank you for your time.
-Looks Iike we have a deal.

917
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,437
Dude, were you seriously
in the Indian mafia?

918
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,951
What the fuck, man?

919
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,579
I never said anything.

920
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,556
Everybody has to know
every fucking thing.

921
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,593
Okay, fine.

922
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,388
Okay, Mr. Nosy.

923
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,056
If you must know,
back in Mumbai,

924
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,895
I was the best
second story man
in the business.

925
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,400
What business?

shit business, okay?

-Okay.
-What is your name?

Zig Zag.

What is so funny, Zig Zag?

930
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,271
I was just
kinda Iaughing

931
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:02,648
at what the whole ""Indian"
organized crime thing
was all about.

932
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,415
What? You don't think
Indian crime can be
organized?

933
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,286
Indians are
very organized.

934
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,054
No, I'm sure. I just had
this, Iike, idea in my head

935
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,256
about all these Indian mob
dudes, sitting around,

Iike being all non-violent
with each other.

'Cause you think about,
Iike, Gandhi, right?

You think Indians
can only drive a cab
and fix your computer?

942
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,775
Well, Iet me
tell you something.

943
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,578
I did drive a cab!
And I can fix
your computer,

Yeah, I feel Iike

Yeah, I was just
pretty baked.

Cool off, man, okay?
Cool off.

00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,561
That much,

[Mona]
So you just must be
totally pissed.

965
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,580
Yeah, I was
furious at first.

I mean, he's got
kids out there.

967
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,021
But then I thought,
why not just go
down there

968
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,084
and see if they have
any of his good sperm
Ieft for us to use.

And?

970
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,227
It was five years ago.

971
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:58,096
They told him they'd Iook,
but it didn't Iook good.

If you keep
drowning James,
I swear to God,

974
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,541
I gonna come over there
and drown you right back!

Oh, AIIison,
she's so adorable.

What's her name?

981
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,721
Well, we wanted
to name her
something Chinese,

982
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,563
but also, you know,
American, so we
went with Jackie Chan.

Yeah, she's really quiet.
She never cries.

988
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,046
Yeah, I've heard that
about those babies.

989
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:48,914
Why does everybody
know so much
about Asian babies?

990
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,453
Did I miss a class
or something?

991
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,317
They're just Iike
American babies.

Only better.

993

I heard
they're also
really musical.

994
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,086
You should totally
get her a piano,
Iike, right now.

Well, I already
got her a violin.

She doesn't even
have fingers yet.

997
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,164
So, just out of curiosity,

998
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,995
how much did it cost
to adopt her?

999
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,899
About $10,000
when you add it all up.

1000
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:09,597
Did you want
to hold her?

a complete stakeout

-Awesome.

to prison for Iife.

you must shoot me.

shoot you, Mr. Jon.

This is
the sperm bank.

00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:04,718
This is the barber shop
right next door.

Just, sorry,

but wouldn't it
make more sense

00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,393
if we made the comb
the barber shop

if Zig Zag's beer
was the Iiqour store...

was something else?

will arrive early,

to the employee
rest room.

From the roof
of the liquor store,

I will slide over

through the skylight,

and blast my way
into the sperm bank.

Meanwhile, rest of team
will be outside,

and just pick
the Iock on the door
to the sperm bank?

1075

Yeah, if you just
use the Iock picking kit,

you can pick the Iock

Or even, Iike half Chinese

are ridiculously expensive

Of course you did.

And the Chinese babies
are the easiest ones to get.

you're right.

How does it even work?

it's about $10,000.

1236
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,871
Would you stop
for a second?

1237
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,034
We're gonna have
enough money
for the Chinese baby.

1238
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:57,635
[gasps]

1239
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,478
You can take
your Chinese baby
and shove it up your ass.

1240
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:06,455
They're not mine.

1241
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:09,218
Okay, tell me.
Then whose are they?

1242
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,387
-They're Wade's.
-Okay.

1243
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,227
Aud. Audrey...

1244
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,996
[heels walking away]

1245
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,664
Hey, wait!
Audrey, seriously, stop.

1246
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,143
Hey, Audrey,
You've gotta be
kidding me. PIease, stop.

1247
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:29,803
Stop, please!

1248
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:31,744
-Hold on.
-Do you Iove her, Tommy?

1249
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,805
Of course not.
I Iove you.

1250
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:36,181
Then why were you
jerking off to naked
pictures of her?

1251
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:39,153
I was jerking off
to naked pictures
of cantaloupes.

1252
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:41,247
I saw her
cantaloupes, Tommy.

1253
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,757
And I'm sorry
that my cantaloupes
aren't good enough for you.

1254
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,589
If only you found
me attractive,

1255
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,663
you could have jerked off
to naked pictures of me.

1256
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,595
Audrey, seriously,
they are Wade's pictures.

1257
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,496
Then how the hell
did they end up
in our bathroom?

1258
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,829
Well...

1259
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,233
You know what?

1260
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,929
BIame your friends.
Who cares?

1261
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,097
You're not man enough
to knock me up, anyway.

1262
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,378
I can't believe
you broke up with Tanya.

1263
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:11,886
I got tired of her.

1264
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,252
A man cannot Iive
by nipples alone.

1265
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,961
Hey, Wade,
you asshole!

1266
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:26,228
I told you to get
the pictures out of my...
[groans]

1267
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,229
She found the pictures.

1268
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,774
Oh...

1269
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,466
You know, she's right.

1270
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:37,068
I got one job
to do as a man,

1271
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,977
and I can't even do that.

1272
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,140
It's just
a little crisis
of confidence.

1273
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,582
It happens to everyone.

1274
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,483
Maybe we should
buy him a hooker.

1275
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,317
What's he gonna do
with a hooker?

1276
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:47,912
Oh, that's right.
He can't get it up.

1277
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,823
Zig Zag, I can get
it up, dude.

1278
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,588
He can get it up.
He just can't come.

1279
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,823
I can come!

1280
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:58,298
Yeah, sure. He can come.
But nothing comes out.
Just puffs of air.

1281
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,335
[all Iaugh]

1282
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,233
Would you guys shut up?

1283
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,170
If I Iose Audrey,
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1284
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:05,604
C'mon, don't talk
Iike that.

1285
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,404
She Ioves you
and you Iove her.

1286
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,239
And she knows
that you'II do
anything for her.

1287
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,780
But I haven't done
everything, have I?

1288
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,282
There's only one thing
Ieft I could do
to make this right.

1289
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,341
And I'm gonna do it.

1290
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:17,909
You're gonna have sex
with that gay guy?

1291
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,420
What?

1292
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:22,116
No, I'm gonna go back
to Pasadena,

1293
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,419
and rob that bank.

1294
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:24,516
Yeah, you are!

1295
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,152
Whoa, rob a bank?

1296
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,661
Here's the deal.

1297
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:29,594
On Monday, the Iast
batch of sperm

1298
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,133
that I have Ieft
in the world
will be gone forever.

1299
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,931
But tomorrow night,
before that happens,

1300
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,996
we're gonna go in there,
and steal that shit back.

1301
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,541
We're pulling a bank job,

1302
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,475
a sperm bank job.

1303
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,035
What do you guys say?
Who's with me?

1304
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:46,046
I'm with you, Tomahawk!

1305
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,811
-Zig Zag.
-Aces high!

1306
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,445
Darrell? We could use
some muscle on this job.

1307
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:58,225
Right, well, I'm just
gonna run home real quick

1308
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,353
and just grab
a few things,
a few things...

1309
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,988
for this mission.

1310
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,556
Little criminal stuff
for the mission.

1311
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,898
And then I'II meet you guys
at the designated place,

1312
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,335
at the designated time.

1313
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,064
Okay.

1314
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:18,009
[car starts, squeals out]

1315
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,672
Okay, Darrell's out.

1316
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,343
He said designated spot,
designated time.

1317
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:25,910
Zig Zag, we don't have
a designated spot,
or a designated time.

1318
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:28,490
Oh.

1319
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,991
At Ieast we don't
have to cut him in
on the take, right?

1320
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:31,924
That's good.

1321
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,492
Ron Jon!
It's Wayne.

1322
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,194
Ron Jon!

1323
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,260
How can he hear you
over that stupid TV?

1324
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:47,339
Shut the fuck up!

1325
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,935
[silence]

1326
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,776
-What?
-Hi.

1327
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:02,381
So it's back on,
and we gotta go tonight.

1328
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,085
Come in.

1329
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,853
I can't do tonight,
but Wednesday might work.

1330
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:12,423
PIease, Mr. Jon.
I paid you a Iot
of money to do this job.

1331
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,560
Hey, you canceled
the job, remember?

1332
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,128
Yeah, but you never
gave me back
my money.

1333
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:18,639
Wait.

1334
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:27,139
What is this?
You got my money in here?

1335
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,148
Open it.

1336
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:34,315
What the--what is this?

1337
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,153
What do you mean
what the fuck?

1338
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,158
It's a kidney.
You say your mother
needs a kidney.

1339
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,251
How about a Iittle
"Thank you, Mr. Ron Jon."

1340
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,593
Whose kidney is that?
Whose kidney is that?

1341
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,466
Mr. Jon...

1342
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,967
I don't know
how to tell you this,

1343
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:48,627
but my mother's
perfectly healthy.

1344
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:51,104
I made that shit up
to get my money back.

1345
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,970
I see.

1346
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,737
I feel very sorry.
I feel very strange
about this.

1347
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:57,278
Whose is this?

1348
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,112
What man is out there
with Iess body?

1349
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:04,243
Listen to me,

1350
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,613
PIease.

1351
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,680
I'm desperate, okay?

1352
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,521
PIease help me.

1353

I can't Iose my wife.

1354
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,756
You should have thought
of that before you
Iied to me.

1355
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,923
What if I paid you
a shitload more money?

1356
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,091
5000 dollars.

1357

[Zig Zag mutters]
What do we have here?

We've got $4048, okay?

1367
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,523
So what do you say?
C'mon.

1368
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,760
I'm not sure
if I can trust my team..

1369
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:28,530
Okay, you know what?
Let's sweeten the deal
a Iittle bit.

1370
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:32,199
Okay? What do you
say to that?

1371
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,707
You know my weakness.

1372
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,377
Let's do it!

[sighs heavily]

1374
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:46,680
Let's do it.

1375
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,891
She's your ex-girlfriend?

1376
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,398
Yep.

1377
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,024
[Ron Jon]
And your ex-girlfriend...

1378
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,393
And what
about you, Ziplock?

1379
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,234
I practice abstinence.

1380
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:08,208
Good. I would
not Iike a woman
you have touched.

1381
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:09,710
When do I get her?

1382
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:11,712
You get her. What?

1383
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,873
Do you think she
would Iike me?
Does she Iike beards?

1384
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,318
Oh, shit.
Did you think that--

1385
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:20,217
Tomorrow, noon.
We will drop her off.

1386
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,382
Noon is good for me.

1387
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,085
Noon can work.

1388

01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:51,756
-Hi.

01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,760
You're pretty.

1710
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,661
And how's my Iittle mookie?
How are you doing?

1711
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:59,894
He's beautiful
and wonderful
and farty.

1712
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:01,730
Just Iike his Daddy!

1713
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,601
Daddy's a Iittle farty.
Daddy gets that way, too.

1714
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:06,663
And there's my two
other Iittle munchkins.

1715
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:08,503
How are you kids
doing over there?

1716
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:10,339
Don't we make
beautiful babies together?

1717
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:12,003
I need butt cream.

1718
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,581
Okay, Mama's gonna
go get some butt cream.

1719
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:16,810
Hey, dude. Grab
the triplets.
It's time.

1720
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:19,449
He's gonna go for you.

1721
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,613
-He's ready.
-My Iittle guy.

1722
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,452
Hey, Iittle man!

1723
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:24,786
There's my big guy!

1724
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:25,848
Hi!

1725
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:28,187
AII right, here we go.

1726
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:30,196
I got $12 on Emmett!

1727
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:32,198
Okay, put him down.

1728
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,791
Sammy's my boy.
He's about to clean
some clocks.

1729
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,928
That's him
in the yellow, right?

1730
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:39,700
No, that's Annie
in the yellow.
Is that Audrey's breastmilk?

1731
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,365
Nothing but the best
for these horses.

1732
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:44,206
AII right, now.
It's the 15-yard dash.

1733
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:46,542
The first baby that gets
to the bottle wins.

1734
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:47,614
You in on this action?

1735
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:48,944
Absolutely.

1736
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:50,176
C'mon. These babies are hot.

1737
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,376
Let's go, Iet's go!

1738
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:52,783
What's going on here?

1739
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:54,549
Uh, we're racing
the babies.

1740
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:55,883
Huh.

1741
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,389
-I got fifty on...
-Annie?

1742
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:59,460
Yeah.

1743
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:01,893
Okay, Iet's make
some money.

1744
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:05,557
On your mark, get set,
go babies, go!

1745
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:10,696
