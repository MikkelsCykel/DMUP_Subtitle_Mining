1
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,330
Five minutes,
my little lambs.

2
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,204
Has anyone seen
Bliss Cavendar?

3
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,837
Pash, this can't
be happening.

4
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,205
Why aren't you
backstage, Brooke?

5
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,511
You know how it is.

6
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,745
They get to a certain age,
they don't want you back there.

7
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,715
She said
she'll meet me here.

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,723
Really? That's odd.
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm

9
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,418
It says "temporary."

10
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,089
It did a minute ago,
I swear.

11
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,960
My mom is
gonna kill me.

12
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,636
Now, Miss Amber Black

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,577
If I could have dinner with
anyone, it would have to be God.

14
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,870
Because what they say
is true. God is great.

15
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,117
Don't tell them
that I did it, okay?

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,881
Those are the rules,
you're not allowed to tell.

17
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,393
Let go.
I'm your only friend.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,325
Corbi Booth,
ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,990
If I could have dinner with anyone,
it would have to be my grandfather.

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,594
I love you, Papa.

21
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,664
And now, also from Bodeen,
Miss Bliss Cavendar.

22
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,522
If I could have
dinner with anyone,

23
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,200
it would be
Amelia Earhart,

24
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,035
because not only was she
a pioneer of aviation,

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:26,135
but she was a great woman in history.

26
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,713
Thank you.

27
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,217
So enlighten me What was
that little stunt all about?

28
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,154
Are you trying to
sabotage your chances?

29
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:44,061
Or was it just your biological urge to
make your mother look like a jackass?

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,222
It was just a dare.

31
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,960
Oh How did that
work out for you?

32
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,797
Not so great?

33
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,469
Corbi

34
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,636
Congratulations, honey
Well-deserved.

35
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,502
Thank you.
Thumbs way up.

36
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,411
Thank you,
Mrs. Cavendar.

37
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,648
Bliss is so hard
to beat. Usually.

38
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,483
Well, the Blue Bonnet pageant
is right around the corner.

39
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,022
And we'll be there.
Come on, honey.

40
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,022
Oh See you later
See you.

41
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,861
I'm sorry that
these pageants

42
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,525
don't live up to your high
moral standards, Bliss,

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,059
but there's a lot you
can learn from them,

44
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,070
no matter what you
go on to be in life.

45
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,369
You think you're being
judged up there on that stage,

46
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,410
but no one's asking you
to be Miss America.

47
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,000
I wanna be Miss America.

48
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,172
And you're gonna be the
best one ever, sweetheart.

49
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,373
Teeth.

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,040
Eyes.

51
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:48,191
Trudy, bless your heart
for fitting us in.

52
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,590
Well, hell.
Shit happens.

53
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,430
Let me get my foils.

54
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,799
Now, what were you
thinking, getting blue hair?

55
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,871
Fourteenth
drive in the red zone.

56
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,636
They have now given up
nine touchdowns

57
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,802
and three field goals. We'll
see how this one ends up.

58
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,641
He's only had one take away
in the red zone.

59
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,617
Hey.

60
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,148
I won another one.

61
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,083
Lord, child,
you are unstoppable.

62
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,752
And had I known what you were up
to, I would have bought a ticket.

63
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,793
Earl.

64
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,488
I mean, dang it, girl,
what has gotten into you?

65
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,488
Just defective, I guess.

66
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,098
Nice parenting, Earl

67
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,499
Come on, now

68
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,169
Ooh, I'll see you later

69
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,770
Dinner.

70
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,510
Seriously, out of all the
places to go to in the world,

71
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,021
who would come to Bodeen?

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,955
Them
I mean, they're smart,

73
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,617
at least they just
pass through.

74
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,126
Go ahead
and mock it.

75
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,460
But without the Blue Bonnet
factory, this town wouldn't exist.

76
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,762
You know what, Birdman,

77
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,326
I think I preferred you
before you got promoted.

78
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,163
You know, now
you're all corporate.

79
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,869
I know. I miss the old Birdman. Yeah.

80
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,879
Ladies, don't let the tie
fool you. I'm still one of us.

81
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,783
But y'all are gonna have to
start calling me Dwayne now.

82
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,717
It's more dignified.
No.

83
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,118
Birdman is the only thing
you have going for you.

84
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,318
That's what you think.

85
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,363
Really?

86
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,556
Yeah.

87
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,391
Hey

88
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,900
Make sure they
tip you this time.

89
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,882
Hey, what can I
get you guys?

90
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,515
Hey, Corbi

91
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,821
So what are you, like,
alternative now?

92
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,690
Alternative to what?

93
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:06,027
What's the name of that thing that
if I eat it real fast, it's free?

94
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,432
That's the Squealer You have to
eat it in three minutes or less.

95
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,201
Yeah, you bring me
a Squealer.

96
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,542
And I don't mean Corbi.

97
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,882
Let's go, buddy, pick
it up Come on, come on.

98
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,417
Oh, yes You got it, you got it.

99
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,351
I can't believe you
used to share a bed with her.

100
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,514
Baby, baby,
get it, yeah.

101
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,388
You make it sound very dirty.
It was just sleepovers.

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,451
Come on Come on
Baby, do it. Do it.

103
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,120
Go. Go. Go.
Go. Go. Go.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,027
Come on Come on, Colby! Yeah.

105
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,533
That's my man.
Come on, Colby.

106
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,396
It's free, bitches.
It's free. It's free.

107
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,648
I was thinking

108
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,623
maybe we could go to
Austin and do some shopping.

109
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,083
Really?

110
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,393
Teach
them well and let them lead the way

111
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,626
Show them all the beauty
they possess inside

112
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,835
...them a sense of pride
to make It easier

113
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,146
You hate them.

114
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:33,515
Well, they don't have duct tape
on them That's an improvement.

115
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,148
Hi

116
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,019
Thanks.

117
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,288
Ooh!

118
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,963
Pretty vases.

119
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,960
They're great
for tulips, really.

120
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,270
Um...

121
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,145
Thank you. Yup,
I changed my mind.

122
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,841
No, please, Bliss.
Come on.

123
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,381
Don't...
Don't be embarrassed.

124
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,477
It's funny.

125
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,889
I'm supposed to buy you
shoes from a head shop?

126
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,017
Does that really strike you
as responsible parenting?

127
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,565
Fine 'Cause shoes
are a gateway drug.

128
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,893
For gosh sakes, Bliss.

129
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,734
It goes out
of bounds near the 42 yard line.

130
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,567
There is a flag down.

131
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,868
Yeah, it's Earl.
Hello, Earl

132
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,670
Can you please explain
to your daughter

133
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,145
why it's inappropriate to
buy shoes in a head shop?

134
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,175
Dad, it's not like that

135
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,376
You took your
mother to a head shop?

136
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,509
Are you off your nut?

137
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,986
You know, if she wasn't
here and I used my own money,

138
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,352
it wouldn't make a difference
That's not the point.

139
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:47,825
Look, I am in the middle
of a deal here, okay?

140
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,091
So whatever you all
work out is fine with me.

141
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,221
Give me that
Okay?

142
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,892
Earl, do you know
how hard I have worked

143
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,935
to raise these girls in
a drug-free environment?

144
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,504
Yes, I do.
Exactly.

145
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,847
Hi. Hey, girls. What's up?

146
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,182
Hello. Dropping my flyers off.

147
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,887
Perfect.
Hurl Scouts-Holy Rollers.

148
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,032
See you then
Thanks, girls. Bye.

149
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,480
Come on All right,
let's go. Come on.

150
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,304
Screw you and your
grandma's Chevy Celebrity.

151
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,775
Here.

152
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,912
No, what are you doing?
Yes, yes, yes You got stiffed

153
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,182
on your tips again, just take it. No.

154
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,348
Just take it, take it.
No.

155
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,692
What is this?
What is this?

156
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,366
Roller derby?

157
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,630
This is...
This is tomorrow.

158
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,797
This is in Austin.

159
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,365
Yeah, I know

160
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,878
Will there be
cute boys there?

161
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:53,777
Hey, Mom, Dad, we're gonna
go to a football game.

162
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,982
It's an away game, but...

163
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,388
The team
kind of needs us.

164
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,824
No, no, no, not "kind of," they do.

165
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,021
Well, sure

166
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,527
Hey, I'll tell you what,
I'll take you.

167
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,661
No, it's cool.
You have your car.

168
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,795
Yeah, I have my car.

169
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,034
No, but I mean, you know,
we can watch together.

170
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,201
Earl, let the girls go on
and have their fun.

171
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,506
And then you and I
can nuzzle.

172
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,059
I kind of feel bad
lying to them.

173
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,686
I don't. I give my
parents straight A's.

174
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,254
I get freedom.

175
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:47,404
She's a punk
punk, a punk rocker

176
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:55,380
Punk punk, a punk rocker

177
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:04,552
Well, the kids are all
hopped up and ready to go

178
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,593
They're ready to go now
They've got their surfboards

179
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:11,221
And they're going to
the discotheque a-go-go

180
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,556
But she just couldn't stay

181
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,933
She had to break away

182
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,801
Well, New York City
really has it all

183
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,101
Oh, yeah

184
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,142
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

185
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:30,480
Sheena is a punk rocker

186
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,740
Okay, everybody, and welcome
to skate night at the Warehouse.

187
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,179
I'm a little hung-over
tonight, so I...

188
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,943
Anyway, let me Introduce you
to our first team.

189
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,747
Coming to you from
the streets of Austin,

190
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,688
men, hold on to your
cookies, it's the Hurl Scouts.

191
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,917
Number 99, captain of the
Hurl Scouts, Maggie Mayhem.

192
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,761
Number 69, Bloody Holly.

193
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,699
Number 3, Rosa Sparks

194
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,704
Number 2, Smashley Simpson

195
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,003
Razor Magee's Hurl Scouts have come
in last place three years running.

196
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,872
This league has five teams,
each with their own theme.

197
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,847
What outlaw do we have
skating against the Hurl Scouts

198
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,008
this fine Texas
evening here?

199
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:43,786
I'm talking about the girls so bad
that even God can't keep them in line.

200
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:49,692
Give it up for the
undefeated Holy Rollers.

201
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,294
Last season's champs
are led by their captain,

202
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:56,233
the league's leading
scorer, Iron Maven.

203
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,164
Yeah, she's the one
from the flyer.

204
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,536
I'm feeling hot in these
polyesters right now, baby.

205
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,303
Ladies and gentlemen,

206
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:08,712
let's play some
roller derby.

207
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,416
A jammer scores
a point in this course

208
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,009
by passing members
of the opposite team.

209
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,181
Maven gets a great jump.
That's fast.

210
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,848
And she's out
to an early lead.

211
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,517
Iron Maven,
ladies and gentlemen.

212
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,989
Folks, the ones to watch
tonight are the jammers.

213
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,361
Those are the ones with
the stars on their helmets.

214
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,732
Some of you might remember watching
derby on TV back In the '70s,

215
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,034
but it was reborn right here
in the heart of Texas,

216
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,371
a true Austin tradition.

217
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,206
Maven's heading up on the outside
but It's real crowded in there.

218
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,540
That's a big
hit by Rosa Sparks.

219
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,343
Jackie Daniels Is down.

220
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,907
Lucky for the Hurl Scouts
this is only an exhibition bout

221
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,111
because the Rollers
are in control.

222
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,288
Thank you, Maggie.

223
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,103
I just wanna tell you all
that you're my new heroes.

224
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,803
It's your
first time here?

225
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,370
Yeah.

226
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,272
Well, put some skates on,
be your own hero.

227
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,579
The last time I wore skates,
they had Barbies on them.

228
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,242
Hey, you know, none of us knew our
ass from an elbow pad when we started.

229
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,748
You should come to
tryouts on Tuesday.

230
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,254
You have to be 21.
You're 21, right?

231
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,319
Two... I'm 22.

232
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,994
Yeah, I just had my...
I had my birthday, so...

233
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,256
Great, it's this
Tuesday at 5:00.

234
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,560
It is?
Yeah.

235
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,494
I'm Maggie,
Maggie Mayhem.

236
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,561
I'm Bliss,
but I can change that.

237
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,174
Yeah, you'll have
to change that.

238
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,334
Don't be late.

239
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:49,181
"Twenty-two.
Just had my birthday."

240
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,610
Twenty-one,
it's a red flag.

241
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,446
Twenty-two's way
more believable.

242
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,012
I guess, 'cause you're not actually
gonna do it, so I guess it makes sense.

243
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,080
Why don't
you and I try out?

244
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,625
Excuse me?

245
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,820
I didn't have a
Barbie-roller-skating phase. Okay?

246
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,090
I had a fat-kid-sits-inside-
and-reads-a-book phase.

247
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,324
You know that.

248
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,800
Well, what makes you
think I won't try out?

249
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,461
Because you'd
be scared to go without me.

250
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,976
And those roller derby
girls, they're tough.

251
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,944
And you are not.
Ow!

252
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,105
Geez!
How dare you?

253
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,541
Not to mention
your mom.

254
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,141
She doesn't
have to know.

255
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,219
You don't have
the balls.

256
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,157
I can grow the balls.

257
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,901
No way.

258
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,208
Mmm

259
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,515
Hey.

260
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,184
Do you have room
for one more?

261
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,901
I like your hair.

262
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,804
Thanks, hon.
I do it myself.

263
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,443
All right, next
stop, downtown Austin.

264
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,760
Hey.
Hey.

265
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:56,927
What's your derby name?

266
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,129
Pocket Rocket.

267
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,262
What's yours?

268
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,430
Jaba the Slut.

269
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,343
Hey, you made it.
Oh, yeah.

270
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,172
Yeah, I'm glad
you came.

271
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,438
Thanks.

272
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,654
What is that?

273
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,213
That would be Razor.
He's our coach.

274
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,559
He's a good guy. And he
really knows his derby.

275
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,320
All right, ladies.
Let's roll.

276
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,722
Ooh, jean shorts

277
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,231
Every single day.

278
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,732
Meet the
Manson sisters.

279
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,171
Gift from the Ottawa Women's
Hockey League to the Hurl Scouts.

280
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,506
They both seem
really aggressive.

281
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,672
Maybe we can finally
win a few this year.

282
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:42,907
Maybe.

283
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,485
All right, listen up,
fresh meat.

284
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,749
There's a lot more to derby than
fishnets and picking out a tough name.

285
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,254
This is a sport.

286
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,018
Now, the league
has six spots open.

287
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,060
So whatever shred
of talent you have,

288
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,925
hope you leave it out
on the track for me today.

289
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,698
Okay, what is it?

290
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,858
Sorry

291
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,097
Just what are the rules?

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,438
Derby 101, people.

293
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,771
Four blockers from each team
are lined up on the track.

294
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,172
Ten feet behind them,

295
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,178
two jammers are lined up,
one from each team.

296
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,543
We're the ones
who score.

297
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,583
First whistle blows
and the pack takes off.

298
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,084
Then a second whistle blows
and the jammers take off.

299
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:24,054
Some of us faster
than others.

300
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:26,781
Once the jammer
breaks through the pack,

301
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,350
she hauls ass around the track
a second time and tries to score.

302
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,262
For every player on the
opposing team the jammer passes,

303
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,696
she gets a point.

304
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,463
Most points wins the game
every single time.

305
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,060
Now, line up
and get you some.

306
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,569
Get up

307
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,115
Go, ladies Move it

308
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,242
Up, up, up Go

309
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,752
Looking good, Barbie.

310
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,891
It's roller derby,
not cotillion.

311
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,893
Come on,
put a hit on somebody.

312
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,960
God damn it, Diane

313
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,339
Hey. That move will get
you tossed from a game.

314
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,137
There's no place in
this sport for that.

315
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:20,971
What?

316
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,673
Okay Sorry

317
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,652
But I like the aggression.

318
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,687
Is it bad?

319
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,683
Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm

320
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,693
No. Mmm-mmm.
Mmm-mmm

321
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:41,660
Forty-one, gotta improve
on that 39, 32, not bad

322
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,028
Twenty-nine. Let's go.

323
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,697
Twenty-three?

324
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,777
Looks like you've
got some competition.

325
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,308
Yeah, yeah, wake me when she
learns how to throw a hit.

326
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,558
Or take one.

327
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,579
Hey, you're
Iron Maven.

328
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,550
That's right,
kiss-ass.

329
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,714
Why don't you suck up
a little harder?

330
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:39,723
There's still part of your face
that doesn't have doodie on it.

331
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,989
Nice shorts.
Help.

332
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,421
Can somebody help me? I...

333
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,939
Just kidding.

334
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,237
Hey, by the way, you made
it, you're a Hurl Scout.

335
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,611
Nice work out there.

336
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:17,222
I never knew
there'd come a day

337
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,398
When I'd be saying to you

338
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:23,526
"Don't let this good love
slip away..."

339
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,263
Your feet are on fire.
They're on fire.

340
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,804
Seriously, look,
they're on fire.

341
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,303
You're changing
your schedule?

342
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,602
Well, I have to.
You know, for practice.

343
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,870
Don't leave me alone
with Birdman.

344
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,879
You can change
yours to mine.

345
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,780
I can't. I'm actually taking
an SAT class, remember?

346
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,817
So caught up in you,
little girl

347
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,722
That I never did
suspect a thing

348
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,093
So caught up in you,
little girl

349
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,962
That I never want
to get myself free

350
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,330
You caught me
Baby, you taught me

351
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,968
How good It could be

352
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,141
Shania, I am not cleaning Salisbury
steak sauce off of that fringe again.

353
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,081
Hey, I just wanted
to let you guys know

354
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,815
that I'm gonna change
my work schedule

355
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,253
to Mondays, Wednesdays,

356
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,623
'cause I wanna take an SAT
class on Tuesdays, Thursdays.

357
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,123
I'm impressed.

358
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,458
Me, too

359
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,664
I like smart girls, that's
why I married your mama.

360
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,168
Well, that and I
knocked her up.

361
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:39,305
So caught up in you,
little girl

362
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,279
You're the one that's
got me down on my knees

363
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:46,614
So caught up in you,
little girl

364
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,552
That I never want
to get myself free

365
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,987
And, baby, it's true

366
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,048
You 're the one

367
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,992
Who caught me
Baby, you taught me

368
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,997
How good It could be

369
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,996
Fill your days
and your nights

370
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,631
No need to ever
ask me twice

371
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,005
Oh, no

372
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,676
Whenever you want me

373
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,351
Shouldn't... Shouldn't we,
like, be practicing soon?

374
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:26,391
Yeah, hurry up, you guys,
we don't wanna be late.

375
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:31,188
Careful, Pee-Wee here might
get the idea we actually win.

376
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,531
You don't?
Hell, no Never

377
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,534
All that "We're Number 1"
corporate crap doesn't apply.

378
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,036
Our bad attitude's
an asset here.

379
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,233
Okay, ladies
Check it out.

380
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:46,368
Hot off the presses, brand new
playbooks compiled by yours truly.

381
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,735
Your hands clean?

382
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,576
Yes, my hands
are clean.

383
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,912
Pay particular attention
to Play Number 3.

384
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,009
I think it's gonna
blow your doors off.

385
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,884
Smashley,
you're late as per usual.

386
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,513
I know.

387
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,549
Well, then you must also know that
there's nothing cool about being late.

388
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:04,095
Hey...
Let's hit the track.

389
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:08,428
Who's up for Lovejoy's later
tonight? $2 pitchers. Beer?

390
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,758
I'm in.

391
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:10,892
Me, too

392
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,197
I'm in

393
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,300
You weren't invited.

394
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,632
I'm still in.

395
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,211
There's no such thing
as a scrimmage.

396
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,907
We practice
the way we play.

397
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,414
Maven, you know
what to do.

398
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,747
Bliss, show me
something good.

399
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,053
You ready?
Am I ready?

400
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,162
Let's go,
ladies. Skate.

401
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:41,762
Don't block your own player,
let's go.

402
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,132
Crossover the turn, stay
low Crossover the turn.

403
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,603
Bend those knees. Bend
those knees. Bend those knees.

404
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:50,801
Ow!

405
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,447
What the hell
was that?

406
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:01,008
You had Maven beat,
but she smoked you

407
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,519
'cause you're too
scared to throw a hit.

408
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,144
And then you quit.

409
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,689
I need you to
be a lot more...

410
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,783
I want you to start
being a lot... Ruthless.

411
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:10,821
Yeah.

412
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,466
That's right, you little peanut,
I need you to be ruthless.

413
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,525
This is
a contact sport, Bliss.

414
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,469
Eventually I'm gonna
need you to make contact.

415
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,808
Next group up.
Back off, Razor

416
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,138
Just ignore him
We do.

417
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,541
Seriously

418
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,547
I mean, he's right.
I'm not cutting it.

419
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,553
You know what I like to
think about before every game?

420
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,181
My ex.

421
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,520
Little piece
of advice, Bliss

422
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,060
Don't fall for your
regional manager

423
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,289
and think that he's not
gonna give you crabs

424
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,731
because he cheated on you,
'cause it happens.

425
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:54,229
And when I think about myself in the
shower, using that special shampoo,

426
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:58,966
which, for the record, doesn't make
anyone feel very special at all,

427
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,569
I really, really
wanna hit somebody.

428
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:06,040
You have to find that thing that
really pisses you off and you use it.

429
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,883
Have you ever had crabs?

430
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:13,647
No.

431
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,259
No Okay My doctor said
it was really common, but...

432
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,531
B-man, come on.
What do you say?

433
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:30,268
Pash has to come. You
know, it's my first game.

434
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,501
Yeah, well,
what about me?

435
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,546
I mean, did anybody
bother to think,

436
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:38,208
"Hey, Birdman might appreciate hot
girls in fishnets and roller skates

437
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,911
"beating the crap
out of each other"?

438
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,047
No, they did not.

439
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,054
Do you wanna come, too?

440
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,859
Yeah, but I can't.
I have a prior engagement.

441
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,222
I'm covering for Pash.

442
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,399
Yes. We love you.
Birdman.

443
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,732
Yeah? You know we love you.

444
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:01,534
Thank you. We do.
You know that, right?

445
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,870
Yeah, yeah. Not enough.

446
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,204
We're crazy about you.

447
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,110
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

448
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,145
You can never have
too much eyeliner.

449
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,612
Or Lash Blast.

450
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,749
Here's a little gift
from the team.

451
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:23,385
Safety is sexy

452
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,762
You'll need these, too.
Those are just sexy.

453
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,495
Guys, thanks

454
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,496
Let the bout come to you.
Let the bout come to you.

455
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,436
Let the bout come to you.

456
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,137
So, are you ready
for your big debut?

457
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,906
Has anyone ever thrown up
on the track before?

458
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:47,677
Yeah.

459
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,778
Let's get them.
Kill them dead.

460
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,854
Skate fast, skate hard

461
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,084
I'm gonna puke.

462
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,286
During the day,
they go by Peggy, Francine,

463
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,828
Tammy, and Rachael,
but here...

464
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,863
All right, let
the bout come to you.

465
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,091
Okay

466
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,526
One, two,
three, kick ass

467
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:06,797
And they're off.

468
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,966
Jamming for the Widows, Eva
Destruction against the Hurl Scouts.

469
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,602
Bloody Holly who makes
her way out to the pack.

470
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:16,375
And, oh, she passes the block
with a beautiful backward skating.

471
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,312
But wait a second,
from out of nowhere,

472
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,113
Eva Destruction shows up
right on her tail.

473
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,019
Each girl the jammer passes,
they get a point.

474
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,113
Pass a girl,
get a point.

475
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:30,053
And she's gotten the first
seven points of the game.

476
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,225
And the Widows
take the lead.

477
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,664
Hey, Black Widows, my
spidey senses are tingling.

478
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:40,227
About to make a sequel
in my pants.

479
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,500
Yeah,
Spider-Man 3 and a Half?

480
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,174
Yeah, it is three and
a half inches wide.

481
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,043
Air trombone, yeah.

482
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,406
Nice jam, man.

483
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,211
That was amazing.

484
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,377
Thanks.

485
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,244
Yeah. Thank you.

486
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,881
Where did you learn
to skate like that?

487
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,481
Well, I once tried out
for the Olympics,

488
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,755
but that didn't
exactly work out.

489
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,023
You gotta maintain the
triangle configuration.

490
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,999
I've been over it and
over it with you guys.

491
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,261
What do you want
to do? Come on.

492
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,237
I don't need to do the triangle
I need to get up there and...

493
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,872
It's the second quarter
and we have Manson Number 1

494
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,536
jamming for
the Hurl Scouts.

495
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,944
This is a rough
contact sport.

496
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:25,242
These girls are lean,
mean skating machines.

497
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,716
And they gotta go fast if they
wanna get past the blockers

498
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,378
who are trying
to knock them down.

499
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,753
And by "knock them down,"
I mean "beat them to a pulp."

500
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,850
Eva's gonna grab
another four points,

501
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,555
bringing the Widows' score to
26 over the Hurl Scouts' 10.

502
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,124
Team captain Maggie Mayhem doing the
honors for the Hurl Scouts, but... Oh!

503
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,068
Getting Widows jammer Honey
Suck it back for that rail check

504
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,732
and Whiskey sweeps Manson
Number 2 out of the way,

505
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,798
making room for Honey
to widen the gap

506
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:56,472
to collect another three points
there as we go into halftime.

507
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,076
That makes the score 29-10. Come on.

508
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,577
They say the Scouts have
the most loyal fans,

509
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,920
and being the worst team in the
league, Lord knows they need them.

510
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,290
Oh, Rosa Sparks,
no, you didn’t.

511
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,160
God damn it.

512
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,989
Okay, folks, the Widows
have a pretty comfortable lead here

513
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,261
late In the game.

514
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,825
Hurl Scouts coach Razor

515
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,735
still sticking with Smashley
Simpson as the jammer.

516
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,401
She's up against the Widows'
speed woman, Honey Suckit.

517
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:28,310
Oh! The Wldows' jammer
hip-checks Smashley.

518
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,109
Well, our favorite
Whole Foods checkout girl

519
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,516
is about to bag her some Honey. Hey.

520
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,651
Clean-up on Aisle 5

521
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,520
With time left for only one
more jam, and the game out of reach,

522
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:43,992
Smashley Simpson
is out of here.

523
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,630
Okay, you're in

524
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,023
Show me why they
call you Ruthless.

525
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,441
Go get you some

526
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,287
Okay, Austin, get ready to
meet your newest Hurl Scout.

527
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:18,796
Here she is, Number 22, the fastest
thing on eight wheels, Babe Ruthless.

528
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:23,228
Babe Ruthless? All
right Go, Babe Ruthless

529
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,360
All right,
It's the final jam of the night.

530
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,803
I like the taste
of fresh meat.

531
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,466
And Razor, with nothing
to lose, throws the rookie

532
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:35,513
into the last jam on
her very first game.

533
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,672
And dang.

534
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,844
Babe Ruthless gets a double shove
to the rail served up by Whiskey.

535
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,319
But she's back up
like a Weebie.

536
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,753
Okay, okay, that's good

537
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,089
She darts down the inside
and heads towards the outside

538
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,028
and makes a run for it
out of the pack.

539
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,262
Oh, but here comes Eva
Destruction, still skating strong,

540
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,599
hoping to ruin
Babe's debut.

541
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,606
Ruthless is out of the pack She's
coming around for her points.

542
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,405
That's my best friend.
That's my best friend.

543
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,573
Rumor has it that Ruthless blew
away the judges in speed trials,

544
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,913
and you could certainly see why tonight.

545
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,214
And now Manson Number 1
takes out Eva.

546
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,222
Feeling the heat
Ruthless is bringing,

547
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,121
and she gets through
for the score.

548
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,621
And Ruthless
gets four points.

549
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,556
Go, Babe Ruthless

550
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,564
Babe Ruthless scored the
last four points of the game,

551
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,533
but the Widows
take this one home.

552
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,092
Congratulations,
you still suck.

553
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:37,536
That's great. Celebrate
mediocrity. That's fantastic.

554
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,099
Yeah, it's all a big joke.

555
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,234
We came second.

556
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:42,542
We came second.
You came second.

557
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,481
We came in second
out of two teams. Nice.

558
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,813
We're
Number 2 We're Number 2.

559
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,582
We're Number 2.
We're Number 2.

560
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,749
We're Number 2. ROSA:
Razor, come on You did good.

561
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,122
Well, I didn't
throw up.

562
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,420
That'll do.
Good thing.

563
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,793
Hey.
Hey.

564
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:01,923
Oh, my God I take back what I
said about you not being tough.

565
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,797
You kicked ass.
Really?

566
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,960
Oh, yeah And I saw that
guy you liked You did?

567
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,402
Mmm-hmm.
But then I lost him.

568
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,667
Bliss.
Hey, Hot Tubs.

569
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,935
Oh, I can't I gotta
get home to my man.

570
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,104
No.
Yes. Great game.

571
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,673
Yeah, man,
that was good.

572
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,146
What's Hot Tubs?
Yeah?

573
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:22,515
Oh, well, here at the
Warehouse, he's Johnny Rocket.

574
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,947
But here he's
"Hot Tub" Johnny.

575
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:28,254
Even though he's not allowed in,
we started calling him "Hot Tub"

576
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,089
until he got us one.

577
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:31,854
Huh.

578
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,491
All right.
Check it out.

579
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,328
No, that's
the thing.

580
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,602
Coke?
You swallowed?

581
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,538
That's hilarious.

582
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,034
Not in this
lifetime, Johnny.

583
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,771
Or the next one.

584
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,006
Hey.

585
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,284
What's up, ladies?

586
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,349
Should we help him?

587
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,521
Nah That's her fiancé He
loves it SMASHLEY: I love you.

588
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,997
That's my fiancé
Hey.

589
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,532
You know, there's some stuff
I'm pretty sure I could teach you.

590
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,537
Johnny.

591
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,637
Y'all check it out.
He's not even in anymore, man.

592
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:27,249
...I need you
tonight, tonight

593
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:31,083
It's gonna be all right

594
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,716
'Cause you are in my sight

595
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:38,421
All night, all night

596
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:44,332
Tonight, tonight, all night

597
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,072
Hey, sweet thing,
will you please bring

598
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,878
That one thing.
It makes my heart sling

599
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,942
Why? 'Cause I need it

600
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,845
Hey, man,
check this out.

601
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,045
That's not a bruise.
That's a bruise.

602
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,448
Yeah, you look
pretty good That's nice, huh?

603
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,795
Pash?

604
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,294
Nice choice.

605
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,490
Yeah?

606
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,324
Yeah, and I love
this one.

607
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,802
So where you from?

608
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,309
Well, I hail from the bustling
metropolis known as Bodeen, Texas

609
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,811
Uh, the tiny town, right?
Off of South 84?

610
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,109
That would be the one.

611
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,083
You live alone?

612
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,449
Roommate.

613
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,511
Me, too.
Four of them.

614
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:15,649
Why Bodeen? If you don't mind
me asking What do you do there?

615
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,255
By day, I work
at the Oink Joint.

616
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,260
But by night...
Oliver. Oliver.

617
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,631
Oliver.

618
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,102
One second.

619
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,367
Oliver.

620
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,878
Get your ass down here You left
Jasper's guitar in your car.

621
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,970
All right, dill weed.

622
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,107
Shut up, douche bag

623
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:40,515
Nimrod.
Tampon.

624
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,676
Tool.

625
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:49,820
What are you doing in approximately
five and a half minutes?

626
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,162
No official plans.

627
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,390
Great.

628
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,893
I'll go bring
you something.

629
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,806
There she is.
All by herself.

630
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,248
Hey.
Don't fight it.

631
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,689
Let's get a beer.

632
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,193
Oh, my God

633
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,900
Okay, you can make out
with him But that is it.

634
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,534
Who are you,
my mother?

635
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:36,767
Pash?

636
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,444
Savage and I have been
looking everywhere for you.

637
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,041
Yeah, I bet

638
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,379
My belly hurts.

639
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:49,545
There's a storm
in there.

640
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,719
It really does, though.

641
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,919
Come on Hold on
Hold on. Let's get this.

642
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,229
It's cool.
I swallowed it.

643
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,698
No, come on. Just stick
your fingers in your throat.

644
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,735
No, you stick your finger
down your throat.

645
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,762
Pash. Have you ever thought
about your parents making love?

646
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,437
Your dad's naked body?

647
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,567
What?

648
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,738
His balls jiggling.

649
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,542
Sweaty
No.

650
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:24,947
That's not fair.

651
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,148
Could you get me
a washcloth?

652
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,383
Yeah.

653
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,820
I'm sorry I ruined
your kind of date.

654
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,928
But I want dirt.

655
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,437
His name's Oliver
It's a great name.

656
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,676
Yeah, if you like wayfaring
Dickensian orphans.

657
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,788
You're gonna have to roll over
You smell like a dead goat.

658
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,954
Sorry

659
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,526
Ugh.

660
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,443
Hey, girl.
How was the sleepover?

661
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:22,809
Fine.

662
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,485
Bliss,
are you ready yet?

663
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,622
The Blue Bonnet brunch
is in an hour.

664
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,458
Did you forget?

665
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:49,401
You think you have all
the time in the world,

666
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:54,473
but there's not many girls who
are both smart and pretty like you.

667
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,514
And I hate to admit it, but the
pretty part doesn't last forever.

668
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:00,983
You got to make the most of
what you have while you can.

669
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,713
Nobody tells you that.

670
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,845
Mom, you're still
really beautiful.

671
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:09,018
Save your sarcasm
for later.

672
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:11,061
How's your inspiration
speech coming?

673
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,094
I'm working on it.
You want me to read it?

674
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,995
Not yet.
Later?

675
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:31,579
Bodeen, Bodeen,
Bodeen, Bodeen

676
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,417
Someone get me
out of here, Bodeen

677
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,546
It's depressing
in the sticks

678
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,716
I'm all over
these racist hicks

679
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:44,455
And I'm jonesing
for an Austin fix

680
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,359
Yeah. That's right.

681
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:52,930
Bodeen, Bodeen,
Bodeen, Bodeen

682
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,472
Oh, my God,
it's him.

683
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:01,745
What do I do?

684
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,713
Go ask him if he
wants a Squealer.

685
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,753
Are you stalking me?

686
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:20,991
No, ma'am

687
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:25,762
I happen to be here in Bodeen on
business craving some barbeque.

688
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,235
And, yeah,
I'm stalking you.

689
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,643
Okay

690
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,106
Can you take a break?

691
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,320
You owe me. I wasn't even
supposed to work today.

692
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:51,427
I love you.

693
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,205
Is this you?

694
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:11,772
Technically, it's my brother's
band But, yes, I am in it.

695
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,443
And I'll be taking
that from you now.

696
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:21,385
Wow. From here it kind of looks like
you're wearing a Stryper T-shirt.

697
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,326
Stryper? Yeah, '80s
Christian heavy metal.

698
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,331
I mean, "In the name
of Jesus, we rock."

699
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,393
Well, I suppose if
it's in His name then.

700
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,735
What's this? What's this three
million five hundred and...

701
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,400
Oh, that's nothing

702
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,676
You wanna know?
I wanna know.

703
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,716
It's a little thing
called a high score.

704
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:50,587
At just the right...
Go. Nice shot.

705
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,382
Is this what you do
with all the girls?

706
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,857
You take them here to
show off your skills?

707
00:44:56,928 --> 00:45:01,160
Yeah. And it
usually works, too.

708
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:03,029
Oh, yeah?

709
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,735
Maybe we should do
something different.

710
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:14,777
Stars at night
are big and bright

711
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:19,949
Deep In
the heart of Texas

712
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:26,251
I should probably
get to practice.

713
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,397
Shit.

714
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:37,393
Um...

715
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,933
I think I might
have lost my keys.

716
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:44,301
Marco
Polo.

717
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,641
Marco.

718
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,871
Polo.

719
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,747
Marco!

720
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:54,580
Polo!

721
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,048
Found them.

722
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,713
Cool, I guess
we can go now.

723
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,087
Oops

724
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,221
I'm gonna kill you.

725
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:09,163
I'm gonna tear you up.
I know.

726
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,564
I am going to...

727
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,967
I realize this.
I realize this.

728
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,072
Holy crap, you guys
We almost won that one.

729
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,404
Yeah, almost

730
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:22,446
You know, Razor's play
actually worked.

731
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,243
Man, maybe we ought
to learn new plays.

732
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,307
What's up,
Hurl Scouts?

733
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:28,851
That was so
good out there.

734
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,513
It was really cute to see
y'all trying so hard.

735
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,588
I hate her.

736
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,661
Bliss.
Yeah?

737
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:41,596
Remember all that stuff I said
about winning not mattering?

738
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,258
Forget it.

739
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,529
I wanna beat
that cocky bitch.

740
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,430
Me, too

741
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,010
On my team. Yeah!

742
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,877
Look what Corbi did.

743
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,718
With all that
combined brain power,

744
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,520
this is the best
they could come up with?

745
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,322
They got
your freckles.

746
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,623
That they did.

747
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,202
Hey, are you all right?

748
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,811
You can't do that.

749
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,679
She just did

750
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,150
We deserve
better villains.

751
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,148
Just a few minutes gone by,

752
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,849
but the game Is already
falling into a familiar pattern,

753
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:43,155
giving the Fight Attendants
an 18-to-6 lead.

754
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,822
Okay, ladies, we're getting
beat, but we got the playbooks.

755
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:50,594
Time to show these Fight
Attendants a few tricks of our own.

756
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,834
Let's run Play Number 3.
Stampede.

757
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,863
Number 3?

758
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah. I think we only
got to Number 2.

759
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,508
Like, one and a half

760
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,714
You didn't learn
a goddamn thing, did you?

761
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,718
What's it gonna take for
you guys to pull it together?

762
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:12,347
You know what?
That's it. Hold this.

763
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,188
Did he just
take Number 3?

764
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,453
Come on That's all I'm
saying Just skate on through.

765
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,890
Hey, what's up, Razor?
Ready to forfeit?

766
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:27,301
Forfeit my ass.
Run this play.

767
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,739
What do I look like?
An idiot?

768
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:33,242
Anyway, I've got
my own plays.

769
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,736
Here's $20 You know
how little money I have.

770
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,645
You run the play. You don't
score at least three points,

771
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,774
you got another 20 coming
at the end of the bout.

772
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,578
Just run the play, Jeff.

773
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,211
You all right? Let's skate Yeah.

774
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,722
Ladies, we've got a change of plan What?

775
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:52,824
Hey, don't let that traitor throw
you. Let's hit him where it hurts.

776
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,399
Did Razor just coach the other
team or did my peyote just kick in?

777
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,966
I don't even know
what's coming on

778
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,969
'cause I don't know what's
coming around the corner.

779
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,562
Fight Attendants are
about to take on the sky.

780
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,769
Whoa! Holy crap,
a 180 turn.

781
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:11,008
Kami Kaze makes her way through the
rubble to score an easy four points.

782
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,606
Fight Attendants, 22,
Hurl Scouts, 6.

783
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,811
Is that Play Number 3?

784
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,581
Works pretty well,
doesn't it?

785
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,787
You suck.

786
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:20,949
You turncoat.

787
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,858
Want me to give them
Play Number 4 now?

788
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,619
No.

789
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,790
Okay Take a knee

790
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,301
Okay I wanna put what
just happened behind us.

791
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,703
I know I've moved on. We're
gonna run Play Number 2.

792
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,937
Fire and Smashley, you at least
know the first half of that, right?

793
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:42,804
Yes.

794
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,972
Okay

795
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,677
Then get out there
and get you some.

796
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:50,185
Hey, Scouts You mind finishing
your little Family Feud huddle?

797
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,949
Survey says you're
wasting our time.

798
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,389
Let's go ape shit.

799
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,121
Yeah.

800
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,202
Coming out of halftime
and an alternate universe,

801
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,075
Coach Razor puts former figure skater
Bloody Holly in the jammer position,

802
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,205
who launches furiously
into the pack.

803
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,250
The team Is on their game now,
pushing Bloody to the front.

804
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,843
And she makes it through
Bitch and Cooke Flake

805
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,822
grabbing a total of eight
points for the Hurl Scouts.

806
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,188
Come on, come on

807
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:32,855
The Hurl Scouts are catching up
in points for the first time ever.

808
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,898
As this space
oddity continues,

809
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:39,026
Babe Ruthless uses
her speed to fly by...

810
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:42,095
Oh! Axels of Evil
knocks her down.

811
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,198
But she's back up. Here
they come around the turn.

812
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,868
A choreographed move
from the Hurl Scouts.

813
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:48,878
Has to be from
Razor's playbook.

814
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:50,914
That makes
the score 58-58,

815
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,006
a first In the history
of the Hurl Scouts.

816
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:56,678
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but the Hurl Scouts are tied.

817
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:59,245
We got a tie game
here, folks.

818
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,381
Oh, yeah?
Oh, but Smashley goes down.

819
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,289
Really?
Bitch. What the... No.

820
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,555
Ooh, watch out, Tammy
No. No.

821
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,597
Here comes Smashley

822
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,063
Get off me,
you psycho.

823
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,930
We've got two girls
brawling on the track.

824
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:13,902
I don't know whether to break It
up or break out the video camera.

825
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,906
Hell hath no fury
like a woman fouled.

826
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,100
That's not legal.

827
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,769
By day, these ladies are your
favorite waitresses, nurses, teachers,

828
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:26,145
but by night these girls give
the crowd what they came for.

829
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:30,116
Smashley Simpson Is out of
here We're only moments to go

830
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,586
and the Hurl Scouts have
managed to squeak out in front.

831
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:37,252
We're at a 70-67.
Hurl Scouts.

832
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,821
Okay, grab her wrists,
hold on tight. Go.

833
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,294
Play Number 8.
You ready for the whip?

834
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,097
Put your arm out,
I'll be there.

835
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,604
It's the final
seconds of the game.

836
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,936
Manson ramps Cookie Rumble,
and the Hurl Scouts attempt

837
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:53,238
a classic move in derby.
Maggie.

838
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,244
Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

839
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,507
Nothing gives you
speed like the whip.

840
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,581
A whip. Ruthless Is
flying into the pack

841
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,779
while her teammates are doing
a downright professional job

842
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,984
of clearing the way. She picks
up one, two, three, four points.

843
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:11,619
Break out
the merit badges. 74-67.

844
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,761
The Hurl Scouts
have finally won one.

845
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,696
Fight Attendants, this
Is your captain speaking.

846
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,463
It's gonna be a long, bumpy ride back
to Loserville. So if you have your...

847
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,631
You win the game. If you
run the plays, you win the game!

848
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,141
How about them Hurl Scouts?
Yeah How about them Hurl Scouts?

849
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,507
How about them Hurl Scouts?

850
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,704
Touché, ladies Touché

851
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,044
We got to run the plays. We
run the plays, we win the game.

852
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,548
We'll do our
homework Every time.

853
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,879
There're only 10 of them.
It's not... Not rocket science.

854
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,512
Let's get those
Holy Rollers.

855
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:40,851
Yes.

856
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,064
I put a bomb in your fire

857
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,460
You say oh-oh-oh-oh

858
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,835
I put a bomb in your fire
You say oh-oh-oh-oh

859
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,740
Murray. Murray.
Murray!

860
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,074
There Is a way to predict
the outcome of people like you

861
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:07,706
You are a sheep in sheep's
clothing and you know, you know

862
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:11,345
I am a-coming to get you
You say oh-oh, oh-oh

863
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,255
There is a way to predict
the outcome of...

864
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:19,227
Please tell me you did not
shove Corbi Booth over a rail.

865
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,494
Actually, I did.

866
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,728
Corbi has a huge
bruise on her leg.

867
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:27,668
I know that you're just
too bohemian to care,

868
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,365
but she has to
cheer tonight.
