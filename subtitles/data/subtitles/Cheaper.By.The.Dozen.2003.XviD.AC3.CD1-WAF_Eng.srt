They're all going to end up
on milk cartons.

Gil-- Gil, Decker and Rico
are playing too loose at the corners.

after I drop the kids off at school...

738
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,865
and we can talk out
some offense variations.

All right. No, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

Uh,Jake, get me a Band-Aid, okay?
Here, here.

742
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,616
Go stir. You like to stir.
Here, let's take a look at it.

00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,618
Let's take a look, see if it's okay.

00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,883
- Oh, no, I'm just kidding.
It's actually not--
- Uh, Dad?

745
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:41,151
- Yeah?
- This goo's on fire.

746
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:45,719
Oh, no, no. That's the way Daddy likes it!
Likes it hot and nice and spicy!

747
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:49,994
Yeah. Here we go.
There we go. Got it. All right.

- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, good. Can you get a Band-Aid?

749
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:56,102
- No need to say hello.
- Not one other kid in
this neighborhood does chores.

750
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,505
Well, we're not like any
other family in the neighborhood.

751
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,476
Right. So,
why do we live here?

752
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,308
Dishwasher, now!

753
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,077
Jessica, can you get these plates
and put 'em on the table, please?

754
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,086
Oh, God. What the--

Oh! Clean-up on aisle 1 2!
Anybody?

760
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,805
You need help
cleaning up, Dad? [ Yells ]

761
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,179
- I'm in puke!
- Are you all right?

762
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,277
- Still need help cleaning up?

enough with your back.

Nora, where's that Band--

Jake put a bucket on Jessica's head,
and it's stuck.

768
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,036
And when they have a free moment,
let my parents know that...

769
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,732
I came by to tell 'em
I got a job today at an ad agency.
