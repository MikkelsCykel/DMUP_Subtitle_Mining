I'm doing the best that I can.

I know that's all
I can ask of myself.

But is that good enough?
Is my work doing any good?

6
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,939
Is anybody paying attention?
Is it hopeless to try and change things?

The African guy's a sign, right?
Because if he isn't...

then nothing in this world
makes any sense to me.

Don't quit.

a lot more of this place.

17

To celebrate, I have
a poem I'd like to read.

''Nobody sits

The rock just sits and is.

and that's what we need.''

to check out this African guy.

- Exactly. What African guy?

Why don't you just tell me
what your situation is.

Look, I'm not really sure I know exactly
what you guys do here, all right?

00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,185
Well, we, uh-- We'll investigate
and solve your case.

- How?
- If you sign a contract, we'll follow you.

- You'll spy?
- Yes.

- Yes.

your case from a different angle.

- In some fancy restaurant
that I'd never been to before.

So they let me borrow a suitjacket.

called Schottinger's photo archives.

i was there getting stills
of early Bob Dylan.

He's like 1 8 years old or something.

and get them signed.

Mr. Markovski, we see
a lot of people in here...

86
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,913
who claim they want to know
the ultimate truth about reality.

87
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,681
They want to peer under the surface
at the big everything...

88
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,349
but this can be a very painful
process full of surprises.

89
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,926
It can dismantle the world
as you know it.

90
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:11,861
That's why most people prefer to remain
on the surface of things.

00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,455
Maybe you should go home.
Let sleeping dogs lie.

- Yes. No.

Uh, time not space. No, I don't know

00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,444
I take it you don't

because my work situation
is a little shaky, all right?

105
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,140
You want us to stay
away from your job?

106
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,402
Yeah. If you come snooping
around my office...

107
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,479
it could make me look unstable
and it could hurt me.

- Hold on.

- Let's do this and then we'll get to the contract.

115
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,435
- It's too much too soon.
- It's always too much too soon.
That's the nature of the beast.

116
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,596
- Approach, patience, finesse.
- Will you stop?

117
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,072
- Come on.
- We need to start with his specifics, Bernard.

118
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,575
We need to go past logic though.
Come on. Let's go.

119
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,736
- Give me a kiss. Come on.
- Okay.

120
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,050
Will you tell me where
we're having dinner tonight?

121
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:43,121
- Korean barbecue.
- Really?

122
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,753
Okay, let's get started.

123
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,954
Is this part
of my investigation?

124
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,090
Yes. Say this blanket represents all the matter
and energy in the universe, okay?

125
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,192
You, me, everything.

126

All the particles, everything.

127
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,035
- What's outside this blanket?
- More blankets. That's the point.

128
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,235
- Blanket's everything.
- Exactly. This is everything.

129
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,939
Let's just say
that this is me, all right?

130
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,915
And I'm, what, 60-odd years old
and I'm wearing a gray suit.

131
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,953
Blah, blah, blah.
And let's say over here, this is you.

132
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,989
And, you're-- I don't know,
you're 21 . You got dark hair, etc.

133
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,254
And over here, this is Vivian,
my wife and colleague.

134
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:26,263
Then over here, this is
the Eiffel tower, right? It's Paris.

135
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,334
And this is a war.
And this is, uh, a museum.

And this is a disease.
And this is an orgasm.

00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,163
And this is a hamburger.

138
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:37,765
- Everything is the same even if it's different.
- Exactly.

139
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,278
But our everyday mind forgets this.
We think everything is separate.

140
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,474
Limited. I'm over here.
You're over there. Which is true.

141
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,576
But it's not the whole truth
because we're all connected.

142
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,655
Because we... are connected.

143
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,746
- Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure.
- Okay?

144
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,792
- Yeah.
- All right, now, we need to learn...

145

00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,493
- You sent it to me.
- No, no. We would never give you this book.

289
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,127
- You didn't send this?
- Caterine Vauban's full of shit.
What is she doing here?

290
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,296
God, she never leaves Paris.
This is insane.

291
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,896
- This is a pretty good book. You should read this.
- What?

292
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,306
She says nothing's connected,
doesn't matter what you do...

293
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,674
you can drive a car,
you can burn up gas...

294
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,043
- Yeah?
- which would explain the way things actually are...

295
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,515
where people do destructive things
like it doesn't matter.

296
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,485
Tommy, Tommy, everything is connected
and everything matters.

297
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,885
There's not an atom
in our bodies...

298

that has not been forged
in the furnace of the sun.

299
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,318
- Now, isn't that cool? Huh?
- Yes.

300
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,486
- That's a cool thing, isn't it?
- But--

301
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,655
But what? You tell me where
she contradicts that.

302
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,824
- Oh, right here.
- Where? Where?

303
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,402
- There--
- Where?

304
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:36,065
''Less than 5% of the cosmos is composed of
the same elements that compose human life.''

305
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,575
- You know--
- There you go. That means we're all alone...

306
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,269
and we're miserable
and isolated.

307
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,370
Molly, if you--
Listen. if you--

done dismantling...

309
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,082
he will never make it
to the other side, okay?

310
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,280
You know what? i'm done
with the dismantling.

311
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,688
- You don't want to ask these questions?
- No! I want to live my life!

312
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,352
What is that life, baby?
What are we part of? Who are we?

313
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,861
Look at this. Do you know where
these come from?

314
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,023
- Yeah, my closet.
- Indonesia.

315
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,364
- The store.
- Baby, this is the truth, okay?

316
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,438
Little girls like you,
they have to work in dark factories...

317
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,270
where they go blind for $1 .60 a month
just to make Mommy her pretty shoes.

318
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,868
- Can you imagine that, Caitlin?
- I don't want the children to work in factories!

Don't listen, honey.
Daddy is crazy.

Daddy's not crazy, baby.
The world is crazy.

321
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,145
- It's important to ask questions.
- [ Caitlin ] Don't let them go blind.!

322
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,121
Mommy doesn't ask
'cause Mommy doesn't care.

323
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,658
- Don't stop asking questions, baby.
- Damn you!

324
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,250
- How dare you!
- Skippy, put her in the car, will ya?

325
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,126
- ''Less than 5% of the cosmos...

that compose human life.''

327
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,500
- What does that matter?
- You should be asking these questions, Skip.

328
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,802
Guys, give him a break.
His therapist is down here to help him out.

329

Excuse me.
What did you call me?

330
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,572
- You're his therapist?
- No, i'm--not his therapist.

331
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,171
We need to talk 'cause this book
is making a lot of sense to me and I want--

332
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,649
And what is Caterine Vauban
doing in the United States?

00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,845
What the hell
are you talking about?

- [ Man ] No, no, wait. This is really good.

[ Brad ] You think that's funny?
i got a story for you.

337
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,656
- It's only four months old.
- Wait. Wait. Listen. Listen.
Listen to the master, all right?

338
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,057
I'm with Shania. We're opening
a megastore down by the loop.

339
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,459
Shania's there
promoting her apparel, right?

340
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:43,159
It's 4:00 and she's starving. So I order
a ton of tuna fish sandwiches, no mayo.

341
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,065
- [ Woman ] Stop it.!
- [ Laughter ]

342
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,138
Tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick.

343
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,697
Shania hates mayo, all right?
And she can't eat chicken salad.

344
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,041
That's no joke, all right? We gave it to her once,
she threw up in the limo.

345
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,014
- She's vomiting all over the limo.
- The lady hates chicken salad.

346
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:01,381
So I bring out a bunch of tuna fish sandwiches.
She still doesn't believe me.

347
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,977
I say, ''Shania,
I'm allergic to mayo.''

348
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,992
- Which, by the way, is a lie.
- He loves mayo.! He loves it.

349
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,224
Shania still doesn't believe me so I eat two
of the sandwiches in front of her to prove it.

350
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,824
So she eats one and a half sandwiches.
One and a half sandwiches...

351
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:20,268
before she realizes...
it's chicken salad.

352
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,832
- And she actually likes it.
- She did not vomit.

353
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:30,575
He made her change her mind. And that's
what they want upstairs in corporate, okay?

Excuse me? Can I help you?

- Shh. Shh. Shh.
- [ Woman ] Excuse me?

357
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,250
Yes, I'm here for
the Open Spaces meeting with Brad Stand.

358
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,262
Okay, well, then you are in the wrong
area entirely. Come on.

359
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,231
- I'll show you where to go.
- You're very, very helpful. Thanks a lot.

360
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,235
There's no reason for you to be up here.
This is an executive private floor.

361
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,795
it's for-- Come on.
Let's pick it up. Heel to toe.

362
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,774

an executive's assistant...

Let's move it along this way.

365
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,918
You're supposed to be on another floor.
Security is very tight in this building.

366
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,818
Or at least I thought it was
very tight in this building.

367
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,323
Of course, every
now and then we get somebody...

who gets off
on the wrong floor.

And then people
flitting about--

Uh, Dawn, can we do it one more time?

- I suck, Daryl. I really sucked.
- You're doing great, Dawn.

of Huckabees.

Oh, there she is.!
You're one sneaky lady.

We deeded them over
to the municipality in 1 97 2.

00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,595
Existential. I'd like to ask a few questions
if you don't mind.

431
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,601
Actually we do. We do because
we've got to meet, and we're a little late.

432
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,035
Sounds kind of interesting though.
Have you got a card?

433
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,038
- Yes.
- I don't mean to give you a hard time.

434
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,301
Existential? Is that
like a therapy?

435
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,173
Okay, let's go, sneaky lady.
Let's step it outside.

436
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,339
[ Albert ] i told you to stay away
from my work situation.!

437
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,852
To solve your coincidence, we have to put it
into context. Brad Stand seems very important.

438
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,354
So you come by Huckabees corporate and
say you're my fucking existential detectives?

439
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,951
- I'm lucky if I last another day!
- We can solve your case sooner
if you're straight with us.

440
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,120
I'm being straight with you.
Brad smeared me...

441
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,323
and took the coalition
in a different direction.

442
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,993
- That's straight.
- At Schottinger's photo archive
where you met Mr. Nimieri--

443
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,162
Who's Mr.-- Who's that?

444
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,069
- The African guy.
- That's the African guy from my coincidence.

445
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:27,167
- This is what I wanna talk about.
- it wasn't your fÝrst time at Schottinger's, was it?

446
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,644
- Did I say it was?
- You did. You agree it wasn't?

447
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,012
Sure. it wasn't my fÝrst time.
Big deal.

448
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,917
It was more like a regular thing with you.
And you weren't finding a still of Bob Dylan.

449
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,512
You were planting photos
of yourself in the archive.

450
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:43,060
- What are you getting at?
- Why would you do something like that?

451
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:47,097
To be noticed.
Maybe urgently.

452
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,167
- Maybe,yeah.
- Uh-huh.

453
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,828
How did that affect things
with Brad at the coalition?

454
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,497
How did it affect things at
the coalition? I don't know.

455
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,041
You know, it was a drag.
It really was a drag.

456
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,670
Because I wanted my poems to go out
with the fund-raiser mailing. Brad didn't.

457
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,078
He was all obsessed
with Shania and Pete Sampras.

458
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:08,118
Not what we were really
supposed to be focusing on-- hurt.

459
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:13,179
You planted photos of yourself and your poems
at Schottinger's. Brad didn't respect you.

460
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,624
- No, he didn't.
- And yet you brought him into
the open spaces coalition.

461
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,129
- Why is that?
- I needed the sponsor to take
my cause to another level.

462
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,290
That's why.
Why else would I do it?

463
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,460
- Like we said. To be noticed.
- This is absurd. Show me my folder.

464
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,973
- No. That is not productive.
- At the photo archive, you spent a lot of time...

465
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,703
looking at old Jessica Lange
bathing suit stills, why?

466
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,972
That's only because Lange
comes before Markovski.

467
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,447
I was putting my head shots under Markovski,
and then ''L'' is right before it.

468
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,384
I might've looked at a little bit of Lange
on the way out. What's the big deal?

469
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,753
- Albert, baby, come on.
- What, is it a crime? Is it a crime to look at Lange?

470
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,656
- [ Vivian ] Have you ever been in love?
- What kind of question is that?

471
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,720
- Do you even believe in love?
- Or do you only have fantasy relationships...

472
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,960
because anything else
would be too painful?

473
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,298
Bernard, excuse me. But I'm
making some progress here.

474
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,567
So am I, darling.
So am I.

475
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,075
Oh, no, no. i'm not going in that thing.
Every time i go in there...

476
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,169
it's all hating faces
that I have to chop up with a machete.

477
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,944
And then they multiply.
And we're going to address that right now.

478
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,020
- Okay?
- I'll leave it to you.

479
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,989
Come on. You can't retreat.
Back into the fray, Albert. Let's go.

480
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,386
I'm in your corner.

481
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,088
[ Heart Beating ]

482
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,760
Okay, Albert, i want you to melt
your usual identity like you did before.

483
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,806
- [ Woman Laughing ]
- Stop looking at me.

484
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,875
I said stop looking at me.

485
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,843
- Dawn is gonna love doing
spots for the open spaces.
- Who's Dawn?

486
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,539
Miss Huckabees.
Dawn.

487
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,811
- She loves your poems. The one about the rock.
- Nobody sits like this rock sits.

488
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,149
That's the one. She loves poems.
She loves forests, meadows, getting outside.

489
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,816
We'll just throw theJet Skis
on the trailer and head to the mountains.

490
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,722
Wait, you guys--
You go with MissHuckabees?

491
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,024
- She was doing some print work for us--
- [ Bernard ] Albert? Albert?

492
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,827
Forget Brad. Come back to me.
Where are you? Where are you?

493
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:07,633
Albert.
Picture a tree in a fÝeld.

494
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,674
Good. Now put someone
you respect in the tree.

495
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,175
- Hey, dickweed.
- [ Albert ] Still Brad Stand.

496
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,303
- Add someone else.
- Like who?

497
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,143
You know, someone who can understand
things. Someone who can help you.

498
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:23,653
- Who's your guide?
- Well, I use Magritte, a Belgian surrealist.

499
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,921
- i got someone.
- Who is it?

500
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,394
Mrs. Schirmir. She was my high school
English teacher. She helped me.

501
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,261
- All right, good.
- He pushed her out of the tree.

502
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:40,167
Okay, Mrs. Schirmir has a vacuum cleaner,
Albert, that sucks up fear.

503
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,737
Now she's going to send you
rays of security and complete acceptance.

504
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,579
He chopped her head off.

505
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,778
[ Yelling ]

506
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,052
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
You're doing well.

507
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,219
Now, don't give up now.
Didn't she vacuum a lot?

508
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,526
But then he vacuumed her.
I had to chop him up with a machete.

509
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,465
Okay, Albert. I can let you
in on a couple of secrets.

510
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,729
One, your mind is always
occupied on something...

511
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,933
so it may as well be something helpful
like Mrs. Schirmir and her vacuum cleaner.

512
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,943
Two, there is
no such thing as you and me.

513
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,138
So then there's
just nothing?

514
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,648
Three, there's
no such thing as nothing.

515
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,742
There is no remainder
in the mathematics of infinity.

516
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,083
There's only the blanket.

517
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,056
I thought I understood the blanket.
Now I'm not sure.

518
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:39,221
Flags and bags.! Huckabees says,
''Happy birthday, Mr. President. ''

519
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,891
50% off all knapsacks
and pocketbooks.

520
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:47,165
Oh, say, can you see
how good this looks?

521
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,900
Let freedom ring.
At Huckabees...

522
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:53,136
the everything store.

523
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,077
''Huckabees cornucopia
of stuff we all want.

524
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,843
''But what happened to the gazelles?
Were they squashed...

525
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,976
under the CD department?''

526
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,850
- Hey, Albert, how's it goin'?
- What are you doing here, Brad?

527
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,083
I met Brad when
I was investigating you.

528
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,456
He called with his own existential
conundrum. That's all.

529
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,325
- I'm really glad I found out about these people.
- That's bullshit.

530
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,422
He doesn't care about
things like this.

531
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,694
Bring me the African guy.
Where's that African guy?

532
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,965
- Dude, what're you talking about?
- Why does he get to write poetry?

533
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,336
There's no gazelles in North America.
Just so you know.

534
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,535
And that building squashing nature
is my imagery. You don't write poetry.

535
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,306
[ Bernard ]
Everyone's intake procedure is different.

536
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,541
I asked Brad to write a poem.

537
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,209
And it wasn't enough that
you came to my coalition...

538
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,719
now you have to
come here and do-- Okay, okay.

539
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,382
[ Bernard ]
All right, that's good.

540
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,951
We're the same, Brad.
It's all the blanket.

541
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,031
There you go.
Give it a shot.

542
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,998
- That is wonderful, Albert.
- Oh, honey, he's got it.

543
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,365
How are things
at the coalition, Brad?

544
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,961
Great. Much smoother.

545
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,736
Great, i look forward to coming back
and working with you.

546
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,243
I don't think that's going
to happen, my friend.

547
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:05,305
i'm still in the charter.
i built the coalition from scratch.

548
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,351
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't want
to cramp you here.

549
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,650
That's what you mean to do.!
That's exactly what you mean to do.!

550
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,485
- What?
- What?
- What?

551
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:16,560
You see what he's doing?
Tell them what you're doing.

552
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,222
-What?
-He's come here to conquer you
like he conquered my coalition.

553
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,665
And now he's here today to unnerve me so
that when Orrin comes to town, i will blow it.

554
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,737
- That's what you mean to do.
- Albert, please.!

555
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,705
- Oh, my God, Brad. You're killing me.
- What are you talking about?

556
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,742
What am i talking--
Okay, when Orrin comes, i'll blow it.

557
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,871
I'll get kicked out, and then he can do
whatever he wants with the coalition.

558
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,779
- Who's Orrin?
- Orrin is the Open Spaces national director.

559
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,909
He's coming to review
our charter.

560
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,955
I hope this isn't about Dawn.
He has a crush on my girlfriend.

561
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,251
- That's crazy!
- Why do you stare at her?

562
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,258
-She's a model.!
-[ Brad Laughs ]

563
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,295
- I'm going home.
- Oh, no.! Albert, please.
Stay with us for mancala hour.

564
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,592
I'm gonna have a fucking ball
at mancala hour, aren't I?

565
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,690
Maybe Albert
should meet his other.

566
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,269
What? Tommy? No, that's
a bad idea right now.

567
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,136
Yes, a dicey move. Maybe even dangerous,
but potentially inspired.

568
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,641
Bernard, give them
both a connection.

569
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,270
Maybe, but Tommy's in a bad direction.
It could spread to Albert.

570
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,110
You said Tommy was gonna be fine.

come back to us, Bernard.

you say, take the long view.
- Long view.

- Yeah, a real treat.
- You have received your answer.

589
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:23,182
Senorita, the petroleum situation
was not created by nature...

590
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,347
like the drought or
the olives or any of that.

591
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,517
It was created by people,
and this is the facts.

592
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,357
It was created by people who
act like nothing's happening...

593
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,057
- and that's causing all the problems.
- No, no, Tommy.

00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,191
- One question only. Uno.
- Okay.

595

- Here's the question--
- No, no. I think--

596

You've had your question and the answer,
Tommy, please. Senora is tired.

597
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,306
Senorita, why do people only ask
themselves deep questions...

598
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,538
when something
really bad happens?

599
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,877
Then they forget
all about it after. Right?

600
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,974
How come people are
self-destructive?

601
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,144
And third,
i refuse to use petroleum...

602
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,382

in my lifetime, is there?

Jimmy Carter would have
a great electric car by now.

I could have a Cadillac Escalade,
and it would be electric.

605

- I wouldn't have to ride on my bicycle.
- That is three questions.

you to meet Albert.

- It turns out he can use
a connection sooner than later.

00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,774
- What is it exactly?
- Like a buddy system I think.

612
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,411
When we dismantle,
it can get kind of rough. And it helps...

613
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,614
to have a friend
going through the same.

Sometimes I take the bus.

- What do you mean?
- They won't let me see my coincidence file.

623

You want them to solve a coincidence?
That's why you came here?

- Yeah, that's why I came here.
- Who's the girl?

- I doubt your coincidence is meaningful.
- Why?

628
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,753
I have a book by a French thinker
named Caterine Vauban.

629
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:41,985
She says the same thing they say here about
dismantling your reality to see the big picture.

630
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,426
- What's the difference?
- Here, they say everything's
connected in the blanket.

631
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:49,431
Vauban says nothing's connected. It's all
random and cruel. It doesn't matter what you do.

632
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,501
That's nihilism, Tommy!

633

They find it threatening.
But it is very convincing.

You know, my ex-girl
won't let me see my daughter.

635
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,506
She's brainwashing her
not to think or feel.

636
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,635
- What kind of reality is that?
- Not this one.

Exactly. i think you shouldjust look
in your fÝle if you want to.

00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,086
[ Albert ] You mean
the existential detectives?

716
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,627
- Sounds like a support group.
- Why can't he use a church?

717
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,562
Sometimes people
have additional questions to be answered.

718
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,634
- Like what?
- Well, um, for instance--

719
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,464
If the forms of this world die,
which is more real...

720
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,732
the me that dies
or the me that's infinite?

721
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,434
Can I trust my habitual mind or do I need
to learn to look beneath those things?

722
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,011
Sounds like we got
a philosopher.

723
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,945
We don't have to ask those kinds
of questions, do we, Mom?

724
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,108
- No, honey.
- What happened to the cat, Albert?

725
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,084
H-How'd you know
about my cat?

726
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:13,350
- The cat was killed by curiosity.
- Right. That cat.

727
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:16,426
- What do you do?
- I'm the director of the Open Spaces Coalition.

728
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:19,121
- We fight suburban sprawl.
- What's suburban sprawl?

729
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,857
Ask Steven. He could have used a little
suburban sprawl in Sudan.

730
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,934
Excuse me, Dad?

731
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,798
Industry, houses,jobs,
restaurants, medicine--

732
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,839
You can preserve a lot of open spaces
and have jobs for people with--

733
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,374
- I beg your pardon, Albert. I wasn't finished.
- Sorry, sir.

734
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,343
Clothes, videos, toys, cheeseburgers, cars,
a functioning economy.

735
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,542
You can still have a functioning economy and
preserve open spaces with a little planning.

736
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,551
- Yeah.
- Socialism. Complete disaster.

737
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,451
- Theodore Roosevelt was a socialist? And Yeats?
- Theodore Roosevelt--

738
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,390
Henry David Thoreau, Robinson Jeffers,
the National Geographic Society, all socialists?

739
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,462
-You're talking about socialism.
-No, I'm not. I'm talking about...

740
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,054
not covering every square inch
with houses and strip malls...

741
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,566
until you can't remember what happens
when you stand in a meadow at dusk.

742
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,160
- What happens in the meadow at dusk?
- Everything.

743
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,239
- Nothing!
- Everything!

744
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,365
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

745
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,535
i work for an electrical
engineering fÝrm, son.

746
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,840
We do a lot of commercial
and residential contracts.

747
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,006
If development stops,
so does my paycheck.

748
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,381
Then Steven couldn't be here as our guest,
could he? So your ideas hurt Steven.

749
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,647
I'm not hurting Steven.
That's an outrageous accusation.

750
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,918
- Don't use that tone of voice in my house.
- I think you started that tone.

751
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,654
And I think it's entirely possible for your
engineering firm to have jobs for people...

752
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,322
preserve open spaces,
have contracts, do the--

753
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:30,668
[ Boy Laughs ]
Whoa.

754
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,999
[ Boy Laughs ]
Whoa.

755
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:35,162
- What's he doing?
- Why's he closing his eyes?

756
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,833
[ Whispering ]
Cricket, I don't know.

757
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,410
- Do you have a job, Tom?
- I'm a firefighter.

758
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,707
Oh, God bless you. A hero.

759
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:47,910
I'm not a hero. We'd all be heroes if we
quit using petroleum though.

760
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,181
- Excuse me?
- Say you're Christians living
byJesus' principles. Are you?

761
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,587
Jesus is never mad at us if we
live with him in our hearts.

762
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,684
I hate to break it to you, but he is.
He most definitely is.

763
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:01,856
All right. That's enough. Steven, I don't know
what this is about. Why they're here--

764
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:06,959
- Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Dad. I did not know.
- Stevo, I'm so disappointed.

765
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,936
It's all right.
Look, he's sad. He's sad.

766
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,564
i'm sorry, Stevo.
My bad. You didn't know.

767
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,303
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- i should be what?

768
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,608
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Why should I be ashamed?

769
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,706
- You're a hypocrite.
- i'm a what?

770
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,752
You're misleading these children.
'Cause you're the destroyer, man.

771
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,447
- How am I the destroyer?
- i saw that S.U. V. out there.

772
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,253
My car's the destroyer? You wanna know
how many miles per gallon I get?

773
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,793
Steven, I need to ask a question.
It's why I came here.

774
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,886
Why are autographs
so important to you?

775
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,557
It is a pastime with this family
which they have taught me.

776
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,500
- Which I can now carry on.
- [ Woman ] it's just for fun.

777
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,128
- [ Game Beeping ]
- For entertainment.
No games at the table, please.

778
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,400
Yes. 260. And I've reached
the omega level.

779
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,567
[ Tommy ]
Destroyer. Destroyer. Destroyer.

780
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:50,477
God gave us oil.! He gave it to us.!
How can God's gift be bad?

781
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,448
He gave you a brain too
and you messed that up pretty good--

782
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,280
I want you sons of bitches
out of my house now.

783
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,253
If Hitler were alive, he'd tell you
not to think about oil.

784
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,916
You're the Hitler! We took a Sudanese
refugee into our home!

785
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,357
You did. But how did
Sudan happen, ma'am?

786
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,588
Could it possibly be related
to dictatorships...

787
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,688
that we support
for some stupid reason?

788
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:13,293
- You shut up! You get out.
- You shut up. Come on. Let's get out of here.

789
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:17,499
- Later, Steve.
- God bless you.

790
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,778
- Wow.
- What's going on in there?

791
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,713
- Crazy.
- I can't believe them.

792
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:27,875
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, Christ.

793
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,682
[ Albert ] You guys get anything good
in there? You didn't, did you?

794
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,553
You hesitated over the mention of a cat.
What does that mean?

795
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,059
- It means nothing.Just like my coincidence.
- Cat seemed to hit a nerve.

796
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,188
Yeah, I had a cat once.
You caught me. You're amazing.

797
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,994
The method worked. I saw it.
It seemed to calm you down, right?

798
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,228
What method?
Come on with that method.

799
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,395
That's a tranquilizer
so people don't get pissed...

800
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,030
about the painful,
ugly truth--you know it.

801
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,167
No, Tommy. It penetrates a unified
infinity of everything.

802
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,007
We're not in infinity.
We're in the suburbs.

803
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,479
Infinity is everywhere.
That's what makes it infinity.

804
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,210
Okay, how does this connect?
Mr. Nimieri's an orphan from Sudan...

805
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,309
who was chased by
soldiers and crocodiles.

806
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,355
- How does the love glow fit into that, man?
- It's connected.

807
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:10,187
Albert and Mr. Nimieri
share a great deal. It's just that--

808
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:13,422
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- [ Vivian ] What's she doing here?

809
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,828
[ Tommy ]
That's Caterine.

810
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,493
- This is worse than I thought.
- Oh, it's much worse.

811
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:23,062
The meeting's going down
at Huckabees right now. Let's go.

812
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,836
- [ Clamoring ]
- Hey, everybody. Calm down.

813
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,935
The national office
recognizes the charter.

814
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:32,345
We're here today to give
the director a chance to even the keel.

815
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,350
- So just give him a break.
- Thank you, Orrin.

816
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,444
- Okay, first director now. Silence.
- Excuse me.

817
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,422
First, I would like to apologize
for my part of the fight...

818
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,790
that I had with Brad Stand
a little while ago over the poems...

819
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,227
that did not go out
with the Shania mailing.

820
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,767
- Where's Brad?
- Brad. Brad. Brad. It's all Brad, Brad.

821
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,859
The big benefit's
coming up with Brad...

822
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,632
and Brad's running it
and it's going to go great.

823
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,731
So, look, we're overlooking
our core issues.

824
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,868
- [ Woman ] Brad is not here.
- So to get us back on track...

825
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,209
I have a new poem
I'd like to read.

826
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,612
[ Angela ] Point of order, please.
Apoint of order.

827
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,778
I want to discuss this strategy of poems,
which are getting us nowhere.

828
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,085
Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.
Poems are amazing, okay?

829
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,557
They will help you
and your mind transform.

830
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,753
[ Angela ]
Who the hell are you?

831
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,262
I'm with Albert.
It will help you...

832
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,663
to transform your mind
into thinking differently.

833
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,430
- You guys need this, okay? This is great.
- Where's Brad?

834
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,971
This is called
''An Open Meadow. ''

835
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,405
''An open meadow,
an open marsh in a cloudless sky.

836
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,500
- [ Girl ] Boring.
- A crane flies.''

837
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:38,069
- Oh, Brad's here.!
- [ Brad ] Look what i got you, MaryJane.

838
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,308
- Oh, is that for my grandson?
- It most certainly is.

839
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,681
I'm talking here.
Come on. Shit.

840
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,845
You know what?
Let me just finish reading my poem...

841
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,855
and then we'll review
our strategy, okay?

842
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,152
- Good job, Albert.
- Can it be taped?

843
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,160
Excuse me, Brad. I would like to finish
reading my poem, please. Thank you.

844
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,254
- Relax. Not doing your poem.
- Don't give me the relax thing, Brad.

845
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,266
Let him read the poem, man.
He was in the middle of it.

846
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:02,532
That man is not in our coalition. He has
no right to be here and no right to speak.

847
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,665
No, ma'am, I'm not a member,
but I am a local firefighter.

848
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,438
He's a great firefighter
and exactly who we want on our side.

849
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,275
I don't know who these men are.
They're not members of our coalition.

850
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,374
They're working on the benefit.
They're bringing a lot of support for our cause.

851
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,385
- Conflict is an illusion.
- Shut up, Brad.

852
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:19,887
Hey, Albert, that's not
the way a director behaves.

853
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:24,051
Why are you guys wasting all
your time fÝghting each other?

854
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:28,188
I mean, come on. Serious.
Put the egos aside for a second, guys, please.

855
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:32,291
Deal with this issues, okay. We have a deadly

Well, look what happened.

They betrayed you,
as he did.

There's an overpopulation problem.

1141
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,218
- [ Bernard ] Whoa.
- [ Gasps ]

1142
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,685
- That came out of left field.
- All right.

1143
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:03,122
Why is having children the ultimate
performance for successful people? Why?

1144
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,989
Well, it doesn't have
to be a performance.

1145
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,359
You know, we don't
have to have kids.

1146
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,331
We could just, you know,
think about it, or not.

1147
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,460
Could just be ourselves,
Jet Skiing, whatever.

1148
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,538
This is not why
I hired you.

1149
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,608
Then why did you
hire them?

1150
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,745
- Well, I have a meeting.
- [ Doorbell Ringing ]

Oh. There it is.

[ Door Opening, Closing ]

- [ Dawn ] Would you like some tea?
- [ Bernard ] With a little lemon.

1154
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:46,161
So, I've never really done
anything like this before.

1155
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,760
Um, where--
where would we start?

1156
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,650
Now. Now.

- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

1158
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,397
I did. I felt it.

1159
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,264
It's hard to describe.

1160

Very, very good.
Your turn.

1161

[ Sighs ]
Now.

1162
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,012
- Not so hard.
- Sorry.

1163
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,982
Now. Now. Now.

1164
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,054
Now!

Did you get it?

1166
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,497
Yeah, you stop thinking.

1167
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:55,433
Yes.
It's fantastic.

1168
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,268
It's like I'm here,
but I'm not--

1169
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:00,968
So, I'm not here.
It-It's just--

1170
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,307
I-- I-- I don't know.
Do it one more time.

1171
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,354
It's like I'm a rock
or a dish of mold.

1172
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:16,084
I'm whatever else is around.
So I'm free to just exist.

1173
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,025
This is the answer.
We just have to be this all day, every day.

1174
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,596
- That's the answer.
- Yes.

1175
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,188
- Do it again. Do it again.
- Now.

1176
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,873
Careful, my young students...

1177
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:33,965
you cannot stay
in this state all day.

1178
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,044
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

1179
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:39,046
It is inevitable that you are
drawn back into human drama.

1180
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,844
Desire, suffering-- everything that exists
in this imperfect world.

1181
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,819
- Shit.
- So we get drawn back into human drama...

1182
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,889
and how important
we think that is.

1183
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,550
Then we do crazy stuff.
We have to go back to the ball...

1184
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:54,151
so we can get the freedom
of being like a-- like a dish of mold.

1185
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,561
Yes. And then back
to the drama, the suffering.

1186
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,396
- It's kind of a crappy deal.
- C'est exactement ça.

1187
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,971
An absurd theatrical
we must play out, back and forth...

1188
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,506
from pure being
to human suffering.

1189
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,736
But isn't the drama and suffering less
if we do the ball thing every day?

1190
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:12,245
Don't call it ''the ball thing.''
Call it ''pure being.''

1191
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:15,146
Doesn't the pure being, ball thing
make the day-to-day suffering easier?

1192
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:16,980
- Yeah.
- No, it doesn't.

1193
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,418
You're wrong. We're gonna
do this every day.

1194

- We'll show you. It'll make it easier.
- I'll prove it to you.

1195
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:25,685
Human drama
is inevitable.

1196
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:28,194
Suffering cannot be diminished.
You cannot escape, Tommy.

1197
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,731
You'll see.
Existence is a cruel joke...

1198
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,824
that entices in a form
of desire.

1199

- Absurd theater of desire.
- I know, buddy, it hurts. It's painful.

- Wait here.
- Where you goin'?

on desire and suffering.

We've talked about your intimacy problem.
What's the core of it?

Intimacy is combo
of infinites.

I'm definitely gonna have an intimacy problem
with you if you keep dressing like that.

- She did it, Brad.

- [ Car Starting ]
- Yes, I did.

1570
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:49,596
That fire was
a bitch-ass thing to do.

1571
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:51,665
No, it liberated you
from the Brad.

1572
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,326
Or did it bond me to Brad
in the insanity of pain...

1573
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:56,630
until I saw that
I'm Brad and he's me?

- [ Vivian ] Yes.
- No.

1575
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:01,340
Come on.
You guys work together, don't you?

1576
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:04,673
- We don't work together at all.
- Really? It's not like some secret deal...

1577
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,441
where she picks up where you leave off,
and then we come back to you?

1578
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:11,006
- There is no secret deal.
- Well, there should be,
'cause that's the way it works.

1579
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:14,110
You're too dark, and you're not dark enough.
You three were close, right?

1580
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:17,156
Maybe too close. Then it went sour
and propelled you into one extreme...

1581
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:19,249
and you into
another extreme.

1582
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,454
So, voila! Two overlapping,
fractured philosophies...

01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,656
were born out of
that one pain.

And he almost died
'cause he cares about the same things.

- Well, the interconnection
thing is definitely for real.

But it's also
nothing special.

Yeah, because it grows from
the manure of human trouble.

You see, the detectives,
they just wanted to gloss right over that.

But in fact,
no manure, no magic.

is closed.

- Do you want to come?
- What time?

Mm, 1 :00, 1 :30.
