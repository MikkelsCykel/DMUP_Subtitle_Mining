<i>Mutation: it is the key to our evolution.</i>

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,358
<i>lt has enabled us to evolve</i>
<i>into the dominant species on the planet.</i>

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,837
<i>This process normally takes</i>
<i>thousands and thousands of years.</i>

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,192
<i>But every few hundred millennia,</i>
<i>evolution leaps forward.</i>

5
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,511
Niagara Falls,

6
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,790
up the Canadian Rockies,

7
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,708
and then it's only
a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

8
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,515
- Won't it kinda be cold?
- Well, that's the point, stupid.

9
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,552
Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure.

10
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,353
And when are you gonna do this?

11
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,993
l don't know.

12
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,351
After high school. Before college.

13
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,830
- Marie!
- l don't know what happened.

14
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,714
- David?
- l don't know... l just touched him.

15
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,673
- l didn't mean...
- Call an ambulance!

16
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,598
We only touched. Just get away from me!

17
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,996
- Will you call an ambulance?!
- Don't touch me!

18
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,717
We are now seeing the beginnings
of another stage of human evolution.

19
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,153
These mutations manifest at puberty, often
triggered by periods of emotional stress.

20
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,431
Thank you, Miss Grey.
lt was quite educational.

21
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,712
However, it fails to address the issue
that is the focus of this hearing.

22
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,435
Three words: are mutants dangerous?

23
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,078
That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong
person driving a car can be dangerous.

24
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,749
- We do license people to drive.
- Yes, but not to live.

25
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,355
Senator, mutants who've come forward
and revealed themselves publicly

26
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,916
have been met with fear,
hostility, even violence.

27
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,395
lt is because of that hostility

28
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,559
that l am urging the Senate
to vote against mutant registration.

29
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,911
- To force mutants to expose themselves...
- Expose themselves?

30
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,556
What do mutants have to hide that makes
them so afraid to identify themselves?

31
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,719
- l didn't say they were hiding.
- Let me show you what is being hidden.

32
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,358
l have here a list of names of identified
mutants living right here in the United States.

33
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,109
- Senator Kelly...
- A girl in lllinois who walks through walls.

34
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,631
What's to stop her from walking
into a bank vault? Or into the White House?

35
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,914
Or into <i>their</i> houses? And there are even
rumours of mutants so powerful

36
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,077
that they can enter our minds
and control our thoughts,

37
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,555
taking away our God-given free will.

38
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,196
The American people deserve the right
to decide whether they want their children

39
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,154
to be in school with mutants.
To be taught by mutants.

40
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth is that mutants are very real.

41
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,512
And they are among us.
We must know who they are,

42
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,519
and, above all,
we must know what they can do.

43
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,316
Eric.

44
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,556
What are you doing here?

45
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,753
Why do you ask questions to which
you already know the answers?

46
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,032
- Don't give up on them, Eric.
- What would you have me do, Charles?

47
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,436
l've heard these arguments before.

48
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,599
lt was a long time ago.
Mankind has evolved since then.

49
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,157
Yes... into us.

50
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,672
Are you sneaking around in here, Charles?
Whatever are you looking for?

51
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,711
l'm looking for hope.

52
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,830
l will bring you hope, old friend.
And l ask only one thing in return.

53
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,115
Don't get in my way.

54
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,753
We are the future, Charles, not them!
They no longer matter.

55
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,276
This is it.

56
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,117
Where are we? l thought you said you were
gonna take me as far as Laughlin City.

57
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,196
This <i>is</i> Laughlin City.

58
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,031
Gentlemen, in all my years
l've never seen anything like this.

59
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,912
Are you gonna let this man
walk away with your money?

60
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,314
No!

61
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,159
l'll fight him!

62
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,400
Ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,476
our saviour!

64
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,950
Don't hit him in the balls.

65
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,312
- You said anything goes.
- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

66
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,478
You idiot!

67
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,437
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight's winner and still King of the Cage,

68
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,790
the Wolverine.

69
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,310
You want something new, honey?
Or are you sticking with water?

70
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,916
l'll have a beer.

71
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,119
<i>Ellis lsland, once the arrival point</i>
<i>for American immigrants,</i>

72
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,276
<i>is opening its doors again.</i>

73
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,313
<i>Preparations are nearly completed</i>
<i>for the United Nations World Summit.</i>

74
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,959
<i>The event promises to be the largest</i>
<i>single gathering of world leaders in history.</i>

75
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,279
<i>Leaders will discuss issues ranging from</i>
<i>the world's economy and weapons treaties,</i>

76
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,678
<i>to the mutant phenomenon</i>
<i>and its impact on our world stage.</i>

77
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,395
<i>American legislators contend</i>
<i>that debate over mutant issues</i>

78
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,719
<i>should be the primary focus of what is,</i>
<i>on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair.</i>

79
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,628
- You owe me some money.
- Stu, let's not do this.

80
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,435
No man takes a beating like that
without a mark to show for it.

81
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,791
- Come on, this isn't worth it.
- l know what you are.

82
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,675
You lost your money.
You keep this up, you lose something else.

83
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,236
Look out!

84
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,470
Get outta my bar, freak!

85
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,032
- What the hell are you doin'?
- l'm sorry. l needed a ride.

86
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,596
- l thought you might help me.
- Get out!

87
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,470
- Where am l supposed to go?
- l don't know.

88
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,717
- You don't know or you don't care?
- Pick one.

89
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,512
- l saved your life!
- No, you didn't.

90
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,077
You don't have anything to eat, do you?

91
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,676
l'm Rogue.

92
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,679
Were you in the army?
Doesn't that mean you were in the army?

93
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,434
- Wow!
- What?

94
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,832
- Suddenly <i>my</i> life isn't bad.
- lf you prefer the road...

95
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,236
No! lt looks great.

96
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
lt looks cosy.

97
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,197
Put your hands on the heater.

98
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,392
- l'm not gonna hurt you, kid.
- lt's nothing personal.

99
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,751
lt's just when people touch my skin,
something happens.

100
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,632
What?

101
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,320
l don't know. They just get hurt.

102
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,755
Fair enough.

103
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,518
When they come out, does it hurt?

104
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,995
Every time.

105
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,788
So what kind of a name is Rogue?

106
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,230
l don't know.
What kind of a name is Wolverine?

107
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,190
My name's Logan.

108
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,710
Marie.

109
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,713
- You should wear your seat belt.
- Look, kid, l don't need advice on...

110
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,508
You all right?

111
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,677
- Kid, are you all right?
- l'm stuck!

112
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,949
Weren't you supposed to bring
someone back with you?

113
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,076
- What happened?
- They knew.

114
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,398
Charles...

115
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,189
- Where is the mutant now?
- With them.

116
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,078
l have made the first move.
That is all they know.

117
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,797
Come, the UN summit is approaching.
Time for our little test.

118
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,109
Where's he going?

119
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,800
Where are you going?

120
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,396
Over here!

121
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,988
- Where are you going?
- This way!

122
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,076
He's over there.

123
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,350
Let go! What's your hurry?

124
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,276
Over here!

125
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,189
Good morning, Logan.

126
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,950
So, l'd like your definitions of weak and
strong anthropic principles on Wednesday.

127
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,036
That'll be all.

128
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,510
- Bye, Professor.
- Bye, Kitty.

129
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,836
Physics.

130
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,272
l'm Charles Xavier.
Would you like some breakfast?

131
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,994
- Where am l?
- Westchester, New York.

132
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,754
You were attacked. My people
brought you here for medical attention.

133
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,839
- l don't need medical attention.
- Yes, of course.

134
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,794
- Where's the girl?
- Rogue's here. She's fine.

135
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,036
Really?

136
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,155
Ah. Logan, l'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe,
also called Storm.

137
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,238
This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.

138
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,515
They saved your life.

139
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,196
l believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey.

140
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,235
You're in my school for the gifted. For
mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto.

141
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,352
- What's a magneto?
- A very powerful mutant,

142
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,029
who believes a war is brewing
between mutants and the rest of humanity.

143
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,799
l've been following his activities
for some time.

144
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,356
The man who attacked you
is an associate of his called Sabretooth.

145
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,198
Sabretooth?

146
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,754
Storm.

147
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,433
What do they call you? Wheels?

148
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,310
This is the stupidest thing l've ever heard.

149
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,273
And Cyclops, right?

150
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,755
You wanna get outta my way?

151
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,997
Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it?

152
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,757
Living from day to day,
moving from place to place,

153
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,599
with no memory of who or what you are.

154
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,950
Shut up!

155
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,029
Give me a chance.
l may be able to help you find some answers.

156
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,517
- How do you know?
- You're not the only one with gifts.

157
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,870
- Where are you going?
- Where's he going?

158
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,956
Over here!

159
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,753
What is this place?

160
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,117
Anonymity is a mutant's first defence
against the world's hostility.

161
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,196
Hey, no powers!

162
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,232
To the public, we're merely
a school for gifted youngsters.

163
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,069
Cyclops, Storm and Jean
were some of my first students.

164
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,875
l protected them,
taught them to control their powers

165
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,436
and, in time, teach others to do the same.

166
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,795
The students are mostly runaways -
frightened, alone.

167
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,675
Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger
to themselves and those around them.

168
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,438
Like your friend Rogue.

169
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,156
lncapable of physical human contact,
probably for the rest of her life.

170
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,195
And yet here she is with others her own age,
learning, being accepted,

171
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,276
not feared.

172
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,749
- John!
- Sorry.

173
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,875
l'm Bobby.

174
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,195
- What's your name?
- Rogue.

175
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,073
- What'll happen to her?
- That's up to her.

176
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,079
Rejoin the world as an educated
young woman, or stay on to teach others.

177
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,829
To become what the children
have affectionately called ''X-Men''.

178
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,235
Welcome to Mutant High.

179
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,238
But the school is merely our public face.

180
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,751
The lower levels, however,
are an entirely different matter.

181
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,557
When l was a boy l discovered l had
the power to control people's minds.

182
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,194
Make them think or do whatever l wanted.

183
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,233
When l was 17
l met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

184
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,912
He, too, had an unusual power. He could
create magnetic fields and control metal.

185
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,797
Believing that humanity would never
accept us, he grew angry and vengeful.

186
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
He became Magneto.

187
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,230
There are mutants out there
with incredible powers, Logan.

188
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,636
And many who do not share
my respect for mankind.

189
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,799
lf no one is equipped to oppose them,
humanity's days could be over.

190
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,990
l'll make a deal with you.

191
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,033
Give me 48 hours to find out
what Magneto wants with you,

192
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,913
and l give you my word
that l will use all my power

193
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,068
to help you piece together what you've lost,
and what you're looking for.

194
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,471
Senator, you favour gun registration, yes?
Some of these so-called children

195
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,310
possess more than 10 times
the destructive force of any handgun.

196
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,513
No, l don't see a difference.
All l see are weapons in our schools.

197
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,393
Well, that's fair enough. All right.

198
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,272
So?

199
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,836
lt's gonna be close.
A vote this loaded is always close.

200
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,997
What about the UN summit?
The world will be watching.

201
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,352
- Maybe you could use it to your advantage.
- We're Americans, Henry.

202
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,950
Let the rest of the damn world
deal with mutants in their own way.

203
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,117
You know this situation? These mutants?

204
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,633
People like this Jean Grey?
lf it were up to me, l'd lock 'em all away.

205
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,270
lt's a war.

206
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,392
lt's the reason people like me exist.

207
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,670
Where the hell are we?

208
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,077
Pilot!

209
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,316
People like you are the reason
l was afraid to go to school as a child.

210
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,276
l'm sorry.

211
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,073
- For what?
- lf l hurt you.

212
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,994
So... couldn't wait
to get my shirt off again, huh?

213
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,719
The metal is an alloy called adamantium.

214
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,278
Supposedly indestructible. lt's been
surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

215
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,472
How could he have survived
a procedure like that?

216
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,597
His mutation. He has uncharted regenerative
capability which enables him to heal rapidly.

217
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,996
This also makes his age
impossible to determine.

218
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,749
He could very well be older than you,
Professor.

219
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,599
- Who did this to him?
- He doesn't know.

220
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,996
Nor does he remember anything
about his life before it happened.

221
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,591
Experimentation on mutants.
lt's not unheard of.

222
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,238
But l've never seen anything like this before.

223
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,669
What do you think Magneto want with him?

224
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,349
l'm not entirely sure it's him Magneto wants.

225
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,792
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

226
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,876
Just like you.

227
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,110
Who are you people? Where's Henry?

228
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,835
Mr Guyrich has been dead
for some time, Senator.

229
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,511
But l've had Mystique here keep you
company. She takes so many shapes.

230
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,837
Whatever you do to me, you'll make me right.

231
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,669
Every word l've spoken will be confirmed.

232
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,600
Are you a God-fearing man, Senator?
lt's such a strange phrase.

233
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,598
l've always thought of God as a teacher.

234
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,156
As a bringer of light,
wisdom and understanding.

235
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,273
You see,
l think what you really are afraid of is me.

236
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,518
Me and my kind.
The brotherhood of mutants.

237
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,589
lt's not so surprising, really. Mankind has
always feared what it doesn't understand.

238
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,194
Well, don't fear God, Senator,
and certainly don't fear me.

239
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,836
Not any more.

240
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,276
- What do you intend to do to me?
- Let's just say God works too slowly.

241
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,188
l think you'll be comfortable here.

242
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,074
- Where's your room?
- With Scott, down the hall.

243
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,078
ls that your gift? Putting up with that guy?

244
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,749
Actually l'm telekinetic.
l can move things with my mind.

245
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,838
Really? What kinds of things?

246
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,597
All kinds of things.

247
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,758
- l also have telepathic ability.
- Like your professor?

248
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,715
Nowhere near that powerful.
But he's teaching me to develop it.

249
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,796
l'm sure he is.

250
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,556
- So read my mind.
- l'd rather not.

251
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,912
- Come on. You afraid you might like it?
- l doubt it.

252
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,474
What do you see?

253
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,397
Scott!

254
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,076
Good night, Logan.

255
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,350
You gonna tell me
to stay away from your girl?

256
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,358
lf l had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl.

257
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,473
Then l guess you've got nothing
to worry about, do you... Cyclops?

258
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,674
lt mustjust burn you up
that a boy like me saved your life, huh?

259
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,270
You oughta be careful.
l might not be there next time.

260
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,836
Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl.

261
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,356
Logan?

262
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,752
Logan! Logan, wake up.

263
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,436
Help me!

264
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,233
Somebody, help!

265
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,836
Scott, grab a pillow.

266
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,634
lt was an accident.

267
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,519
- Logan?
- What happened?

268
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,031
- ls she all right?
- She'll be all right.

269
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,397
- What did she do to me?
- When Rogue touches someone,

270
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,159
she takes their energy, their life force.

271
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,556
ln the case of mutants,
she absorbs their gifts for a while.

272
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,114
ln your case, your ability to heal.

273
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,830
- lt felt like she almost killed me.
- lf she'd held out any longer, she could have.

274
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,036
How are we feeling, Senator?
Advanced, l hope.

275
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,995
What the hell have you done to me?

276
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,999
Senator, this is pointless.
Where would you go?

277
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,429
Who would take you in,
now you're one of us?

278
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,118
Tommy, let it go! Tommy, please let it go!

279
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,959
l'm telling Mommy.

280
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,400
ls that a mutant?

281
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,513
<i>..UN summit. With the leaders</i>
<i>of over 200 nations attending,</i>

282
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,918
<i>the Secret Service has transformed</i>
<i>Ellis lsland into a veritable Fort Knox</i>

283
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,478
<i>for tomorrow night's opening gala.</i>
<i>Ellis lsland rests less than one mile from...</i>

284
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,997
Rogue!

285
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,111
Bobby!

286
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,268
Rogue, what did you do? They say
you're stealing other mutants' powers.

287
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,356
No! l borrowed his power.

288
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,109
You never use your power
against another mutant.

289
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,116
l had no choice.

290
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,394
- No, you have to understand...
- lf l were you l'd get myself outta here.

291
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,113
- What do you mean?
- Listen, the students are freaked.

292
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,791
Professor Xavier's furious.
l don't know what he'll do with you.

293
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,753
l think it'll be easier on your own.

294
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,596
You should go.

295
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,953
What are you looking for, Eric? lt's strange.

296
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,790
There are more <i>powerful</i> mutants out there.
Why should this one be so important to him?

297
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,390
- Maybe it's his way with people.
- You don't like him.

298
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,990
- How could you tell?
- Well, l am psychic, you know.

299
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,198
- Where is she?
- Who?

300
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,595
Rogue.

301
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,119
She's gone.

302
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,795
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

303
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,756
Welcome to Cerebro.

304
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,714
This certainly is a big, round room.

305
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,071
The brain waves of mutants
are different from average humans.

306
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,194
This device amplifies my power, allowing me
to locate mutants across great distances.

307
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,757
- That's how l intend to find Rogue.
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto?

308
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,271
l've been trying, but he's found
some way to shield himself from it.

309
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,392
How would he know how to do that?

310
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,829
Because he helped me build it.

311
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,110
Now if you'll excuse me...

312
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,956
Have you ever...?

313
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,036
Used Cerebro?

314
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,151
No.

315
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,400
lt takes a degree of control and...
for someone like me, it's...

316
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,999
Dangerous.

317
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,030
<i>..now boarding at track 4.</i>

318
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,676
- She's at the station.
- Where is it?

319
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,113
A few miles west of here. You can't leave the
mansion. lt's the opportunity Magneto needs.

320
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,789
- Listen, l'm the reason she took off.
- We had a deal.

321
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,593
She's all right. She's just upset.

322
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,998
Storm, Cyclops, find her.
See if you can talk to her.

323
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,918
- What?
- Where's my motorcycle?

324
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,238
Hey, kid.

325
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,995
l'm sorry about last night.

326
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,516
Me, too.

327
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,276
You running again?

328
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,194
l heard the professor was mad at me.

329
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,596
- Who told you that?
- A boy at school.

330
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,794
- When's the last time you saw her?
- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

331
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,029
You look around,
l'll check with the ticket agent.

332
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,875
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

333
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,433
- You think l should go back.
- l think you should follow your instincts.

334
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,273
The first boy l ever kissed
ended up in a coma for three weeks.

335
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,400
l can still feel him inside my head.

336
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,951
And it's the same with you.

337
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,674
There's not many people
that'll understand what you're going through.

338
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,837
But l think this guy Xavier's one of them.

339
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,392
He seems to genuinely wanna help you.

340
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,875
And that's a rare thing.

341
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,235
For people like us.

342
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,196
OK, so...

343
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,438
What do you say?
Give these geeks one more shot?

344
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,675
Come on, l'll take care of you.

345
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,160
- You promise?
- Yeah.

346
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,156
Yeah, l promise.

347
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,594
Come along now. l told you not to...

348
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,550
She's about 17, my height,

349
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,877
has brown hair and she...

350
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,279
Scream for me.

351
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,839
Quit playing around.

352
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,790
You must be Wolverine.

353
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,435
That remarkable metal doesn't run through
your entire body, does it?

354
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,992
Stop!

355
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,872
Stop it!

356
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,957
- What the hell do you want with me?
- You? My dear boy!

357
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,640
Whoever said l wanted <i>you</i>?

358
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,439
Young people!

359
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,274
<i>All right, hold it! Hold it right there.</i>

360
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,678
<i>Stay where you are.</i>
<i>Put your hands over your heads. Now!</i>

361
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,357
You Homo sapiens and your guns.

362
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,117
- That's enough, Eric.
- Let them go.

363
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,310
Why not come out where l can see you,
Charles?

364
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,395
What do you want her for?

365
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,318
Can't you read my mind?

366
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,475
What now? Save the girl?

367
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,279
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

368
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,190
Let them pass that law and they'll have you
in chains with a number on your forehead.

369
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,835
- lt won't be that way.
- Then kill me and find out.

370
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,349
No? Then release me.

371
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,910
Fine!

372
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,349
Care to press your luck, Charles?

373
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,435
l don't think l can stop them all.

374
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:09,475
Still unwilling to make sacrifices.
That's what makes you weak.

375
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,234
Goodbye, Charles.

376
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,273
- You said he wanted <i>me.</i>
- l made a terrible mistake.

377
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,110
His helmet was somehow designed
to block my telepathy.

378
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,516
Couldn't see what he was after
till it was too late.

379
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,631
- Where are you going?
- To find her.

380
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,672
- How?
- The traditional way: look.

381
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,512
- Logan, you can't do this alone.
- Who'll help me? You?

382
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,315
- So far, you've all done a bang-up job.
- Then help us. Fight <i>with</i> us.

383
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,193
Fight with you? Join the team? Be an X-Man?

384
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,959
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

385
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,799
The world is full of people
that hate and fear you

386
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,675
and you're wasting your time trying
to protect them. l got better things to do.

387
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,190
You know, Magneto's right.
There's a war coming.

388
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,074
- Are you sure you're on the right side?
- At least l've chosen a side.

389
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,909
l'm looking for Dr Jean Grey.

390
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,476
Senator Kelly.

391
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,880
l'm Professor Charles Xavier.

392
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,719
l was afraid if l went to hospital,
they would...

393
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,796
Treat you like a mutant?

394
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,552
We're not what you think. Not all of us.

395
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,271
Tell it to the ones who did this to me.

396
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,436
Senator...

397
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,315
l want you to try and relax.

398
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,675
l'm not going to hurt you.

399
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,036
Welcome to the future.

400
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,316
Brother.

401
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,753
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.

402
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,759
But the mutation is unnatural.
Kelly's body is rejecting it.

403
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,112
- His cells began to break down immediately.
- What effect does it have on mutants?

404
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,394
There appears to be none. But l fear
it will harm any normal person exposed to it.

405
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,195
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- l don't know.

406
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,871
Wait a second. You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto.

407
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,358
- And that it weakened him.
- Yes. ln fact, it nearly killed him.

408
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:21,109
He's going to transfer his power to Rogue
and use her to power the machine.

409
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,076
ls somebody there?

410
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,279
Yes. l'm here.

411
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,390
Please don't leave me!

412
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,270
l don't want to be alone.

413
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,236
All right.

414
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,554
Do you hate normal people?

415
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,476
Sometimes.

416
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,276
Why?

417
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,836
l suppose...

418
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,315
l'm afraid of them.

419
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,470
Well...

420
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:19,152
l think you've got one less person...
to be afraid of.

421
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,551
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.
l'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform.

422
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:48,513
Wait a minute.
He's not coming with us, is he?

423
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,110
- Yes.
- Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and...

424
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,152
l wasn't the one who gave the station
a new sunroof, pal.

425
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,999
No, you were the one
who stabbed Rogue in the chest.

426
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,112
Why don't you take your little mission
and stick it up...

427
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,595
Senator Kelly is dead.

428
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,311
l'm going to find her.

429
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,115
Settle this.

430
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,276
l'm sorry.

431
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,435
You can still hear me... can't you?

432
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,638
You've taught me everything in my life
that was ever worth knowing.

433
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,115
And if anything happens...

434
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,232
l'll take care of them.

435
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,033
Jean?

436
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,550
Jean!

437
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,875
No!

438
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,838
Jean?

439
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,916
Jean.

440
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,996
Answer me. Please.

441
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,390
l know where Magneto's going.

442
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,991
Magnificent, isn't she?

443
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,829
- l've seen it.
- l first saw her in 1949.

444
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,074
America was going to be
the land of tolerance. Of peace.

445
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,275
Are you going to kill me?

446
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,358
Yes.

447
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,268
- Why?
- Because there is no land of tolerance.

448
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,154
There is no peace, not here or anywhere else.

449
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,634
Whole families destroyed simply because
they were born different from those in power.

450
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,675
Well, after tonight,
the world's powerful will be just like us.

451
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:23,394
They will return home as brothers.

452
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,836
As mutants.

453
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,315
Our cause will be theirs.

454
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,357
Your sacrifice will mean our survival.

455
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,873
l'll understand
if that comes as small consolation.

456
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,636
Put her in the machine.

457
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,276
l'll raise it.

458
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,908
Magneto is here - Liberty lsland.

459
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:57,717
Presumably his objective is to mutate the
world leaders at the summit on Ellis lsland.

460
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,879
He doesn't know his machine kills,
and judging from what the professor saw

461
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,518
if Magneto gave Rogue enough power,
he could wipe out everyone in New York City.

462
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:11,155
All right. We can insert here
at the George Washington Bridge.

463
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,195
Come around the bank, just off of Manhattan,
land on the far side of Liberty lsland. Here.

464
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,390
What about harbour patrol? Radar?

465
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,229
lf they have anything that can pick up <i>our</i>jet,
they deserve to catch us.

466
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,993
You actually go outside in these things?

467
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,635
What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?

468
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,315
Whoa.

469
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,198
There's the bridge. l'm takin' her down.

470
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,796
Storm, some cover, please.

471
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,554
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp. We're not alone.

472
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,674
And you stay here. Once l've given my power
to the girl, l'll be temporarily weakened.

473
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,155
You'll be my only defence.

474
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,912
Sounds like a storm's comin'.

475
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,079
- Sorry.
- You call that a landing?

476
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,515
The torch.

477
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,914
<i>..the proceedings. The first dignitaries</i>
<i>started to arrive about an hour ago,</i>

478
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:06,828
<i>greeted with a garden-party atmosphere</i>
<i>designed to entertain them</i>

479
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,349
<i>as the others traversed the rigid security.</i>

480
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,480
- There's someone here.
- Where?

481
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,278
- l don't know. Keep your eye open.
- Logan...

482
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,591
Damn it!

483
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,313
- Anything?
- There's someone here. l just can't see 'em.

484
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,959
Wait!

485
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,836
Back up! Back up!

486
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,913
Jean!

487
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,588
Oh, God!

488
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,156
Don't move.

489
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,714
Don't you people ever die?

490
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,791
Do you know what happens to a toad
when it's struck by lightning?

491
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,436
The same thing
that happens to everything else.

492
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,715
Logan, is that you?

493
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,512
The other one ain't far away.

494
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,838
- Come on. We have to regroup.
- l know, but there's a problem.

495
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,349
You're not part of the group.

496
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,629
Hey, hey! lt's me.

497
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,115
- Prove it.
- You're a dick.

498
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,117
OK.

499
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,753
Hey!

500
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,312
- Everybody get out of here.
- What is it?

501
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,396
l can't move.

502
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,470
Ah, my brothers.

503
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:39,911
Welcome. And you, just point those claws
of yours in a safer direction.

504
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,350
You better close your eyes.

505
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,157
Storm, fry 'em.

506
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:07,277
A bolt of lightning into a huge copper
conductor. l thought you lived at a school.

507
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,233
For those of you not familiar
with the historical significance...

508
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,596
Mystique?

509
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:27,035
- Mystique!
- l've seen Senator Kelly.

510
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,998
So, the good senator survived his fall.
And the swim to shore.

511
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,588
He's become even more powerful
than l imagined.

512
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,234
- He's dead.
- lt's true.

513
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:42,319
l saw him die.
Like those people down there will die.

514
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,833
Are you sure you saw what you saw?

515
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:50,078
l would also like to thank the
President of the United States of America

516
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:55,672
for hosting this event under the lights
of the great city of New York.

517
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,548
Why do none of you understand
what l'm trying to do?

518
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,959
Those people down there control our fate
and the fate of every other mutant!

519
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,436
Well...

520
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,028
soon our fate will be theirs.

521
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,277
<i>Help! Please help me!</i>

522
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:27,319
You're so full of shit. lf you're really
so righteous, it'd be <i>you</i> in that thing.

523
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,756
Help! Somebody help me!

524
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,076
<i>Please!</i>

525
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:50,591
<i>Somebody please help me!</i>

526
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,236
Somebody! Help me...

527
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,230
Logan!

528
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,591
- l'm sorry, my dear.
- Don't do this.

529
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,476
This is mine.

530
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,876
You owe me a scream.

531
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:31,915
Hey, bub, l'm not finished with you yet.

532
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,034
- Jean.
- Scott, when l tell you, open your eyes.

533
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,115
- No!
- Trust me.

534
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,708
You drop something?

535
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,436
Now!

536
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,991
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

537
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,992
- Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it?
- The rings are moving too fast.

538
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,793
- Shoot it!
- l'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up?

539
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,037
- l can't control it like that.
- Then let me go.

540
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,509
lf l don't make it,
at least you can still blast the damn thing.

541
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:25,199
All right, do it!
Jean, use your power. Try to steady him.

542
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,716
Hang on to something.

543
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,560
Scott, wait!

544
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,955
- Jean, l have to!
- Just wait!

545
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,194
l have a shot.

546
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,117
l'm taking it.

547
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:41,075
Come on...

548
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,269
Hey, this one's alive. Let's get him outta here.

549
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:40,039
Welcome back. l knew you'd find your way.

550
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,116
l had you to guide me.

551
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,475
How did we do?

552
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,434
Oh, that tickles.

553
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,516
Hey.

554
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,312
Hey.

555
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,396
How are you feeling?

556
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,476
Fantastic.

557
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,148
That was a brave thing you did.

558
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,000
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

559
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:39,673
She's fine. She took on a few of your
more charming personality traits for a while.

560
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,915
But we lived through it.

561
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,914
l think she's a little taken with you.

562
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,352
Well, you can tell her
my heart belongs to someone else.

563
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,110
You know, you and l...

564
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,196
How's the professor?

565
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,190
He's good.

566
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,276
Good.

567
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,958
There's an abandoned military compound
at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies

568
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,039
close to where we found you.
There's not much left but...

569
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,515
you might find some answers.

570
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,434
- Thank you.
- Are you going to say goodbye to them?

571
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,917
<i>The Mutant Registration Act</i>
<i>lost its main proponent</i>

572

<i>with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly</i>

573

Son of a bitch.

- You running again?
- Not really.

l'll be back for this.

Doesn't it ever wake you in the night,

588
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,310
the feeling that someday they will pass
that foolish law, or one just like it,

589
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,476

lt does indeed.

592

What do you do when you wake up to that?

593

l feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who
comes to that school looking for trouble.

594

Why do you come here, Charles?

595
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:18,036
Why do you ask questions
to which you already know the answers?

Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope.

597

You know this plastic prison of theirs
won't hold me for ever.
