1
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,360
You went on the defensive too soon.

2
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
Ah, you gave too much ground.
A Musketeer would never do that.

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,400
A Musketeer doesn't fight his duels
after a morning of farm chores.

4
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,439
No, but they drink
and carouse all night.
So it's much the same thing.

5
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:12,439
Time to eat.
Don't fill his head with that.

6
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:15,839
D'Artagnan wishes to serve his king
as the bravest of Musketeers.

7
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,159
Well, I might have a drink
now and then.

8
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,679
Aren't we waiting
for Planchet?
Oh, I would,

9
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,279
- but my hunger won’t
- Riders coming.

10
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:32,638
Please join. There is not a lot,
but you’re welcome to share it.

11
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,998
You don't recognize me,
Gaston?

12
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:38,638
Not since you no longer
wear the colors of the King.

13
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,918
Are you the son?

14
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:45,558
You know your father was
quite a swordsman at one time.

15
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:48,038
- The best in Europe.
- Second best.

16
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,758
- He's second to no one.
- He is no one but a cripple.

17
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,077
Leave now.

18
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,997
Not without the taxes.
I’ve paid my taxes to the King.

19
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:01,037
Oh, that does the Church
no good at all.

20
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:03,557
Taxes for the King,
taxes for the Church,

21
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:06,437
taxes for the sheriff,
taxes for the mayor.

22
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,277
It's a wonder there is
anything left to eat.

23
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:11,757
Does it look like
I've struck gold here?

24
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:15,757
Such insolence...
from a thief.

25
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,596
- My father is not a thief.
- D'Artagnan! Please.

26
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:24,516
Listen to your mother,
and listen to me.

27
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:27,476
A man who does not pay his taxes
is no more than a thief.

28
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:30,436
- My father was a Musketeer.
- I know.

29
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:34,756
Planchet.
Not here.

30
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:37,716
I've heard otherwise.
You've heard wrong.

31
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:41,515
Not only a thief,
but also a liar.

32
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,554
I'm so sorry,
little D'Artagnan.

33
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:26,873
Planchet will take
care of you.

34
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:37,953
I do not hope to replace
your parents. No one can.

35
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,553
However,
I would like to help you
in becoming a man.

36
00:03:40,673 --> 00:03:43,273
It's a rather
tricky journey.

37
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:46,073
I will be your guide.

38
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,312
I want you to teach me
to become a Musketeer,

39
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,512
like you taught my father.

40
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:56,352
I will find that man
and kill him.

41
00:03:56,432 --> 00:04:00,712
Listen to me, D'Artagnan.
Listen to me carefully.

42
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:04,392
I didn't teach your father
how to kill. I taught him how to live.

43
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:08,912
I don't understand.
That's because you’re a boy.

44
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,792
You have always
had your father in you.

45
00:04:11,912 --> 00:04:14,511
I can see it in your eyes.

46
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,431
You will become a Musketeer.

47
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:19,631
A great one.
Understand...

48
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,711
it will not happen quickly,
and it will only happen if you listen.

49
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,391
If you teach me,
I will listen.

50
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,711
I'd be honored.

51
00:06:58,664 --> 00:07:01,864
Whoa. Whoa.

52
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:10,344
D’Artagnan, this place invites
one for bad food and worse company.

53
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:14,504
Oh, well, I just want
breakfast, not a new home.

54
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,662
You have money?
Yes.

55
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:48,102
- Who invited you?
- The space is free.

56
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,782
Move.
You're attracting flies.

57
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,182
Forgive my associate.
Strangers make him anxious.

58
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:02,782
What with the public running wild,
thieves and cutthroats around every bend--

59
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:05,021
I'll keep my eyes open.

60
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:14,501
Get out!
Go on, go away!

61
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:19,901
- Where are you going?
- Paris.

62
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:23,501
- Oh, what business takes you there?
- Mine.

63
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:08,536
Stop!

64
00:10:08,616 --> 00:10:10,576
Put down your sword
or he's dead.

65
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:16,096
This man is a moment from his
death if you don't put down your sword!

66
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,736
What do I care about
some old man?

67
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:22,216
I think you do care.

68
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,095
- Why did you come here?
- I wanted to watch.

69
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:28,055
- I will kill him!
- You'll be dead before you do.

70
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,815
Well, I'd love to see how
all of this turns out,

71
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,895
however I have
a long ride ahead of me.

72
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:39,655
You have an interesting fighting style.
Where did you acquire it?

73
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,735
Here and there.

74
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,614
Perhaps there.
Certainly not here.

75
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:49,694
When you bury Darcy, I wouldn't
be too concerned about a cross.

76
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:52,254
He was not a man
consumed by religion.

77
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:55,014
If you survive, don't try
these heroics in Paris.

78
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,974
You will not last the day.

79
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:59,734
When you pass the entrance,
would you send
six of my men back?

80
00:10:59,814 --> 00:11:03,614
- Six men?
- Well, that should be
enough, don’t you think?

81
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:09,453
He doesn't have men outside!
He's-- He's bluffing.

82
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:12,533
Let him go now.
He doesn't mean
much to me.

83
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:17,173
However, he is a friend
of the men outside.
They will not be merciful.

84
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,413
I see you have been
making friends again.

85
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,692
Why didn’t you do anything?
He was no match for you.

86
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:34,372
This was your test,
not mine.

87
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:39,932
Hyah!

88
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:51,412
Whoa!

89
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,331
Why are we stopping?

90
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,610
We are emissaries
from the King of Spain.

91
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,490
I have a document from
King Louis guaranteeing me
safe passage in France.

92
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,088
Whoa!

93
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:26,608
You said there were
always 50 or 60 men here
waiting to be assigned...

94
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:28,567
and that one
could mark this villa...

95
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,287
by the men outside
begging to call themselves
Musketeers.

96
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,247
by the men outside
begging to call themselves
Musketeers.

97
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,527
Things change.
Oh, thank you.

98
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:51,046
Hello?
Monsieur Revile?

99
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,686
- Your guard’s too low.
- Nothing wrong with my guard.

100
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:05,126
I'm looking for
Monsieur Revile.

101
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:07,406
He is not receiving visitors.

102
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:09,926
He will receive me.

103
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:16,005
Please forgive Aramis.
He's not at the peak
of civility this morning.

104
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,445
I'm civil as this stray deserves.
You have the courage
of wine for breakfast.

105
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,645
May we give Revile
a message?
You may give him this.

106
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:24,845
Just the name will do.

107
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:28,365
My father was a Musketeer.
Revile gave him this sword.

108
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:34,765
I'm Porthos.
This is Aramis.

109
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:38,284
- We, too, are Musketeers.
- You two? Musketeers?

110
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:41,524
- So much for civility.
- I'm sorry. It's just that I had no idea--

111
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:45,884
- Well, now is not the best time
to be a Musketeer.
- Or the child of a Musketeer.

112
00:14:46,004 --> 00:14:47,804
On the 12 of 'April,
just outside of Lyon,

113
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:50,124
the Spanish envoy and his escorts
were slaughtered.

114
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:51,724
The sword and tunic
of a Musketeer were found.

115
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,764
But who would believe
the Musketeers capable?

116
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,964
Cardinal Richelieu.
Or so he professes to.

117
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,884
The Musketeers
have been suspended.

118
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,803
Replaced by Richelieu's
own private guards.

119
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:05,283
And Revile, as our leader, has been, uh...
detained until there's a full inquiry.

120
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,643
Detained where?
In the Cardinal's jail.

121
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:10,243
We must get him
out of jail.
Well, that seems unlikely.

122
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:12,483
What of the King?
These are his Musketeers.

123
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:15,043
Surely he will want us
to free Revile.

124
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,763
- He will not meddle where
the Cardinal is--
- You have a loose tongue.

125
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,723
I'm hardly giving away
great secrets.

126
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,882
Perhaps one more secret.
The name of a place to stay.

127
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:25,962
Certainly.

128
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:41,602
Your guard's
too low.

129
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,121
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

130
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:54,721
It's been a lifetime
since my last confession.

131
00:15:56,601 --> 00:16:00,361
I have murdered,
plundered, raped.

132
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,321
Oh, and I have been...

133
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,521
uncharitable.
Don't make a mockery
of the Church.

134
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:07,401
- You sent for me.
- You've gone too far.

135
00:16:07,481 --> 00:16:12,240
I wish to scare the Spaniards.
Embarrass the King.

136
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,120
I want political tension,
not war.

137
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,200
Oh, the Spaniards were scared.
You could see it in their faces
just before they died.

138
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,880
And I'm certain King Louis
feels embarrassed.

139
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,960
Buckingham must be dealt with.
He is coming despite
what happened to the Spanish.

140
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,239
If the King makes peace with
the English, it will strengthen
his position with the people.

141
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,679
So, let me see,
how can I phrase this?

142
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,839
Without killing anyone,

143
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,679
make the King a fool
in Buckingham's eyes.

144
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:49,199
What if I absolutely
must kill someone?

145
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:51,439
Well, if you must, you must.

146
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:58,878
Whoa.

147
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:17,278
Three pistoles a week,
a week in advance and-- Oh.

148
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:22,397
It says you have no money
and that you are a man of honor...

149
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:24,317
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

150
00:17:24,397 --> 00:17:26,837
My niece, Francesca.
She's lovely.

151
00:17:26,957 --> 00:17:29,157
Not if you must live with her.

152
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:33,157
She thinks she's something
special because her mother
hemmed dresses for the Queen.

153
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:35,317
She sometimes
forgets her place.

154
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:40,317
Sorry, Francesca. Gout.
Puts me in a foul humor.
Show monsieur a room.

155
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:43,796
I have some
pressing book work.

156
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:48,276
Is he always like that?

157
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:51,676
No. He's never
apologized before.
Why do you stay?

158
00:17:54,476 --> 00:17:57,836
He is all the family I have.
I have nowhere else to go.

159
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:04,595
Do you wish
to see the room or not?

160
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:07,035
The room.
Yes. Yes, of course.

161
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:11,515
Ohh!

162
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:15,275
'Are you all right, Monsieur?
That stair moved
at the last moment.

163
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:18,475
Stairs can do that.
Do you have a name?
A name?

164
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,075
Yes, of course.
Uh, D'Artagnan.

165
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:26,195
Are you certain?
Not if you don't like it.

166
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,794
It wasn't always like this.
Once we were filled
with would-be Musketeers.

167
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:33,354
What happened?
They kept getting killed.

168
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,434
This is the best room.

169
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:38,594
This is the best room?

170
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,834
Well, actually,
it's the only room.

171
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:49,514
You're beautiful.
I'm sorry. It just came out.

172
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:51,873
I've embarrassed you.
No.

173
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:55,553
Does every man tell you
you're beautiful?
Yes.

174
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,673
Will there be anything else?

175
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:02,273
- Did the ceiling move?
- I need a place
for my horses and coach.

176
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:06,193
Around the back.
I'm sure you'll be able to find it
if you don't kill yourself.

177
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,473
Nothing like this.
They're far fussier than I am.

178
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:20,632
Hallways are here,
and cells are down here.

179
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,912
Do you know the jail so well
from the time you spent there?

180
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:26,112
This is not the first time
a Musketeer needed rescuing.

181
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,872
Something amuses you?
This coach, for one.

182
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:37,791
And those pathetic horses,
for another.
Not to mention your clothes.

183
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:40,511
You see,
everyone is rude here.

184
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:42,431
Paris is the rudeness
capital of the world.

185
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:46,871
- Move this trash.
- Not until you apologize
to my horses.

186
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:51,951
Apologize to your horses?

187
00:19:58,151 --> 00:20:01,070
They're very sensitive.
You've hurt their feelings.

188
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,110
Be thankful that's all
we do. Now move.

189
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,670
You really don't
seem to understand.

190
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,590
I can't leave
until you apologize
to my horses.

191
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,790
Do you know who we are?

192
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,870
No. Do you know
who I am? Good.
No.

193
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,509
In their hearts,
I believe they wanted
to apologize.

194
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:28,109
For a moment, I thought
you planned to talk them
into unconsciousness.

195
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,389
Ow!
Ohh!

196
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,908
- You!
- Me?

197
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:51,068
A Cardinal's Guard.
I said he was spying--

198
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:52,988
If I were
a Cardinal's Guard,
you'd be dead.

199
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:56,188
And so would you.
Perhaps.

200
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:58,268
For certain.

201
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:01,188
Standing like this,
we're likely to attract
some attention.

202
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:04,028
What do you suggest?
That you trust me.

203
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:07,548
A stranger?
Dressed as a Cardinal's Guard?

204
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,227
You're not in
the spirit of this, are you?

205
00:21:16,347 --> 00:21:19,107
What are you doing here?
Freeing Treville.

206
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:23,747
How? Trade a barrel of wine for him?

207
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,027
You'll be outnumbered
15 to 1.
Or 15 to 3.

208
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,387
We're drunks, not fools.

209
00:21:32,506 --> 00:21:35,466
Why risk your life?
You're not one of us.

210
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,426
From what I've seen,
I'm more a Musketeer
than either of you.

211
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,465
- Yes?
- Wine from the Cardinal.

212
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:04,185
The Cardinal?
Yes.

213
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,225
Leave it.

214
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:11,865
- Who was it?
- Someone delivering wine...
from the Cardinal.

215
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:14,225
A gift from the Cardinal?

216
00:22:16,145 --> 00:22:19,424
Don't open it!

217
00:22:47,903 --> 00:22:49,863
Well, we wanted to see
how good you are.

218
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:51,983
And?
You're quite good.

219
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:58,223
You're gonna need
to be better.

220
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:00,583
Revile?
Here! Over here!

221
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:02,983
The keys.

222
00:23:04,742 --> 00:23:06,582
Which key?
Guess.

223
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:09,902
It is in your interest
to provide a hint.
If I guess wrong,

224
00:23:09,982 --> 00:23:11,862
Monsieur Treville
will slice your throat.

225
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:14,022
I couldn't bear the guilt.

226
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,182
The black one.
Wise choice.

227
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,701
- Whoa!
- Planchet. My old friend.

228
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:34,501
- You are too old for this.
- No, we are too old for this.

229
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:49,261
If you are with Planchet,

230
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:53,540
- then you must be--
- D'Artagnan, sir.

231
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,700
'At your service.
D'Artagnan.

232
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,820
Aw, home sweet home.

233
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,619
Forced into hiding.
Is this any better
than prison?

234
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:17,499
Well, the food will be.
D'Artagnan,

235
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:22,219
I'm afraid you have joined us
at not a very propitious time.

236
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:27,059
It was my timing.
Well, then, old friend,

237
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,419
you have brought him to us
when we're not at our best.

238
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,619
No, I brought him
when he was most needed.

239
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:38,178
Oh, yes. I can see how
D'Artagnan's arrival signals
an end to all our problems.

240
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:44,018
Well, we can at least drink
to this evening's work.

241
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,778
And if they come
to take you again?

242
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:51,058
Then I shall go
and see the King in person...

243
00:24:51,178 --> 00:24:54,218
and not rot
in the Cardinal's jail.

244
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:56,178
To a job well done.

245
00:24:56,258 --> 00:25:00,537
We have our own toast.
D'Artagnan, draw your sword.

246
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:07,977
All for one,
and one for all.

247
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:22,897
Porthos, who is this
pretty young thing?

248
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:24,856
He's a bit tender
for you, Josephine.

249
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:28,296
Oh, they can
never start too early.
Is that not right, Aramis?

250
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,296
Perhaps later.
You both know her?

251
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,816
Yes. Well, she knows many
of the men in this room.
No.

252
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:34,976
Many of the men in Paris.

253
00:25:35,096 --> 00:25:39,096
You fight amongst yourselves?
Oh, a man has to fight
with someone.

254
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:42,096
Silence!
Quiet!

255
00:25:42,216 --> 00:25:45,456
Silence, please!
Please, quiet!

256
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:52,615
Thank you.
I have an introduction
to make.

257
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,535
Men, please!

258
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,335
It's the introduction
of Monsieur D'Artagnan!

259
00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:01,095
His father served
as a Musketeer,

260
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:03,455
and D'Artagnan
wishes to join us.

261
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:07,095
But can he hold his liquor?
Doesn't he know we don't exist?

262
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:09,095
We're going to work
for the Cardinal.

263
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:12,374
You see how well
they take the suspension?

264
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:16,654
Everybody's a bit preoccupied
with, uh, not being occupied.

265
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,734
Normally, we'd be preparing
to guard the Englishman.

266
00:26:18,814 --> 00:26:20,654
The Englishman?
Buckingham.

267
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:24,334
He arrives tomorrow evening.
He'll be royally greeted,
eat, drink...

268
00:26:24,414 --> 00:26:26,254
and then,
along with Richelieu
and our King,

269
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,294
determine if there’s to be
war or peace with England.

270
00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:32,134
Unless something should happen
at the banquet to cause trouble
and Buckingham is harmed.

271
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:35,773
Regardless,
we as Musketeers have no choice
but to sit and watch.

272
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,773
Lord Buckingham's safety
is with the Cardinal.

273
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:42,573
You'll need to hit the eyes
to better that.

274
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:45,173
Who can do it?

275
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,333
How about
the would-be Musketeer?

276
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:57,252
Go and win
our meals and wine.
I'm not very good with a knife.

277
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:00,212
Humility is so boring.
We've all seen you fight.

278
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,212
I'm not fighting now.
Come on.

279
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,092
Take it.

280
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:19,651
Next time, listen to him.
You're no Musketeer.

281
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:23,331
You're a sheepherder.
Go drink with the sheepherders.

282
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:26,891
Pay no attention to Athos.
He envies your youth.

283
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:30,651
Have you got dung
in your ears? Go!

284
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:33,971
Yes. He's just trying
to make you overconfident.
He's much better with a sword.

285
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:38,531
Please understand,
if I'm not fighting--
Ah. Better with a sword.

286
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:44,090
Yes. We can all see
how much better with a sword.

287
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,490
Too petrified to move.

288
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,970
I do not wish
to fight a Musketeer.

289
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,130
Oh, I'm certain you don't.

290
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,650
I would not fight
a drunken Musketeer...

291
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,449
so I'm unfit
to drink with?

292
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:09,209
Athos was...

293
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,529
testing you.
Testing me?

294
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:15,889
Yes. Judging you.
Measuring you.

295
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:22,009
That is not a happy walk,
D’Artagnan.

296
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,689
The Musketeers are suspended
and they are drunk.
The Cardinal has arranged it...

297
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:29,688
so that no one
will be protecting the King,
and the Queen and Buckingham...

298
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,688
at the banquet tomorrow night.

299
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:35,208
Something is going to happen.
I know it. I have to find
a way into the palace.

300
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:37,848
The King must be protected.
I can't do it alone.

301
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,088
'Ask the Musketeers.

302
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,488
They don't seem
very cooperative.
They are loyal.

303
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:45,288
'Ask them.

304
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:35,406
- This is not what you think.
- You have no idea what I think.

305
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,525
I- I-I wish to explain.

306
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:41,885
You behave as though
you've never seen
a naked woman.

307
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,725
Never one quite so... naked.

308
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:47,685
Or so, uh, beautiful.

309
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:51,365
- You've seen many
ugly naked women?
- That's not what I meant.

310
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:59,405
- 'Are you standing up?
- You can turn around now.
It's perfectly safe.

311
00:30:04,884 --> 00:30:08,684
My back. Are there,
uh, any on my back?
A few.

312
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:14,604
You're not very brave.
Brave enough when need be.

313
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:18,324
And you feel no need to be
when insects are involved?

314
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:25,883
I was up there chasing away a rat.

315
00:30:25,963 --> 00:30:27,723
A sewer rat.

316
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:30,923
If I tell the Queen, you'll be back
cleaning the palace sewers!

317
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:36,443
How is it you have--
How is it someone like me
has the ear of the Queen?

318
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,323
My mother came from Spain
with the Queen.

319
00:30:40,443 --> 00:30:44,723
She was her seamstress. Perhaps more.
Perhaps her confidante.

320
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,202
And since I was a little girl,
since my mother died,

321
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:50,562
the Queen has always
been kind to me.

322
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:55,922
She is a kind woman at a time
when kindness is ignored.
Or worse, mistaken for weakness.

323
00:30:56,042 --> 00:30:59,162
But it will not always be so,
will it, D'Artagnan?

324
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:01,162
Not with those who matter.

325
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:15,201
You got no right to--
Of course.
Shut up!

326
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:18,241
You cleaned the palace sewers?
That must be fascinating work.

327
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:22,361
I'm sure I can get you
an apprenticeship.
Tell me about the palace sewers.

328
00:31:22,441 --> 00:31:25,601
Where they go.
How you get in.

329
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:29,361
Everything.
Go crawl around in them
yourself.

330
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,840
Over here with the torch.
I think I heard something.

331
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,040
I do not wish to see anything
that may live down here.

332
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,560
It's rumored that a crocodile
lives in the sewers.

333
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Young Louis was given
a baby crocodile from Egypt.

334
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,919
The Queen dropped it
in the sewer, and it's been
living on whatever it can find.

335
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,319
Is that true, Bonacieux?

336
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:04,959
Something kept dragging
the poor workers away.
All we ever found were bones.

337
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:07,879
I'm very glad
you and D'Artagnan
lead this little group.

338
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,239
Me too.
Crocodiles attack from behind.

339
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:15,159
Slow down!

340
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,319
Bonacieux, slow down!

341
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,678
Where did he go?

342
00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:27,878
If Bonacieux went that way,

343
00:32:27,998 --> 00:32:29,998
we should be going this way.

344
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:34,038
Crawling around in a sewer.
You consider this
the test of a man?

345
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:37,158
There is a certain
lack of dignity in it.

346
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:58,397
Hurry up there!

347
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,796
Henri!

348
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:22,036
Henri!

349
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:24,676
Henri!
Hmm?

350
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:47,555
Uh, more bread.
We need more bread.
Can you get some, please?

351
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:50,835
Does he mean you or me?
I thought I was the baker.
Me.

352
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:53,874
There's blood on your apron.
You think that came
from a croissant?

353
00:33:53,954 --> 00:33:55,914
Oh. Uh, right.

354
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,114
Oh, God-- God bless.

355
00:33:59,234 --> 00:34:02,114
Thank you, thank you.

356
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:51,352
Mister. Wine, please.

357
00:34:54,432 --> 00:34:57,352
Nice sword.
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

358
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:01,671
Is it a long sword
or a short sword?
Well, long enough.

359
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,511
Do you keep
your sword polished?
Uh, when there's time.

360
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:09,271
And do you do it yourself
or do you have help?

361
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:12,191
Mm, myself. I, uh, won't
trust my sword to anyone else.

362
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:19,511
Come on, you make bread
like a butcher.
Hurry! Hurry!

363
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,871
I wanted to be the butcher.

364
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,670
What now?
Add the salt.

365
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,750
Hey, you!
Hurry with these two.

366
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,389
What do I use for ducks?
The smaller one.

367
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:00,949
Shoo! Shoo!
Fly away!

368
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:04,389
You can thank me later.

369
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:16,348
This wine is rejuvenating.
Don't get too rejuvenated.

370
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,988
It's begun.

371
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:36,307
Stop! Stop! Stop!

372
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:39,547
I order you to stop!

373
00:36:39,707 --> 00:36:43,547
Where are your guards?
Like your respect and power,
they have been overrun.

374
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:53,587
- We will lead you out.
- Who are you?

375
00:36:55,227 --> 00:36:57,026
Your Musketeers.

376
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:02,426
- Then you should be arrested!
- Might that wait until
we're safely out of here?

377
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:08,106
I will stay.
Someone has to confront
this madness.

378
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:27,423
I will not
go down there.

379
00:38:27,543 --> 00:38:29,742
Your Royal Highness,
would you rather
go back out there?

380
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,582
Hello. Hello.

381
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,020
- You own an excellent sword
for a peasant.
- You fight well for a waiter.

382
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:05,698
I've heard there
are crocodiles down here.

383
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,898
If you're that jumpy,
you'd best leave Paris.

384
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:22,818
Why? Will you keep
leaping out at me?

385
00:40:22,978 --> 00:40:26,217
I wanted to warn you.
There are six Cardinal's Guards
in your room.

386
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:28,097
How could six of them
fit in my room?

387
00:40:31,817 --> 00:40:33,737
Why did you tell me?

388
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:37,097
Perhaps because you said
I was beautiful.
You are.

389
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:40,297
I thought men always
say that to you.
It's still nice to hear.

390
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,535
Come, come.
This way. Come on.

391
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:17,255
The Cardinal
demands to see you.

392
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:19,815
Then he may join me here
for a breath of morning air.

393
00:41:20,975 --> 00:41:22,215
Come on.
Quickly. Quickly.

394
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:27,135
- You've got him!
- There he is!

395
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:40,974
If he’d asked politely,
I'd have been glad
to visit the Cardinal.

396
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:43,814
For the Cardinal,
this is politely.

397
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:58,293
You warned D'Artagnan.
You want to get us
all slaughtered?

398
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:00,773
Yes, I warned him.

399
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:03,653
You'll bring
the Cardinal down on us.
Is that what you want?

400
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:06,573
And worse yet.
That- That night creature.

401
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:10,253
Not your Queen or any
other power on Earth can
save you from his hell!

402
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:17,053
It doesn't
have to be like this.
We can get along much better.

403
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:19,133
I'll take my chances
with the Cardinal.

404
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:26,732
Oh, that's better.
That's more like it--

405
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:32,572
Remember... we're family.
That sad fact...

406
00:42:32,652 --> 00:42:34,932
is all that
keeps you alive.

407
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,852
Up!

408
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:40,892
My- My dear niece,
may I say something?
No. Just listen.

409
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,731
If you ever
touch me again,

410
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:46,611
threaten me again
or hit me again,

411
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,211
I will slice off your balls
and feed them to the pigs.

412
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:52,731
Do you understand me?

413
00:42:52,851 --> 00:42:58,091
Yes- Yes. Very clear.
You explained it quite well.

414
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:03,131
Get out!

415
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:10,008
You wanted to see me?

416
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:12,408
I am your humble servant,
D'Artagnan.

417
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:16,447
I've heard about you,
Monsieur D'Artagnan,

418
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:18,807
and nothing I've heard
suggests you’re humble.

419
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:20,887
Monsieur Rochefort
will not be joining us.

420
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,407
Who are you,
D'Artagnan?

421
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:28,887
Where are you from?

422
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,367
What do you want?

423
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:34,527
I even want to know
your philosophical
and political leanings.

424
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:39,326
I don't have any.
You'd best acquire some quickly,
if you’re to survive in Paris.

425
00:44:39,406 --> 00:44:42,166
Is that why
you wish to see me,
to pass along advice?

426
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:46,086
Fires are erupting
all over France.
Last night, for example.

427
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:49,646
I'm sure you'll be glad to know
that I subdued the peasants
without further incident.

428
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:53,446
And how did you deal with
the ones who were not peasants?
You confuse me.

429
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,166
The men I confronted
were well-armed
and fought like swordsmen.

430
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,126
Even swordsmen can be poor.

431
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:00,366
Do you know why France
has come to this?

432
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:05,525
The King, poor man,
is weak.

433
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:09,205
The Queen is manipulative.

434
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:13,405
The Spanish and the English
are opportunistic.
The Protestants are divisive.

435
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:16,485
The nobles are scared
and the peasants are impatient.

436
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:18,965
Well, I thought they were
just cold and hungry.

437
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:22,685
If that were so, we could
just give them hot soup
and be done with it.

438
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:32,764
Understand me.
There will be
a shift in power,

439
00:45:32,844 --> 00:45:34,804
and with that,
a shift in wealth.

440
00:45:34,924 --> 00:45:36,924
Those who do not join me
will be against me.

441
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,444
They will be swept away
with the King. That includes
your friends, the Musketeers.

442
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:42,684
I will be sure to tell them.
I'm counting on that.

443
00:45:42,764 --> 00:45:45,884
- How is it
you have their trust?
- I helped them free Revile.

444
00:45:46,004 --> 00:45:48,123
Such honesty.

445
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,123
Such stupidity.

446
00:45:50,243 --> 00:45:53,243
I assumed Your Eminence
was not aware Revile was jailed.

447
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:56,443
I mean, why would it be
important to jail an old man...

448
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:59,443
when the impression it would
give is that Your Eminence
was frightened of him?

449
00:45:59,563 --> 00:46:02,283
And, of course, why give
the Musketeers a martyr?

450
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:04,763
Of course.

451
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:09,403
For a man who does not
have a political position,

452
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,402
you think remarkably
like a politician.

453
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:20,842
Men without greed
make me nervous.

454
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:25,682
This is someone
who will bear watching.

455
00:46:25,802 --> 00:46:28,042
Or eliminating.

456
00:46:28,162 --> 00:46:31,162
I think he's the most
dangerous kind of man.

457
00:46:31,282 --> 00:46:33,802
He’s young
and he has a cause.

458
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,841
He will serve me
or he will serve no one.

459
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,401
I think
you should kill him now,
before he causes more trouble.

460
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:43,801
You've barely washed
the blood from your teeth...

461
00:46:43,881 --> 00:46:47,281
and you hunger for more.
Call it a weakness.

462
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:49,361
I want him alive,
for the moment.

463
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:52,121
After last night,
he's in the King's good grace.

464
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:56,761
When the time is right
and the King can do no harm,
I will let you have him.

465
00:46:56,881 --> 00:47:00,640
- When? Will it be soon?
- Yes.

466
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,960
Good.

467
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,679
The Cardinal is not satisfied
with suspending the Musketeers,

468
00:47:34,759 --> 00:47:37,679
now he has to arrest them;
I will not stand by
while this happens.

469
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:41,079
- This is not necessary.
- Or wise.

470
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,078
What is not wise
is hiding here,

471
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:47,558
letting Cardinal Richelieu
dictate what I do.

472
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:50,998
I will no longer cower
in this place.

473
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,518
Then Richelieu
will have you cowering
in one of his jails instead.

474
00:47:53,598 --> 00:47:58,118
Aramis, I do not intend
to cower at all.

475
00:47:58,238 --> 00:48:00,718
If they want
to put me in jail,

476
00:48:00,798 --> 00:48:02,638
if they want
to hang me,

477
00:48:02,718 --> 00:48:04,838
so be it.

478
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:07,117
I will no longer hide.

479
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:25,877
Your Majesty, Buckingham
has left for England...

480
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:28,517
after the fiasco at the banquet.

481
00:48:28,637 --> 00:48:30,276
The situation with the English
grows more...

482
00:48:31,636 --> 00:48:33,596
intense.

483
00:48:34,956 --> 00:48:37,996
If you will excuse us.

484
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:41,916
The concerns of the Crown
are my concerns as well.

485
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:45,156
- We do not wish to trouble you.
- I assure you...

486
00:48:45,276 --> 00:48:49,316
if anything can help keep peace,
it's not troubling.

487
00:48:49,436 --> 00:48:51,276
I think there is still
an opportunity--

488
00:48:51,356 --> 00:48:53,675
The role of the Queen
is not to think.

489
00:48:55,955 --> 00:48:59,395
- But if I could explain--
- The Queen wishes to
return to her chamber.

490
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:12,275
I would not presume to dictate
the behavior of the Queen,

491
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:15,115
but she grows
more strong-willed.

492
00:49:15,195 --> 00:49:17,034
It does you
an injustice.

493
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,754
- I will deal with her.
- I'm certain that you will.

494
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,754
Your Highness.

495
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:23,954
Most of the Musketeers
are in the cells back here
and here.

496
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:27,474
Most of the Musketeers
are in the cells back here
and here.

497
00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:29,874
At dawn,
they change guards.

498
00:49:29,954 --> 00:49:32,154
The hour before,
they'd be most vulnerable.

499
00:49:32,274 --> 00:49:35,354
They'll expect it.
They're counting on it.

500
00:49:35,474 --> 00:49:39,873
That's what
makes it fun.

501
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:53,153
Francesca!

502
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:56,033
I need your help.
Yes, of course.
Anything.

503
00:49:56,153 --> 00:49:58,193
You could start
by taking the pistol
from my head.

504
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:01,313
Sorry.

505
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,512
Please, come with me.
Where?

506
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:07,672
We escort the Queen.
She visits Buckingham,
a last plea to avert war.

507
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,792
Won't the King's Guards
escort her?

508
00:50:09,912 --> 00:50:12,712
No, the King does not know.
Richelieu does not know.

509
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,872
No one must know.
Not now, not later.

510
00:50:14,992 --> 00:50:17,552
I must have
your word on that.
You have.

511
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:21,032
But you could wait
one moment.

512
00:50:21,112 --> 00:50:22,952
There's no time
for that.

513
00:50:24,991 --> 00:50:26,751
Well, there's
no time for that.

514
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:30,151
Are you bragging?

515
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:34,191
I will wait outside.

516
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,750
Don't deny you’re cheating.

517
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:57,710
What do you call
that card you are hiding
in your sleeve?

518
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,830
The ace of spades.

519
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,470
Good morning, D'Artagnan.

520
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,710
You may close
your mouth now.

521
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:08,710
Her Majesty thought it best
to travel as a commoner--

522
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:11,189
dressed as a commoner,
and in the company
of commoners.

523
00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:13,629
Oh, how fortunate
we're so common.

524
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:16,669
What you do is
most important for France.

525
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:19,509
Only the four of us
will ever know.

526
00:51:19,629 --> 00:51:21,869
D’Artagnan!

527
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,069
We've been
looking for you.
We need your help.

528
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,989
We ride
to free the Musketeers.

529
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:27,949
I... cannot go.

530
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:31,789
Cannot go?

531
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:33,709
There's something
that I must do.

532
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:36,308
Uh, well, uh--
Take care and do it.

533
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,988
We'll wait for you.

534
00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:41,788
What is so important
that you cannot help
a Musketeer?

535
00:51:41,908 --> 00:51:44,748
As you so frequently
remind me, I'm not
a Musketeer.

536
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:32,426
Wait here.
I'll get some food.
Don't leave the coach.

537
00:52:40,426 --> 00:52:42,666
Hey.
Hmm.

538
00:52:42,746 --> 00:52:44,705
Two loaves of bread
and that small wheel
of cheese, please.

539
00:52:44,825 --> 00:52:48,225
- Oui, monsieur.
- The one next to it,
if you please.

540
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:51,185
- Go back to the coach.
- And a nice bottle of wine.

541
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:53,545
I'll bring it to you.
Back to the coach, please.

542
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:56,185
I know you, don't I?

543
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,865
- I very much doubt it.
- You're Hessian.

544
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:03,225
I don't think
I like your tone.

545
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:05,905
Well, that's the only one
I have for people
who sell their loyalties.

546
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:10,184
You have insulted me!

547
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:12,984
This is foolish.
There's no quarrel here.

548
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,424
- Would you fight a man
over nothing?
- Enthusiastically.

549
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:30,103
I'm enjoying this.
I suppose a Queen...

550
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:32,743
participates
in few tavern brawls.

551
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:36,103
This Hessian concerns me.

552
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:38,503
They're mercenaries hired
by someone not friendly
to the Crown.

553
00:53:50,543 --> 00:53:54,142
In case we stop...
at another tavern.

554
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:09,742
Hyah!

555
00:54:11,262 --> 00:54:13,462
Hyah! Hyah!

556
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:28,741
- Get down. Hold tight!
- What is it?

557
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:42,180
Come on!

558
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:07,059
Hyah!

559
00:55:39,138 --> 00:55:42,338
Hyah! Hyah!

560
00:56:47,095 --> 00:56:49,855
Hey!

561
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:38,213
- Whatever happens, you keep going.
- Hyah!

562
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:54,172
Hyah! Hyah!

563
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,730
You'd be best going.
She might sleep until autumn.

564
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,530
I have never slept through
a whole season.

565
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,289
You hear the most interesting
things about yourself...

566
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:56,809
when people think
you're asleep, hmm?

567
00:58:56,929 --> 00:59:00,889
This is Francesca Bonacieux,
an old friend.

568
00:59:01,009 --> 00:59:05,049
- Mmm.
- And this is D'Artagnan,
a new friend.

569
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:07,329
Oh, D'Artagnan.

570
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:11,529
Perhaps a little to eat...

571
00:59:11,609 --> 00:59:13,809
and then on your way?

572
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:17,128
I have no intention
of leaving you.

573
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:22,128
I mustn't draw
attention to myself.

574
00:59:22,248 --> 00:59:25,528
And...
if things should turn...

575
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:28,048
difficult, it's better you know
little of what goes on here.

576
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:30,608
I will be deaf and blind,
but I will stay.

577
00:59:30,728 --> 00:59:33,648
Francesca, I want you
to return to Paris.

578
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:54,687
- It's not good, it's not good.
- What's not good?

579
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:59,287
The lead horse lost a shoe.
But we can't replace them
till the swelling comes down.

580
00:59:59,407 --> 01:00:01,327
You may as well go.
It could be hours.

581
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:04,726
Days. Weeks.
How can we go?

582
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:14,886
I'll be back in a moment.

583
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,845
I saw a Musketeer's tunic
in your room.

584
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,805
It's my father's.
My parents were killed
when I was a boy.

585
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,765
- They were murdered.
- I'm sorry.

586
01:00:40,885 --> 01:00:44,325
I was there. I watched.
Couldn't stop it.

587
01:00:44,405 --> 01:00:46,805
You were a boy.
I should
have done more.

588
01:00:46,885 --> 01:00:48,565
So, that's what
this is really all about.

589
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:50,484
In the beginning, yes.
It's all I thought about.

590
01:00:50,604 --> 01:00:54,164
Planchet, he raised me.
He taught me everything.

591
01:00:54,244 --> 01:00:56,684
He taught me that
if I really wanted
to be like my father,

592
01:00:56,764 --> 01:00:58,724
I need a higher purpose
than hate.

593
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:01,204
- Are you now like your father?
- You ask a lot of questions.

594
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:05,524
How else am I to learn?
Are you like your father?
I'm still trying.

595
01:01:07,444 --> 01:01:11,444
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

596
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:13,843
- Those eyes.
- They're the only eyes I have.

597
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:16,843
It's unfair.

598
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:25,043
It's the Tear of Brionne.

599
01:01:25,123 --> 01:01:28,043
Shed by Saint Bridget,
because she couldn't feed
all the poor.

600
01:01:28,123 --> 01:01:30,523
Wherever her tears fell,
a fruit tree grew.

601
01:01:30,643 --> 01:01:32,843
Provided food
for the hungry.

602
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:35,482
Thank you.

603
01:01:36,602 --> 01:01:38,962
When you look
at me like that,

604
01:01:39,082 --> 01:01:43,282
I don't know what to say.
Sometimes it's much better
to say nothing.

605
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:55,402
Would you care to
say that again?

606
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:12,241
This is not after,
this is between.

607
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,040
Don't.

608
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,960
I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.
Who are you?

609
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:34,040
- Your pallbearer, if you hurt her.
- In truth, I know who you are.

610
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,000
D'Artagnan.
The name is familiar.

611
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,760
Maybe you can tell me
all about yourself,
just before you die.

612
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,000
But, first--

613
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,679
Where is the Queen?

614
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:47,759
Where is the Queen?

615
01:02:47,879 --> 01:02:51,079
- No.
- Do not tell him!
- The lady gives unsound advice.

616
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:55,439
- Do not harm her.
- But I feel the need
to harm someone.

617
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:57,719
Where is the Queen?
Hmm?

618
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:07,119
Oh, how touching.

619
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:10,558
The Tear of Brionne.

620
01:03:10,678 --> 01:03:12,678
It's a beautiful place,
Brionne.

621
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,398
I believe the Queen has
an old acquaintance there.

622
01:03:16,478 --> 01:03:19,878
Thank you for your cooperation.
Bring her.

623
01:03:19,998 --> 01:03:22,438
Fire away, boys.

624
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:29,478
Come on, girl.
You're going to come with us.

625
01:03:59,276 --> 01:04:04,356
Febre left me here,
in case you were not dead.
Just one? I'm insulted.

626
01:04:04,436 --> 01:04:06,276
Don't be.

627
01:04:18,795 --> 01:04:21,995
For whom
do you do this?
For my own pleasure.

628
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:24,675
Now write the letter.

629
01:04:24,755 --> 01:04:27,835
Richelieu?
No, he wouldn't go that far.

630
01:04:28,955 --> 01:04:32,035
He believes that
rhetoric conquers nations.

631
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:37,435
- Chaos conquers nations.
- Did you kill the Spanish envoy?

632
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:39,155
Yes. Write the letter.

633
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:42,954
You bring us
to the brink of war.

634
01:04:43,034 --> 01:04:45,634
Now it's time
to push you over.
Write the letter.

635
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,074
Am I to assume, then,

636
01:04:56,194 --> 01:04:59,434
- that you won't write the letter?
- I would die before I help you.

637
01:05:00,634 --> 01:05:02,953
Well, you wouldn't
be the first.

638
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:08,673
You have...
no children.

639
01:05:08,793 --> 01:05:11,073
No.

640
01:05:11,153 --> 01:05:15,273
But you like children.
Of course you do.

641
01:05:15,393 --> 01:05:18,473
Everybody likes children.

642
01:05:18,593 --> 01:05:20,873
Except for me.

643
01:05:27,672 --> 01:05:32,472
She's very pretty, isn't she?

644
01:05:34,112 --> 01:05:38,912
- Why are you doing this?
- No, you said...
that you liked children.

645
01:05:38,992 --> 01:05:43,232
Well, do you like them enough
to save her life?

646
01:05:43,312 --> 01:05:45,552
- Is there no mercy in your heart?
- No mercy.

647
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:49,191
No heart.

648
01:05:58,351 --> 01:06:01,351
Take this to Grenouille.
Place it in Buckingham's hands...

649
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:03,351
the moment he arrives,
and give him this:

650
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:06,071
the Queen was generous enough
to donate her ring to the cause.

651
01:06:06,151 --> 01:06:09,951
Monsieur.
The rest of you,
join the others in DuChamps.

652
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:15,630
What happened?
He came back.

653
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:18,990
And did you kill him?
Well, he doesn't seem
to have killed you.

654
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,470
So what choice
does that leave us?
He escaped, sir.

655
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,390
Who is D'Artagnan?

656
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:37,989
Whose throat do
I have to cut now?

657
01:06:38,109 --> 01:06:41,549
Hmm?
Perhaps a little boy?

658
01:06:41,669 --> 01:06:43,749
I know.

659
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:46,469
A little boy and a nun.

660
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:52,029
Prepare DuChamps castle
for hell.

661
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:54,509
I have business
in Paris.

662
01:06:54,629 --> 01:06:57,669
I'll be
with you soon.

663
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:49,026
She's gone.

664
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:53,266
The Queen?
And Francesca.

665
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:55,786
- Who did this?
- A man in black.

666
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:58,346
He is without pity,
without remorse.

667
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:01,146
Where did he take them?

668
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:05,026
Monsieur!
Monsieur!

669
01:08:05,106 --> 01:08:06,986
You're a friend
of the Queen's?
Yes.

670
01:08:07,106 --> 01:08:09,345
You brought
her here?
Yes.

671
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:11,265
I know
where she is.
Where?

672
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:13,865
DuChamps castle.
And a young woman?

673
01:08:13,985 --> 01:08:15,865
He took her too.

674
01:08:15,985 --> 01:08:17,945
You're sure
it was DuChamps.

675
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:21,105
He made the Queen
write a note to
a Lord Buckingham.

676
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:23,065
It said she had
changed plans.

677
01:08:23,145 --> 01:08:25,185
He was to meet her
in DuChamps.

678
01:08:25,305 --> 01:08:29,065
And then he sent some man
to meet this Lord Buckingham
where the ferry comes in.

679
01:08:29,185 --> 01:08:31,104
The Queen did not want
to write it,

680
01:08:31,264 --> 01:08:33,104
but he said he would
slit my throat if she did not.

681
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:35,064
He would have.
You're lucky.

682
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,064
He has an army.
What will you do?
Get an army of my own.

683
01:08:38,184 --> 01:08:40,144
And find him.
When you do,

684
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:42,104
give him this.

685
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:46,264
I will.

686
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:17,142
Come on.
Come on, boy.

687
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:19,822
Just a little further and
you can rest all you want.

688
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,742
Come on.

689
01:09:21,822 --> 01:09:23,782
We're almost there.

690
01:09:23,902 --> 01:09:27,022
It's just ahead.
You see?

691
01:09:27,102 --> 01:09:28,022
Come on, Strega.

692
01:09:28,062 --> 01:09:28,942
Come on, Strega.

693
01:09:29,022 --> 01:09:30,862
Just a little further.

694
01:09:38,902 --> 01:09:43,101
Go on.
No, rest, Strega.

695
01:09:50,181 --> 01:09:52,821
I will
come back for you.

696
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,940
I didn't
hear you knock.

697
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:14,700
Tell me about D’Artagnan.
He would have knocked.

698
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,700
Tell me
where he comes from.

699
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:20,340
Tell me about
his parents.
Why?

700
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,780
I know his name.

701
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:26,060
Ask him yourself.
No, I'm asking you.

702
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:32,099
Get out of here.
Get out!

703
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:34,019
Tell me about D'Artagnan.

704
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:37,139
You're a madman.
All the more reason
to fear me.

705
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:40,539
Tell me
what I mean to know.

706
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:43,539
Or you’ll be rendered
to ashes...

707
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:45,619
with your books
and your maps.

708
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,459
H- He comes from Gascony.

709
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:51,298
His father was
a Musketeer.

710
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:54,258
They were both
killed in front of him
when he was a child.

711
01:10:54,378 --> 01:10:56,218
What's the importance
to you?

712
01:10:57,978 --> 01:11:01,178
Oh, my God.
It’s you.

713
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:04,178
- You killed his family.
- He wants revenge.

714
01:11:05,658 --> 01:11:08,018
He wants to be
a Musketeer.

715
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,778
And in attacking me,
he'll fail in both.

716
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:14,137
Or succeed in both.
No, I will kill him.

717
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:18,137
But first, I will kill that
which he holds most dear.

718
01:11:19,297 --> 01:11:20,537
Febre!

719
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:39,656
- He has gone too far.
- Who’s gone too far?

720
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:42,776
I'm here to tell you,
you shall have your wish.
I will kill the Queen.

721
01:11:42,936 --> 01:11:44,736
And Buckingham.

722
01:11:44,856 --> 01:11:47,216
They will die in each
other's arms: victims
of the King's jealousy.

723
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:51,016
- You're mad!
- That's the second time this
evening I've been called mad.

724
01:11:51,096 --> 01:11:52,896
And I'm beginning
to resent it.

725
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:57,016
With this final stroke,
France will erupt, the King
will be dragged from the throne,

726
01:11:57,096 --> 01:11:58,735
and France
will turn to you...

727
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,535
for spiritual
and political guidance.

728
01:12:03,295 --> 01:12:05,975
The Queen is
at DuChamps castle
with 200 of my men.

729
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,895
- Buckingham arrives tonight.
- I gave no orders for that.

730
01:12:09,015 --> 01:12:10,815
Well, this is
beyond orders.

731
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:13,135
This is the domain
of history now.

732
01:12:13,255 --> 01:12:15,655
So you plot the course
of history now.
You are indeed mad.

733
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:19,855
That's three times!
It must be so.

734
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,054
You cannot do this, Febre!

735
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:26,094
And what would you do...
Your Eminence?

736
01:12:27,454 --> 01:12:29,294
Damn me to hell?

737
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:34,174
Well, I'm certain
that's where I'm going.

738
01:12:35,254 --> 01:12:37,614
And I'm
just as certain...

739
01:12:37,734 --> 01:12:40,694
we can finish
this debate there.

740
01:12:54,773 --> 01:12:58,813
He is your creature--
you made him, and now
you can no longer control him.

741
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:00,933
Is that what he needs?
Controlling?

742
01:13:01,013 --> 01:13:03,733
I will stop him!

743
01:13:07,653 --> 01:13:10,212
Arm yourself!
If you insist.

744
01:13:19,252 --> 01:13:21,172
Sorry you had to come
all that way for this.

745
01:13:40,331 --> 01:13:44,371
Lord Buckingham?
From the Queen.

746
01:13:45,411 --> 01:13:47,211
Well, there's no seal.

747
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:49,851
Oh, I was instructed
to give you this ring.

748
01:13:49,971 --> 01:13:52,291
It's explained
in the letter.

749
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:01,930
We go to DuChamps.

750
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:15,250
Are you gonna
shoot me?
Where's Revile?

751
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:18,129
We carried
what was left of him
out a few minutes ago.

752
01:14:18,209 --> 01:14:21,049
What happened here?
Someone said
they saw a man.

753
01:14:21,169 --> 01:14:23,649
In black.
Leaving the villa.
Febre?

754
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:26,929
Well, it's the sort of thing
that appeals to him.

755
01:14:27,009 --> 01:14:29,329
Revile was waiting
for you, D'Artagnan.

756
01:14:29,409 --> 01:14:32,969
When this fire started,
he was waiting for you!

757
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:35,009
So then I have killed him.
He was worried about you.

758
01:14:35,089 --> 01:14:36,929
Worried that the guards
had picked you up.

759
01:14:37,009 --> 01:14:39,729
Worried about what
was so important that
you couldn't help us.

760
01:14:41,168 --> 01:14:43,048
Well, do you care
how we got on?
Does it matter to you...

761
01:14:43,168 --> 01:14:45,688
that three men died?

762
01:14:45,808 --> 01:14:48,288
Well, we managed to free
the others-- without you,
D'Artagnan.

763
01:14:48,368 --> 01:14:50,568
We remembered,
"All for one,
and one for all. "

764
01:14:51,648 --> 01:14:53,688
Don't turn your back
on me, D'Artagnan!

765
01:14:53,808 --> 01:14:55,728
For I will fight you!

766
01:14:55,888 --> 01:14:59,688
Do not fight me, Aramis,
for I will kill you.

767
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,487
D'Artagnan!

768
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,687
I know
who did this.

769
01:15:17,087 --> 01:15:18,927
Febre. The one that
does your bidding.

770
01:15:19,007 --> 01:15:21,487
This is not my bidding.
He is gone mad.

771
01:15:21,607 --> 01:15:24,567
He was always mad.
But when he was your madman,
it was overlooked.

772
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,966
He will set France ablaze
and rise from the ashes.

773
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:30,766
He's out of control.
He will kill the Queen,

774
01:15:30,846 --> 01:15:33,366
kill Lord Buckingham--

775
01:15:33,486 --> 01:15:36,526
But the thing
he hates most is you.

776
01:15:36,606 --> 01:15:41,606
He is horribly scarred,
and his eye is useless.
He says you did it.

777
01:15:43,646 --> 01:15:45,486
I will stop him.

778
01:15:45,566 --> 01:15:47,886
I will pray.

779
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:50,885
Pray for your success.

780
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,405
I will kill your monster,
but not for you!

781
01:16:05,245 --> 01:16:07,485
I've come to ask for help.

782
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:14,124
Is this your answer?

783
01:16:25,924 --> 01:16:27,764
I've been practicing.

784
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:31,484
We don't want you here.

785
01:16:32,724 --> 01:16:35,404
Are you afraid of Febre?

786
01:16:35,484 --> 01:16:38,843
We've come to this.
The Musketeers
afraid of one man.

787
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:43,763
- We are not afraid of anyone.
- This isn't our fight.
- He will kill the Queen.

788
01:16:43,883 --> 01:16:45,723
If not our fight,
whose fight is it?

789
01:16:45,803 --> 01:16:47,683
They're King's Musketeers,
not the Queen's.

790
01:16:47,763 --> 01:16:50,403
- You have your allegiances confused.
- I know my allegiances.

791
01:16:50,483 --> 01:16:53,603
But you’ve forgotten
what it was that
made you Musketeers.

792
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:57,403
Really? And where were
your allegiances when
we asked for your help?

793
01:16:57,483 --> 01:16:59,042
I had to escort
the Queen.

794
01:16:59,122 --> 01:17:03,522
- I was sworn to secrecy.
- Escort the Queen?
Or was it the chambermaid?

795
01:17:06,762 --> 01:17:09,282
Hate me all you want,
but act!

796
01:17:09,362 --> 01:17:12,682
- Defend your country.
- A country that has scorned us.

797
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:16,282
Then do it as Musketeers.
Do it to resurrect yourselves.

798
01:17:16,362 --> 01:17:22,042
Perhaps what you seek here
only existed in the imagination
of a small boy.

799
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:29,841
"All for one,
and one for all. "

800
01:17:39,401 --> 01:17:41,241
Candle wicks.
Ten of them.

801
01:17:41,321 --> 01:17:43,721
Dipped in Armagnac.
Just like you taught me.

802
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,680
Uh, I didn't teach you
to use such a good Armagnac.

803
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,120
Where are we going?
Probably to die.

804
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:57,440
Strega?
Can you get Strega?

805
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,440
He's on the southern road,
two kilometers out.

806
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,119
What are you doing?
Saddling a horse.

807
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,039
Not your saddle.
Not your horse.

808
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,959
I have to borrow them.
Steal them, you mean.

809
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:16,239
But then,
you're a Musketeer!

810
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:18,159
You can just steal things!

811
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:20,719
Must be strong wine, Bonacieux,
to give you so much courage.

812
01:18:20,839 --> 01:18:23,399
You won't want what's left
of Francesca when Febre's done.

813
01:18:27,799 --> 01:18:30,199
Don't come near me,
or I'll--

814
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:33,278
How did you know
Febre has Francesca?

815
01:18:33,358 --> 01:18:36,518
I heard talk. I--
There was no talk.
No one knew.

816
01:18:36,598 --> 01:18:38,518
You're wrong!
No, you listen.

817
01:18:38,598 --> 01:18:41,478
When Francesca came
to my room, you listened,
and you told Febre!

818
01:18:41,598 --> 01:18:44,718
No, I-I--
You betrayed
your own flesh and blood.

819
01:18:44,838 --> 01:18:46,878
If I do not come back
with Francesca,

820
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:49,558
I'm coming back for you.

821
01:19:07,717 --> 01:19:10,357
I'm afraid you're going
to regret we ever met.

822
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:31,276
Well, it would be nice
if you could fly.

823
01:19:31,396 --> 01:19:33,876
- Am I truly crazy?
- Let me answer that.

824
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:37,836
I've known you longer.
You've changed your mind?

825
01:19:37,956 --> 01:19:40,436
No, I've come
to change yours.

826
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:43,395
You've wasted your time.

827
01:19:43,515 --> 01:19:45,995
You cannot do this.

828
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:49,395
You're right.
Not at all.

829
01:19:49,475 --> 01:19:51,755
Well, I suppose that
in the scheme of things...

830
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,675
the loss of our lives
will matter not.

831
01:19:53,795 --> 01:19:55,835
What scheme is that?

832
01:19:55,955 --> 01:19:58,195
I shall ride with you.
As shall we.

833
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:06,994
We'll take them
by surprise.

834
01:20:07,074 --> 01:20:09,594
Yes.
They're expecting an army.

835
01:20:09,714 --> 01:20:12,314
Well, perhaps we shall
not disappoint them.

836
01:20:28,513 --> 01:20:31,113
Whoa!

837
01:20:50,632 --> 01:20:53,272
Keep watch, Strega.

838
01:20:53,352 --> 01:20:55,792
You've done enough.

839
01:20:55,872 --> 01:20:58,032
It's our turn.

840
01:21:02,312 --> 01:21:04,152
You dropped this.

841
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:08,029
It's begun.

842
01:22:17,749 --> 01:22:20,909
- All for one...
- and one for all!

843
01:23:13,946 --> 01:23:15,826
Come on!

844
01:23:35,145 --> 01:23:36,585
We'll have to charge
the damn thing!

845
01:23:42,745 --> 01:23:45,065
Come on!

846
01:23:53,465 --> 01:23:55,424
Come on!
I need men over here!

847
01:23:56,584 --> 01:23:58,544
Push it back.
Back!

848
01:23:58,704 --> 01:24:01,744
Turn it around.
Heave!

849
01:24:01,864 --> 01:24:03,624
Now push forward.

850
01:24:03,704 --> 01:24:06,224
Push! Push!

851
01:24:06,304 --> 01:24:07,984
Push!

852
01:24:12,504 --> 01:24:14,704
Keep going.

853
01:24:14,784 --> 01:24:16,824
Forward.

854
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:18,343
Come on!
Push.

855
01:24:20,743 --> 01:24:24,503
Push!
Keep going!

856
01:24:28,983 --> 01:24:31,263
Come on!

857
01:24:32,743 --> 01:24:35,143
Now stop!

858
01:24:49,782 --> 01:24:51,982
I just knew he was going
to blow something up again.

859
01:25:07,981 --> 01:25:09,741
Where's the Queen?
I don't know.

860
01:25:09,821 --> 01:25:11,221
Then die here.

861
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:13,221
Francesca!
Come here.

862
01:26:53,457 --> 01:26:55,657
Now get up.

863
01:27:41,935 --> 01:27:43,455
No.

864
01:27:45,295 --> 01:27:47,134
I wanted you here
for this.

865
01:27:48,334 --> 01:27:50,934
This will just
take a moment.

866
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:54,534
No!
Francesca!

867
01:28:10,173 --> 01:28:12,613
I'm not dead. Now, will
you please go kill him?

868
01:28:13,933 --> 01:28:16,653
Time to dance.

869
01:28:49,172 --> 01:28:51,572
That's from
a young friend.

870
01:32:13,683 --> 01:32:15,523
Do you think
it's worth anything?

871
01:32:15,603 --> 01:32:17,643
- I'd be very much surprised.
- Shh!

872
01:32:17,763 --> 01:32:20,883
France owes you all
a great debt.

873
01:32:27,522 --> 01:32:29,682
I owe you my life,
Monsieur D'Artagnan.

874
01:32:29,802 --> 01:32:33,322
'And England owes you thanks
for preventing a great war.

875
01:32:33,442 --> 01:32:37,882
I don't think you realize
how much you've done for France.

876
01:32:39,922 --> 01:32:42,962
I'm only glad
I could be of some guidance.

877
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:45,642
Bless me, Father,
for I will sin.

878
01:32:45,762 --> 01:32:48,361
One night, I will
come for you.

879
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,440
I'm not mader of lace.
