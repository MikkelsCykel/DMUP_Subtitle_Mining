1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,860
That's me.

2
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,730
That's my dad.

3
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,150
I remember that day.

4
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,590
And believe it or not, I remember that hit.

5
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,390
I remember it because of the smile
that spread over my dad's face.

6
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,130
Yeah, I'd have stood there all day
just to sink one.

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,950
Just to see that smile.

8
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,010
You see, to Pop, sports were a religion.

9
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,100
To me, it was about purity.

10
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,380
Sports was a place
where all wrongs could be made right.

11
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,840
I thought if I filled the whole house
with trophies for him, he'd stick around.

12
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,200
Well, I did.

13
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,530
He left before my tenth birthday.

14
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,730
The Championship
has come down to this final play.

15
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,000
The Sun Devils trail by four.
The ball on the Aztec 15.

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,630
Seven seconds left on the clock.

17
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,430
Settle it down.
Pro-right tiger. This is your game.

18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,140
Now let's go. Let's go get 'em.
Now let's go! Let's go!

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,830
Sun Devils' ball.
First down and ten yards to go.

20
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,500
Here we go men last play.
It's fun time!

21
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,070
Pro-right tiger. Wide check. 532 double fly
on two Scottie. Guaranteed TD.

22
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,900
We gotta worry about one thing men.

23
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,390
After we win this game
they'll be putting cameras in your faces.

24
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,200
Don't give them "Hi Mom"s and shit.
It's overused.

25
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,870
You gotta thank somebody thank me.

26
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,830
- I'll see you in the end zone men. Ready?
- Break!

27
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,710
I was a quarterback
since peewee football -

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,450
set high-school records, won
state championships. This was pertect.

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,910
Coming at you 57.

30
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,120
Bowl game, national TV,
there were pro scouts in the stands,

31
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,580
and I knew exactly
what was gonna happen next.

32
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,480
Lang has led the Sun
Devils to four comebacks this season.

33
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,400
Can he do it?
Win their first bowl game in 12 years?

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,140
Lang barks the signals. The Aztecs have
eight in the box. They're showing blitz.

35
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,600
Lang takes the snap,
fades back into the pocket.

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,710
He looks for Ravis on the right.
Sherman breaks through.

37
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,640
Lang's in trouble. He shakes Sherman off,
nearly goes down.

38
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,110
He's looking to throw. Two seconds to go.
There he goes. He's going to run it.

39
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,450
He's got to get in the end zone.
And that safety is stepping up.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,840
Can he make it?

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,180
- Touchdown!
- Argh!

42
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:36,060
My first thought was I could tape it
and play next week. Then I puked.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,660
When do I play again Doc?
What's the rehab time?

44
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,950
I'm not sure son.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Football wasn't a sport.

46
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,580
It was my life.

47
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,430
And I wasn't gonna give up now.

48
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,690
I would play again.

49
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,210
In the meantime I needed ajob
to hold me over between tryouts.

50
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,460
Then one day, and it didn't take long,

51
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,580
six years had passed
and I woke up at the bottom.

52
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,920
"You have reached
the Jessica Simpson hotline.

53
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,740
"Jessica will tell you
about Nick's birthday party

54
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,390
"and a whole lot more about
her rocking new panty line at Wal-Mart.

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,230
"But first here's a little fan trivia
to win a VIP gold-package backstage pass

56
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,750
"to Jessica's Omnicon Hotel summer tour. "

57
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,200
- Lang.
- "The question... " I'm taping boss.

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,200
Look. I got a job for you. Bauer's sick.
I can't update his betting line.

59
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,870
- You know anything about sports?
- Yeah a little.

60
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,980
900 numbers, audio text.
The racket had a lot of names.

61
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,440
This guy's gig was sports handicapping -
predicting winners for people who bet.

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,270
I was supposed tojust record his picks.

63
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,080
Thing was, I didn't agree with them.

64
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,060
No they're not.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,520
Living in Las Vegas, it was easy to gauge
the temperature of the betting public.

66
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,770
The problem is they're usually wrong.

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,360
What's up Stu?
Where's all the action this weekend?

68
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,280
Tampa-Oakland.
Everyone's jumping on Oakland.

69
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,220
- That's crazy.
- You think?

70
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,450
Yeah man.
That game's gonna be won by coaching.

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,830
Gruden put that Oakland team together
before he came to Tampa.

72
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,670
He knows every strength and weakness.

73
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,030
Brown catches to his left so he'll have
him double-teamed to the defender's right.

74
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,070
Gannon throws on a three-step drop.

75
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,760
He'll stack the midfield with line backers
take away the short pass.

76
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,160
Gannon will throw three or four NTs Sunday.

77
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,210
Fuck me.

78
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,220
- You took Oaktown?
- Yeah what do you think?

79
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,150
I think I gotta
save your ass one more time.

80
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,880
Take Tampa Bay on the money line.
They're gonna win this game outright.

81
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,720
- Bet 'em big.
- Thanks B.

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,830
Stu did bet 'em big,
and he won ten grand.

83
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,620
I was quickly becoming
the biggest 900 line in Vegas.

84
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,210
"Kansas City is seven to one against
point spread v division opponents

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,240
"coming off a Monday night game.
Take KC minus the six.

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,370
"Call tomorrow for my pro-football game
of the year. That's here at 900-656-3100.

87
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,580
"Until then this is Brandon Lang
saying good night and good gambling. "

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
Big plans this weekend?

89
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,110
There you go.

90
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Steve. I went nine and two
on pro football Sunday

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,890
and hit my third straight
Monday-night parlay.

92
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,790
- It's worth 12 bucks an hour.
- Hey I don't make 12 an hour.

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,040
You're not picking 75%.

94
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,420
If you're that good why don't you
bet your own games get rich?

95
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,470
Send me a postcard from the riviera.

96
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,260
By Unwritten Law)

97
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,010
What's going on Denny?

98
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:04,100
Hey man. What's up?

99
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,400
Big bro's making them greenbacks.
How about you bro?

100
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,770
I scrounged up some old headers B.
Check it out. Fire it up.

101
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,550
All right here goes.

102
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,690
Jeez I'm late. Honey dinner's in the oven.
Where the hell's my lucky crucifix?

103
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,640
Oh I forgot to tell you. The mail came
and there's a letter for you from Chicago.

104
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,350
You just went there
for your tryout last week.

105
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,420
Another rejection letter.
"... strength of your knee in question. "

106
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,890
I only had two Arena teams left,
and after that there was always the CFL.

107
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,970
You can't save me

108
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,000
You can't change me

109
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,370
Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,690
And everything, everything's my fault

111
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,630
Whoa! So what do you think?

112
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,220
Should I ride shotgun
or do you want to hop on the handlebars?

113
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,540
Hey the packaging's not that great
but there's a prize on the inside.

114
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,360
What do you say? No?

115
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,190
Oh that's OK.

116
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,840
You'll be back. I'll have a life.

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,260
Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call

118
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,080
And everything's my fault

119
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,950
Good morning Mary.

120
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,290
This is Brandon.

121
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,400
Congratulations, you went nine and two
last Sunday. This is Walter Abrams.

122
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,470
I don't know if you know me. I run
the biggest sports service in the country,

123
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,300
and I'm a big fan of yours, Brandon.

124
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,330
As a matter of fact,
I've got a poster of you on my wall.

125
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,190
- This is a joke right?
- No, this is not ajoke. This is ajob offer.

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,650
In your top drawer- go ahead, open it up -
there's an envelope with your name on it.

127
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,340
Now, that's travel cash and an airline
ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon.

128
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,970
I paid someone to put it there,

129
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,080
who told me that the place you're in
reminded him of a Turkish prison.

130
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,960
Now, all I'm asking you to do
is come up with a number.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,540
You write down the number
of what you make now, you cross it out,

132
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,590
you write what you should be making,

133
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,220
and then toss in how much it's gonna take
to get you to fly to New York first-class

134
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,160
and come work for me.

135
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,660
Now, focus, Brandon, focus.

136
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,500
With your bum knee, a comeback
isjust a dream. My offer is real.

137
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,790
Run the numbers, do the math.

138
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,500
Hold on a second. Yeah.

139
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,220
Mom holding twojobs,
Denny going to college,

140
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,240
this looked like a chance
to make some real money.

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,240
And besides, I'd never seen New York
and New York had never seen me.

142
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,020
Oh goodness. Hey.

143
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,370
All right.

144
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,070
So what's this guy Walter like?
How long have you been working for him?

145
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,380
A long time.

146
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,510
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.

147
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,580
Every day with Walter's an adventure.

148
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,410
Super cool, super mean

149
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,170
Feelin' good for the man,
supertly, here I stand

150
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,380
Secret stash, heavy bread,
baddest bitches in the bed

151
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,990
I'm your pusherman

152
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,530
I'm your pusherman

153
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,430
That's OK.

154
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,280
All right double it. Triple it.

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,060
No everything's about money.

156
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,520
Listen this Sunday my little girl
an angel turns six.

157
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,250
This is not likely to happen again.

158
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,260
She loves elephants.
Your circus has ten. I only need one.

159
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,530
Now my little girl's happiness
is in your hands.

160
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,700
I don't need advice
from a guy who doubles as a clown.

161
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,580
I need a fucking elephant.
Now I'm willing to pay.

162
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,940
What'll it take to grease your wheels
and get one here this weekend? Hello?

163
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,990
Fuckwad!

164
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,890
Find Ringling Brothers. Get someone
who understands profit. Whoa!

165
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,620
Brandon Lang.

166
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,810
The Marlboro man here.

167
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,080
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey you're in great shape.

168
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,640
- I've been in better.
- You're modest too. Oh!

169
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,170
Modesty - not a virtue.
Could be a vice. Sit down.

170
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,430
There are rules to success my friend.

171
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,970
Rule number one is know what you know
know what you don't know

172
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,770
and know that I gotta know everything
you know as soon as you know it.

173
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,020
- Sooner.
- Yes sir.

174
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,670
- You ever sell before?
- No.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,000
- Are you religious?
- I believe in God.

176
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,090
Hey Liz.

177
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,370
This is me 30 years ago right?
It's remarkable the resemblance.

178
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,140
I mean he's a little taller. I'll give him that.

179
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,920
Oh boy you know I'm not supposed
to do this. It's bad for my... condition.

180
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,460
Nobody knows this Liz OK?

181
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,340
So before I die...

182
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,350
Did you do anything
other than sports phone in Vegas?

183
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,330
Just the 900 recordings
you know 10 bucks a call.

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,790
That's chump change.

185
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,560
I mean we're going after
much bigger fish here.

186
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,510
You know networks don't talk about it
government can't tax it

187
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,420
but sports betting
is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year business.

188
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,360
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

189
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,550
A lot of gamblers out there man
and they have needs.

190
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:32,060
And come Monday morning after a losing
weekend they got big needs. Gargantuan.

191
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,230
See that? That's every
football game played last Sunday.

192
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,290
You know why Monday-night football's
the most watched game of the week?

193
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,300
Monday's the last chance bettors have
to climb out of the hole they got in

194
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,240
to pay their bookies on Tuesday.

195
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,560
Sports betting's illegal in 49 states
including this one.

196
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,390
But what we do is not.

197
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,460
We are 100% legal like stockbrokers

198
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,840
only instead of counting stocks
we advise people on how to bet.

199
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,680
Now if a client wins by taking our advice
we get a percentage or we ask for one

200
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,480
which they will gladly give us because
they want to keep getting the advice.

201
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,560
But if they lose we get zip.

202
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,490
So the object here my dear
tall athletic religious friend is to win.

203
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,890
I can do that.

204
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,040
- Hello. This is Walter...
- Hello Walter.

205
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,650
That's my cable show.

206
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,880
Now, after a nice
five-day vacation on my yacht...

207
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,820
Airs Saturday and Sunday morning
nationwide. We tape Thursday and Fri...

208
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,590
What's going on with my hair?

209
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,260
He did it again Liz.

210
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,910
I got one part of my head in Cleveland
the other's in Chicago.

211
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,020
What are we gonna do with this guy?
My barber. Should be shot. I want him dead.

212
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,270
For the first time,

213
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,630
I'm gonna release our three-team
college and pro parlays absolutely free.

214
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,430
If all the picks are free
how'd you get the yacht?

215
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,320
There's no yacht.

216
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,190
Next question.

217
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,300
Why give any picks for free?
Why not charge a fee up-front initially?

218
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,810
You make a good point. Next.

219
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,260
What's on the second floor?

220
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,320
That's where we print the money.

221
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,250
- Anything else?
- Of course not.

222
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,300
No I think I've got it.
I think everything's crystal clear Walter.

223
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,320
I like you you know that?
You and me - this thing's gonna work.

224
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,760
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

225
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,800
Ringling Brothers on one.

226
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,010
Tell them to hold that elephant.
You ever have a manicure?

227
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,640
There's a girl you gotta meet.

228
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,000
- Yeah? What's she like?
- She's beautiful. You're gonna like her.

229
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,460
Is this Barnum or Bailey?

230
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,180
- I've got it.
- He's all yours.

231
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,010
- Brandon?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,930
- Hi. I'm Toni.
- Nice to meet you.

233
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,980
Walter said you'd stop by.

234
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,370
- This was his idea.
- Yeah I know.

235
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,920
Does he make
all of his employees do this?

236
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,280
- Yep. Every one.
- How often?

237
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,610
Once. Before they start work.

238
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,760
- Weird.
- You think?

239
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,370
I never had my nails done before.

240
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,950
Yeah I can see that
but you've got strong hands. That's nice.

241
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,580
Do you drink?

242
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,190
Excuse me?

243
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,940
- Alcohol. Are you a drinker?
- I have a beer every once in a while.

244
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,510
- Do you smoke?
- No.

245
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,260
- What about gambling?
- What about it?

246
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,490
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit pressed for time.

247
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,410
- I asked do you bet? Are you a bettor?
- No.

248
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,550
Really?

249
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,370
Why not?

250
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,610
Toni huh?

251
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,450
- Are you here full time?
- Yeah no this is my shop. I better be.

252
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,800
So why don't you gamble?

253
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,430
Well I did once.
I wagered everything I had and I lost.

254
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,640
So?

255
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,670
I just swore I'd never do it again.

256
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,860
- You're sticking to that story?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,670
I'm not gonna start
this relationship off by lying.

258
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,820
That's good. Walter could definitely use
someone with a little resolve in his life.

259
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,640
Hey Toni.

260
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,180
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

261
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,120
What do you say?

262
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,190
- He didn't tell you.
- Tell me what?

263
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,590
Brandon Walter and I are married.

264
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,800
Oh. Oh bogey. Wait a minute.
Wait wait wait. Listen.

265
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,640
He said to come to meet a nice lady...

266
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,560
I'm sure he did.
That's OK. I'll kill him when I get home.

267
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,290
He has a big bright beautiful spirit
though and you will love working for him.

268
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,130
But he is held together by meetings.

269
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,090
If it has "anonymous" at the end
he goes. He has to.

270
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,860
He also has to be careful
who he lets into his life.

271
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,970
Most ways Walter's brilliant
but he can be bullshitted and I can't.

272
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,910
He sends them to me before hiring them.

273
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,660
- So this was my interview.
- Oh you're swift.

274
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,390
How'd I do?

275
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,980
Except for an illegal forward pass perfect.
Congratulations.

276
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,340
Thank you very much.

277
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,900
1-800-238-6648.

278
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,490
1-800 bet on it. Absolutely free.

279
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,350
This is the first floor,
and it's all yours.

280
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,830
The TV's satellite and it swivels.

281
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,770
Your bedroom.

282
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,780
Got a Jacuzzi in there
the size of a kiddy pool.

283
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,360
You know what this is?
Looks like weights to me.

284
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,410
Yeah baby.

285
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,890
Now I'm gonna put your copy here...

286
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,350
on your desk.

287
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,330
Walter this is sweet ass.

288
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,650
- A man's chair.
- That's what I'm talking about.

289
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,120
OK. I'm gonna start you on the 900 numbers.
Same gig you had in Vegas.

290
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,660
Make your picks record them each day.
Monday through Friday once a day.

291
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,540
- Five times a day on a weekend.
- Mm-hm.

292
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,620
Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot.

293
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:07,110
Now we're doing about
three dozen hits a week. That's nothing.

294
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,670
We should triple that.

295
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,510
Now before you get into your test copy
here I got a few words for you.

296
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,560
Your pitch sucks. No offence.

297
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,870
But you got potential
so we gotta find a way to bust you out.

298
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,400
- Bust me out?
- Yeah.

299
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,980
We're gonna start
by giving you a new name.

300
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,800
John Anthony. Just came to me.

301
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,390
John Anthony the million-dollar man.

302
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,220
What's wrong with Brandon Lang?

303
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,960
Nothing's wrong with Brandon Lang.
It's just that he's still living with his mommy.

304
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,690
John Anthony's living large.

305
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,020
He don't hold back.
He's got a direct line to God.

306
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,180
And for a measly 25 bucks a call
he's gonna let the world's losers listen in.

307
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,430
"Hello sports fans.

308
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,640
"This is John Anthony in the Big Apple
with my big-money picks.

309
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,210
"The action starts Saturday
with college ball

310
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,790
"and our first match-up
is Michigan against Indiana.

311
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,730
"The Wolverines... "

312
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,510
I already hung up.

313
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,200
John Anthony here ready to make
all your betting dreams come true.

314
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,750
That's right.
Call me right now and let me win for you.

315
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,290
The point spread
in the Indiana-Michigan game is at...

316
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,270
- I think it's all right.
- Wrong.

317
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,610
Mm-hm.

318
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,280
OK what's your sales pitch?

319
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,180
My sales pitch is I'm picking 80% winners.

320
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,160
Stats is not enough.

321
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,450
I'm telling you you need a voice.

322
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,600
These are gamblers ready to risk what
they can't afford for what they can't have.

323
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,000
You're selling
the world's rarest commodity.

324
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,610
You're selling certainty...

325
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,010
in an uncertain world.

326
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,640
John Anthony here
the million-dollar man.

327
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,540
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood. All
your big money stays and plays with me.

328
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,380
Sit back and relax. It's a Scud attack this
weekend. I am shelling your bookmaker.

329
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,140
Follow his block and cut to the right.
Going in Liz. Going in.

330
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,580
That's it isn't it? Huh?

331
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,330
- It's a start.
- It's a start?

332
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,000
What can I tell you?

333
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,220
That's not what you want
then you need to find somebody else to sell

334
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,260
and let me just pick.

335
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,600
It's not about what I want.

336
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,200
You understand?
It's about what Brandon wants.

337
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,540
If I hear that I'm calling this number.

338
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,500
Whoa whoa whoa.
Easy easy. Easy easy.

339
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,320
What is it? What is it? What is it?

340
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,780
Shh.

341
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,760
Should I call somebody?

342
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,620
Not unless they got a spare heart.

343
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,370
Shh.

344
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,590
Oh it's a small one. It's a teeny one.

345
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,530
Breathe it out.

346
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,170
- What do you need? Some water?
- I'll be all right.

347
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,790
Oh I know what I want.

348
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,390
I know what I want.

349
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,910
Be a good boy and get me a light.
Right there.

350
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,870
What are you doing?

351
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,560
Courage wants to laugh.

352
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,150
He makes the snap,
looks right, he throws.

353
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,880
Phillips in for the touchdown!

354
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,510
...clearly in the defense
that does not give up the big plays.

355
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,870
...23 over West Virginia.
Pittsburgh on a 47-yard field goal

356
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,500
leads Virginia 10-7.

357
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,210
North Carolina and Florida are scoreless.

358
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,260
25th ranked Kansas trails Mississippi 7-3.
We'll be back with more scores...

359
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,700
Back to the one-yard line...

360
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,100
...and it will go against Utah again.

361
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,270
With time-out on the field,
let's go to our studios in New York

362
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,510
for an update on today's college football.

363
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,590
Brandon!

364
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,610
How we doing?

365
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,860
Down here.

366
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,390
...while Michigan
just put the hammer to Illinois. 44-12.

367
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,580
Florida - no problem
beating North Carolina 42 to 7,

368
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,750
while Northern Washington
upset Iowa State 28-21.

369
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,820
Pennsylvania
manhandled Kentucky 31 to 3.

370
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,760
Bullshit!

371
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,560
...with a 17-7 win at Idaho.

372
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,320
And thisjust in. Arizona is hot.

373
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,350
All right! All right!

374
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,750
This guy is a machine. I mean he...

375
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,820
All he does is work out and pick winners.

376
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,240
Talk about fit.
You should see him with his shirt off.

377
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,640
Really. I did. A serious side of beef.

378
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,010
Enjoy your daughter's birthday. Come on.

379
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,600
What do you mean?
You should check him out.

380
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,900
- I know you want to.
- Walter.

381
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,570
Get out of your head.
It's a bad neighborhood.

382
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,530
Touchdown!

383
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,750
I'm gonna have the bruchetta here
and this right here.

384
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,090
Very good.
And may I say sir an excellent choice.

385
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,260
I think it's pronounced "bruschetta. "
"Bruschetta. "

386
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,700
They're little pizzas
but they don't have cheese in them.

387
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,950
- Bruschetta?
- Perfect.

388
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,520
Who cares? Anyone who goes 20 for 24
college football 12 for 14 professional

389
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:59,050
175 calls on the 900 number you can
call bruschetta anything you want son.

390
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,340
Ever have
a thousand-dollar bottle of wine?

391
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,970
- No.
- Steward!

392
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,290
- Walter it's a waste. He hardly drinks.
- It's a celebration. Steward.

393
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,120
- Walter it's...
- Toni come on.

394
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,920
Just 'cause he's with reformed drunks
doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.

395
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,840
I was a lot of things Walter
I was never a drunk.

396
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,990
Actually truth be told

397
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,780
I've never had
a 12-dollar bottle of water either.

398
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,390
- He thinks we're fighting.
- Yeah.

399
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:30,750
No I don't. Look hey this is great
all of this. Thank you Walter Toni.

400
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,360
Watch out Walter. He's a fixer.

401
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,700
- I should've ordered two.
- What did the doctor say? Come on.

402
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,120
Well if you really want to know - I've been
meaning to tell you - I went yesterday

403
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,160
and he seemed very concerned.

404
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,170
Afterwards he sat me down
and looked into my eyes and he said:

405
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,840
"Walter...

406
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,800
"who do you like
in the Buffalo-Oakland game?"

407
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,740
- You tell him Buffalo?
- Shit Walter. It wasn't funny.

408
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,480
You didn't know I was joking?
It's a joke. Jokes are funny.

409
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,570
Wow what a meal.
You haven't touched your sauce.

410
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,030
It's chocolate. I hear it's good for you.

411
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,140
- I'm not raising a kid alone Walter.
- Come on don't be dramatic Toni.

412
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,410
In biblical times you'd just move in
with my brother Morty anyway.

413
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,520
Oh look at that.

414
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,700
Beauty and the beasts.
What do you think?

415
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,570
I like her man.
I think she's extremely cute.

416
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,590
Brandon she's looking at you.

417
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,410
Yeah but so are
those two guys she's with.

418
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,560
I tell you what. I'll bet you ten to one
on a thousand you can't pick her up.

419
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,860
That's 10000 cash
if you leave this restaurant with that girl.

420
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,170
I have a better idea. Why don't we go to
Atlantic City and open a house account?

421
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,910
You know you can't gamble. Come on.

422
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:01,370
Who's gambling? I haven't flipped a coin
since the '80s. This is just a challenge.

423
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,780
A challenge?

424
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,400
10000... to one.

425
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,940
- Cash?
- Mm-hm.

426
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,110
What are you gonna do?

427
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,130
- I'm gonna introduce myself.
- Before...

428
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,870
Before you make your move sit.

429
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,510
- Where are you going?
- No problem. Don't worry.

430
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,910
You sit here and rest your little self.

431
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,020
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt
or anything but I just gotta know this.

432
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,150
We're sitting over there
with my friends and I'm thinking...

433
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,240
You are drop-dead gorgeous
and we just want to know...

434
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,090
Your dates look like they haven't
missed a meal since Christ died.

435
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,890
Seriously you're eating
like you got a date with the electric chair.

436
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,250
What is going on? No no no.

437
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,580
It's all over. Sit sit sit.

438
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,520
Just joking. Sorry.

439
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,480
- I don't want to get wounded with a fork.
- Jerk. Moron.

440
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,390
- I'm gone. Thank you very much.
- What the hell was that?

441
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,430
- I went too far.
- Oh yeah.

442
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,540
- I'll buy them a bottle of champagne.
- You'll pick up their check.

443
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,260
The voice of reason.

444
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,960
Thank you. Uh-oh.

445
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,400
Your date's going to the bathroom.

446
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,600
I don't think that
helped me out too much do you?

447
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,490
Well...

448
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,610
But hey thanks for the introduction.

449
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,690
Hey I was just raising the bar a little.

450
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,500
John Anthony could close her.

451
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,390
You are beautiful.

452
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,560
- Excuse me.
- Hang on a second.

453
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,170
I want to get to know you.

454
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,540
You just want to get in my pants.

455
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,860
No. No no no no no. I want to get
in your mind and your heart and your soul

456
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:55,140
and I don't see you
wearing any pants in that equation.

457
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,830
Do you?

458
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,900
Let me ask you something.

459
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:46,130
OK, forget the 900 numbers.
Now you're ready.

460
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,010
We're moving up.
We're going to the second floor.

461
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,430
This is where we print the money.
Put your ear to the door.

462
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,100
Wow.

463
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,390
That's the sound of possibilities.

464
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,980
This is it. This is where
the sales people turn a ten-dollar bettor

465
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:05,320
into a 1000-dollar bettor
before he knows he made the call.

466
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,650
I'm asking do they use
Astroturf or AstroPlay?

467
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,320
Tammy. Give it up baby.

468
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,620
- You know what I need.
- Sure do.

469
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,330
- Tammy this is Brandon.
- How are you Tammy?

470
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,020
OK this is our phone sheet.
The losers who need us.

471
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,860
The more they bet the more we win.

472
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,490
We take 10% of a winning bet
anywhere from 500 to 500000.

473
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,730
- That's Southie.
- Let's make some serious money.

474
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,910
- What's the game plan?
- You know what?

475
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,230
You're a private security guard.
Bang a cheerleader extract the information.

476
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,340
Well it was a substantial sum.
Walter he's a little miffed at our picks.

477
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,800
Just do what you got to do.

478
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,340
It says right here
that the minimum bet is five grand.

479
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,780
Reggie Hawks. Best salesman ever. Ever.

480
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,370
I don't have time for this kind of shit
Jimmy. I know you're a loser.

481
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,080
If you were a big winner
you wouldn't pay to call me.

482
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,050
You got your head
outta your ass yet?

483
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,340
Is this my office?

484
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,760
- Well do you like it?
- What's not to like Walter? Thank you.

485
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,270
Miami New York point spread
just went up to ten.

486
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,850
- What do you think?
- Miami is a lock. Are you kidding me?

487
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,480
This is Jerry my top handicapper.
Came to me straight out of grad school.

488
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,940
Whoa. Phone boy makes good huh?
It's a big jump from 900 numbers.

489
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,340
Make sure you don't get
a nosebleed up here. I'm just kidding.

490
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,700
- Nice meeting you. Gotta get to work.
- Nice meeting you too.

491
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,690
Say by the way tonight's game...

492
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,650
New York wins that outright.

493
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,900
Really?

494
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,090
They always play the Fish tough
and tonight it's foregone.

495
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:47,620
I wish I had a pen because I would
never write that down. You know...

496
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,180
college is right for you.

497
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,820
You have to work your way up
to pro ball around here. Good luck.

498
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:57,420
Rookie's got balls.
I almost like it but I don't. Good luck.

499
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,880
I get that all day.

500
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,880
You know I got three guys who can
pick games I got 20 who can sell.

501
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,610
I never had one who could do both.

502
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,910
- What? You mean me?
- No not you.

503
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,580
I'm talking about John Anthony.

504
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,210
John Anthony doesn't exist.

505
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
Oh? Well I'm shocked

506
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,460
because I'm standing in his office
and you're sitting in his chair.

507
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,970
So you want me to sell.

508
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,200
- Like those guys out there?
- Yes.

509
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,580
Big bettors don't want middlemen.
They want the guy giving them the picks.

510
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,390
- You got a problem with selling?
- No. I don't have a...

511
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,440
There's a few choice phrases we use here.

512
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,250
You just start with those.
Now here's an easy one.

513
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,840
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's fucking money.

514
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,930
Give it back to me.

515
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,210
I don't want your money.

516
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,410
I want your bookie's money.

517
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's money.

518
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,830
That's not bad.

519
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,480
- What happened to "fuck"?
- What about it?

520
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,050
- I said it. You don't use it?
- Nah.

521
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,840
- Really? A religious thing?
- No it's not a religious thing. I just...

522
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,030
It was all right for Chaucer 600 years ago.

523
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,570
Hey! I don't want to embarrass you
but I gotta do this.

524
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,060
I got someone here
who has a problem saying "fuck. "

525
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,980
- Hold on.
- Fuck you!

526
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,720
Look at that.
A lot of brunettes.

527
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,390
Where are we headed?

528
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,100
We're gonna continue your education.

529
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:33,100
- Hi. Is this the meeting?
- Yes yes. Come on in. Hi.

530
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:38,310
You'd think with two mortgages out
the repo guys staking out my car

531
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,470
my job on the line and my wife
threatening to leave that I'd stop

532
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,760
instead of staying in the chase
doubling down.

533
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,700
It's a disease Leon.

534
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,600
Yeah man. Look admitting
you have a problem is the first step.

535
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,130
Yeah.

536
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:57,860
I guess I must be doing pretty good
because I've got one big problem.

537
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,680
- Don't worry about it Leon.
- It's OK Leon.

538
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,450
- Hang in there Leon.
- Hey.

539
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,100
My name is Walter
and I'm new to this group...

540
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,200
Hey Walter.

541
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,420
...but I am not new to these meetings.
I've been coming 18 years now.

542
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,590
As a matter of fact friends
this is my 936th consecutive meeting.

543
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,260
Hey man well done.

544
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,180
Well done is right.

545
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,270
And in all that time I haven't once been
to a track or a casino or bet on a game.

546
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,420
Hand to God not a cent.

547
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,860
So I know where you're coming from Leon.

548
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,920
Believe me I know. I heard your story
and it's something I relate to

549
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,080
but I gotta say if I learned anything
it's that gambling is not your problem.

550
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,600
- It's not?
- Not even close.

551
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,580
I don't know how to say this without
sounding rude but you're a lemon Leon.

552
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,170
Like a bad car there is something
inherently defective in you.

553
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,130
And you. And you. And me.
And all of us in this room.

554
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:02,000
We're all lemons.
We look like everybody else

555
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,700
but what makes us different is our defect.

556
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,710
You see most gamblers
when they go to gamble they go to win.

557
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,110
When we go to gamble
we go to lose subconsciously.

558
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:18,470
Me I never feel better or more alive
than when they're raking the chips away

559
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,660
not bringing them in and everybody
knows what I'm talking about.

560
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,980
Hell even when we win it's just
a matter of time before we give it all back.

561
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,100
But when we lose
now there's another story when we lose.

562
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,360
I'm talking about the kind of loss

563
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,590
that makes your asshole pucker up
to the size of a decimal point.

564
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,530
You know what I mean? You've just
recreated the worst possible nightmare

565
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,040
this side of malignant cancer
for the 20th goddamn time

566
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,520
and you're standing there
and you suddenly realize:

567
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,030
"Hey I'm still here.

568
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,390
"I'm still breathing.

569
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,670
"I'm still alive. "

570
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,590
Us lemons we fuck shit up
all the time on purpose

571
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:00,490
because we constantly
need to remind ourselves we're alive.

572
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Leon gambling's not your problem.

573
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,120
It's this fucked-up need

574
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,000
to feel something

575
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,920
to convince yourself you exist.

576
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,300
That's the problem.

577
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,340
Hey you're the guy I see on TV
every weekend selling betting picks.

578
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,940
- So what?
- Oh yeah he's right. This guy...

579
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,090
This guy peddles a tout service on TV.

580
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:36,220
You read the charter buddy?
We all left our jobs at the door.

581
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,330
Are you gonna throw an ex-alcoholic
bartender out of an AA meeting?

582
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,580
- What?
- You're gonna do that? That's bogus.

583
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,440
- Hey didn't you come in with this jerk?
- Come on.

584
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,050
I don't like the feeling I'm getting.

585
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,610
If you rethink things here's my card.

586
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,620
We're topping 80% this season.
Put it in your wallet.

587
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,600
- You never know when you'll relapse.
- Get out!

588
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,870
What the fuck was that?

589
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,480
- What did you just say?
- That was bullshit.

590
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,860
- You gave your business card...
- No no. You said fuck.

591
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,240
- So what?
- Brandon. So what? That's great man.

592
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,700
It was all worth it just from that one word.

593
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:20,060
From the one word fuck I could feel
your frustration I could feel your anger.

594
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,410
Man I'm proud of you.

595
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,300
His name is Amir.

596
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,870
He's a dime bettor.

597
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,180
Owns a dry cleaners.

598
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,770
- We got him for the subscription.
- Amir...

599
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,310
He's on line one. Mm ding ding.

600
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,200
Mm.

601
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,760
Good morning.

602
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,930
Walter wanted
your first call to be special.

603
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,750
- OK. Go get 'em tiger.
- You got it.

604
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,400
Me-me-me-me-ow-ow-ow!

605
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,020
Mm-hm.

606
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,930
- Amir my man. John Anthony here.
- Yes. Hello.

607
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,650
Yes, hello to you, sir.
How's your morning?

608
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,600
Mine started off outstanding.
Not as outstanding as I plan my weekend being.

609
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,160
Billy listen.
Thanks for the $15000 FedEx.

610
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,230
It's called a three-team parlay.
It pays six to one.

611
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,520
How much can you lay? 20 grand?

612
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,460
Are you crazy?

613
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,110
No way. Listen
I was betting a thousand a game.

614
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:32,740
I've got a game that I'm calling
my lock of the decade OK? Texas v OU.

615
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,880
Now Texas is receiving
six points in this game.

616
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,000
- They're gonna win it by two touchdowns.
- Really?

617
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,770
- I like Oklahoma in that game.
- You do?

618
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,320
I shouldn't have called.
Thank you for your time.

619
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,400
Hold on. I've got Vegas on the line.

620
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:51,160
When we get our 30 grand from last night
then I tell you who he likes next week.

621
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,580
The only thing you gotta know about any
of our clients is that they're all in a hole.

622
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,930
The second they pick up the phone
you got 'em.

623
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,040
I'll tell you once. Green Bay Dallas
Cleveland. 100000 across the board.

624
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,340
Get to the point you're above them.

625
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,240
Let 'em know it. Let 'em feel it.
More John Anthony.

626
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,970
Amir.

627
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,180
- What's your favorite drink my man?
- Favorite drink?

628
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,020
I don't know.

629
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,830
- Pia colada.
- Whoa.

630
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,980
Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink
but today here's what you're gonna do.

631
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,010
You're gonna go down to your bookie
and lay 20 large on Texas.

632
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,240
Then you'll go home
put on your favorite Hawaiian shirt

633
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,810
and you'll sit back
twirl your little umbrella

634
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:39,170
after you've made that rum concoction
with the orange slice and the cherry

635
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,410
and you'll watch Texas
rip those Okies a new asshole.

636
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,490
And after you win the 20 grand,
you're gonna call me back

637
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,860
and you're gonna tell me,
"Thank you, sir. May I have another?"

638
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,520
McNeil lost his dog last week
to a hunting accident.

639
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,020
You don't mess with a man
who just lost his dog.

640
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,610
Western Union me ten thou
and let's ride this wave into Sunday.

641
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,690
Denny boy!
I've got something good for this weekend.

642
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,900
Green Bay against Minnesota. I want
you to lay $500 on the Cheeseheads.

643
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,240
Let Stu in on that too
and take care of Mama. Talk to you later.

644
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,390
Tammy who's on four?

645
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,750
Forget the other games you wanted to bet.

646
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,440
Let's throw that 4000 on this 1000
and make it five

647
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,840
take it money line and turn it into 12000.

648
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,920
John Anthony here.

649
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,360
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to "Football Tonight. "

650
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,780
...ten-yard
line, he passes and that's a blind throw...

651
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,720
He's in the end zone!

652
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,790
- Touchdown!
- Yes!

653
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,690
Good ball game.
10-7. Oakland upsets New York.

654
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,120
OK. No that sounds good.
Actually you know what? Monday...

655
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,730
Go Daddy go! Can't you go any faster?

656
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,970
Hey! Ten and two pro football?

657
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,160
85% weekend. You're a mutant!

658
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,110
I definitely want to be there with him.
Put it on a plate.

659
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,020
Oh my God. Thank you. You saved my life.
That is beautiful.

660
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,790
What... What's going on?

661
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:20,110
Walter's doctor - this is good news -
finally put him on an exercise program.

662
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,630
I want to be there the first time

663
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,260
to make sure the trainer understands
his aversion to consistency. Excuse me.

664
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,410
- Aversion to consistency?
- Mm-hm.

665
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,480
That's Walter. He's always been that way.

666
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,380
- Well that's consistent.
- Well that's true.

667
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,500
You are cute. Take a bite.
Tell me what you think.

668
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,110
Life is fucking good.

669
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,120
So... let's talk about making it better.

670
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,830
Uh-oh. Duck Brandon. Here it comes.

671
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm thinking of putting
John Anthony on TV this week.

672
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,490
If you do this from here on out

673
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,090
you're gonna have to eat sleep

674
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,820
drink breathe

675
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,830
talk walk and fart John Anthony.

676
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,210
That's the way it is.
There's no holding back.

677
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,940
You gotta be it
completely or it doesn't work.

678
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,630
That's right and just think it over.
Don't decide now.

679
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:21,010
It's the only move.
If it means I've gotta act that's cool.

680
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,550
No. No acting. This is living.

681
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,170
You didn't hear me.

682
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,620
From here on out

683
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,750
Brandon Lang and his fettuccine knee

684
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:38,740
and his self-fucking-pity
is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair.

685
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,680
And John "I Can Walk On Fucking Water"
Anthony has taken his place.

686
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,390
Now listen
to what he's asking you Brandon.

687
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm gonna build an empire around you.

688
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,440
It's gonna cost me.

689
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:59,280
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Hell yeah I understand.

690
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,240
I'm John fucking Anthony.
I've got a crystal ball.

691
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,580
I am sitting on top of the world,
just rolling along

692
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,760
OK John Anthony breathes.

693
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,510
Now we gotta get a walk and talk.

694
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,180
I'm just asking.

695
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm looking for a car
for my friend here.

696
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,810
- Let's see. What's his name?
- John Anthony.

697
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,060
- Mr. Anthony.
- Yes sir.

698
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,150
- Do you have any credit?
- No.

699
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,250
Of course not. I don't know Wally
can you trust him?

700
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,190
With my wife.

701
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,360
- Naked.
- Well in that case the floor is yours.

702
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,220
Glory, hallelujah,
I just phoned the parson

703
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey, Pa, get ready to call

704
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,790
Just like Humpty Dumpty
I'm about to fall

705
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,800
- Hey what's "900 King"?
- That's me. John Anthony.

706
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,260
- I don't lose.
- Thank you.

707
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,680
I want you to meet Mr. Miracle
John Anthony. There he is.

708
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,700
It's never ever gonna go down.

709
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,350
Give me all you got.

710
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,340
Singing a song

711
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,880
I'm ready. I'm ready.

712
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,800
A star is born today. How you doing?

713
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,840
- Scared shitless.
- You're sweating.

714
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,470
You'll be all right. Don't worry. You've got
the script. Read off the TelePrompTer.

715
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,310
You've been here before kid.

716
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,170
- Remember football?
- No this is different.

717
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,940
- How's this different?
- No opponent.

718
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,840
- Then you're a lock to win.
- Walter we're ready.

719
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:39,390
You'll be OK.
Remember stay with the script.

720
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,530
45 seconds.

721
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:44,760
- That's a lifetime.
- For you boss. This is for you.

722
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:47,940
Tony, you good?
OK, everybody, we're gonna go.

723
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,670
- We back?
- Places.

724
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,900
- John Anthony huh?
- Yep.

725
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,130
All's I see is another wannabe
in a thousand-dollar suit.

726
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,840
Word to the wise
keep the suit you came in with.

727
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,820
All right Jethro? Good luck to you.

728
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,080
In five four...

729
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,040
- I'll do that.
... three two...

730
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,440
Welcome to this week's Sports Advisors,

731
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,170
America's premier sports-information
program with myself Walter Abrams

732
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,010
Jerry Sykes Chuck Adler

733
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,240
and a truly gifted newcomer
to the Sports Advisorpanel.

734
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,970
I want you to meet him a substantial find
and his name is John Anthony.

735
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,270
OK we're entering week six
in professional football.

736
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:30,430
This is when the cream rises to the top.
This is when things get hot.

737
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,400
This is oven-mitt time. Am I right?
This is big-time ball season.

738
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:39,560
So let's get right into it with the wizard
of odds Jerry "The Source" Sykes. Jerry.

739
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:43,060
Stats records rankings weather

740
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,920
if the goalpost is tilted just a little bit...

741
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,420
The SYKES system
uses 42 proven indexes

742
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,380
to eliminate
the guesswork in sports wagering.

743
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,160
Without my patented
computer-based picks

744
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,410
you got a better shot of having God
show up at your door with nine strippers

745
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,250
a bag of pure Bolivian cocaine

746
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,000
enough Viagra
to make Chuck's head blow off

747
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:07,250
than picking these things on your own.

748
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:11,460
You call me absolutely free. I got five
picks this weekend that are incredible.

749
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,970
1-800-238-6648. Give me a call.

750
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,390
How many gamblers did I bail out
last weekend with my game of the year?

751
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,840
A 100-dollar bettor made $10000.

752
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,130
A 500-dollar bettor made $50000.

753
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,340
Well I got six games on Sunday
that I'm releasing absolutely free.

754
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:34,260
These games are a burial
a blowout a human lock.

755
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:40,560
You can bet your children's unborn
children's children on these six games

756
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,750
absolutely free!

757
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,840
Whoa whoa I believe I believe!

758
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,960
I believe you're trying to make me deaf.

759
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:54,060
I've never seen a color on a man like that.
Would you say that's chartreuse?

760
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:59,120
So Saturday comes before Sunday and
looking at Saturday's college match-ups

761
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,560
is the last but certainly not least
member of the sports advisors.

762
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,380
- And here he is Mr. John Anthony.
- Thank you Walter.

763
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,320
This is John Anthony the million-dollar
man with the billion-dollar plan.

764
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,090
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood

765
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,970
all your big money
is gonna stay and play with me.

766
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:20,040
That's right. That's why
they call me the million-dollar man.

767
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,360
The million-dollar man the million-dollar
man the million-dollar man.

768
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,750
I can't say that man.

769
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,780
- Uh...
- No no.

770
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,890
Somebody wrote
some very clever stuff for me here

771
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,390
like the million-dollar man.

772
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,160
So let's just call me John.

773
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,500
I played quarterback division one.

774
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:50,010
Every QB knows that the secret
the key to victory is anticipation.

775
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,820
The ability to see the future and react to it.

776
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,600
Now that is what I do.

777
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,540
And that is the truth.

778
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,790
So I'm not gonna sell you today all right?
I'm just gonna tell you the facts.

779
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,840
For over one year

780
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,630
I have been picking 80% winners.

781
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,770
Unbelievable?

782
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:11,660
Used to be.

783
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,370
I know the leagues. I know the teams.

784
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:18,790
I know these players.
I know this wonderful game called football.

785
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,020
Call the number
on the bottom of your screen

786
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,000
and ask for John.

787
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,710
Let's make some money.

788
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,800
Walter.

789
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,850
- I'm not here. Go back to sleep.
- Walter it's four in the morning honey.

790
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,050
What a show.

791
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:01,190
Come to bed.

792
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,590
Man you should have seen him.

793
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,920
I just sat there and watched him roll.

794
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,260
I swear he made me
want to pick up a phone and call.

795
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:16,090
I took the sales boys down the Smith and Wo's
to get them primed for the weekend

796
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:21,880
and Chuck got so drunk he took a swing
at one of the deer heads on the wall.

797
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:25,010
I don't know what we're gonna do.
I'll hire more guys on Monday.

798
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,620
I got to. I gotta get more phones.

799
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,220
- Everything's amping up.
- Yeah?

800
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,260
This guy I'm telling you

801
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,480
I'm gonna do this whole dot-com thing
around him you know?

802
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:40,650
I swear if I had me when I was his age...

803
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,110
you know I never had a mentor.

804
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,070
Now I got a protg. You know?

805
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,850
Someone you hand it all down to.

806
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,540
If anything happens to me he steps in.

807
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,000
He steps in.

808
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,220
Just knowing that
with this thing you know.

809
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,400
- It's like having a son.
- Walter come here.

810
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,050
It's beautiful. It's beautiful beautiful.

811
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,970
- You gotta go back to sleep.
- What are you doing?

812
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:13,180
- I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go for a run.
- No. Walter...

813
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,630
- See the sunrise.
- Come here. Just for a second.

814
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,090
Come here. You're exhausted.

815
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:23,610
No I'm not. I wanna go do the bridge
thing you know up-up-up Fifth?

816
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,300
Walter I haven't seen you all day.
Just come to bed for one minute.

817
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,680
Just for a minute 'cause you know
I've got the trainer tomorrow.

818
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,670
- The trainer wants me to run.
- I know baby.

819
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,050
- He wants me to run in place you know?
- I know honey.

820
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,510
Run from one place to another place.

821
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:46,450
No time to sleep just because you're so
exhausted I mean that's no time to sleep.

822
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,220
You're right. No time for sleep.

823
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,600
I'll be right here
when you get back from your run.

824
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,120
That's nice of you.

825
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:58,440
- I'll be right here right beside you Walter.
- Oh that's nice of you.

826
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,840
I'm not going anywhere.

827
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,200
It's OK.

828
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,450
Just close your eyes
for one second before you go OK?

829
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,560
Know about Stokey
being out against New York?

830
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,360
- A knock would be nice Jerry.
- I'm kinda underwater here man.

831
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,650
- A yes or no would be great.
- No I don't.

832
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,550
If you know something or if you
hear anything you gotta let me know

833
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:28,070
'cause that's the way we work.

834
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,410
I'll rush right over stat.

835
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,230
I've been here six years.
You've been here one.

836
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:38,070
What are you doing in here?
Hit the phones man. Do some damage control.

837
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,110
Rewrite that friggin' computer program.

838
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:42,820
- Hey it was a fucked weekend.
- For some people.

839
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,510
There's a 50-dime bettor
who wants to talk to John Anthony.

840
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,160
- What's his name?
- Carl. He owns McDonald's franchises.

841
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,870
Wait a minute.
I landed that lead. He's my guy.

842
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,610
- Was.
- He's raiding my list now?

843
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,710
Your clients are jumping ship
you lactose-intolerant fuck. Get out.

844
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,280
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

845
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,760
We're home! We're home!
We're home! We're home!

846
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,450
- Can we play princess?
- Oh yes can we play princess.

847
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,830
You go get in your princess outfit.
Everything OK?

848
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,750
I'll put the groceries away
then I'll come and play.

849
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,530
- OK!
- You go ahead.

850
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,180
You got it made. You gotta admit that.

851
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,620
I got a little cab fare.

852
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,370
That... that won't hurt. Hey baby.

853
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,560
I can explain this. It's...

854
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:35,840
- Gail that's my wife Toni.
- Hi.

855
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,400
- Thank you.
- It's OK really.

856
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,350
- Walter I'll talk to you later OK? Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

857
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,180
What the hell's going on here Walter?

858
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,190
You don't seriously think
I had something to do with that girl now?

859
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:53,150
I just brought her up here to pay her off.
I got her for John. Come on.

860
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,190
- Don't bullshit me Walter.
- Oh no.

861
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,630
You can't be serious.
You think I slept with this girl?

862
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,320
- Who the hell's John? Who's John?
- John. John Anthony. Ring a bell?

863
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,260
You got Brandon a hooker?

864
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:10,150
He's working late he's in a new city
he has no friends. Yes I got him a hooker.

865
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,190
Are we gonna have this conversation?

866
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,310
Are you completely
completely clueless Walter?

867
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,110
- Why are you so angry?
- Why am I so angry?

868
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,410
Look at you.
You're jealous. Look at you.

869
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:27,040
- Oh God. Jealous of what? Of what?
- I don't know. Brandon getting laid.

870
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,630
You really are crazy.
'Cause that sick thought never entered my mind.

871
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,760
Oh that's not where those thoughts enter.

872
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,050
OK I'm done. I'm done. That's it.

873
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:42,790
You'll be happy to know he didn't
sleep with her. I just paid her for coming.

874
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,180
- Pardon the pun.
- Oh you're hysterical.

875
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,120
- Daddy!
- Oh!

876
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,900
- Daddy!
- Where's my baby?

877
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,020
Look at her! Look at her! Look at her!

878
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:57,070
Coming up, week-seven predictions
with our new star John Anthony,

879
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,140
who went an amazing 24 and six
in last weekend's games.

880
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,810
- Jerry.
- Yeah.

881
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,350
John's up first tonight.

882
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,790
- What?
- John Anthony is leading off tonight.

883
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,230
- John Anthony's leading off?
- Is there an echo in here?

884
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,470
Engineer! Sound!
Help me I'm hearing everything twice.

885
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,370
Two years I lead off and you bury me
in the deck over a couple lousy weekends?

886
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,710
- This is bullshit Walter.
- ... three two...

887
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,730
Welcome to week seven.

888
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,190
- I'm in the garage.
- Hook it up?

889
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,940
- Yeah. You wanna hear it?
- Man let me hear it.

890
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,860
OK.

891
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,480
- It is the bomb.
- Oh that's what I'm talking about.

892
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,040
That's what I'm talking about my man.

893
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,690
I'm about to head out.
Everything else cool?

894
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,050
Yeah sort of. Did Dad reach you?

895
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:55,570
- Dad? No. Why?
- Must be out of money. He keeps calling.

896
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,300
He saw you on TV and wants to talk.

897
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,990
I gave him your work number but
he says they won't put him through.

898
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,600
I don't know what that's about.
I'll check into it.

899
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,170
Let's walk.
You could use the exercise.

900
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,500
Stop worrying. We're set for life.
We got Jimmy the Greek here.

901
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:15,910
He makes Nostra-fucking-damus look like
a novelty act. Brandon to the right.

902
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,430
You love that don't you?

903
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,490
- Let me ask you a question Walter.
- Shoot.

904
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,580
Have you been blocking any of my calls?

905
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,640
Of course. You don't need
distractions right now my boy.

906
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:31,650
- Lot of crazies out there.
- Does that include my father?

907
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:36,350
You're asking me
I'm gonna tell you. Yeah.

908
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,430
You son of a bitch.

909
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,040
How long?

910
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,810
- About two weeks.
- Walter.

911
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,130
Come on. Brandon would you
have taken the call if I put it through?

912
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,630
That's not the point. That's not the point.

913
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:56,260
What is the point? I'd like to know.
What's the story with you and your father?

914
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:59,390
- You tell me. You seem to know.
- Well I know pieces.

915
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,430
That's about all.

916
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,860
- Hey man I was just trying to spare you.
- Who are you gonna spare me from huh?

917
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:09,190
He was a drunk left when I was nine.
I couldn't compete with the bottle.

918
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,010
End of fucking story.
So you won't spare me nothing.

919
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,810
If I want to talk to him I will.
Spare me. You fuck.

920
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,060
Is that it? Is that all you got?

921
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,370
I will match my dysfunctional childhood
and Toni's against yours any day.

922
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:29,630
My father - five foot arms like this.
He had a cock like a Hebrew National.

923
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,870
If I even looked at him the wrong way
he'd smack me like Jake LaMotta.

924
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,870
By the time I was five he yelled at me
so much I thought my name was asshole.

925
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,710
Broke my nose three times.

926
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,100
Toni tell him about you. Come on.

927
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:45,590
- I didn't have a great childhood either.
- Great?

928
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,150
Tell him about the uncle.

929
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,920
Well I think he gets the idea now.

930
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:54,240
Come on. Suffice it to say she was
abused by everybody but the family pet.

931
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,870
OK Walter please.

932
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:59,520
Your father was a drunk.
He was a jerk. So what?

933
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,310
It happens. I'm glad
I blocked those calls. You know why?

934
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:06,130
You need a new image of a man.
How about me?

935
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,390
- She's laughing.
- 'Cause that's a scary fucking thought.

936
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,220
Hey Brandon listen to me man.

937
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,020
The shit that happened to you
to me to Toni you know what that is?

938
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,060
It's just that shit that happened

939
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,500
because after the therapy
and the psychiatry

940
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,360
and the meetings
you know what it all comes down to?

941
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:28,510
We're all fucked up.

942
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:31,160
We are alljust so fucked up.

943
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,620
Now you gotta just say that shit out.

944
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,540
"I am fucked up
and I ain't gonna take it anymore. "

945
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,440
Come on. You too Toni. Let's do it.
All of us. Wallow with me here a minute.

946
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:44,190
We are so fucked up
we're not gonna take it anymore.

947
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,170
I am so fucked up with all of you

948
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,140
that I'm not gonna take it anymore.

949
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,600
How's that?

950
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,140
Hey! I'm trying to sleep here asshole.

951
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,180
- That you Dad?
- OK Walter.

952
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,210
I'm gonna kick your fucking head in.

953
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:01,500
- Let's go.
- Don't wait up.

954
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,210
Amir you've got to be kidding me huh?

955
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:10,370
Are you gonna haggle over 50 grand
after the 250000 I just made you last weekend?

956
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,850
Look don't get me wrong John.
50000 seems slightly steep.

957
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,940
Steep. Amir let's rewind a second.

958
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,570
First time you call... No cuff.
... you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon

959
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,820
crying about having
to hock your fiance's ring.

960
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:29,450
Now today you're calling me from
a red convertible F1 Ferrari isn't that it?

961
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,910
Right? Candy red?
Yeah you doing the math?

962
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,350
I am. All right? I'm gonna cut you off.

963
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,600
- Oh come on John.
- I'm coming on.

964
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:40,290
If we keep working together,
I'll charge a 10% aggravation tax.

965
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,230
Get your ass to Western Union tonight.

966
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,190
Wire me 75 grand
and maybe we can kiss and make up.

967
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,340
OK OK John. Now let's...

968
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,430
John Anthony. Talk to me.

969
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:52,450
- May I please speak to Brandon Lang?
- Mom?

970
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,210
- Hey honey is that you?
- Yeah it's me!

971
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,170
- Are you OK?
- Mom I have never been better.

972
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,630
I'm kicking ass and taking names.

973
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:05,070
- Did you get the money that I sent you?
- Yeah. That's why I'm...

974
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:09,070
I talked to Denny. I'm flying you and him
out here next month first-class.

975
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,990
I'll put you up at the Plaza.
You'll meet Toni and Walter.

976
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,830
You are gonna love this joint Ma.

977
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:19,400
That sounds great honey.
About the money all that money it's-it's too much.

978
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,650
Ma but it-it-it's not too much!

979
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:25,240
I made that money. I earned that money
every fucking cent of it.

980
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:28,890
- Listen to you.
- Ma it's just how people talk out here.

981
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,830
Look no cuff.

982
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,120
No cuff Francesco.

983
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,620
Now who's this John Anthony person?

984
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,840
Those checks I've been sending you
those checks you've been cashing

985
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,460
those are from John Anthony.

986
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:44,700
- And he talks like that?
- Mom they are from me.

987
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,550
- We gotta go to Puerto Rico.
- I gotta put you on hold.

988
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,910
- What's in Puerto Rico?
- CM Novian called.

989
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,190
He lives in Puerto Rico.
He's the biggest sports bettor in the world.

990
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:58,920
We've hit the jackpot. He wants to sit
and talk in person with John Anthony.

991
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:02,360
- Got it. How much time we got?
- 45 minutes plane leaves La Guardia.

992
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,760
Whoa pronto OK. Mama?

993
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:07,370
Mom? Ma?

994
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,690
My mom just hung up on me. Um...

995
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:18,890
- What do you know about him?
- Not much but he's a world-class prick.

996
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:24,050
Wouldn't return my call. Treated me
worse than my Hong Kong tailor.

997
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,550
You know how long
I've been trying to bag this guy?

998
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:29,170
Have you any idea
what this thing is worth?

999
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,260
Nope but I want a bonus
if we pull this off.

1000
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,310
- No "if. " It's only "when. "
- I got you.

1001
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,230
You understand?
Remember he called us.

1002
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,590
- You hooked him.
- Mm-hm.

1003
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,720
- Know that. Sweat that.
- You got it.

1004
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,350
Relax my man.
I'll get in character in the car huh?

1005
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,230
Oh fuck!

1006
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,190
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1007
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,380
Hey! Uh-oh. Easy baby. Easy easy.

1008
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,550
Is it your heart?
Where's your vial? Easy easy.

1009
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,350
Somebody get a doctor! Get me a doctor
and get me some water now.

1010
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:08,160
Here we are. Hang on baby.
Yeah breathe it out.

1011
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:12,440
Here's one two. Yeah yeah yeah
you suck on them. Suck on them man.

1012
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,520
Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.

1013
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,780
Easy easy easy.

1014
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,590
- Yeah baby.
- Brandon?

1015
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,420
- Yeah? I'm here.
- You love me?

1016
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,640
Shh. Oh I love you. You know I love you.
Shh. You ain't going nowhere.

1017
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:29,120
Somebody get some help!
Get me some water now!

1018
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,060
Shh.

1019
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,020
- Brandon?
- Yeah? Talk to me my man. Come on.

1020
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,520
Would you love me...

1021
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,970
if this was a joke?

1022
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:42,370
I'm OK.

1023
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,010
I was just practicing. It's OK.

1024
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,160
It's OK.

1025
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,330
Look at me. I'm all right. Oh I got a crowd.

1026
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:56,230
Little indigestion.
Too many peanuts on the plane. I'm OK.

1027
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,090
Thank you for your concern.
He's had a little problem. Whoa.

1028
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,010
Don't-don't-don't-don't you do that to me.

1029
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,980
- Walter that's pushing it too far.
- Now you listen to me.

1030
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:11,460
Now you pay attention to me right now.
There's no such thing as too far.

1031
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,960
Understand?
You push everything as far as you can.

1032
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,860
You push and you push and you push
until it starts pushing back

1033
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,800
and then you push some goddamn more.

1034
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,020
Remember that
when you're with this guy today.

1035
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,160
OK?

1036
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:33,250
Oh man. If I start to die again
forget the hospital I wanna croak here.

1037
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:39,930
- Walter.
- Mr. Novian it's an honor. My associate...

1038
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,490
- John Anthony.
- How are you?

1039
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,040
These sports services of yours...

1040
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,790
complete fucking scam huh?

1041
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,880
I hear your boy here's having quite a season.
What's your system Walter?

1042
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:59,430
- System?
- Let's start with how much you bet.

1043
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,830
Million a game across the board.

1044
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,330
OK is that the most we're working with?

1045
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:11,000
It depends. Shit Benny check your wallet.
See if you have any cash.

1046
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,030
Maybe he'll talk about the weekend.
How do you feel about it?

1047
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,110
- Do you rent that yacht?
- No no. I own it.

1048
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,140
Well that's how I feel about this weekend.

1049
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,450
And I'm not being cocky. I'm talking
straight commerce with you Mr. Novian.

1050
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:28,830
- I didn't come down here to bullshit you.
- Wow you got steamed.

1051
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,650
Or maybe
a little inside information maybe?

1052
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:35,990
I know these teams
better than they know themselves.

1053
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:39,680
I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend
including the Monday-night parlay.

1054
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:42,870
Wow. Should we believe him?

1055
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:45,310
- What do you think?
- I don't believe him.

1056
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,460
You cannot afford not to.

1057
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,420
- No I can afford.
- Can you?

1058
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,860
Honest question Mr. Novian. Can you?

1059
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,110
Hell can anyone for that matter

1060
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,220
afford to lose as much
as a man like you needs to bet

1061
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,410
to actually feel a win?

1062
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,690
Winning's a funny thing.

1063
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:12,110
It's one of those rare commodities
that money cannot buy until you called me.

1064
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,550
I didn't call you. I called your boss.

1065
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,490
And he called me.

1066
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:23,690
The price is $250000 up-front
plus 10% of every game you win.

1067
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,400
Well that's wild.

1068
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:31,610
I never paid up-front before did I?

1069
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,450
We've never charged it before.

1070
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:38,180
Considering whose picks you're getting
and the amount of money you're betting

1071
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,850
250's a bargain. You know it and I know it.

1072
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:45,900
If you want this weekend's winners
that's my offer.

1073
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:49,440
You can take it or leave it.

1074
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,120
Let's step outside.

1075
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:06,340
Come in.

1076
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:10,920
- They need it Mr. Anthony.
- What's your mother's name Mitchell?

1077
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:11,970
Sheila.

1078
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,990
- What street did you grow up on?
- Atlantic Avenue.

1079
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,910
- Who do you like Monday night?
- Oh I don't know.

1080
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,370
- Pick one.
- Well that's your job.

1081
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:24,270
I'll do your job tomorrow.
Today you do mine. Who do you like?

1082
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,730
- What are you talking about?
- Mitchie.

1083
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:31,470
Seattle v New Orleans.
Stop stalling. Who do you like?

1084
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,310
I don't know. I mean
I guess I like Seattle plus the two points.

1085
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:42,000
- Over or under?
- No you can't... Don't... You can't do that.

1086
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:46,480
No I can do this.
Over or under? It's 44 points. Come on.

1087
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,680
Um...

1088
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,820
Over.

1089
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,320
Seattle in the over. Nice.

1090
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:56,600
I won't hand that in.
A million dollars are riding on that game.

1091
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,270
Oh there's a whole lot more than that.

1092
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:04,210
We all know I can pick. Today I'm picking you.
The outcome will be the same.

1093
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,950
- OK. And... what if I'm wrong?
- There's no "if. "

1094
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,430
Are we running to the field goal?
We don't need a field goal.

1095
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,410
We need a touchdown.

1096
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,870
Oh that's OK. That's OK.

1097
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,260
They score we win. Come on come on.

1098
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,610
They score we win. They score we win.

1099
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,730
They score we win. They score we win.

1100
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,300
They score we win.

1101
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,390
...first down on the sixth.
Touchdown!

1102
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:35,600
Yes! We won! We won!
A hundred fucking percent!

1103
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,520
A hundred fucking percent!

1104
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,690
A hundred fucking percent! A hundred...

1105
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,430
It was like he mesmerized me a little bit.

1106
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:53,850
Like Spock or something I visualized it.
Seattle and the over and he wrote it down.

1107
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,290
- He said picking me was like him doing it.
- How long have you been here?

1108
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:02,980
It's not unusual to go out at any time

1109
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:06,050
Congratulations Brandon
or should I say John?

1110
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,030
Either way it's amazing.
I am very impressed.

1111
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,770
Are you kidding me? Letting salesmen
make your picks? That's balls.

1112
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:16,480
You better get over there and
collect some of that cash right now.

1113
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:19,500
The way you're picking
you'll need some for a rainy day.

1114
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,750
Enjoy it while it lasts.

1115
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:26,030
Gambling gods are a fickle bunch.
So easily offended.

1116
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:30,760
There might be businesses you can make
over two million dollars in a weekend...

1117
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:33,120
- Thanks for looking after me.
- All right.

1118
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,970
...but will somebody tell me
somebody please tell me

1119
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,770
where else are you gonna
have this much fucking fun?

1120
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,010
You the man! You the man big Papa!

1121
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,820
I love you forever.

1122
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:52,450
Let me ask you something.
How much of that do-re-mi be for moi?

1123
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,870
Well how about a one
with five zeros behind it.

1124
01:06:57,910 --> 01:06:59,860
- A hundred thousand?
- Yeah.

1125
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,480
On two mill?

1126
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,400
- You be working out of my shop.
- Yes sir I am.

1127
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,620
- Look around you.
- This is your place Walter's shop.

1128
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,810
I understand that.
I'm just saying feed the horse baby.

1129
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,370
- Maybe 10%.
- 10%?

1130
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:17,650
That what you're thinking?
That's a beautiful thought. Forget it.

1131
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:23,320
Walter we were starting to roll here.
And we got Novian. We got the 250 grand...

1132
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:26,300
I wanna tell you something now OK?
I'm gonna say it only once.

1133
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:30,510
If you want something more from me
than a gesundheit after a sneeze

1134
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,250
you have to do more than this shit.

1135
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,840
You understand?
You're gonna have to earn it.

1136
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:37,250
Once you earn it
you'll have to fight me for it.

1137
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:42,300
You'll have to challenge me.
You'll have to rip it out of my fucking talons.

1138
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:46,990
That's how you get ahead with me.
Now John Anthony would know that see?

1139
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,220
As a matter of fact
next time you come to me with this shit

1140
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,000
you come as John Anthony.

1141
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,290
I ain't talking money with you.

1142
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,480
Hey big winner huh?

1143
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:04,510
How you feeling?

1144
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:07,380
Winning. Winning.

1145
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,140
Dance with me.

1146
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,960
Oh!

1147
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:20,360
- You know I gotta dance with you more.
- You do.

1148
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:23,590
- Listen. I'm thinking of buying a plane.
- Oh yeah.

1149
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,640
Yeah. You know...

1150
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,160
Don't laugh. A big one.
One of them G... G somethings.

1151
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:36,840
I saw this house in the Bahamas for sale.
I mean talk about an investment.

1152
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:40,490
In case anything should happen to me
I mean you and Julia...

1153
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,510
Shh! I don't wanna hear that Walter.
Stop that.

1154
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,700
Why don't we go down and check it out?

1155
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,870
Just you and me barefoot in the sand.

1156
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,980
Just tell me you're not... gambling Walter.

1157
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:56,340
Oh.

1158
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,820
18 years I'm straight OK?
That shit's over.

1159
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:05,300
It's never over.
You know that Walter. It's never over.

1160
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,180
How about a truth serum... in the veins?

1161
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:12,500
Baby we just made two million dollars.
I wanna just celebrate with my wife.

1162
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,000
I want to enjoy a dance.
Can I do it just once?

1163
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,880
Walter.

1164
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:30,440
Alexandria? Hey, it's Brandon.

1165
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:33,980
Yeah. Yeah listen
I happen to be in the neighborhood.

1166
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:38,150
You have got a Doberman for a doorman.

1167
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,050
- Hi Alexandria.
- What are you doing here?

1168
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,640
What do you say we go out
for a late-night dinner right now?

1169
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,860
Have a couple killer bottles of wine
go back to that place where we first met...

1170
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,420
Hm?

1171
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:00,050
Are you out of your mind?
I live in this building asshole. This is home.

1172
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,760
I don't appreciate
you stopping by without calling.

1173
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,950
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1174
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:09,230
- What's gotten into you?
- I'll make this shit real clear

1175
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,100
so this doesn't happen again.

1176
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,920
You meant 5000 bucks.

1177
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,900
Your friend set it up.

1178
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,590
The world still is the same

1179
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,780
You never change it

1180
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,670
As sure as the stars shine above

1181
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,140
Well, you're nobody

1182
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:38,840
Till somebody loves you

1183
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:42,550
So find yourself

1184
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,250
Somebody to love

1185
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,590
- You know what time it is?
- It is 8:37 in the a. m.

1186
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,630
Wrong. It's time to press my man.

1187
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,220
We're gonna yank out all the stops.
When you're winning you press.

1188
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:03,720
You don't rest on your laurels.
What are you doing?

1189
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,830
I've got a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot
with a client - that Howell guy.

1190
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,980
So don't call me unless the lines change.

1191
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:15,550
The salmon are running my man.
You gotta stay here. Gotta field phone calls.

1192
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,590
You can't go out playing golf having fun.

1193
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,510
Fun? Seor you have obviously
never played Wingfoot.

1194
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:24,580
Come on stop playing around here.
Let's go. You got work to do this week.

1195
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:29,730
I'm not asking you if I can leave Walter.
I'm telling you that's how it is. All right?

1196
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,820
You want my picks I can give you those.

1197
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:35,940
Washington minus eight against Miami
Washington.

1198
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,970
Saint-Louis KC.
Out of your mind? Las Vegas.

1199
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:42,350
You're gonna start picking
on Tuesday for the weekend huh?

1200
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:46,210
Philadelphia. I love it. Look at that. Cinci.

1201
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,470
We'll be advising in the neighborhood
of 20 million dollars this week.

1202
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,900
That's a nice neighborhood.
We should be doing double that by week ten.

1203
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,350
I see. You're gonna make the picks.
No study no analysis.

1204
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:01,180
You're just gonna pick 'em.

1205
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,480
Locked in Walter. I don't really need it.

1206
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,170
Look at that. You've got to be kidding me.
Vegas Monday night.

1207
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,790
There's my picks for this week.

1208
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:13,210
Now if you want next week's picks
I can give you those by Friday.

1209
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:16,090
- If you wanna join us you can.
- No I'm getting the drift.

1210
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,680
Tell you what. We'll keep these on ice
and go over 'em tomorrow.

1211
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,290
- I won't be in tomorrow.
- Well then the next day!

1212
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:25,420
Uh we'll talk about it.

1213
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,960
Hey Brandon!

1214
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,800
- Toni!
- Hey!

1215
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,340
- Where you headed?
- Some of us have to work.

1216
01:12:33,370 --> 01:12:36,640
- Oh oh oh. There we go.
- Baby.

1217
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,870
- Hey you look great.
- Nice ride.

1218
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:43,660
- "900 K-I-N-G." Did you see the plates?
- Yes I did.

1219
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,640
- You feel that? You feel that?
- Don't. Slow down Brandon.

1220
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,850
- Oh this car was made to go fast.
- No. Not with me in it. Slow down.

1221
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,730
Loosen up will you? Hey.

1222
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,610
Let me ask you a question.

1223
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:10,840
When you're not at the salon
or running Julia to play dates

1224
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,620
or keeping Walter in line which I know
is a full-time job what do you do for you?

1225
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:20,680
- I stay busy. You're gonna turn here so...
- That's not what I asked.

1226
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,270
What do you do for you for Toni?

1227
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:30,760
I was a junkie Brandon. OK?

1228
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,400
So every day I get up and I wonder
"Is this the day?

1229
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:38,140
"Is this the day I slip
end up back on the street?"

1230
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:41,850
Just keeping it all on track
that's what I do for me.

1231
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,940
Well that's not living Toni.
That is not living.

1232
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:49,260
That is maintaining.
That's cashing in. That is not living.

1233
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,400
What the hell does that mean?

1234
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,890
Are we talking perfection?
You wanna talk perfection?

1235
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,140
No. Nobody's perfect.

1236
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:01,870
Oh except for me last weekend
going 14 and 0 huh?

1237
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:11,570
- This is your stop.
- Well thanks for the ride... John.

1238
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,770
In other action, Washington melted down
in Miami, losing 24 to 12.

1239
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,130
Saint-Louis shocked KC 34-14,

1240
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,610
and Philadelphia
smacked Pittsburgh 23-10.

1241
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:33,050
- I'm gonna go work out.
- No you're not.

1242
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,200
There's half a dozen games left here.

1243
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,250
I want you to watch every second
of every minute of every one of them.

1244
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,810
All right so sit down.

1245
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,320
Oakland is having a miserable time.

1246
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,920
Berman.

1247
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,740
You know how you go
three and 11 don't you?

1248
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:54,950
You go three and 11 when
you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday.

1249
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,990
'Cause it rained in Cincinnati on Saturday.

1250
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,850
Two starting quarterbacks
never got to play.

1251
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:04,340
That's how you go three and 11.
You're a handicapper not a psychic.

1252
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,740
- We still got Monday and the parlay.
- Fuck Monday and the parlay.

1253
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:11,740
This isn't about that. This is about me.
It's about the commission thing.

1254
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,080
- Oh no. I don't know.
- Oh don't bullshit me. Come on.

1255
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:19,250
All right listen.
I'm gonna bump you. 10%. OK?

1256
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,290
You earned it.

1257
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:26,860
This is dangerous territory we're getting into.
You understand? But I'll bump you.

1258
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,010
Now talk to me about Monday night

1259
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:33,640
because everyone I mean everyone
will double down after the hole you put 'em in.

1260
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:35,830
- It's fine.
- You'd bet your mother's house?

1261
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:37,870
- I don't bet Walter.
- If you did?

1262
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:41,360
- I like the pick Walter.
- On your mother's house or not?

1263
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:43,190
With my mother in it.

1264
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:47,400
Another Monday-night
thriller comes down to the final seconds.

1265
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,530
Carolina has to get at least
into field-goal range here.

1266
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,310
High snap, pulled down nicely.

1267
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,810
And a beautiful punt by Feuderday.

1268
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,160
He drills it. Thompson has to retreat.

1269
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:01,270
And Thompson dropped the ball. The ball
is on the turt, and the scramble is on.

1270
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,630
It's heading toward the Carolina goal line.

1271
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:07,430
A couple of guysjump on it.
It might be changing hands right now.

1272
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,090
Fuck!

1273
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:13,060
The call goes to Cleveland.
Carolina won't have a shot...

1274
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:15,000
Fuck!

1275
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:21,090
This one is over.
An unbelievable finish.

1276
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:28,070
You don't switch to
a three-four halfway through the season.

1277
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,430
No, what defense
are they running in practice?

1278
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:34,230
Jones is on the field. Sunday.
We're still leaning heavy on the overs.

1279
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,790
Thank you, thank you, sir.

1280
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:37,730
You are the man. I'll talk to you...

1281
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:43,300
His improvement's been great but he got
out of surgery two and half weeks ago.

1282
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:46,700
I know he's had a good week of practice
but his knee's swollen.

1283
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:50,080
Help me out. Game-time decision.
That's what coach always says.

1284
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:54,210
Are we talking game-time probable huh?
Or doubtful?

1285
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:57,690
Tell me. You're going into...
It's raining it's snowing.

1286
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,200
Can his knee hold up in that?

1287
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,710
Will the doc let him play?

1288
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,150
Yes he is a gamer. Thank you.

1289
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,220
I can read between the lines. You got it.

1290
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:11,040
Unbelievable! Yee-ha!

1291
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:14,580
Takes the snap, drops the throw.

1292
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,590
Whoa!

1293
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,300
Hell of a swing.

1294
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,850
Sport of kings right?

1295
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:35,440
- No no. That's horse racing.
- What are you doing here?

1296
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:38,880
- Southie told me where I could find you.
- Yep.

1297
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,800
I wanted to get out. Clear my head.

1298
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:44,780
So talk to me. How'd we do?

1299
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,810
- You haven't seen the scores?
- Nope.

1300
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:53,060
That's how I wanted it.
Make my picks get the results later.

1301
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,280
- Well... highest sales volume ever.
- Yeah?

1302
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,380
- Take a guess how we did.
- I think we kicked ass.

1303
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:08,390
- It was amazing.
- Yeah last week was nothing Walter.

1304
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:15,380
You're right. It was nothing
compared to what we lost today.

1305
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,190
What'd I go?

1306
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,090
I got an idea. Why don't I give you
a glimpse of what happened

1307
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,430
and then you take a stab
on how you went?

1308
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:27,990
Just give me the numbers.

1309
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,120
You don't wanna play?
Too bad. Would've been fun.

1310
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:33,170
Grown men crying on the phone.

1311
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:35,460
Their wives screaming in the background.

1312
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,630
Three salespeople quit -
couldn't take the pressure.

1313
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,200
- Fuck.
- No no no.

1314
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,050
You lose ten out of 12
"fuck" doesn't quite cover it.

1315
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,640
You know what would be more appropriate?
"Holy Fucking Shit!"

1316
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:52,810
Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"

1317
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:56,110
- I got the picture Walter.
- You're right.

1318
01:18:56,150 --> 01:19:00,220
You go two for 12
on our highest volume weekend ever

1319
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,470
and...

1320
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,350
what's left to say?

1321
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:07,470
Except maybe
we keep the phone number

1322
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,640
only we switch it over
to a fucking suicide hotline.

1323
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:14,290
Tomorrow morning Brandon
bright and early

1324
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:17,210
we start all over again.

1325
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:37,440
- Mr. Novian wants to see you.
- Argh!

1326
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,410
Tell him... to call me. Argh!

1327
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,660
You tell him.

1328
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:48,500
- I didn't recognize you without the suit.
- This is my time off.

1329
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:51,000
If you want to talk make an appointment.

1330
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:53,820
Or should I call you Brandon?

1331
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,670
Someone costs you 30 mill
you do research right?

1332
01:19:57,710 --> 01:19:59,610
I mean I got more than your name now.

1333
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:03,830
I know where you live where you're from
where your family lives.

1334
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:06,600
Hey your mother
there's a sweet lady man.

1335
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:12,060
I just come from Vegas. Dealt me
three blackjacks in a row. She's a good woman.

1336
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,800
Where's the cocky motherfucker
who come to my house? Where's John?

1337
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:20,930
If you don't like my picks
use somebody else.

1338
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:29,170
Come here. It's all right. It's all right.

1339
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:35,740
I just come for an apology. That's it.
Just look me in the eye and say you're sorry.

1340
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:39,590
I mean say it so as to make me
believe you mean it. Come on.

1341
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,410
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck that. I'm not going to accept that.

1342
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:45,540
Come on one more time. I'm sorry. Hey?

1343
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:50,440
- I'm sorry.
- You motherfucker. You're not even close.

1344
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,900
You're not even close.

1345
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:56,130
No it's not gonna work.
It's not gonna work.

1346
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,510
I'm gonna get my satisfaction.
I'm gonna get something I want.

1347
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,910
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
No-no-no.

1348
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,580
What do you mean "No-no-no"?

1349
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,230
No look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1350
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,110
- Brandon?
- OK.

1351
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:10,630
I'm sorry.

1352
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:14,110
Come on you're not gonna tell me
you're scared of dying are you?

1353
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,360
Mr. Novian it was a bad fucking weekend.

1354
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,910
- It was a bad weekend?
- Yeah yeah. Yes yes.

1355
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:22,660
Well let's make it a fun day.

1356
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:24,450
Come here.

1357
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:26,210
Oh yeah.

1358
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,710
Yeah. Yeah.

1359
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,590
- Come here.
- Argh!

1360
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:32,460
There.

1361
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:39,200
- Walter.
- I'm busy.

1362
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,040
Listen I think I should lead off tonight.
I got some really strong stuff man.

1363
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,190
Jerry you got a good hole. Stay in it.

1364
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:49,360
I went eight for 12 last week.
I'm hot. I'm feeling it.

1365
01:21:49,390 --> 01:21:51,190
You had one good weekend.

1366
01:21:51,230 --> 01:21:54,570
What do you mean?
SYKES system revolutionized this industry.

1367
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,030
Am I wood?

1368
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:59,990
Where's my fucking ad? I...

1369
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,870
- Take a hike.
- What?

1370
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:05,000
- You're fired.
- I'm not fired.

1371
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,610
- You're out of here.
- You need me.

1372
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,110
Get outta here you cut-rate parasite.

1373
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,050
In six years my worst weekend

1374
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:15,590
was never as bad
as any of this guy's last three weeks.

1375
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,910
You're not hearing me.
You don't work for me anymore. It's over.

1376
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:22,060
- What the hell are you doing Walter?
- Oh!

1377
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:25,400
Am I doing something wrong?
Am I not communicating? Is that it?

1378
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,920
Am I not projecting enough?
He doesn't understand. You all know what I just did.

1379
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:32,800
- I fired you!
- Come on this is me! All right?

1380
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:37,010
I've been here for you. I'm consistent
and you know it. The other guys fuck 'em.

1381
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,390
- They come they go. I'm the guy.
- No they don't. Not him.

1382
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,750
That's true talent! Get it?

1383
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:48,170
You can't see it I can't explain it to you.
That's why you're fired.

1384
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,900
Think about what you're doing.

1385
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:53,800
You couldn't pick your nose without
a fucking computer. You're small.

1386
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:56,410
- You belong in a can.
- You've lost it!

1387
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,450
You don't touch him.

1388
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:03,080
Now why don't you have
some self-respect and leave?

1389
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,170
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Maybe I am.

1390
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:12,630
Maybe I am.

1391
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,070
Good luck!

1392
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:19,930
Asshole.

1393
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:23,520
Doesn't realize I'm trying
to build an empire around you.

1394
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:25,880
I hope you do.

1395
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,510
OK everyone. Let's go. Back to work.
Big playoff weekend coming. Chop-chop.

1396
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:04,980
Hey Toni. This is not a good time.

1397
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:09,300
I know but Brandon
I need to talk to you. It's important.

1398
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:16,180
- Not right now.
- Brandon you have to... you have to go.

1399
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,230
No I gotta... get back on track.

1400
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,380
It won't matter.

1401
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:29,010
You could win 100 games in a row
and it won't be enough. It'll never be enough.

1402
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,240
He will ride you into the ground.

1403
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:35,270
I'll figure it out.

1404
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,140
No.

1405
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:40,900
Brandon please.

1406
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:13,290
John Anthony.

1407
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:16,870
- I'm wiped out, John.
- Amir.

1408
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,470
My business my house

1409
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,440
my credit... everything.

1410
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:25,070
Amir?

1411
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:30,120
It's gonna be OK all right?
We're gonna get back on track this weekend.

1412
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:33,240
- You hear me?
- Still you talk like this.

1413
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,390
Who the fuck are you?

1414
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:39,250
Like this is some kind of game.
You ruined me!

1415
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:44,190
I was betting a few thousand a Sunday
when I called you, but you pushed me.

1416
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:47,220
Every call, all the time, with your talk.

1417
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:51,810
I lost 380,000 this weekend.

1418
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:55,350
I was going to get married.

1419
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,840
I had a life!

1420
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:04,740
Oh, no words now, huh?

1421
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,970
No more money to squeeze
so you shut up.

1422
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,770
How do you fucking live with yourself?

1423
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,630
Come on.

1424
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,310
That's it!

1425
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,250
Coming Walter!

1426
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:38,210
I know what the problem is.

1427
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:40,710
- He's OK.
- I'll come back later.

1428
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,650
No no stick around. Stay stay.

1429
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:46,400
These guys are finished.
You guys want anything before you go?

1430
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:50,100
Something to eat?
You leave the way you came in fellas. Thank you.

1431
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:52,500
Shut the door.

1432
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:57,980
- Who's that?
- We need a Bat Light or something.

1433
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,400
One of them signals you shoot up
into the clouds so that no matter where you are

1434
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,070
you just look up you say
"Hey Walter needs me. "

1435
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:08,030
Because I must've beeped you
a hundred fucking times.

1436
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:11,370
- Who were they man?
- The Salvation Army.

1437
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:15,020
How does someone go one for eight?

1438
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,510
A fucking monkey tossing darts
could do better than that.

1439
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:22,740
- What's with all the money Walter?
- I got a plan.

1440
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,890
We take your picks
we reverse everything.

1441
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:28,890
Like one of them Twilight Zone
episodes where everything is opposite.

1442
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,930
You say black we go white.

1443
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:34,370
- How much is that?
- Peanuts.

1444
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,610
275000. That's how desperate I am.

1445
01:27:37,650 --> 01:27:40,740
- What happened to the two mill?
- Two mill?

1446
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:45,470
Man I was carrying twice that in red ink
before you even showed up.

1447
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,180
Look around. Everything you see
is smoke and mirrors.

1448
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:50,960
I got three mortgages on this house.

1449
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,860
What do you wanna know?
I'm gambling again!

1450
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:00,700
To cover my losses
I just got a loan from a guy

1451
01:28:00,730 --> 01:28:03,300
who works out of a bar
on 106th and Broadway.

1452
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,270
Trouble with me is I start
betting you heavy after you went 100%

1453
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:10,560
and I rode you right into the fucking toilet.

1454
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:15,090
I do know what the problem is man.
We're gonna take care of all this shit.

1455
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,440
Check this out man. I'm Brandon Lang.

1456
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,050
I'm the kid who played sports
and loved sports.

1457
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:23,530
I'm the kid who can pick winners.
I'm the kid you called in Vegas.

1458
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,790
Along the way I lost something in here.

1459
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:30,000
I don't know what but I know I gotta
go back to being me to being Brandon.

1460
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:33,750
- If I get back to being Brandon...
- You can pick again. Of course.

1461
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:37,510
- Forget John Anthony. Burn the suits.
- Mm-hm.

1462
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,430
My fault. I fucked with you.

1463
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:45,600
- Only two games. Two over-unders.
- That's right.

1464
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:51,380
If I get you to crunch the numbers
sprinkle a little Brandon magic over it.

1465
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:54,250
We get the salespeople
burning up the phones...

1466
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:57,110
- Come Monday we go four for four.
- Four for four.

1467
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,950
- That's something.
- How's that sound?

1468
01:28:58,990 --> 01:29:02,950
- This is important you know?
- I know it is. Pressure doesn't help.

1469
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,770
Let's go eat something.
Let's go to Smith and Wo's.

1470
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,540
Brandon's gotta stay
and do some homework.

1471
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,290
The Brandon thing.
You see I'm forgetting.

1472
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:23,600
Two games. Two games. Two games.

1473
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:30,380
Two games. Two games. Two games.

1474
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:31,730
Hey what... Ho!

1475
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:38,090
People living in the zone.
What does that mean?

1476
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,770
His hair was all over.

1477
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,470
Brandon made these picks?

1478
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,970
You're looking at him.

1479
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:23,140
New York in the under.
Tennessee in the over.

1480
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:25,540
Sell 'em hard.

1481
01:30:25,850 --> 01:30:29,810
Hello and welcome. The Conference
Championship game is underway.

1482
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:32,590
- Can I watch Daddy?
- Come to Daddy.

1483
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:35,300
My angel. I need you to root for me.

1484
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:39,830
You see that team? Those are the bad guys.
We don't want them. That's Atlanta.

1485
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:42,860
We want the good guys the blue team.
That's New York.

1486
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:45,870
And New York has gotta win
by more than five points

1487
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:48,330
only you gotta root for a low score OK?

1488
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:52,860
Because both teams together
have to make less than 42 points total.

1489
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:56,820
All right so it's New York
in under 42 points.

1490
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,660
All right?

1491
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:02,140
Smith is wide.
Cohn changing the play, audible lies.

1492
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:05,540
At the line of scrimmage.
He doesn't like the defense.

1493
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:09,020
Robinson in motion to the left.
Jones alone in the backfield.

1494
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,900
Cohn back to passer. He's got the rookie.

1495
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,450
- Anderson is in the middle...
- Go go go!

1496
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,800
- In the end zone.
- Yeah!

1497
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,490
Touchdown, New York,
and they take the early lead.

1498
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:22,540
Midway through the second quarter now.

1499
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:26,960
Atlanta down 10-0, but they're making
their first serious threat of the game.

1500
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:29,110
- Thomas, delay action...
- Get him!

1501
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,920
Over the top.
Touchdown, Atlanta!

1502
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:36,760
10-7 and New York is on the move.
Cohn now back to throw.

1503
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:38,910
He's over he's over he's over.

1504
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:42,600
Simpson's got it!
He fumbles it. He's in the end zone!

1505
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:46,770
That's a touchdown!
It's now 17-7 New York.

1506
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,920
- And we'll be right back.
- Whoo!

1507
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,730
Less than a minute to go.
New York seconds away

1508
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,450
from making their third trip
to the big game.

1509
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:59,500
A New York score here and this game
is all but over. He's got Simpson.

1510
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:02,370
Touchdown, New York!

1511
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:06,340
24-14. Now it is out of reach.

1512
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:10,970
New York ready to take on the winner
of our next game, KC against Tennessee.

1513
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,640
The boy is back. First of two baby!

1514
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,910
Atlanta may just take a knee here.

1515
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:18,540
Way to do it!

1516
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:22,650
Why not throw it long?
He puts it up for grabs. It's a Hail Mary.

1517
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,520
- Knock it down! Knock it down!
- Oh no.

1518
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,380
A wall of blue shirts...

1519
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,420
Come on! No!

1520
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:34,950
It is tipped in the air.
It's still loose. It is bouncing all around.

1521
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:38,300
- Jesus!
- Peterson comes down.

1522
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:41,580
- He's at the 20.
- Come on!

1523
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:46,730
Across the ten. Mackey
dives to keep him out of the end zone.

1524
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,300
No!

1525
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,800
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1526
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,760
New York wins it 24-21.

1527
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,070
That wraps up
our doubleheader playoff coverage,

1528
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:10,610
as Kansas City tops Tennessee 33 to 13

1529
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:13,950
and heads for Super Forty.

1530
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,350
I'm finished Walter.

1531
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:19,480
Oh that's great to hear.

1532
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:21,420
Yeah.

1533
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,750
- I'm done man.
- Yeah?

1534
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:25,690
I don't eat.

1535
01:33:25,730 --> 01:33:28,300
I'm not sleeping.

1536
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:32,090
What you saying? You got insomnia
indigestion you're gonna quit?

1537
01:33:32,130 --> 01:33:34,450
Hail Mary pass. These things happen.

1538
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:38,140
Listen to me man.
I'm telling you. It's over.

1539
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:43,460
What use is John Anthony
gonna be to you now anyway huh?

1540
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:45,300
With the streak he's been on?

1541
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:48,150
Come on.
I won't listen to this defeatist bullshit.

1542
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:51,030
Hot streaks go cold. Cold streaks go hot.

1543
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:54,460
They know you went 80%
for half a season. They know.

1544
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:57,850
They're gonna remember
as soon as you win a game.

1545
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,100
Then we go into
March Madness baseball.

1546
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:02,540
Next year this won't even be a memory.

1547
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:04,800
Who said anything about next year Walter?

1548
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:09,430
You made a career choice buddy
and I bankrolled it.

1549
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:13,700
Mm-hm.

1550
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:17,830
OK?

1551
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:20,900
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

1552
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:25,280
Of course you stick up for him. Of course.

1553
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:27,530
Oh Walter.

1554
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:30,700
- Meaning what?
- I don't know. Meaning what?

1555
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:33,520
Meaning whose side are you on?

1556
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:39,250
I didn't realize I had to choose Walter.

1557
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,650
Brandon.

1558
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:48,320
You're a champion. A champion
goes down 86 times he's up on the 87th.

1559
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,510
I'm not gonna let you stay down. No way.

1560
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,680
Because this is not about you. Or you.

1561
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,600
Or me. It's about your gift.

1562
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:01,620
Your gift transcends all this shit.

1563
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:04,800
Your gift is cosmic. It's metaphysic.

1564
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:07,930
It's eternal. It is God!

1565
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,990
Besides we have a contract.

1566
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:18,360
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Bullshit bullshit.

1567
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:22,070
- Walter you can't own someone.
- Who owns him?

1568
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:25,340
I created the greatest sports tout
this country's seen.

1569
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:27,800
I hooked him up with every major client.

1570
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,490
I built a fucking
television show around him.

1571
01:35:31,530 --> 01:35:33,640
I took out full-page ads.

1572
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,810
I introduced him
to the major clients of the world.

1573
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,940
I did that.
I hooked you up with everybody.

1574
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:44,010
Think you're gonna walk out the door
take that with you

1575
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,780
leave me here
holding the fucking sack? Bullshit!

1576
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,370
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
What has this got to do with you?

1577
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,600
This is between me and him.
What are you doing in this office?

1578
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:55,690
What are you doing here? Get outta here!

1579
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,610
Don't talk to her like that Walter.

1580
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:02,740
- It's between me and you.
- It is between you and me.

1581
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:07,680
Are you telling me how to talk to my wife?
You shut your fucking toilet.

1582
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:11,640
Leave. Leave please Brandon. Go. Go.

1583
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,940
Please. Go. Leave.

1584
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,230
Listen to me you son of a bitch.

1585
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:21,030
Don't you ever talk to me like that ever.

1586
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,050
I'm sorry.

1587
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,730
Hey Brandon! Hoo!

1588
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:34,580
It's Walter. Don't get excited.

1589
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:37,190
All is forgiven.

1590
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:39,070
Hey.

1591
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:43,820
- What time is it?
- It's 6am.

1592
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:47,890
I gotta fly to Vegas meet with
some clients - hand-holding thing -

1593
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:52,620
and just keep them aboard for the last game
because you can do this thing.

1594
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:56,130
End of the season's the perfect place
to turn a streak around.

1595
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:59,610
I'll be back tonight.
We'll go out. We'll have a good meal.

1596
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:04,720
You know get you
back in the groove again. 9:30 Nobu.

1597
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:08,470
We're turning it around.
I'll see you tonight.

1598
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:16,920
Hey Brandon.

1599
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,110
Hey Toni.

1600
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:23,390
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Walter was delayed.

1601
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:27,560
He'll be back in the morning.
Asked if I'd fill in.

1602
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:30,790
You know what's funny?

1603
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:33,080
He didn't call me.

1604
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:38,660
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1605
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,220
Julia did her...

1606
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:51,750
I'm sorry.

1607
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:58,110
He's gambling.

1608
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,870
- Yep.
- Yeah.

1609
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,140
I just can't believe I'm here again.

1610
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:08,180
I just...

1611
01:38:08,230 --> 01:38:11,560
I just can't believe it you know.
I saw it coming.

1612
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:14,170
I just couldn't stop it.

1613
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,510
I gotta win one more game.

1614
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,750
You can't fix this Brandon.

1615
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:29,190
You can't fix it.

1616
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:59,740
- Come here for a second.
- What?

1617
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:04,950
I'm gonna kiss you right now OK?
Trust me on this.

1618
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:36,240
OK Daddy open the present.

1619
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,040
Oh!

1620
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,460
Oh look at this. It's so beautiful.

1621
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:49,480
Daddy not the paper! In there.

1622
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,560
Oh!

1623
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:54,680
Oh man.

1624
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,740
Beautiful.

1625
01:39:56,780 --> 01:39:59,180
Baby this is beautiful.

1626
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,470
Happy anniversary.

1627
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:04,350
- I'll get it.
- OK.

1628
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:07,830
Oh thank you honey.
What am I gonna do with this?

1629
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,480
- It's a dangerous thing to give me.
- Brandon!

1630
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,630
- Hello.
- Look who's here.

1631
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:17,120
- Oh you're back from Vegas.
- Join the celebration.

1632
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:19,370
- What's going on?
- Well...

1633
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:23,060
Toni and I were married
12 years ago today.

1634
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,830
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1635
01:40:25,870 --> 01:40:28,590
Angel give Mommy her gift.

1636
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,910
It's OK baby. I saved for it.

1637
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,620
We got enough believe me.

1638
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:45,900
We're not broke yet honey. Put 'em on.

1639
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:50,170
Come on. I wanna see them on you.
Let me see them.

1640
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,630
Ooh!

1641
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:56,220
I got beautiful taste don't I?
Brandon I couldn't leave you out.

1642
01:40:56,250 --> 01:41:00,080
It's sort of our anniversary
anyway isn't it?

1643
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:03,370
They're made for car racing.

1644
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:08,320
The guy who wore this
won six straight times at Le Mans.

1645
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:10,820
Put it on.
Maybe you'll start winning again.

1646
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:13,110
Walter I can't take this man.

1647
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:17,140
- Why not?
- It's too much.

1648
01:41:17,180 --> 01:41:20,830
We all love each other here right?
You're family.

1649
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:23,960
I'm like your father you're like my son.

1650
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,130
That would make you his mother
wouldn't it Toni?

1651
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:32,820
Oh I said something wrong didn't I?

1652
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,950
What are you doing? Keep 'em on.

1653
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:41,480
- They're for evening Walter.
- So what? Wear 'em to bed. Come on.

1654
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:43,630
Brandon I got you.

1655
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:45,500
Who do you like in the big game?

1656
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:49,090
- Turn that off Walter.
- Why? What are you camera shy?

1657
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,810
- Turn that off.
- Hey man surprise me.

1658
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:54,510
We'll break it
when we do the live TV show.

1659
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:16,930
Coming up on "Sports Advisors,"
John Anthony's Super Forty selections.

1660
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,060
It's live, and it's next.

1661
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:24,230
I know he's supposed to be here.
I know where he is. He's in the bathroom.

1662
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:31,390
Fuck!

1663
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:35,700
Two minutes till we go live.

1664
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,390
What the hell is he doing?

1665
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:57,080
Heads New York tails Kansas City.

1666
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,670
Heads over tails under.

1667
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:05,110
John Anthony!

1668
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,330
- Here he is.
- 40 seconds till we're live.

1669
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,040
40 seconds.
Come on come on come on.

1670
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,590
- We're at 30.
- Uh New York minus one and a half

1671
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:28,780
and the over 36.

1672
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,760
Wanna know about those picks?

1673
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,460
- 20 seconds to air.
- Hold on.

1674
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:37,060
What should I know about 'em?

1675
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:39,630
I flipped a coin to decide.

1676
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:45,570
- Ten.
- Push it all the way Southie.

1677
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:49,900
And five four

1678
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:52,310
three two...

1679
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:56,830
Live from the WDIX studios
high above Manhattan,

1680
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:59,020
here's your host, Walter Abrams.

1681
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:02,570
Hello everybody
and welcome to the big weekend.

1682
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:07,780
Never before in the history of this industry
has an offer been made

1683
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:10,240
like the one I'm about to present
to you now.

1684
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:15,180
I am so confident
in John Anthony's picks for this Sunday

1685
01:44:15,220 --> 01:44:19,000
I'm so sure of the skills
he's brought to bear

1686
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,280
and so anxious for you
to get on the phone

1687
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:25,470
and dial the toll-free number
on your screen

1688
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:29,470
that for the first time
in sports-service history

1689
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:33,430
I am going to guarantee our picks
this weekend.

1690
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:38,750
- What's that mean?
- What does that mean? It means this.

1691
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:43,030
You tell us how much you're betting
with your bookie

1692
01:44:43,060 --> 01:44:46,050
you lose we cover.

1693
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:50,330
You heard me right. That's risk-free.

1694
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,740
Now let's go to the oracle

1695
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:55,820
God's gift John Anthony.

1696
01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:58,630
Wow. That's all I can say.

1697
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:03,220
The phones are gonna be flooded Walter
and they should be.

1698
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:08,320
Hey John why don't you run down
the pitfalls facing the average bettor?

1699
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:13,370
I mean when you think about it a game
this huge all the added dynamics...

1700
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,940
I mean uh without your expertise

1701
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:21,090
I guess the average bettor might as well
just what flip a coin.

1702
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:25,010
Walter? No no no no
no no no no no no no.

1703
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:30,470
Hang on. You can't guarantee that they're gonna win.
That's insane. Come on.

1704
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:35,480
I say if you can flip a coin to make a pick
I can guarantee the game.

1705
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:38,980
- What if we lose?
- Ah fuck it. I'm ruined anyway.

1706
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:43,720
Look man. Cover your ass all right.
At least cap the thing out right?

1707
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:47,120
- Oh Brandon can't you feel it?
- What?

1708
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:51,020
- Can't you just feel it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

1709
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:54,310
Oh I think you do. I think you do.

1710
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:58,000
You know the best part of the best drug
in the world ain't the high.

1711
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,130
It's the moment just before you take it.

1712
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:03,320
The dice are dancing on the table.

1713
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:07,080
Between now and the time they stop

1714
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:10,620
that's the greatest high in the world.

1715
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:15,160
Made up your mind yet?
It's the last minute! I'm here to make you money!

1716
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:19,070
New York's the one-and-a-half point
favorite the over and under is 36.

1717
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,110
I want you to bet New York in the over.

1718
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:24,340
- Come on guy it's a fucking lock.
- It's New York in the over.

1719
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:28,450
You can parlay it tease it
do whatever you want 'cause it's guaranteed.

1720
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,750
- Our reputation is the guarantee.
- Tammy!

1721
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,850
I'm coming.

1722
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:34,980
28 years in the business
we're not going anywhere.

1723
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:40,030
- Can we please get some air in here?
- You gotta make up your mind.

1724
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,950
OK that's it. Kill the phones. Come on.

1725
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:45,200
Right now. Let's go let's go.

1726
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:48,270
They come from New York
and Kansas City in this match-up.

1727
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:50,770
The opening kickoff is coming up next.

1728
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:02,190
We are under way in Super Forty. It's
a high end-over-ender. Down the middle.

1729
01:47:02,450 --> 01:47:06,520
Jackson gets it, a short one for the 15,
tries to angle over to the right side,

1730
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:09,020
stripped away from...

1731
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:12,000
- Kansas City comes up with it.
- Ah man.

1732
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:17,150
Harris getting to the outside, turns,
clear path. Boy, does he have blocking.

1733
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:19,400
- Touchdown, Kansas City.
- Shit.

1734
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:22,850
- Sets out for the pocket. Simpson.
- He's open.

1735
01:47:22,890 --> 01:47:27,060
Guns one over the middle, Simpson
on the completion. It's second and 15.

1736
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:29,470
- Setting up, he's got time again.
- Go go.

1737
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,810
Looks down field
and the slam intercepted.

1738
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:34,630
- What the fuck is that?
- Dawkins finds a wave of blockers.

1739
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:40,300
Over to the near side, he's going to go
the distance. Touchdown, Kansas City.

1740
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:43,220
14-nothing, Kansas City over New York.

1741
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:47,980
New York's got it now
for the third time in the game.

1742
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:51,360
Back to throw once again,
pocket collapses and down it goes.

1743
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:55,170
Oh man. You better hold on
to that coin you flipped

1744
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:59,490
because this game keeps up like this
I'm gonna have to borrow it.

1745
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,000
Well it's not over yet Walter.

1746
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:04,490
I wouldn't change my bet. Hm?

1747
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:10,750
And second and long,
second and about a dozen.

1748
01:48:10,780 --> 01:48:13,460
Can they get something started?

1749
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:19,410
What are they counting on today?
Do they have to get away

1750
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,970
from the balanced attack
we've seen all season?

1751
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:26,770
Will they lose the ground game now?
Will they go over to the pass?

1752
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:32,230
Well, there is no way they'll be able
to run when they're 14 points down.

1753
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:49,230
Handoff goes to the second man through.
It's Jones, fullback, off the right side.

1754
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:52,250
He's got room, downfield he goes.
Will anybody catch him?

1755
01:48:52,290 --> 01:48:55,490
Deep into the secondary now.
Touchdown, New York.

1756
01:48:56,430 --> 01:49:00,390
Extra point makes it 14-7, Kansas City.

1757
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:07,020
Kansas scores on the eight-play
drive, capped with Rogers's 32-yard run.

1758
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:13,420
And that's the end of the third quarter.
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, ten.

1759
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:16,410
Back to throw once again.
Post available...

1760
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:19,580
- Let's go!
... beats the safety down the right side.

1761
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:21,570
He's in!

1762
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:23,390
All right!

1763
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:29,380
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, 17. What
a final four minutes we're going to have.

1764
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:30,940
- Where's Brandon?
- I don't know.

1765
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:33,030
Where's Brandon?

1766
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:36,740
We're back in it babe!

1767
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:40,010
New York touchdown
and we win both bets!

1768
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:42,680
Hey!

1769
01:49:42,730 --> 01:49:46,020
- Hey Brandon?
- I believe this'll be their final possession.

1770
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:49,980
Can they do it? Can they get it done
like they have all year long?

1771
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:55,130
They're trailing by four. Don't forget,
the new rule doesn't apply here.

1772
01:49:55,170 --> 01:49:57,640
They've gotta get into the end zone.

1773
01:49:58,370 --> 01:50:01,030
- He left.
- I know.

1774
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:03,690
You didn't tell me?

1775
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,590
How about that?

1776
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:12,820
No goodbye no... no nothing.

1777
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:17,350
- I'm sure it's all there in the letter.
- I'm sure it is.

1778
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:20,580
I wonder what's not in here.

1779
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:23,190
What do you mean?

1780
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:29,130
- What do you mean what do I mean?
- He had enough. He wanted his life back.

1781
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,070
He said that to you?

1782
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:34,140
Well loud and clear by leaving.

1783
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:39,560
- I think it was something else.
- Yeah? Tell me.

1784
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:42,370
You know.

1785
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:44,310
No.

1786
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:47,170
You have no idea?

1787
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:53,220
- You're missing the game Walter.
- Oh no. This is the game.

1788
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:55,470
On first down,
the handoff is to Jones.

1789
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:58,640
He's on the right side.
He's got a blocker. And a first down.

1790
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,890
- But he's dropped inbounds.
- Nice.

1791
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,910
I guess Brandon was homesick.
I don't know.

1792
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:06,880
Or maybe he had
such deep feelings for me

1793
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:11,150
that he couldn't face saying goodbye.

1794
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:17,620
Wait a minute.

1795
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:22,520
I just got an idea. Just came to me.

1796
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:25,230
I mean out of the blue.

1797
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:27,210
What about this?

1798
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:33,050
Brandon didn't tell me
he was gonna leave because...

1799
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:36,600
you let him fuck you.

1800
01:51:38,580 --> 01:51:42,650
Back to pass, rolls under the left side.
Guns it over the middle, it's complete.

1801
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:45,360
Edwards has it, all the way
down to the 44, Kansas City.

1802
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:47,550
Oh God.

1803
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:50,780
- You deny it?
- Oh my God.

1804
01:51:52,030 --> 01:51:54,120
Do I have to Walter?

1805
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:56,470
You know you did.

1806
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,910
Oh you...
Another lock of the year?

1807
01:51:58,950 --> 01:52:00,850
I saw you Toni.

1808
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:04,020
I saw you and him that night.

1809
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,380
I never went to Vegas.

1810
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,030
You mean you lied to me about the trip.

1811
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:11,180
Oh don't talk to me about lying.

1812
01:52:11,220 --> 01:52:15,490
- I guess you had the whole thing set up.
- Oh don't make this about me.

1813
01:52:15,530 --> 01:52:19,620
- Just put me out there on a tray?
- I put a tray out there.

1814
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:24,840
You didn't have to shove a fucking apple
in your mouth and sit on it!

1815
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:28,840
He's looking for his hot receiver.
Edwards, again, got it! Kansas City, 23.

1816
01:52:28,870 --> 01:52:30,510
Admit it!

1817
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:33,220
You played me Walter.

1818
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:36,450
You're fucking-A I did.

1819
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:40,380
It worked. Didn't it?

1820
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:44,170
With eight seconds left, New York
has to spend their final time-out.

1821
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,320
Brandon was right.

1822
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:50,220
- But you don't deny it?
- It's the best pick he ever made.

1823
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:53,200
I don't know what that means.

1824
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:58,350
Deep drop sets up in the pocket. Fires
over the middle. Batted down at the line!

1825
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:02,520
So after everything,
it all comes down to one final play.

1826
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:08,780
You were gambling with me that night Walter.
With me!

1827
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:12,290
Brandon knew it
because he knew you.

1828
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:14,790
He told me he was sure
you were watching somehow.

1829
01:53:14,830 --> 01:53:19,000
So he asked me in to spend the night
and put on a little show for you Walter.

1830
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:23,030
But I didn't believe him Walter.
Oh God I didn't believe him.

1831
01:53:23,070 --> 01:53:27,030
I mean after all we've been through.
So I figured you know "What the hell?"

1832
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:29,640
He slipped out the back no big deal.

1833
01:53:29,670 --> 01:53:32,040
He never even stayed here.

1834
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:34,020
And you.

1835
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,900
You were in such a good mood
the next day.

1836
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:40,070
I figured "Thank God
because he must've been wrong. "

1837
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:43,190
"Otherwise why wouldn't he confront us
confront me?"

1838
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:44,610
Oh Walter.

1839
01:53:44,650 --> 01:53:49,760
So it all boils down to this.
Can New York find the end zone?

1840
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:52,220
This is what players dream of.

1841
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:55,870
The chance to win it on the final snap.

1842
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,710
You wanted to lose! Like I was something
you could just toss on the table!

1843
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:03,170
Only we booked your bet Walter
Brandon and me

1844
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:07,180
who evidently love you
more than you love yourself.

1845
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:10,990
Spreads the defense.
Drops back to throw.

1846
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,750
Here comes the pressure.
He bounces to the right side.

1847
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:17,190
Your fantasy is to end up alone
with nothing!

1848
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:21,110
I won't let that happen.
Understand?

1849
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:24,280
I will never let that happen to you.
This is it.

1850
01:54:24,310 --> 01:54:27,260
He's on the run,
picks up a big block downfield.

1851
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:32,520
This is real Walter.
You and me and Julia we're all that's real.

1852
01:54:34,290 --> 01:54:35,650
One man to beat.

1853
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:38,730
This is it Walter.

1854
01:54:38,770 --> 01:54:40,920
He goes airborne from the five.

1855
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:43,360
- Does he get in?
- He's in! He's in!

1856
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:47,850
Touchdown, New York!

1857
01:55:53,750 --> 01:55:57,300
Apaches win this game a-whoosh!

1858
01:55:58,030 --> 01:56:01,260
Giants with me! Over here with me!
This side this side

1859
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:03,760
this side right in front of me right here.

1860
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:05,910
Take a knee take a knee take a knee.

1861
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:10,330
We got a tough team we're playing today
y'all know that. Toughest on our schedule.

1862
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:15,090
Now most important thing
we're gonna do today is have fun.

1863
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:19,930
I mean have some serious fun.
We're gonna play loose and enjoy ourselves.

1864
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:22,430
We're gonna play
this wonderful game of football.

1865
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,470
- Do we wanna win?
- Yeah!

1866
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:27,220
- What are we gonna do play?
- Play!

1867
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:28,540
- Huh?
- Play!

1868
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:32,440
Ah let's go do it!

1869
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:40,640
What's going on chief?

1870
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,810
Coach do you really think
we can win today?

1871
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,950
Ho!

1872
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,350
I'd bet on it.

1873
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:58,350
