1
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,221
Son of a bitch.

2
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,832
Anyway, the cop is sitting there,
sipping his coffee, you see?

3
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,895
And he's scratching his head.
He's completely confused by now.

4
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,806
- He says to the drunk...
- How's it going, Philo?

5
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,367
..."What about the guy
in bed with your wife?"

6
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,404
And the drunk says, "The hell with him.
Let him make his own coffee."

7
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,382
You get it?
"Let him make his own coffee."

8
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:26,587
Excuse me.

9
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:30,389
That's funny,
but don't give up your day job.

10
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,950
Come on, Big Al.

11
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:36,398
Let's have some fun.
You want to go some place?

12
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:41,003
- Hey, Big Al. Are you married?
- I used to be.

13
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,964
I know this place in the valley.
We could go get a couple drinks.

14
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:49,739
Lots of action there. Great fun.
What do you say?

15
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,677
Hey. Put them back.

16
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,416
- You talking to me?
- This ain't the Salvation Army.

17
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,747
Put them back.

18
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,549
I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al.

19
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,721
- You mean these?
- Yeah, asshole.

20
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,459
- Unless you're taking them to your tree.
- Shit. Excuse me, gents.

21
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:13,130
The squirrel is taking his peanuts
up to his tree.

22
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,600
The squirrel is ripping off peanuts,
ain't you, squirrel?

23
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:23,445
Going to take them up to your tree?

24
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:33,747
All right.

25
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:37,149
- Come on, guys. Knock it off.
- Get him!

26
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:38,284
Attaboy!

27
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,625
- Come on, get out of here, you guys.
- Get him.

28
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,527
Outside. Come on, guys.

29
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:48,395
Outside!

30
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:36,549
Hey, Orville, what's doing?

31
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,248
Ma's going to try it again.

32
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:55,867
I should have remembered my wig.

33
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,702
You think it'll make any difference?

34
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,639
I don't know, Ma.

35
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,705
I don't expect
that's all they're going to be looking at.

36
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:24,826
Don't be in such a fired, big hurry.

37
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,836
I want to look at these pictures
one time more.

38
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:31,600
I always did have trouble
with these squiggly lines.

39
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:35,542
I hope you pass it this time, Ma,
because there ain't too many more...

40
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:38,341
...of these places we can go to.
They all know you.

41
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:42,616
They don't know how I drive.
Don't none of them know how good I drive.

42
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,455
Been driving since
before them sons of bitches were born.

43
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,615
Come on, get out.

44
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:03,756
Here.

45
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,134
You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde.

46
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,838
You've done real good, Ma.

47
00:08:11,674 --> 00:08:12,663
Meathead.

48
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,838
Waited till I passed the whole test
before he tells me I'm too old.

49
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,643
I should have remembered my wig.

50
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:27,681
The hell with everybody.
Come on, get going, for God's sake.

51
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:31,519
- Philo, are you out here?
- No, I ain't.

52
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,391
What are you doing?
Are you working on the car?

53
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:40,363
Orville, that's two dumb questions
in a row you've asked me.

54
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,659
Here.

55
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,938
Help me put that block under the car here.

56
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,638
- This one here?
- Yeah.

57
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,305
You want it under the wheel
or under the spring?

58
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,870
Under the spring.

59
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,040
There you go.

60
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:01,949
- Thanks.
- Sure.

61
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:05,254
Ma's pissed. It's Clyde.

62
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:08,955
He got out this morning, came over,
and shit all over everything.

63
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,161
How did she get him back?

64
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:15,361
That's what she's pissed about.
She had to bribe him with all her Oreos.

65
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:18,531
Well, I'll make it up to her.

66
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,308
- You got one going tomorrow?
- Yeah, you coming?

67
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,009
Sure am.

68
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,279
Who wants some action around here?

69
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,511
- There you go, my man. What's the name?
- $40.

70
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,052
- Name?
- John Hatfield.

71
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,588
I got you, my man. Thank you. Who else?

72
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,288
How much you want?
Quick, talk to me, my man.

73
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,759
- Give me $80.
- $80. Let me see that.

74
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,554
- Name?
- Jackson.

75
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,396
All right, listen, I've got $100.
Who wants to make a side-bet, here?

76
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,900
Come on, guys. Talk up!

77
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:48,368
He may be good,
but he ain't no Tank Murdock.

78
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,828
Take it.

79
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,005
- We won't have anything...
- Take it.

80
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:54,940
You're on.

81
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,909
- Who's gonna hold this?
- You hold it.

82
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,286
No problem, you're fine.

83
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:07,348
Church, let's go, man.

84
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,457
You got him.

85
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,596
- Come up here, Clyde. There you go.
- Put this bum away!

86
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,036
Don't waste any time on the guy,
just put him away.

87
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:28,439
Put him away now, Church!

88
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,405
Put him away.

89
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:56,295
Thank you. $5, $100 and $200...

90
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:58,094
...$500, $600, $900<i>...</i>

91
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,004
Clyde could have beat him.

92
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,899
I kind of like this.

93
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,570
That one's a redhead.

94
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,130
- I'll take the one on the left.
- All right.

95
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,709
The one stuffing her face with chowder.

96
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:20,843
Let's go over there
and see what she's drinking.

97
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:24,942
Hi.

98
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:29,186
My name's Philo.
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?

99
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,820
Suit yourself.

100
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,958
I don't recall seeing you around here.

101
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,227
I've never been here before.

102
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,430
Where do you go when you're not here?

103
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:44,166
My name is Carol. I go to USC.
I major in sociology.

104
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,607
I'm here because I'm doing a paper
on the country-western mentality.

105
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,071
Well, that just blew five minutes
of our conversation.

106
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:56,709
Well, you asked if you could sit.
You didn't say nothing about talking.

107
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,309
Who are you mad at?

108
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:02,557
- I don't suppose you have a light, do you?
- No, I don't smoke.

109
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,958
Excuse me.

110
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,325
Orville.

111
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,486
Tell me, just what is
the country-western mentality?

112
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,792
Well, if the lyrics of this song
are any indication...

113
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:47,427
...it's somewhere between moron
and dull-normal.

114
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,402
Oh, my<i>...</i> Jesus Christ.

115
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,134
You are disgusting.

116
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,142
Let's leave. Go.

117
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,575
What happened?

118
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:04,745
This wild clam got out of control. Take it.

119
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,958
Did you see her face?

120
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:15,087
You could've put a turd in there and
she couldn't gotten a better look on her.

121
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,727
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

122
00:15:19,802 --> 00:15:24,296
<i>Now, would you all put your hands</i>
<i>together and keep the applause going?</i>

123
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,204
<i>Let's all give a big,</i>
<i>big Palomino welcome...</i>

124
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:30,468
<i>... to pretty Miss Lynn Halsey...</i>

125
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:32,345
<i>... Taylor.</i>

126
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,020
<i>Thank you. Okay. Ready, boys?</i>

127
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:29,395
Let's get out of here.

128
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,571
I want to watch this chick for a minute.

129
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,917
<i>That's awful nice. Lynn Halsey...</i>

130
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,518
<i>... Taylor.</i>
<i>You can come back anytime, honey.</i>

131
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,787
Excuse me.
Could I put this back there for a while?

132
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,527
- Sure can.
- Thank you.

133
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,435
- You sure sing pretty.
- Well, thank you.

134
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:11,171
I'd really be pleased
if I could buy you a drink.

135
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:12,933
Sure.

136
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:16,038
- I'd like a beer.
- Two of those.

137
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:25,552
I didn't get your name in the introduction.
My name's Philo Beddoe.

138
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:29,113
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

139
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,825
- She sure ran out pretty fast.
- Oh, her. I hardly knew her a minute.

140
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:36,963
A minute?

141
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,899
Well, you must go through
a lot of women like that.

142
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:46,802
- That was a nice song. Did you write that?
- No. Wish I did.

143
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,969
Just a song my daddy used to sing to me
when I was little.

144
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:53,343
When you were little?
That's where I know you from.

145
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,950
When I was in third grade
I knew a girl that looked enough like you...

146
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,146
...it makes my memory water.

147
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,681
You sure do talk funny.

148
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,494
Kind of smoky in here.

149
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,796
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.

150
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,473
Say, it's kind of smoky in here.

151
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:36,017
So, I decided there was nothing
I liked doing better than singing.

152
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,889
- So, here I am.
- Am I glad.

153
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,796
Row 3. That's my lucky number.

154
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,536
I'll tell you what:

155
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:52,366
You're my lucky number.

156
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:58,902
Would you like to...

157
00:20:00,215 --> 00:20:02,308
...have me in for a while, maybe?

158
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:04,683
I'd love to.

159
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,979
- Only...
- Only?

160
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,426
- Only my boyfriend, Schyler, is sleeping.
- Boyfriend?

161
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,121
- He wouldn't mind.
- He wouldn't?

162
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:19,462
So long as you don't drive his car.

163
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,170
Well, I think maybe we could make it
some other time when he ain't around.

164
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:30,072
Okay. Whatever you say.

165
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,147
Slightly advanced.

166
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,298
Look, man, it's an ape!

167
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:56,902
Yeah. Which one's the ape?

168
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:03,337
- What did you say?
- That looks your girlfriend.

169
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,037
Hey, buddy.
Are you taking your mother for a ride?

170
00:21:11,386 --> 00:21:13,786
- Take that up there, baby.
- Hey.

171
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,484
- So long, apeshit.
- Son of a bitch.

172
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,532
What the hell's this?

173
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,201
We'll get them, right, boy?

174
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,526
Clyde, get your hands off the wheel.

175
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,264
- Let's get the hell out of here. He's crazy.
- Follow me.

176
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:50,776
- Hey, why did you come in here?
- He'll never find us in here.

177
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:52,782
Get those things out of here.

178
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:01,359
Roll up your window.

179
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:05,488
Shit!

180
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,412
Get them out of here. Freaks!

181
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,240
Hey, man, what in the hell is going on?

182
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,825
- Do you think we ought to stop and fight?
- Nope.

183
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,068
Let's catch that train.

184
00:24:50,872 --> 00:24:52,271
Take it easy.

185
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:54,733
It's a monkey.

186
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,819
Crazy monkey!

187
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,468
Are you okay? Thanks, Clyde.

188
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:37,549
If you don't like him,
how come you stay with him?

189
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,583
Because he promised
to help me get the $7,000.

190
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,083
"Best I can"

191
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,625
- For what?
- "It's hard for me to say no

192
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,752
"to a truck drivin' man"

193
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,520
For the down payment.

194
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:52,958
- What do you want to buy?
- "Cadillac that I still don't have the time

195
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:57,901
"Keep the fool who wants to marry me
dangling on my line"

196
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,974
My own club back home in Denver.

197
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:04,471
I'm going to call it
the Lynn Halsey-Taylor Drinking Fountain.

198
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:08,676
"Hard for me to say no
to a truck driving man"

199
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,483
That will be the name of my group, too.
I'll have talent night three nights a week.

200
00:26:15,423 --> 00:26:17,914
How much of the $7,000
do you have already?

201
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,454
He won't tell me.

202
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,061
Well, about the only thing
of any value I've got is Clyde.

203
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,494
- Clyde?
- Yeah, he's my ape.

204
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,771
- I won him in a fight.
- You won him?

205
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:34,574
Yeah.

206
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:37,607
They brought him over here
to make a baby.

207
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,147
- You mean he's from Africa?
- No, he's from Sumatra.

208
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:44,445
When he got here, the other male orang
they had on hand had already done the job.

209
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,543
You're kidding?

210
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,454
Yeah, so Clyde got real mean as hell,
so they sold him to a desert zoo.

211
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,755
- Desert zoo?
- One of those places out in the desert...

212
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:57,696
...says, "Real, live dragon, cactus candy,
five miles ahead," that sort of thing.

213
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,764
That's where I won him.
I bet my truck and two dirt bikes on him.

214
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,872
- You must have wanted him a lot.
- I really hated to see him in that cage.

215
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,079
- So, who'd you fight for him?
- These four guys.

216
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:13,645
Four guys?

217
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,610
You would have thought after
the first couple lost they'd have given up.

218
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:21,645
- Well, I fought all four at once.
- All four at once?

219
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,026
- You like to fight?
- I used to. Better than anything.

220
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,191
Well, almost anything.

221
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,228
So, why didn't you turn professional?

222
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,665
None of that stuff. There's too many rules.

223
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:39,095
You're just a regular Tank Murdock.

224
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,203
- You know him?
- I know of him.

225
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:46,036
He's from Denver
and he's a regular institution.

226
00:27:46,114 --> 00:27:47,604
You bet he is.

227
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:50,617
Now that is one guy
I'd like to meet up with.

228
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:54,187
Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.

229
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,783
And you will. You will.

230
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:03,661
Right now we'll meet my friend, Orville.
He's waiting on us.

231
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:09,000
So, Tank was in the back seat of this car
with this debutante.

232
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,095
I mean, her daddy owned the whole town.

233
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,469
- And his buddy was in the trunk.
- And then what happened?

234
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,143
Well, you see, she was so pure...

235
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:22,081
...that nobody believed these wild stories
that Tank had been telling about her.

236
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,347
- What happened?
- You got to use your imagination, Orville.

237
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:29,483
Anyway, after...

238
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:33,755
...she heard all this bumping around
and laughing coming from the trunk.

239
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,352
And she started to scream.

240
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:38,532
So, all these cops came in,
six or eight of them.

241
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,366
Tank tried to explain, but nobody
believed him because they all knew him.

242
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:47,238
He must have put four cops in the hospital.
It took about 12 of them to take him in.

243
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:49,471
Man.

244
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:52,069
- One thing I want to know about the story.
- What?

245
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,513
Who let that poor guy out of the trunk?

246
00:28:56,351 --> 00:28:58,080
Shit, he's probably still there.

247
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,515
Those two creeps over there
asked me to bring this to the lady.

248
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:25,709
This was mighty nice of you.

249
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,312
- Do you see that?
- An arm?

250
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,119
No, that.

251
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,152
A tattoo?

252
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:43,020
They don't know what this means.

253
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,123
Do you see that?

254
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,069
- Sorry.
- Two tattoos.

255
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:54,908
Them's black widows.

256
00:29:56,244 --> 00:30:00,340
Did you know that more people die
from black widows than rattlers each year?

257
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:02,883
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

258
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:06,882
Well, listen, I sure do appreciate
knowing that because...

259
00:30:06,988 --> 00:30:11,049
...most of the people I know
just step on them and squish them.

260
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,717
I don't need this cheap shit.

261
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:16,491
Orville, that's no way to thank two guys
that just bought us a beer.

262
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,996
Why don't you get the check and
I'll go outside and thank them properly?

263
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,071
Okay.

264
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:32,472
- Go ahead.
- You started it.

265
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,719
Shouldn't you go with him?

266
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,100
Sure is good pecan pie.

267
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:10,211
I think we'd better get out of here.

268
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:44,817
Cut it out, Clyde.

269
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,985
Ma, what'd you do that for?

270
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:57,291
Been trying to get your attention
for five minutes.

271
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:58,989
Did you see Orville?

272
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,104
- Yeah. I saw him.
- Well? Orville tell you what?

273
00:32:05,239 --> 00:32:08,470
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Ma,
about you missing your driver's test again.

274
00:32:08,543 --> 00:32:10,977
That ain't the one what I mean.

275
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,271
You mean Clyde?

276
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:19,849
I'm sorry about that too, Ma.
He won't do it again, I promise.

277
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:23,288
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What? The crap or the Oreos?

278
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:26,359
About Clyde! Goddamn it!

279
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:29,487
I don't have no privacy
in my own home no more.

280
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:34,198
Well, I confronted him about it, Ma.
I guarantee it won't happen again.

281
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:37,566
No privacy in your own home.

282
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:42,443
A whole goddamn bag of Oreos.

283
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:54,354
Stop that, you goddamn baboon.
No respect. No privacy.

284
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,521
No nothing.

285
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,156
Bang.

286
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,474
- You're late, pretty boy.
- Shut up.

287
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,969
I don't believe this.

288
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:21,137
Damn.

289
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:25,074
I never knew nobody
who could hit so hard or so fast.

290
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:28,347
- He could've been Denver Tank Murdock.
- That's right.

291
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,553
- Sound like him?
- Don't know.

292
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,321
Didn't get to see him so close as Elmo.

293
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,291
At least I didn't drop my bike and run.

294
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,264
Like you two! You big suckers!

295
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:41,765
Shut up!

296
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,762
Now, it isn't bad enough...

297
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,240
...that you let somebody else
kick your butts...

298
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:50,937
...without you trying to do it to each other.

299
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:57,644
If we're all talking about the same man...

300
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,686
...and I think we are...

301
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:07,157
...then it appears he's got
a rather growing collection of our bikes.

302
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:10,391
Yeah, but we don't know for sure
if he took them or not.

303
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:13,828
- We were...
- Unconscious for two hours!

304
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,329
- Sick son of a bitch.
- It's not true!

305
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,371
Shut up!

306
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:25,542
The very first thing we do...

307
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,641
...is find out who we're talking about.

308
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:32,619
I mean,
we don't even know where to find him.

309
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,951
How are we going to find him?

310
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:44,284
Well, it appears to me
that there can't be too many guys...

311
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,389
...driving around this valley with an ape.

312
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:53,695
- What you got sticking out here?
- Open it.

313
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:57,433
- It sure feels heavy.
- Open it.

314
00:34:59,874 --> 00:35:04,174
- Philo. God, where'd you get this?
- Off a couple little old widows.

315
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,112
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

316
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,674
More people are dying to buy widow bikes
than are dying by rattler bites every year.

317
00:35:15,356 --> 00:35:16,050
Well.

318
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,718
- You like it?
- Well, yeah.

319
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,521
That I do.

320
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:27,627
Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit.

321
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,174
- What's the matter?
- I'm okay.

322
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:40,308
- House not too good tonight?
- I'm okay, Philo.

323
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:06,706
Well, at least this outfit you bought me
was a big hit.

324
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:13,972
I don't like the way this guy's driving.

325
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:35,059
Get down!

326
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,010
Is that somebody you know?

327
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:56,953
Schyler.

328
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:02,023
- I thought you said he didn't care.
- He must have changed his mind.

329
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:19,812
Philo, I'm scared.

330
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:23,646
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- That's not what I'm afraid of.

331
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:26,243
I'm afraid for Schyler.
Please don't hurt him.

332
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,617
He tried to shoot me
and didn't care that you were next to me.

333
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,591
That's just it.
He was just trying to scare you.

334
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,491
He doesn't even know how to shoot.

335
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:37,030
I sure don't like
the way he's trying to find out.

336
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,698
Philo, I know him.
He's probably in there now...

337
00:37:39,767 --> 00:37:41,826
...hiding, scared out of his wits.

338
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,194
I don't like to see you cry.

339
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:48,075
Let me talk to him. Please.

340
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,132
I don't know.

341
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:53,774
Please. For me. Please.

342
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,944
All right. You talk to him.

343
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,787
And you tell him that I want you
to come with me...

344
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:03,085
...and I want you to stay with me,
you hear?

345
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:04,488
Philo.

346
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,387
Here. I want you to dry those tears.

347
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:13,659
- I want you to take this. It's the dough.
- I couldn't take that.

348
00:38:13,734 --> 00:38:16,225
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it now, you hear?

349
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:19,934
- Okay.
- I don't want you to cry no more.

350
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:44,255
Clyde, how'd you get out?
What, did you pull the lock off?

351
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,561
How'd you get out?

352
00:38:47,602 --> 00:38:51,265
No, you don't. Come on. No, you don't.

353
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,302
Give me that! Give me it!

354
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:01,206
What?

355
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:04,379
Good Clyde.

356
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,115
Just hold that truck up, Clyde.

357
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,323
What are you doing, Clyde?

358
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:12,882
- Philo.
- Yeah.

359
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:17,088
Call this son of a<i>...</i> No, don't call him.

360
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,697
Don't call him. Good Clyde.

361
00:39:21,302 --> 00:39:23,634
That's it, Clyde. Hold it up.

362
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,312
How many times have I told you?

363
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:40,320
I don't want him drinking beer,
except on Saturday night.

364
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,506
- Don't expect I'll need these no more.
- Take it easy, Ma. This is the easy part.

365
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:10,412
Awful glad there ain't no more
of them squiggly pictures.

366
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,446
Good. Maybe you'll do it this time.

367
00:40:14,522 --> 00:40:17,218
Maybe. Well, I guess I will.

368
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,926
Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses?

369
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:27,232
It's none of his goddamn business
what I wear.

370
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:30,368
Just wear them to read, anyway.

371
00:40:31,706 --> 00:40:33,173
Was there anything else?

372
00:40:35,242 --> 00:40:37,107
Told me I was too old.

373
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:40,005
Meathead! Orville.

374
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,143
Yes, Mother?

375
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:46,514
- Next time I'll wear my glasses.
- Good.

376
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:50,049
Goddamn it.

377
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:00,196
God, you're a handsome devil.

378
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,203
Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now.
I want you to handle it.

379
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:15,509
That means no spitting, pissing,
farting or picking your ass.

380
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:20,717
You hear me? Because if you do,
I'll throttle you. Understand?

381
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:37,432
Man, I'll tell you something.

382
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:41,470
Clyde, this has got to stop.
People are going to talk, you know?

383
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,943
- What is it?
- That trailer that was parked down there.

384
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,208
What happened to it?

385
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:23,307
- What spot?
- That spot right over there.

386
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:24,408
I don't see it.

387
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:26,282
- Well, where'd it go?
- It's gone.

388
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:29,045
I know it's gone, goddamn it,
but where'd it go?

389
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:31,223
- Back home, I suppose.
- Denver?

390
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:35,028
Some folks
just don't take me into their confidence.

391
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,529
The plates said Colorado.
Sound right to you?

392
00:42:37,832 --> 00:42:40,096
- When'd they leave?
- This morning.

393
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:41,364
Thanks.

394
00:42:44,038 --> 00:42:45,300
Goodbye, now.

395
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:56,675
Hey, Philo. I've got a message for you.

396
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:14,398
Why don't you watch
what the hell you're doing?

397
00:43:14,768 --> 00:43:16,759
Why don't you shut your face, boy?

398
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:21,464
What have we got here?
A real, live, macho cowboy.

399
00:43:21,942 --> 00:43:23,239
Don't turn your back.

400
00:44:13,127 --> 00:44:15,595
- Somebody call the cops.
- They are the cops.

401
00:44:18,966 --> 00:44:19,933
Shit.

402
00:44:23,837 --> 00:44:26,670
- She didn't say where she was going?
- Nope.

403
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:29,642
- Well, how do you know where to look?
- I'll know.

404
00:44:30,044 --> 00:44:33,104
Well, how do you know
she wants you to come looking for her?

405
00:44:33,414 --> 00:44:36,110
There you go
asking those dumb questions again.

406
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:39,686
- Is Clyde going?
- Yes.

407
00:44:42,456 --> 00:44:44,515
- You got room for one more?
- Yes.

408
00:44:44,591 --> 00:44:45,387
Got you!

409
00:44:46,927 --> 00:44:47,916
I'm coming.

410
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,523
- Which way are we headed?
- East.

411
00:44:51,932 --> 00:44:53,263
Sounds reasonable.

412
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:56,565
East? What are you gonna do
with the baboon?

413
00:44:57,705 --> 00:45:00,299
Orangutan, Ma. Clyde's an orangutan.

414
00:45:00,474 --> 00:45:03,841
- What's the difference?
- He has 12 ribs, just like you and me.

415
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:07,312
- What are you going to do with him?
- He's coming with me. Come on.

416
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:09,542
Well, when are you coming back?

417
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:13,948
- When are you coming back?
- Whenever it's time, Ma.

418
00:45:16,023 --> 00:45:19,686
It don't seem right
to leave an old lady alone.

419
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,695
And what about my goddamn license?

420
00:45:24,865 --> 00:45:26,833
This is<i>...</i> It's just<i>...</i>

421
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:30,628
Twelve ribs.
I don't believe any of that shit!

422
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,603
This machine is very sensitive.

423
00:45:34,508 --> 00:45:36,408
What do you think you'll find here?

424
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:39,446
You never know what you'll find here.
Just listen.

425
00:45:40,014 --> 00:45:41,777
It picks up all kinds of metal.

426
00:45:41,882 --> 00:45:47,320
Swiss watches, expensive foreign cameras,
silver dollars. Gold, man.

427
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,089
- Gold?
- Yeah.

428
00:46:03,804 --> 00:46:06,204
- Herb.
- Yeah.

429
00:46:07,074 --> 00:46:09,542
What are we going to do
about that son of a bitch?

430
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:12,579
- Who?
- You know who I'm talking about.

431
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,611
That cowboy at the Palomino Club.

432
00:46:14,948 --> 00:46:17,815
I don't know what you can do about him.
What can we do, man?

433
00:46:18,085 --> 00:46:21,384
You mean to stand there and tell me
you'd let him get away with it?

434
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,383
You got anything in mind?

435
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:28,752
What I got in mind is
to break his stupid head.

436
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:40,240
- Listen, are you sure that thing works?
- Sure it works. Just keep digging.

437
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:44,374
Besides, you don't even know
where to find him.

438
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:46,913
Don't worry. I'll find him.

439
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,504
I got a plan.

440
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:52,913
- What's that?
- I'm going to use my medical leave.

441
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,155
What are you laughing at?

442
00:46:56,223 --> 00:46:59,386
You're going to spend your two weeks
medical leave looking for him?

443
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:03,521
I'll spend the next two years
looking for him if I have to.

444
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,659
- What's up?
- Pit stop.

445
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:18,377
- Are these cantaloupes fresh?
- Yes.

446
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:21,346
- Are they today's?
- Yes. They just came in.

447
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:26,250
No, I only want a quarter of a pound.

448
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:29,018
These only cost a quarter a pound.

449
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:32,616
I only want a quarter of a pound
of tomatoes.

450
00:47:35,129 --> 00:47:37,063
Yes, ma'am. Right.

451
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,692
Can I have a fresh bag now?

452
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,734
I'll take these two cantaloupes.
How much are they a pound?

453
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:52,636
Cantaloupes are 29 cents a pound.

454
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:56,672
I think they were cheaper down the road.
I don't know why you're so expensive here.

455
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,580
Ma'am.

456
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,124
- Can you help me out?
- Sure.

457
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:15,732
- What's your name?
- Echo.

458
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:17,266
Echo.

459
00:48:20,107 --> 00:48:21,699
Do you want some cantaloupes?

460
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:27,006
Those are beautiful.

461
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:31,646
Thank you. How many would you like?

462
00:48:33,687 --> 00:48:35,154
Do you live around here?

463
00:48:36,757 --> 00:48:39,317
Yeah. Down past the wash.

464
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:42,722
Where's the wash?

465
00:48:44,164 --> 00:48:46,325
How come you want to know
so much about me?

466
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:51,195
Because I never met anyone
that made me feel like you do.

467
00:48:52,072 --> 00:48:53,471
Right out of the gate.

468
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:00,880
- Where are you headed?
- East.

469
00:49:57,571 --> 00:49:59,903
- What's your name?
- Echo.

470
00:50:00,107 --> 00:50:01,836
- What?
- Echo.

471
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:06,246
Orville.

472
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:12,118
What did you say, anyway,
that made that woman storm away?

473
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:18,219
I told her you had the clap.

474
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,748
All right, spread out.

475
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:56,957
- Hey, heifer, how's the slop?
- Suits the clientele real good.

476
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,290
Looking real good.

477
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,863
Don't you got no special of the day?

478
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:05,432
Liver and onions.
Why don't you read the menu?

479
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:08,268
Maybe I'd rather talk to you.

480
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:11,903
Has Philo Beddoe been around?

481
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:17,282
You want to talk, take a walk.
You want to eat, take a seat.

482
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:23,446
What are you laughing at? Lard-ass!

483
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,525
I'll tell you what:

484
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:32,188
Turn around and walk out that door,
and I'll forget what you said.

485
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:36,794
And I won't tell everybody
that you drink horse piss.

486
00:51:38,538 --> 00:51:41,803
- Elmo, Cholla, did you hear what he said?
- I heard it.

487
00:51:43,276 --> 00:51:47,076
- I'll just keep this warm for you, Lester.
- Okay, big mouth, let's go.

488
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:50,149
You want me to keep a piece
of that lemon meringue?

489
00:51:50,217 --> 00:51:53,345
Yeah, this won't take but a minute.
Let's go, cutes.

490
00:51:58,825 --> 00:52:01,055
Drinking horse piss. What is this?

491
00:52:01,928 --> 00:52:04,488
- Hey, come on!
- Get him, come on!

492
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:08,625
Kick him in the nuts.

493
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:38,862
Kick him in the shins.

494
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:55,177
Come on over here. Give me a hand.
Where you going? Get back here.

495
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:59,476
That's it.
Get this little son of a gun right there.

496
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,182
Good.

497
00:53:14,534 --> 00:53:16,331
Hurry up. Get out of there, Roy.

498
00:53:17,704 --> 00:53:18,602
Look out.

499
00:53:23,443 --> 00:53:24,569
My God.

500
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,714
Spread out!

501
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,124
Goddamn morphadites.

502
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,597
Come on.
Get the hell out of the way. Hurry.

503
00:53:52,372 --> 00:53:53,361
Let's go.

504
00:53:56,977 --> 00:53:57,966
Move it.

505
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:30,768
- Who is it?
- The police.

506
00:54:32,612 --> 00:54:36,309
I'm coming. I'm coming, goddamn it!

507
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,009
What do you want with an old lady?

508
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:43,021
Ma'am, we're looking for Philo Beddoe.
Our records say he lives at this address.

509
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,653
Well, your records are wrong.

510
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,993
He lives at that address in the back.
What do you want him for?

511
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,930
- Just looking for him, ma'am.
- Well, he don't live there anymore.

512
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,959
He's gone off.
Took that son of a bitch, Clyde, with him.

513
00:54:58,038 --> 00:54:58,800
Clyde?

514
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,700
His ape.

515
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:03,531
His ape?

516
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,443
You heard me.
What you making me repeat myself for?

517
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:10,049
Do you know where he's gone?

518
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,716
Who gives a damn? Stealing all my Oreos.

519
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:19,955
Crapping all over the place.
Twelve ribs, my ass!

520
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:23,191
- Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.

521
00:55:23,263 --> 00:55:25,254
I'm sorry, too, you see.

522
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:28,528
Leave an old lady alone, fending for herself.

523
00:55:28,902 --> 00:55:30,563
No protection.

524
00:55:30,637 --> 00:55:32,434
It just don't seem<i>...</i>

525
00:55:34,507 --> 00:55:37,806
Well, I don't suppose you know
of a ladies' room hereabouts?

526
00:55:38,678 --> 00:55:39,838
They're all over.

527
00:55:41,581 --> 00:55:42,878
Just pick one.

528
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,691
- She's something, ain't she?
- She sure is.

529
00:55:57,631 --> 00:56:00,259
You're full of all kinds
of surprises these days.

530
00:56:03,503 --> 00:56:08,031
Listen, I want to say that I appreciate
your making her feel at home.

531
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:15,314
Clyde.

532
00:56:18,184 --> 00:56:21,312
There's something out there!
God, it's horrible! It's a monster.

533
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:26,652
- It's not even a bear. It's a<i>...</i>
- No, Echo, it's just Clyde.

534
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:31,653
Hey, Echo! Wait. Give me<i>...</i> What?

535
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:36,024
Take it easy. You're going to scare him.

536
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,438
- Me, scare him?
- That's right.

537
00:56:39,973 --> 00:56:42,703
Let me introduce you. Echo, this is Clyde.

538
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:45,404
Clyde, this is Echo. Echo.

539
00:56:47,213 --> 00:56:48,339
Did you get it?

540
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,754
It's okay. See?

541
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:14,165
- Hey, granny, how they hanging?
- Hey, hot damn.

542
00:57:15,075 --> 00:57:19,171
- What are you doing tonight, honey?
- Let her alone. She's mine. I saw her first.

543
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:37,627
- Say, old lady. Where's Philo Beddoe?
- How the hell do I know?

544
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:42,734
Get off my porch with that thing.
Get off my property!

545
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:45,800
You're not very hospitable.

546
00:57:46,473 --> 00:57:51,137
Hospitable, my ass. Get off my porch!

547
00:57:53,446 --> 00:57:56,574
Very well. If you insist.

548
00:58:18,338 --> 00:58:21,466
All right, lady. Put that gun down!

549
00:58:22,375 --> 00:58:25,037
I'm warning you, lady.
Put down that gun, now!

550
00:59:15,995 --> 00:59:17,428
Wait for me!

551
00:59:18,464 --> 00:59:19,761
First, the police.

552
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,201
I told those boys not to leave
a vulnerable old lady all alone.

553
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,801
Hospitable? Horseshit!

554
00:59:29,943 --> 00:59:31,911
- Police.
- Yeah?

555
00:59:32,045 --> 00:59:35,606
I want to ask you questions about a girl.
Her name was Lynn Halslay-Taylor.

556
00:59:35,882 --> 00:59:36,871
Halsey.

557
00:59:37,817 --> 00:59:39,978
Yeah. She was here, but she left.

558
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:12,611
Hey, man.
How come that cat ain't moving?

559
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,209
You think he's dead?

560
01:00:14,487 --> 01:00:19,618
Shit, man, if he's the only one here,
let's have some fun.

561
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,352
Shut up!

562
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:24,162
But he's only one old man.

563
01:00:24,597 --> 01:00:27,794
It was only one old woman
that nearly ruinated all of you.

564
01:00:28,368 --> 01:00:29,460
Yeah.

565
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:33,839
Maybe we ought to split.

566
01:00:40,914 --> 01:00:42,211
Hello, there.

567
01:00:46,819 --> 01:00:47,843
You in there?

568
01:00:51,324 --> 01:00:54,657
What is it?
What the hell are you doing here?

569
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:59,687
Well, I'm looking for a girl
that used to stay around here.

570
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:05,635
- She was with a guy named Philo Beddoe.
- Don't know no Philo Beddoe.

571
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:09,797
Well, the girl's name was Halsey-Taylor.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.

572
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:13,836
She must've been one jim-dandy of a girl.

573
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:18,216
You're the third one come to ask about her
since she left for Denver.

574
01:01:18,918 --> 01:01:21,216
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

575
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:36,155
- Could I put that back there?
- Sure, doll. It'll be here when you need it.

576
01:02:41,434 --> 01:02:43,368
- Buy you a drink?
- Sure.

577
01:02:47,707 --> 01:02:48,833
Taste that, too.

578
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:50,837
Here.

579
01:02:51,144 --> 01:02:52,736
Get out of my stuff, Clyde.

580
01:02:53,946 --> 01:02:56,506
Here, take a piece of this. That's my salad.

581
01:02:57,784 --> 01:03:01,811
Why don't you two take the truck?
Clyde and I are going to go check around.

582
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,438
- What's going on?
- Orville, you've got to get up.

583
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:09,941
- Why?
- Because it just isn't right, that's why.

584
01:06:10,042 --> 01:06:12,135
- What isn't right?
- What isn't right?

585
01:06:12,612 --> 01:06:14,910
It just ain't right. I mean<i>...</i>

586
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:19,708
I mean, you two have somebody.
And I've almost got somebody.

587
01:06:19,785 --> 01:06:21,218
And it just ain't right.

588
01:06:21,787 --> 01:06:25,314
- Well, what isn't right about it?
- You just don't understand, do you?

589
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:28,785
Yeah. He just doesn't understand.

590
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:31,659
Right, and that's why
we've got to do something about it.

591
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:32,493
We do?

592
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:36,126
Yeah. Here. Off your ass and on your feet.

593
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:43,069
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Clyde, damn it.

594
01:06:44,577 --> 01:06:46,306
You think he doesn't understand.

595
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:50,838
He sits back there all the time. You don't
think he understands, but he's smart.

596
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:54,409
And I'll tell you something, Orville.

597
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:58,181
He thinks about a lot of things
besides Oreo cookies.

598
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:03,657
Right, Clyde?

599
01:07:06,399 --> 01:07:09,698
- You don't mean<i>...</i>
- I mean exactly that.

600
01:07:12,305 --> 01:07:16,173
Where the hell are we going to get
Clyde laid in the middle of the night?

601
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:25,142
Shit.

602
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,488
How the hell do you break into a zoo?

603
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:32,315
It's easy.
Zoos are meant to keep everybody in.

604
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:35,688
Listen to that.
He knows something good will happen.

605
01:07:36,095 --> 01:07:38,723
Well, how do you know there's a lady
in there for him?

606
01:07:38,964 --> 01:07:40,898
I don't, but if there is one there...

607
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,959
...and he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know
what to do, anyway. Give me a hand.

608
01:07:49,642 --> 01:07:50,631
Come on.

609
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:54,411
Well, what do you want us to do?

610
01:08:00,353 --> 01:08:04,221
The place is probably guarded, so I want
you to stay here and keep an eye out.

611
01:08:10,496 --> 01:08:11,485
Come on, pal.

612
01:08:14,066 --> 01:08:15,556
Okay. All right, Clyde.

613
01:08:16,369 --> 01:08:17,358
Up.

614
01:08:18,604 --> 01:08:22,335
Boy, I bet there's a gal in there.
Think there's a lady in there?

615
01:08:24,076 --> 01:08:25,134
You bet, man.

616
01:08:26,412 --> 01:08:28,539
Clyde, you think there's a lady in there?

617
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,547
Come on. Clyde.

618
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:15,958
Orville.

619
01:09:18,164 --> 01:09:21,156
When we get to this next town,
you should drum up some action.

620
01:09:21,267 --> 01:09:23,497
We're getting a little short on cash.

621
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:26,266
Sure, why not.

622
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:33,201
Do you know where
the meat-packing plant is?

623
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,608
- No. But I'll find it.
- All right, I'll see you there.

624
01:09:37,683 --> 01:09:38,741
You got it.

625
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:05,072
I don't care much
for that perfume they're wearing.

626
01:10:05,778 --> 01:10:08,269
- Do they know me here?
- No, it's even money.

627
01:10:08,848 --> 01:10:12,841
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Guy's name is Kincaid.

628
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:17,218
He's a local champion. Taller than you.
About 240 pounds. I checked.

629
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:21,992
- And?
- They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock.

630
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:24,696
Tank Murdock?

631
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:29,200
You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall.
And another thing, he fights dirty.

632
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:32,028
- Orville Boggs?
- You got it.

633
01:10:32,538 --> 01:10:34,301
Okay, open the gate.

634
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:37,542
It's over there in the cold room.

635
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:48,485
- How much you want?
- What you got?

636
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:51,019
- $1,200.
- We'll take it.

637
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:54,086
You've got to show me something
besides conversation.

638
01:10:57,496 --> 01:11:00,329
- I'll take that.
- All right, if I see yours.

639
01:11:04,603 --> 01:11:06,662
What do you want us to do with the body?

640
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:09,731
Save your breath.
It's enough you'll lose your money.

641
01:11:11,043 --> 01:11:12,840
- Hey, man.
- Hey, baby!

642
01:11:13,546 --> 01:11:14,706
What's up?

643
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:33,355
I want you.

644
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:13,600
Come on, Philo, put him away!

645
01:12:16,742 --> 01:12:18,471
Don't let him tag you!

646
01:12:42,534 --> 01:12:46,527
What the hell are you doing, Philo?
It's getting cold in here!

647
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:46,296
- I think you owe us some money.
- What money?

648
01:13:47,766 --> 01:13:48,858
Wait a minute.

649
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:52,529
You aren't gonna tell all these boys
that you'll take their money, are you?

650
01:13:59,545 --> 01:14:02,571
That was just so you'd know
the first one was no accident.

651
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:25,498
Did you see this little filly shoot?
Where did you ever learn to do that?

652
01:14:25,604 --> 01:14:28,072
You could shoot a gnat off a buffalo's ass.

653
01:14:28,307 --> 01:14:31,333
- I told you I could take care of myself.
- She took care of us.

654
01:14:33,312 --> 01:14:35,507
<i>Car 103.</i>

655
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:38,744
<i>Proceed to the intersection</i>
<i>of Interstate 5 and Velasquez Road...</i>

656
01:14:38,984 --> 01:14:40,281
<i>... for a 602.</i>

657
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,511
<i>103 here. Got you, over.</i>

658
01:14:46,558 --> 01:14:49,220
That 602's the same as our 406.

659
01:14:50,129 --> 01:14:54,088
No way. It's got to be the same
as our 309 or at the best our 213.

660
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,522
You're crazy.

661
01:14:56,668 --> 01:15:00,331
No New Mexican 602
can come anywhere near California 309.

662
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,838
When's the last time
you been out on a 309?

663
01:15:03,909 --> 01:15:05,604
Maybe three or four months.

664
01:15:07,179 --> 01:15:11,138
But it don't mean that I don't know
that our 309 ain't more than their 602.

665
01:15:13,185 --> 01:15:15,380
- What time you got?
- 6:07.

666
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:18,756
<i>Unit 103, abort that 602, 103.</i>

667
01:15:18,824 --> 01:15:22,521
<i>Proceed to Velasquez Road</i>
<i>on Interstate 5 for a 607.</i>

668
01:15:32,671 --> 01:15:35,697
Well, kiss my<i>...</i>

669
01:15:52,858 --> 01:15:56,385
I suppose you think I'm crazy
traipsing across the country...

670
01:15:56,461 --> 01:15:58,952
...after a girl I hardly even know.

671
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:01,056
Hell, I'm not like Orville.

672
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:03,397
It takes me a long time
to get to know a girl.

673
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:07,029
Even longer to let her know me.

674
01:16:08,073 --> 01:16:09,734
You know what I mean?

675
01:16:14,913 --> 01:16:19,179
I'm not afraid of any man,
but sharing my feelings with a woman...

676
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:24,013
...my stomach just turns to royal gelatin.

677
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:27,057
I don't suppose that ever happens to you.

678
01:16:29,494 --> 01:16:33,988
I guess you just keep howling
until sometime they howl back.

679
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,304
If this is a strike,
it means Ronstadt and Parton move over.

680
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:51,678
It's Halsey-Taylor to the top.

681
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,596
It's okay. It just means
it's going to take a little longer.

682
01:17:07,466 --> 01:17:09,457
But we don't give up.

683
01:17:14,773 --> 01:17:16,764
If I get this pickup...

684
01:17:17,476 --> 01:17:19,944
...it means the same time next year...

685
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:22,412
...Halsey-Taylor has her own special.

686
01:17:38,563 --> 01:17:40,793
That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady.

687
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,733
Thank you.

688
01:17:54,947 --> 01:17:57,882
Will you mind Clyde for me?
I'm going to take a run.

689
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:58,939
All right.

690
01:18:32,284 --> 01:18:33,546
Shit!

691
01:18:36,755 --> 01:18:39,155
Hey, Lynn! Wait up!

692
01:18:44,463 --> 01:18:45,930
Fancy meeting you here.

693
01:18:46,231 --> 01:18:48,563
Incredible is more like it.
What are you doing?

694
01:18:48,967 --> 01:18:50,195
Following you.

695
01:18:52,237 --> 01:18:54,102
You picked me up just in time.

696
01:18:54,373 --> 01:18:56,000
All this weather.

697
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:59,708
You took off so fast
I thought there was something wrong.

698
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:02,204
Bad time to run.

699
01:19:02,514 --> 01:19:04,505
I figured maybe I'd better follow you.

700
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:06,582
Thought you'd better, huh?

701
01:19:08,186 --> 01:19:10,677
Hell, you didn't even get a chance
to meet Clyde.

702
01:20:13,218 --> 01:20:15,243
Pull in right here.

703
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:28,732
I know where he keeps the money now,
so it's a matter of finding the right time.

704
01:20:29,201 --> 01:20:31,101
I still say my way would be quicker.

705
01:20:31,169 --> 01:20:32,636
Philo, you promised.

706
01:20:32,704 --> 01:20:37,368
Please don't make me sorry I told you.
You make me afraid to believe you.

707
01:20:37,442 --> 01:20:39,637
I never want to make you sorry.

708
01:20:43,782 --> 01:20:46,114
You want to come down
and meet everybody?

709
01:20:46,184 --> 01:20:50,143
No, I'd better go back.
We'll do it when we have more time.

710
01:20:50,222 --> 01:20:53,589
Tomorrow night? Like we agreed?
El Patio Restaurant.

711
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,058
Philo?

712
01:20:58,029 --> 01:20:59,462
You're really something.

713
01:21:24,289 --> 01:21:25,756
Jesus Christ.

714
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:30,592
Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I think I'm still asleep and dreaming.

715
01:21:30,662 --> 01:21:33,153
You're not dreaming. Come on.
Get your ass up.

716
01:21:33,331 --> 01:21:35,265
Hi, Clyde. How you doing?

717
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:39,062
Let's let the little lady up.

718
01:21:43,408 --> 01:21:45,342
What did you do that for?

719
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:48,803
I think he's trying to tell us something.

720
01:21:48,947 --> 01:21:51,074
What's he trying to tell us?

721
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:54,680
Why are you so all fired happy, Philo?

722
01:21:54,753 --> 01:21:58,280
Listen, the only time
I ever see you smiling is when<i>...</i>

723
01:22:00,492 --> 01:22:01,959
You got laid?

724
01:22:02,427 --> 01:22:05,521
You were jogging,
and you picked up somebody and laid her.

725
01:22:05,897 --> 01:22:08,127
- Did he?
- I'll do you one better than that.

726
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,027
- You mean Clyde got laid again, too?
- No. I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor.

727
01:22:12,571 --> 01:22:14,232
How'd you do that?

728
01:22:14,406 --> 01:22:16,966
I was running down the highway
and she picked me up.

729
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:18,873
- Where is she now?
- She's in town.

730
01:22:18,944 --> 01:22:21,469
She's getting things straightened up,
we'll see her.

731
01:22:21,546 --> 01:22:25,107
Goddamn, that is good news.
That means we can go home soon.

732
01:22:27,252 --> 01:22:28,617
I don't see why not.

733
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:32,250
While we're waiting around
for true romance...

734
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:34,588
...I think I'll jump down and get some flies.

735
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:37,526
There's no way I don't want
to get in on this action.

736
01:22:38,763 --> 01:22:41,061
- Help me finish these first, will you?
- Right.

737
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:45,795
Did you ever notice how drinking
and fishing kind of go together?

738
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:48,201
- You sell fishing licenses in here?
- Sure do.

739
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:50,468
Something about the six-pack
and the worms.

740
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:53,841
- Any good trout around here?
- About four or five miles down the road.

741
01:22:54,913 --> 01:22:56,107
Orville.

742
01:22:57,482 --> 01:23:01,111
Don't these look like the humpers
Clyde was eating this morning?

743
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,579
Are these the flies Philo wanted?

744
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:05,748
Grayish yellow.

745
01:23:31,683 --> 01:23:33,981
Hey, Philo. Where's your boat?

746
01:23:35,086 --> 01:23:36,986
I'm going to hang out here on shore.

747
01:23:39,357 --> 01:23:43,123
Echo and I are going on down
to the other end here.

748
01:23:45,096 --> 01:23:46,893
- We got him?
- Got him.

749
01:23:52,504 --> 01:23:54,301
Here. Be careful, it's loaded.

750
01:23:56,508 --> 01:23:57,805
Why the scattergun?

751
01:23:57,976 --> 01:24:01,036
- Because I don't want to miss that sucker.
- Makes sense.

752
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:02,838
Here.

753
01:24:06,618 --> 01:24:08,085
Why all the fishing gear?

754
01:24:08,153 --> 01:24:11,145
Because we got to look
like we're going fishing, dummy.

755
01:24:11,723 --> 01:24:13,953
Now look, I'll go right through there.

756
01:24:14,459 --> 01:24:16,825
You go around the lake
and come from behind him.

757
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:19,820
I'm going around this lake...

758
01:24:19,898 --> 01:24:22,867
Damn it. Not so loud.
He'll hear you. It's not so far.

759
01:24:23,535 --> 01:24:26,766
And here. Get going.

760
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:33,877
Now get going, will you?

761
01:24:52,364 --> 01:24:53,626
Stinking hippie.

762
01:24:58,069 --> 01:24:59,536
Quite a mess of fish.

763
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,534
Shit.

764
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:16,452
The white boy's
the craziest son of a bitch in the world.

765
01:25:16,588 --> 01:25:18,579
Where in the hell is that Putnam?

766
01:25:22,193 --> 01:25:23,626
What are you doing, boy?

767
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:26,526
My God!

768
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:30,091
Feet!

769
01:25:30,802 --> 01:25:33,270
Feet don't fail me now, man.

770
01:25:43,782 --> 01:25:47,479
Goddamn apes, snakes, alligators and shit!

771
01:25:58,496 --> 01:26:01,727
You so much as blink,
and I'll blow a big hole in you.

772
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:03,357
Who are you and what do you want?

773
01:26:03,435 --> 01:26:05,869
Just never you mind.
You'll find out soon enough.

774
01:26:06,504 --> 01:26:07,869
What the hell was that?

775
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,008
- Jesus.
- Good Lord.

776
01:26:11,776 --> 01:26:13,539
He must be 5 or 6 pounds.

777
01:26:13,611 --> 01:26:16,273
Give him some slack.
Don't jerk, you'll lose him!

778
01:26:17,649 --> 01:26:18,911
God, he's a monster.

779
01:26:21,386 --> 01:26:23,013
Don't jerk him!

780
01:26:23,321 --> 01:26:25,152
Give me that rod!

781
01:26:26,758 --> 01:26:29,022
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

782
01:26:32,464 --> 01:26:34,056
He's a monster!

783
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:36,494
He's a frigging monster!

784
01:26:37,502 --> 01:26:39,834
I've never seen anything like it before.

785
01:26:40,004 --> 01:26:42,598
He must weigh 25 pounds.

786
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:46,374
He's a stud! He's got to be a stud!

787
01:26:46,444 --> 01:26:48,412
Come on, help me here.

788
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:53,244
Boy, he is a stud!

789
01:26:58,122 --> 01:27:00,147
- Have a stud.
- Shit!

790
01:27:26,818 --> 01:27:27,876
Putnam!

791
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,351
Big, dumb galoot.

792
01:27:35,894 --> 01:27:37,486
Putnam, where are you?

793
01:27:38,096 --> 01:27:39,085
Dummy.

794
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:54,205
What was that?

795
01:27:54,279 --> 01:27:56,611
I think he's spending too much time
with Clyde.

796
01:28:42,627 --> 01:28:44,925
What are we supposed to do
with all this stuff?

797
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:46,463
Eat it. All of it.

798
01:28:50,134 --> 01:28:51,999
- "All of it"?
- All of it.

799
01:28:54,572 --> 01:28:55,937
What if I can't?

800
01:28:57,075 --> 01:28:58,667
Then we'll give it to Clyde.

801
01:28:59,243 --> 01:29:02,303
Can you imagine what this would do
to Clyde's digestive tract?

802
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:04,780
He already has enough gas
to go to North Denver.

803
01:29:04,849 --> 01:29:07,181
And he's never seen a bean in his life.

804
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:13,083
Say, when's your little lady coming here?

805
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:16,089
She should be along any time.

806
01:29:24,802 --> 01:29:27,236
Let's get out of here.

807
01:29:31,876 --> 01:29:34,845
Listen, Philo.
Does that mean we're going back to L.A.?

808
01:29:35,079 --> 01:29:37,775
Hell, no. But when I find her...

809
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:41,552
...l'll take care of that guy she's with.
My way.

810
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:52,620
Hey, an Airstream!
Hey, Cholla! That's the one!

811
01:30:10,415 --> 01:30:11,575
Howdy.

812
01:30:21,259 --> 01:30:23,625
I bet you're Lynn Halsey-Taylor, ain't you?

813
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,498
Now how'd you know that?

814
01:30:27,932 --> 01:30:30,765
Well, we been following you,
all the way from Los Angeles.

815
01:30:32,503 --> 01:30:34,266
You see me sing at the Palomino?

816
01:30:35,006 --> 01:30:39,670
I'm sorry to say, I missed that,
but I promise not to miss it next time.

817
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:46,148
Well, then, what did all you boys follow me
all the way to Colorado for?

818
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:49,719
Do you know a guy named Philo?
Philo Beddoe?

819
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:52,122
He's been following you.

820
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:53,687
You know that?

821
01:30:54,358 --> 01:30:55,689
Yeah, I know that.

822
01:30:56,194 --> 01:30:57,684
Is he a friend of yours?

823
01:30:58,296 --> 01:30:59,729
Not particularly.

824
01:31:00,231 --> 01:31:01,858
You want to find him?

825
01:31:02,467 --> 01:31:03,695
Not particularly.

826
01:31:04,469 --> 01:31:05,299
We do.

827
01:31:28,326 --> 01:31:30,157
Now, that's a nice looking truck.

828
01:31:32,063 --> 01:31:33,724
There she is.

829
01:31:37,368 --> 01:31:39,700
You stay here. This is personal.

830
01:31:53,484 --> 01:31:54,644
Lynn!

831
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,810
You Philo Beddoe?

832
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:02,387
Do I know you?

833
01:32:03,227 --> 01:32:04,592
You're going to.

834
01:32:24,982 --> 01:32:28,145
Last time I saw you two,
you were going for a fast freight.

835
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:31,584
The last time we saw you,
you were dirt-diving in an alfalfa patch.

836
01:32:33,758 --> 01:32:34,816
Philo Beddoe.

837
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:38,023
Your time has come.

838
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:47,003
Here we go again.

839
01:34:30,141 --> 01:34:31,130
I got him.

840
01:34:35,112 --> 01:34:37,444
The bikes, you dummies! The bikes!

841
01:34:38,482 --> 01:34:39,506
The bikes!

842
01:34:48,826 --> 01:34:50,691
Are those guys coming after me?

843
01:34:51,128 --> 01:34:53,153
Those guys are coming after me!

844
01:35:03,207 --> 01:35:04,435
I'll get him!

845
01:35:17,722 --> 01:35:20,088
I'm going to kill you all!

846
01:35:26,163 --> 01:35:26,959
Look out!

847
01:35:27,832 --> 01:35:29,265
Watch out for the truck!

848
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:35,996
Hi, cutie pie. Want a ride?

849
01:35:36,907 --> 01:35:38,670
- Don't mind if I do.
- Hop in.

850
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:44,069
Darling, I'm only glad you happened along
when you did.

851
01:35:44,849 --> 01:35:46,248
Nice day for a drive.

852
01:35:56,794 --> 01:35:59,661
- Look at these guys coming up the road.
- I love this.

853
01:36:01,766 --> 01:36:03,393
Ten points.

854
01:36:04,268 --> 01:36:05,997
Get out of the way!

855
01:36:08,739 --> 01:36:09,865
There's the boy.

856
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:37,334
- Thanks.
- Make sure that door's closed, would you?

857
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:50,946
Let's go get a bite to eat.

858
01:36:51,082 --> 01:36:54,051
No, you go on ahead.
Clyde and me will eat later.

859
01:36:55,052 --> 01:36:57,612
We'll bring you back something,
okay, Philo?

860
01:36:58,556 --> 01:36:59,352
Whatever.

861
01:36:59,623 --> 01:37:03,684
He's locked into that phone book.
He must have called every place in town.

862
01:37:04,628 --> 01:37:06,220
What are you hungry for?

863
01:37:18,609 --> 01:37:21,908
Are you sure you don't want me
to go in there and just hang out?

864
01:37:22,012 --> 01:37:25,448
- He pulled a shotgun last time.
- This is personal. I'll handle it.

865
01:37:25,616 --> 01:37:29,313
Why don't Echo and I just go in
and have a beer and listen to the music?

866
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:33,649
- Do you want to borrow my pea shooter?
- Thanks. You two go have a good time.

867
01:37:33,724 --> 01:37:36,386
See if you can find out the location
of Tank Murdock.

868
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:11,651
- What will you have?
- A beer.

869
01:38:52,236 --> 01:38:55,205
<i>Lynn Halsey-Taylor, everybody.</i>

870
01:38:56,740 --> 01:39:00,870
<i>All right!</i>
<i>It's great to have you back in Denver, Lynn.</i>

871
01:39:02,413 --> 01:39:06,850
<i>And now, everybody,</i>
<i>the featured performer of the evening...</i>

872
01:39:07,551 --> 01:39:11,351
<i>... the star of tonight's show,</i>
<i>Mr. Charlie Rich.</i>

873
01:39:16,894 --> 01:39:21,194
The best club out there is the Palomino,
and the manager's a good friend.

874
01:39:21,265 --> 01:39:23,733
So, I'll write him,
tell him to give you a spot.

875
01:39:23,801 --> 01:39:25,598
That's mighty nice of you.

876
01:40:03,607 --> 01:40:04,869
Like me?

877
01:40:08,345 --> 01:40:09,710
Want me?

878
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:11,747
- Let's go.
- Harlan.

879
01:40:12,783 --> 01:40:15,718
I've got a friend. It's okay, though.

880
01:40:16,587 --> 01:40:19,681
He won't mind,
he just might want to come along.

881
01:40:22,359 --> 01:40:23,621
Let's go.

882
01:40:40,577 --> 01:40:42,306
- Is this your...
- No.

883
01:40:47,284 --> 01:40:50,082
You want to talk to him?

884
01:40:50,821 --> 01:40:54,222
The lady and I have a little business.
I expect you'll be excusing us.

885
01:40:57,127 --> 01:40:59,891
Maybe you ought to excuse yourself.

886
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:02,928
It's okay, Harlan, I'll just be a minute.

887
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:06,068
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

888
01:41:16,413 --> 01:41:19,644
It's your own goddamn fault!
Who asked you to follow me?

889
01:41:20,184 --> 01:41:21,913
- I just thought...
- You thought!

890
01:41:22,152 --> 01:41:25,212
If you'd thought,
you would've taken some very broad hints.

891
01:41:25,589 --> 01:41:29,491
I've been trying to get rid of you practically
ever since the first night we met.

892
01:41:30,961 --> 01:41:33,054
- What about Taos?
- What about it?

893
01:41:33,697 --> 01:41:35,597
I need it just like anybody else.

894
01:41:37,067 --> 01:41:40,696
- You do this all the time.
- I do this all the time.

895
01:41:40,938 --> 01:41:44,567
And you and me had our time,
so why don't you know when to disappear?

896
01:41:44,775 --> 01:41:47,300
- Come here.
- Take your hands off me!

897
01:41:47,778 --> 01:41:49,712
Lynn? Is everything all right?

898
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:54,317
Schyler, this is the one from L.A.
The big, dumb one I told you about.

899
01:41:58,489 --> 01:41:59,956
Schyler, with the shotgun?

900
01:42:00,023 --> 01:42:03,015
That was my idea.
I was hoping he'd scare you away.

901
01:42:03,761 --> 01:42:05,626
Why didn't you just say goodbye?

902
01:42:05,696 --> 01:42:07,186
You're here, aren't you?

903
01:42:07,264 --> 01:42:09,698
Guys like you don't understand goodbye.

904
01:42:15,072 --> 01:42:17,040
What do you do? You hustle for him?

905
01:42:18,976 --> 01:42:20,910
You're just not too smart, are you?

906
01:42:21,111 --> 01:42:24,342
Why did you have to come?
Why couldn't you quit like everybody else?

907
01:42:24,415 --> 01:42:27,145
You had to come chasing me
and spoil it all.

908
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,313
I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all.

909
01:42:31,488 --> 01:42:35,390
Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough
to want to take you further than your bed.

910
01:42:38,529 --> 01:42:39,621
I hate you!

911
01:42:44,535 --> 01:42:45,695
I hate you.

912
01:42:58,382 --> 01:42:59,872
I hate you.

913
01:43:16,834 --> 01:43:19,667
Well, listen,
do you want to rest up a little bit?

914
01:43:19,803 --> 01:43:22,704
- You don't have to take him tonight.
- No, that's fine.

915
01:43:25,108 --> 01:43:27,133
- Are you Philo Beddoe?
- That's right.

916
01:43:28,645 --> 01:43:30,476
Keep on walking, you'll see him.

917
01:43:30,547 --> 01:43:33,516
- Here you go.
- Is that all the money?

918
01:43:33,717 --> 01:43:36,083
- What's with the girl?
- Don't worry about it.

919
01:43:36,186 --> 01:43:38,416
What do you mean, "Don't worry about it"?

920
01:43:43,527 --> 01:43:45,256
Right to your left.

921
01:44:22,533 --> 01:44:25,366
Don't worry about it, Philo.
This guy's a real porker.

922
01:44:30,574 --> 01:44:33,566
He's carrying his reputation
around his waist.

923
01:44:55,232 --> 01:44:57,427
Looks like you've had a go at it already.

924
01:44:58,402 --> 01:45:00,893
You sure that face won't hurt
too much to fight?

925
01:45:01,939 --> 01:45:05,773
- I ain't going to hit you with my face.
- That's funny.

926
01:45:06,243 --> 01:45:07,608
I like you.

927
01:45:08,045 --> 01:45:12,982
Don't worry, we'll get this over
in a hurry and take care of you.

928
01:45:15,352 --> 01:45:18,150
Where did you hear
of Tank Murdock before, kid?

929
01:45:18,722 --> 01:45:20,417
- All around.
- Yeah?

930
01:45:20,624 --> 01:45:22,956
- They say you're the best.
- They do?

931
01:45:26,263 --> 01:45:28,356
Well, let's get with it.

932
01:46:32,329 --> 01:46:33,956
Jesus Christ, who is that guy?

933
01:46:34,031 --> 01:46:36,829
I don't know,
but he's the one that'll beat Tank Murdock.

934
01:46:39,569 --> 01:46:42,834
Come on, Tank! Come on, get him!

935
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:12,727
Jesus Christ,
that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock!

936
01:47:12,803 --> 01:47:13,997
Get up! Come on!

937
01:47:27,851 --> 01:47:29,842
This guy will be the new Tank Murdock!

938
01:47:34,224 --> 01:47:36,192
- This is it for Tank!
- Who is this guy?

939
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,355
The new guy's beaten Tank!

940
01:47:55,812 --> 01:47:57,939
You has-been! You ought to learn to box!

941
01:47:59,683 --> 01:48:01,514
You old bum! You're all washed up!

942
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:17,295
That guy's the new Tank Murdock.

943
01:48:21,037 --> 01:48:23,028
We're going to make money on this guy.

944
01:48:33,617 --> 01:48:35,380
My champ!

945
01:49:05,182 --> 01:49:07,377
"5, Z."

946
01:49:08,718 --> 01:49:12,017
Just a minute there, now. "B."

947
01:49:13,623 --> 01:49:17,218
Why don't you try that one
with your glasses on?

948
01:49:19,362 --> 01:49:23,492
Yes. Why didn't I think of that?

949
01:49:25,635 --> 01:49:29,036
- There. Now try it again.
- Thank you, I will.

950
01:49:29,339 --> 01:49:31,102
"5, Z, B, D, F."

951
01:49:31,174 --> 01:49:33,039
- You did it.
- Of course I did.

952
01:49:33,243 --> 01:49:36,041
Now, if you'd please step over there
for your photograph.

953
01:49:37,714 --> 01:49:39,739
- My what?
- Your photograph.

954
01:49:40,116 --> 01:49:41,583
To put on your license.

955
01:49:42,819 --> 01:49:44,411
My photograph.

956
01:49:44,521 --> 01:49:48,287
Well, what will they think of next?

957
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:57,158
I think I forgot my comb.

958
01:49:57,634 --> 01:50:00,933
Don't you worry.
Your hair looks quite lovely.

959
01:50:02,138 --> 01:50:04,038
Do you really think so?

960
01:50:10,213 --> 01:50:13,080
All right, you ready?
Let me get you focused.

961
01:50:13,216 --> 01:50:15,616
All right, now smile. Big smile.

962
01:50:16,616 --> 01:50:26,616
