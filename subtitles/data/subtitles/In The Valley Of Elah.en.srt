00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,332
Mike, returns to the damned vehicle!

3
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:42,375
Mike, returns to the damned vehicle!

00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,304
Let us go Mike, now!

" In the Valley of Elah"

00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,422
INSPIRED BY CURRENT EVENTS

7
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,389
I hardly listen to it.

8
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,367
I said that their son is in USA.

9
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,406
November 1 the 2004.
- My son is in Iraq.

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,332
Their son was in Iraq Mister,
but I have arrived for 4 days in an unit.

11
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,538
It should be here if that is certain.

12
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,281
Mr., their son has until
on Sunday to come,

13
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,375
he/she has an exam of pending balisitca.

14
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,309
I sit down it I have another call

15
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,325
" You don't have any message"

16
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,515
Hello he/she is Mike, he/she leaves your message and I will call you
of turn.

17
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,454
Hello Mike is your father, give me a call
when you can.

18
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:30,339
America is dangerous, very dangerous
for our society

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,413
Analysts say that they plan a strategy.

20
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,521
And that they make it in the city of Zomorra
from the month beginnings.

21
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:46,398
Here he/she has.

22
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:50,402
Does he/she believe that this fit?

23
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,268
You have to trust somebody some
times, Hank.

24
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,411
Does somebody call?
- No.

25
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,430
Do base of the I exercise, with who wants to speak?

26
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,426
First sergeant Victor, division criminalistica

00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,438

00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,272
Thank you.

30
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,347
Is there something that you love me?

31
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,297
Why cannot I go with you?

32
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,296
Not I believe that they allow you to enter to the I exercise.

33
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,466
I will call you when it arrives there
tomorrow, this well?

34
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,311
They are two days managing.
- For some people.

35
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,351
Never let him to play the floor.
- This well.

36
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,224
Of where you are?
- Of the Salvador.

37
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,353
You know that it means when a flag
this hung to the you review?

38
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,458
It is an international sample of estres.

39
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,297
Seriously?
- Seriously

40
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,464
It means that we are in
big problems and it is hour

41
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,473
that they come to save our bottoms.

42
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,374
He/she says a lot.
- Undoubtedly if.

43
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,368
Does he/she know as making it now?
- If.

44
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,309
Well.

45
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,209
Dad?

46
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,311
Dad?

47
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,454
Dad?!

48
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,259
Dad?!

49
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,310
Ahead Mister.

50
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,323
Sergeant Deerfield?

51
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,395
Thank you to receive me, you that this busy one.

52
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,399
He/she would want that it had warned me before
that he/she will come, he/she would have but time.

53
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,307
The base has changed a lot from its days.

54
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,379
What are there of their friends?

55
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,373
Undoubtedly we ask them.

56
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,317
Some of their friends
72 came from the base,

57
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,512
but something am concerned

58
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,414
none of our soldiers you
it disappears time therefore.

59
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,257
Would he care if I see their clothes?

60
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,260
No.

61
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,304
Penning, this he/she is the soldier's father Deerfield.

62
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,429
Steve Penning a pleasure of knowing it Mister.

63
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,264
Has he/she listened of Mike?
- No

64
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,310
Mr. Deerfield wants to see the things
of Mike.

65
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,310
Sure Mister, this here.

66
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,506
Mike and I met each other in Bosnia.

67
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,411
I am grandiose histories of you.

68
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,515
Not he/she has called or anything?
- Does that surprise him?

69
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:17,260
You should know the best thing that me Mister,
Mike has never made something like that.

70
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,464
Long, Ortiz.

71
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,387
this he/she is the father of Doug.

72
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,424
A honor to know it Mister.

73
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,268
A pleasure to know it.

74
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,306
Doug?
- It is a nickname that we put him/her.

75
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,271
Not he/she makes sense, that it is the pigeonhole
of Mike.

76
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,275
Some has idea of where it can be
Mike?

77
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,242
Not Mister.
- I sit down it.

78
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,381
He/she should be a beautiful woman.

79
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:38,511
A pleasure to know it Mister.

80
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,283
When he/she listens of Mike tells him/her that
do communicate, this well?

81
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,252
This well.

82
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,359
Sergeant.

83
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,233
This is the soldier's father Deerfield.
He/she came to see their cuerto

84
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,460
Copied sergeant, I sit down it I thought that it was
somebody being about stealing something.

85
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,466
If, that it is that of Mike.

86
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,414
It was a pleasure to know it Mister.

87
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,350
Of who that is?

88
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,478
We lost a man.

89
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,472
Is that their bag, truth?
- If.

90
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,376
We are about to convince him that takes a new one.
But it was as speaking with the wall.

91
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,385
Not he/she has pictures.
- Do I sit down it?

92
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,359
He/she always took pictures and me those
it sent, I don't see any picture

93
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,263
or a camera.

94
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,463
To have properties is a true problem.

95
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,206
It should have been same in their days.
- If.

96
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,348
Would he care if I take this? Their mother
he/she gave it to him, leave mine at home.

97
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,249
I would like but. I cannot leave that you
take anything.

98
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,219
I understand.

99
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,373
This telephone has been in an intense heat.

100
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,503
If, it was in Iraq.
- It is for that reason.

101
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,313
This well.

102
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:59,390
This very fried one am.
Let us see.

103
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,319
Well, here this their list of contacts.

104
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,426
There is nunmeros of Barrys,
hamburgueserias, poultries,

105
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,265
pizza, TD, s, Ted.

106
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,234
What is T.D.?
- It is a local bar.

107
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,297
It could have but but that is
all that is.

108
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,269
Well, thank you.

109
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,273
Does he/she want the videos?

110
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,309
The videos?

111
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,371
If, look.

112
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,447
This is garbage.

113
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,387
Here there is one.

114
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,359
Lonard takes this.

115
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,395
Throw me the ball.

116
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,540
It is the first time that these children will see
a ball this way.

117
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,506
Is that their son?
- That is Mike.

118
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,293
Return him/her the damned ball!

119
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,301
What step?
Did they remove you your ball?

120
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,437
It turns off this thing.

121
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,274
If, but it seems that the rest of the files
they are corrupt

122
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,349
If he/she wants I can fix them at home,
slow but. they will be 100 $ but.

123
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,317
Can you send them for e-mail?
- If, there is not problem.

124
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,254
Thank you.
- Where this TDs?

125
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,330
I look for the bar.

126
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,472
Do I look for my son?
- Good luck.

127
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,319
What do you make?

128
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,356
Alone seeing old pictures that I send myself Mike.

129
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,229
Will you be well?

130
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,397
Not he/she makes sense, he/she would not leave without telling us he/she swims.

131
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,476
I will find it.
- This well.

132
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:49,250
Good night.
- Good night.

133
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,250
I hardly listen to you.

134
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,483
I have to leave of here.

135
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,280
She should have known it.

136
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,219
Wait one second.

137
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,325
Is their son in the I exercise?
- That is correct.

138
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,324
He/she needs to go to the I exercise, please.

139
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,397
They are very busy with the order and all that,
treatment of verifying the things for my bill.

140
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,200
The only thing that can make
it is to report it missing.

141
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,265
And in that case he/she needed to see to the
military police.

142
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,408
How's it going if it happens to me with somebody that
don't answer the telephone?

143
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,409
I want to know if he/she can help me with this.

144
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,489
Not he/she understands, the owner to that dog.

145
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,392
I am sure that if Mrs., but the one
dog bit him.

146
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,420
But that you would make?

147
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:37,426
Really not him you.

148
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,232
It ties it, he/she gives it or it can send it
to kill

149
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,360
but to put it to the bathroom and to drown it in the tub.

150
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,430
That doesn't sound a little strange
for you?

151
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,442
Not him you, perhaps thought that serious
more human.

152
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,336
But human?
It is a doverman

153
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,506
I drown it in front of our
son while he/she took a bath it

154
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,450
and I cry so that he/she stops

155
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,412
Does that sound but human for you?

156
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,381
Has their husband threatened her at some time?

157
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,425
No, the would never harm us, the alone one
he/she needs help.

158
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,526
For that reason he/she needs to go to BA, there they will give him/her a
consultant, is not anything but... 

159
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,423
Does he/she believe that I have not gone it stops there?

160
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,429
The non anger, the will be harmed, you that he/she will make it.

161
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,373
I would really like to help her.
- Seriously?

162
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,242
Because I find that he doesn't care
a cucumber.

163
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,269
In fact this way it is, but
I have to tell him/her crimes

164
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,305
against dogs they are difficult to process

165
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,474
but he cares I have somebody waiting for me.
- Rot.

166
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,354
That was something rude.

167
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,297
He/she has to take this to the I please exercise.

168
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,470
Treatment of avoiding my son to have
but problems.

169
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,240
You that this busy one but
the only thing that I need

170
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,437
that he/she makes it is a call
to the bank to see if.

171
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,509
retirement money or use their card this last
week.

172
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,477
Retired police or it is alone that you see much
television?

173
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,374
No, I am a military one.

174
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,353
Then he/she should know that the one exercises he/she has
their own personnel.

175
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,414
I sit down it, I hope he/she finds their son.

176
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,425
Hear, not you that he/she thinks which it is their work
but if it was as the one that I had

177
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,458
odedecer in everything, not to ask many questions
but my son.

178
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,299
it has passed the last 18
months making democracy

179
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,529
in a hole and serving their country.

180
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,530
He deserves something better than this.

181
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,416
My God, hello dear friend,
it is a pleasure to see you again

182
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,261
What devils faces at home?

183
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,330
We hardly see each other, we are of trip we will go
to see the grandsons.

184
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,468
Call you to the base.
- To the base?

185
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:02,271
Hank has been retired for 14 years.
- Seriously?

186
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,374
If, I go for the 15.

187
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,336
How devils these?

188
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,271
Well, do you want a coffee or a foot piece?

189
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,281
Not I have time, Helen this waiting for me
in the car.

190
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,380
What do you make? You call me to invite me
a swig?

191
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,382
No, he/she hoped you even worked in the base.

192
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,221
I look for an expensive friend.

193
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,320
Some of your children this in problems?
- No.

194
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,393
I always forget their name, he/she is Ben.
- David.

195
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,466
Correct, the one managed airplanes in the armada, certain
- If.

196
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,500
Should it be strong, how him this llendo?

197
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,275
He died in a crash
of helicopter making

198
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,405
you have maneuvered for ten years.

199
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,313
I sit down to listen that, Hank.

200
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,351
I sit down it a lot.

201
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,354
What is there of the but young?

202
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,258
Mike.
- If.

203
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,327
Of the I exercise as their father.
It was him/her well in Iraq.

204
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,264
I am making him/her a
favor, one of their muchahos

205
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,233
this in problems

206
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,429
Some of those that we even know this
there?

207
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,465
No, all have left.

208
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,405
She wants to arrive quick.

209
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,272
The children are waiting for us.

210
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,353
I found their old notebook.

211
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,229
Is something written that says key?

212
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,332
No, there is not anything of that.

213
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,470
These sure one?

214
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:16,465
If this but I don't sit down with desires of
to tell it to you.

215
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,480
Don't worry Hank, he/she will already appear.

216
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,253
He is a good boy, you that it is it.

217
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,394
I will find it.

218
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,330
I call you tomorrow.

219
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,353
What this happening?

220
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,492
Don't worry, not this related with
animals.

221
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,298
What?

222
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,328
We find parts of a body in
the highway.

223
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,280
He/she looks, there this your family.

224
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,508
He/she stops to joke with that.

225
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,285
Shit.

226
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,319
Shit!
What do I make?!

227
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,289
Don't stop.
Don't stop!

228
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,518
Hurry!
- Hold on to!

229
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,405
What do you make?

230
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,220
Some evidence but Marcus?

231
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,492
It is all that we have.

232
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,331
See to buy some glasses descartables,
we go.

233
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,459
And bring me a receipt!

234
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:37,509
Shawn?!

235
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,324
Do tell me that you discovered?

236
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,433
Good it seems that it kills her it was murdered the one
side of that fire.

237
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:42,406
Then the body you burns, the animals
they made it pieces.

238
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,544
And is this our jurisdiction?

239
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:50,285
Good, this seems to have been ago
two months.

240
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,390
The property of the city
alone he/she extends until

241
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,255
this fence

242
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,261
I don't believe that it is our body, boss.

243
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,460
Hallelujah, let us go home!

244
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,363
Boys pack!

245
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,209
The soldiers took charge of this!

246
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,321
Mr. Deerfield?

247
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,260
Am I Jim Mosher, can I speak with you?

248
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,321
If, ahead, alone gives me one minute.

249
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:22,331
Mr., I sit down to inform him/her that a body
it was opposing last night

250
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,278
The investigation says that
they can be their son's remains

251
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,278
Correct, does he/she need him to identify the body?

252
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,310
Not Mister, they identified the body of
another way... 

253
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,380
I believe that for partial fingerprints.

254
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,457
To that refers with partial?
What do I pass him/her?

255
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,293
Not I can say it Mister, somebody of the base... 

256
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,419
I want to see their body now!

257
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,348
Agent Deerfield, this is not necessary.

258
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,323
Not it is the way like he/she should remember
to their son.

259
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,258
Perhaps not.

260
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,364
 ... but it is the way like accent the earth,
so I want to see it.

261
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,472
The pattern shows that
the body was desmenbrado

262
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,275
before being burnt.

263
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,279
It perishes to have been with
a he/she arms piercing but even

264
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,510
we don't know with accuracy
that steel type.

265
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,309
For that reason the bones are cut and
not pulled up.

266
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,423
The pattern of the burnt sample parts
of the mienbros they were stabbed

267
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,390
and they put a fuel with intention
of burning the body.

268
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,420
It is ridiculous because it should it should not have cold
so that the fire spreads

269
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,322
What means that the
majority of the fabrics

270
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,334
So the damages are bigger in this part,
but I don't arrive to the bone

271
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,338
the cause of death
he/she delayed a little in knowing it

272
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,500
but there is multiple stabbed

273
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,239
How many?

274
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,242
How many stabbed?

275
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,347
Good with so much alone lost skin we will be able to
to count those that arrived to the bone.

276
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,477
Would how many be those?

277
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,354
42.

278
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,418
A knife or several?

279
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,464
One.

280
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,431
did you give this to the I exercise?

281
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,273
They took their own pictures.

282
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,473
And they didn't make it very well.

283
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,482
If this well would like me
to ask him/her some things

284
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,252
when it arrives home.

285
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,390
Wonder them now.

286
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,257
Their son taenia a green car?

287
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,327
Mike non taenia a car.

288
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:03,365
Report they say that they saw it a green car
in the field on Saturday in the night.

289
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,268
A theory says it can have been a robbery
that I finish bad.

290
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:11,236
There is a lot of activity of robberies lately.

291
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,465
I want to see where he/she died.

292
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,243
I sit down it, it is even one
scene of the crime, but

293
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,340
I will warn him/her he/she hardly can.

294
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,313
This well.

295
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,254
What but he/she wanted to ask?

296
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,357
All this seems to have been
related with I traffic of drugs.

297
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,360
He/she asks me if my son was a trafficker of
you drug or alone an addict.

298
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,321
Not he/she wanted to ask him/her he/she swims.

299
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,466
You know that the one exercises ago
you prove regular with drugs.

300
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,257
Not when they are in Iraq.

301
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,339
We find this below of the mattress
of their son.

302
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,468
Non anger in my report.

303
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,475
I ask because last month we arrest
to 3 soldiers that tried

304
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,408
of bringing heroine from Kuwait.

305
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:56,248
They sold it to the gangs
Mexicans.

306
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,482
I understand that the wise one Spanish.

307
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,483
And you believe that it can have trafficked with
it drugs alone because he/she speaks Spanish.

308
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,293
No.

309
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,330
Because somebody cuts him/her the hands and
the head.

310
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,238
I sit down that of their son a lot.

311
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,504
Demonstrate it to me.

312
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,508
Do I sit down it?

313
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,379
I need to see where he/she died.

314
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,259
Not it is our case

315
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,327
the murder happened in another district.

316
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,429
But you know where it is.

317
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,462
Not there is anything to see.

318
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,527
Then there won't be problems
if I see it.

319
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,474
It is noticed that they know how to examine a scene of the crimer

320
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:44,284
I suppose that they thought that serious a good one
he/she devises to murder it here.

321
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:54,328
Their investigators found blood
in this part

322
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,298
here it should be murdered.

323
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,311
You don't see blood but he/she knows that it is there.

324
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,309
If.

325
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,305
It seems that their body was dragged
from here

326
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,284
until there.

327
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,351
That is impressive.

328
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:13,322
The road this clean one but you
you see marks of blood.

329
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,482
If they took the nuisance
of burning their body

330
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,427
he/she doesn't believe that also
they would cover their prints.

331
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,321
I will go to the bathroom.

332
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,496
If he/she entered with their car he/she would not make so much
I damage as the one that you leave

333
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,249
It seems that he/she knows everything.

334
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:57,299
Hello.

335
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,332
Hello.

336
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,401
Can I help him?

337
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,472
I suppose that the police
he/she has come to ask him/her

338
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,473
that I pass in that field.

339
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:07,341
If, they made it that terrible what you/they found.

340
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,312
I come on behalf of the family,
does something know about what I happen there?

341
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:15,409
Deseaia to know it, we didn't know what was
neither when we smelled it, certain affection?

342
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,418
Pardon?

343
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:20,218
That Sunday in the morning when we enter to the one
parking lot

344
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,359
we think that they had made barbecue
of somebody.

345
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,262
He/she smelled like to burnt meat.

346
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,263
Thank you.

347
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,375
Tell to their team that you/they should look for a car
blue and I don't unite green.

348
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,456
Because a blue car but the yellow lights
it is green.

349
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,465
It seems that if.

350
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,321
It is it less than I can make.

351
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,414
He/she would say that that is not enough.

352
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,462
I will buy an airplane passage.

353
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,312
To that refer with which not?

354
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,405
I will take it to house he/she hardly can.

355
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,410
I need to see it, I need to be with Michael.

356
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,319
It is he/she has left.

357
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,253
I need to be with my boy.

358
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,293
Not it has been anything of the one.

359
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,425
What devils does that mean?

360
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,436
Joan for once in your life you make I marry.

361
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,374
I remember to have been him/her the one that not said

362
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,503
when your you said that
serious good for their character

363
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,472
Who do win that discución Hank?

364
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,249
Michael was the one that wanted to enter me
don't impel it to that makes it.

365
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,409
Not living in this house
he/she had felt as

366
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,511
a man if he/she had not gone.

367
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,283
All my children Hank, you could have me
left one.

368
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,272
Joan.

369
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,373
Joan, please.

370
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,392
Joan cannot listen to you crying.

371
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,300
Good then you don't make it!

372
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,391
The door.

373
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,259
Good night.

374
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,521
Good night affection.

375
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,264
Shit!

376
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,503
Move.

377
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,416
Not there is nobody.

378
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,481
He/she leaves of being playing with that telephone.

379
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,415
I don't believe it friend.

380
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,291
He/she has their clothes to the you review,

381
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,364
This is a very strange day.

382
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:05,427
Well there is not nobody, it is necessary to move.

383
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,258
Libby prepares a chicken sandwich.

384
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,290
Does he/she want mayonnaise in their sandwich?

385
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,360
Non thank you Mrs..

386
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,328
A woman undressed in front of you.

387
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,391
A man can take it as
an insult.

388
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,266
Is that their son?
- If Mrs..

389
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,206
I am asking if somebody saw it,
it could have been one week ago

390
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,304
on Saturday.

391
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,310
Non reconosco to anybody to the one
following day.

392
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,401
Stay here.

393
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,316
Lieutenant excuse.

394
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,250
I wondered because they gave me this case.

395
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,284
Which case?

396
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:09,221
Jake Miller arrested to torture hens.

397
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,489
Not it is of great importance,
all they make it.

398
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,263
All don't take out him/her the eyes imbecile!

399
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,228
Undoubtedly they make it.
- Be quiet.

400
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,368
The boss doesn't like it him to make it with their daughter.

401
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,334
Now if that soprendida am.

402
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,274
You realize as you take out him/her information
to people.

403
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,401
You fall to people well.

404
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:31,278
And for that reason they promoted you of I traffic
to detective, certain?

405
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,250
Do I sit down it?

406
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,476
You don't sit down it, if them
they had had that cojer

407
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,354
to enter here
they had also made it

408
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:41,313
Good Wine had made it.

409
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,356
One of us needs to know that we make.

410
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,488
Vera that is it that me
it worries, I don't believe to be

411
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:52,265
disqualified for
to work in this trash can.

412
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:58,470
For example the place of the murder was
it was not in property of the I exercise

413
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,378
serious something fool seeing the signs of
it fights beside the highway

414
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,512
did that trailer full with bushes see?
Of there to where it was murdered

415
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,343
that had started to think that

416
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,286
it was murdered in our
jurisdiction and moved

417
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,451
because the murderers are not so silly for
to leave the body to the light.

418
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,429
I had made that if it was
my scene of the crime.

419
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,468
No, no, he/she says good work, we don't need
another homicide

420
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,472
We solved 3 of the last ten that we had.

421
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:40,281
This had worsened the things,
does he/she have problems with their colleagues?

422
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,476
does he/she have the necessity to be demonstrated them, is that?
- Not Mister.

423
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:47,518
Is the military police then?
Does he/she believe that they wasted the invetigación?

424
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,227
Not Mister but let us don't seek the true ones
reasons because the one exercises he/she wants this case

425
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:56,229
Psychic powers, when did he/she begin to have them?

426
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,462
So you don't believe that
the results had

427
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,459
affected to the I exercise?

428
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:04,341
Do you see this as an ascent in their career?
- I don't have a career Mister.

429
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,444
I have a work, I take care of my son and I make
what you/they tell me... 

430
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,280
 ... but this boy died
in some bushes in our

431
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,505
Somebody burns it as a
wooden piece leaving

432
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,278
their remains for the animals

433
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,482
with respect, if that it was
their son that I return of Iraq,

434
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,489
I don't believe that serious happy to give this case

435
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,417
to other people so that one sees better
in the elections.

436
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,360
Was that with respect?
- That was my intention Mister.

437
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,295
Well I will think it and I will make it to him to know.

438
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:34,268
We have already lost many cases this month.
- Not he/she did say that he/she makes what you/they order him/her?

439
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,373
If, but aveces exaggerates to explain to me well.

440
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,311
How this David?
- Do I sit down it?

441
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,470
Their son.

442
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:49,477
This well thank you to ask.

443
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,288
Does he/she go him/her well in the games?

444
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,391
For luck Dave is
pathetic in all their games

445
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,384
so he likes people to see it

446
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,488
That one is it hurts, truth?

447
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,458
It sounds to that will be as their father.

448
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:14,266
In short. me alone I see a ball and as people
he/she makes things to have a good time.

449
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,473
Not he/she has idea of how many
baisball players

450
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:20,244
they are thrown away every Saturday at night.

451
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,285
He/she knows I also played in my school.

452
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,486
I remember that has shown me pictures
of that, Mister.

453
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,394
You will continue bothering me with this
of the boy, truth?

454
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,372
I believe that he/she knows that it is the correct thing that there is
that to make Mister.

455
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,340
Hillary.
- If Mister.

456
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,382
Communicate with the captain of the base.

457
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,356
Did he/she want to sit down Mrs.?

458
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:46,503
That everything is?

459
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,338
Is that all that I am of him?

460
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,406
If Mrs..

461
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,406
He/she should have died to stay it heats.
- If Mrs..

462
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,244
He/she made what you/they taught him/her.

463
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,354
Do I want to enter, can I enter?

464
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,421
Not Mrs., I sit down it.

465
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,402
My but felt condolence Mrs..

466
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,408
Don't you have a son, truth?

467
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,350
Truth?

468
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,378
Mr. Deerfield?
- Hello.

469
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:14,350
Listen that he/she wanted Mike's Bible,
I thought that it should be given it.

470
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,419
Does somebody know that you took this?

471
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,447
Ask where he/she stayed and
they told it to me.

472
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,293
Can I invite you a coffee?

473
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,222
I should really leave.

474
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:08,302
By Mike.

475
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,405
I need to wonder something.

476
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:20,472
And I want the truth.

477
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,421
Was Mike being drugged?

478
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,223
Doug, I suppose.

479
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,354
Not but that the rest of the boys.
Not it was very dedicated neither anything of that.

480
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,358
At some time he/she has seen it walking out
of the base with somebody?

481
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:39,529
Perhaps Mexicans.

482
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:41,371
Not Mister.

483
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,401
How is it adapted?

484
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:51,446
Me in the battle?
Not a lot of time have been.

485
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,247
Flames to your parents?
- To my he/she suckles

486
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,353
Pope and I were never so near.

487
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,255
Did you speak a lot?

488
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,230
We could have spoken but.

489
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,427
Some time he/she has told you something that
should he/she know?

490
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:23,309
One sees many things of those which
he/she doesn't want to speak, neither with your friends.

491
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,209
If.

492
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,437
But to the he/she went him/her well?

493
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:27,407
He/she was a soldier of first class.

494
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,284
He/she knows Mike, he loved the I exercise.

495
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,391
Not he/she could wait to leave to save
to the good ones and to kill to the bad.

496
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:45,264
they should send it to heroes to places like Iraq

497
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,395
Everything there this fact shit.

498
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:52,499
Before going I never said this but... 

499
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,410
if they ask it to me now... 

500
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,473
you see converted powdered people.

501
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,320
Hello.

502
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,482
These well?

503
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,290
If, it was to call yourself.

504
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,489
Michael's package came.

505
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,326
What package class?

506
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,365
Not him you, is a package, I send it to the one
same it is of the I exercise

507
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,343
I want to open it.
- No.

508
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,411
How that not?

509
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,350
It seems to have been opened by customs
or the military ones?

510
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,223
How can I know it?
No, it doesn't seem.

511
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,389
Why cannot I open it?

512
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,521
Alone you don't open it, please.

513
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:47,420
Alone you put it in a sure place.

514
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,332
This well.

515
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,301
Good night.
- Good night.

516
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,420
Good morning.
- Good morning.

517
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,325
He/she could ask him/her some questions on their son.

518
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,335
I thought that it was not their case.
- But now it is it.

519
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:08,272
He/she wanted to ask him/her if their son taenia some enemy,

520
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:11,437
He/she refers to the thousands
of people Irakies and

521
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,383
those that killed him
does a couple of weeks make?

522
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,277
If, that shirt leaves something even wet.

523
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:19,379
You this drying off.

524
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,492
Somebody the moletaba that you know?
- No.

525
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,354
Does he/she have connections with gangs?

526
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,422
Why? he/she thinks that
their son this involved

527
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,399
in weapons or drugs.

528
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:35,368
When do I speak with the one for last time?
- Why?

529
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,271
The bank informs myself that it had used
their trajetas

530
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,278
one day after returning I buy
soap.

531
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:46,348
I told him/her thousands of times that he/she doesn't buy soaps
commercial, they are bad.

532
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,252
And later I buy chicken.

533
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:52,488
Did he/she say to that hour?

534
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,457
Not they had but positions.

535
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:00,259
We assume that their son was murdered among the one
Saturday in the night or Sunday in the morning.

536
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,462
Not yet we find their wallet but if it was
stolen they will have but positions in their cards.

537
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:06,494
The computers detected it.

538
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,236
Did he/she already go to the place where I buy chicken?

539
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,382
Here he/she has their order.

540
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,325
We wanted to ask him/her on a soldier that
it was here one week ago.

541
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,431
This joking, truth?
we are to a block of the base.

542
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,492
Can he/she know to that hour was?

543
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,494
They are the last 4 digits.

544
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,497
1:03 am Sunday in the morning,
something but?

545
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,466
Can he/she tell us that I buy?

546
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,469
Not without the receipt.

547
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,345
Thank you.

548
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,382
Their I warp of 4 pieces they are 6.79$,
that most of people order?

549
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,474
No, the three pieces.

550
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,412
So with taxes.

551
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,254
21.79 $ would be.

552
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,454
3 foods, 3 people.

553
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:09,295
4 if it is of 3 pieces or a
very hungry soldier.

554
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:41,228
There these, I have just left something for you.

555
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,355
Seriously?

556
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,500
Some declarations of
I squadron of Mike.

557
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,427
Grandiose, he/she went you to call for
to make interviews.

558
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,495
Save you the problem.

559
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:52,365
How this way?

560
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,273
There are declarations sworn in your desk.

561
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:59,276
Not you thought that he/she would want
to interview them personally?

562
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,247
Alone he/she wanted to take the first step.

563
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,479
Thank you, I like to make
my own work.

564
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:08,287
I will tell you something, read them and if you even want

565
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,419
to interview them, with pleasure will help you.

566
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:18,393
Maybe you didn't understand me, it is not a petition,
I want the list of the men of their unit.

567
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,370
- This in their desk.
- And I want to interview them this afternoon.

568
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,372
He/she will have to ask to my commandant.

569
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,307
My boss already speaks.

570
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,366
It is a jurisdiction disaster.

571
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,345
Not there is disaster, the murder
it was in our jurisdiction.

572
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:36,216
There it is where it is disordered.
Read them, I will make the petition.

573
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,490
- Not you do have the declarations?
- If, I have them.

574
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,293
And if they cooperate I don't see the problem.

575
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,357
I am entitled to interview
to the witnesses.

576
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,370
- Nobody said that not.
- They said that they would consider it.

577
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,364
And that was 10 minutes ago.

578
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,465
I want to speak to them before
that they train them.

579
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,503
Those make repeat it so many times that
the inconsistencies disappear.

580
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:09,314
For sure you had already seen pass that.
Maybe when it served Tnte. Kirklander

581
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:16,381
I will tell you something, he/she walks up and cry him/her

582
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:20,419
to your boyfriend because I won't make anything.

583
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,435
Did you already order?

584
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,345
Of agreement, begin.

585
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:41,306
- Am I able to?
- Please.

586
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,404
Salt.

587
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,307
I can make it.

588
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,477
If you can, enroll for the bed.

589
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,296
Can I help you in something?

590
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,417
It is supposed that you read it to me to my.

591
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,325
Not I understand anything.

592
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,354
Do you know some history?

593
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,399
Not I am good counting them.

594
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,229
Then read me the book.

595
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,367
Do you know of where your name comes?

596
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,504
- Of my mother.
- Before that.

597
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,249
I name you like to the King David
Didn't your mother tell it to you?

598
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,344
It supposed it.

599
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,421
They had 2 big armies.

600
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:10,398
The Israelis and the Philistines
both were in hills

601
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,496
With the valley of Eliah in the mean, a place
in Palestine you do know where?

602
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,262
Not it cares.

603
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,441
The Philistines had a champion

604
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,502
an enormous, called giant Goliath.

605
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,339
Seriously? there is a robot called this way.

606
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,407
It is another type.

607
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:33,311
Every day for 40
days Goliath got off the

608
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:36,450
hill and it challenged somebody of the other side.

609
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:42,397
but neither if at least those but brave
the king's warriors wanted to go.

610
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,524
Why didn't they shoot him/her?

611
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,326
Not they had bullets, single arrows.
But there are combat rules,

612
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,499
they were not shot,
they were challenged with swords.

613
01:01:54,410 --> 01:02:00,349
One day a boy, not but big that your
he/she comes to the king to leave bread and he/she tells him/her:

614
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,251
- I will fight with the one.
- Don't tell me.

615
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,417
Truly, the king gives him/her so
to David an armor.

616
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:14,419
but it was very heavy so the I take off it
and when seeing around he/she finds 5 stones

617
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,367
of this size and he/she goes to the valley
with their sling in the hand.

618
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,363
Goliath comes running,
and he/she gave a horrible scream,

619
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,432
David grasp their sling with a stone

620
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:32,312
and you the ribbon breaking him/her the head
so he/she falls.

621
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:36,247
- So I shoot him/her.
- With a stone.

622
01:02:36,352 --> 01:02:37,410
Not it is the same thing.

623
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:44,391
- Do you know as it conquered it?
- How?

624
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,424
Him first that he/she had to conquer
David was his own fear.

625
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,334
I win that and I win Goliath.

626
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:57,235
When he/she decided to fight
it had already won.

627
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,379
He/she was lucky, some steps but
and Goliath had squashed it.

628
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:12,318
So he/she gave him/her with that rock,
this way fights with the monstros

629
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:18,382
you attract them to you and the aims to the eyes.
Then you hit them.

630
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,255
Your you fought with many?

631
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,460
- If.
- Did you win?

632
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,266
Of not being it would be this way flat.

633
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:49,347
It will be well.

634
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:01,294
Suckle!

635
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,312
- Not so much.
- This well.

636
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,313
This way this well.

637
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,393
You know that that history is not true.

638
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:37,395
Undoubtedly it is it, until this in Koran.

639
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,241
Did you read the declarations?

640
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:47,476
Anything that it is worthwhile,
the last time that you/they saw

641
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:51,351
to Michael it was when
it left the base that afternoon.

642
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,323
You are a good father.

643
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,460
Not you have to prove that you love him.

644
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,263
For sure the wise thing.

645
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,332
Pope?

646
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,462
I am so angry.

647
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,481
Hello.

648
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,358
Evie, of the bar.

649
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,227
Sra?

650
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:47,394
If.

651
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,330
I sit down it.
Hello.

652
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:56,505
I saw their son's picture in the newspaper
when I enter I thought that he/she was joking.

653
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,213
- I regret it.
- Thank you.

654
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,318
Am I able to?

655
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,291
Pretty eyes.

656
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,464
To the I remember it.

657
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:33,248
I work in another bar the weekends.
He was there, it should be Saturday.

658
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,248
How is the bar called?

659
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,227
If they were here, both.
With their friends.

660
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:49,424
- On Saturday?
- We had to take out them.

661
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,491
That was jodiendo to a dancer.

662
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,301
- This?
- The other one.

663
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:59,465
There are many idiots here but the one wanted the prize.
He/she played the dancers.

664
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,442
I believe that he/she makes a mistake.

665
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,446
It asks me him to identify it and then
he/she tells me that I am mistaken.

666
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:08,341
- Is their relative?
- To that hour they left?

667
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:13,287
Not him you, was not happy
two fought out.

668
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,322
I thought that he/she would have to separate them.

669
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,417
Thank you.

670
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,375
Dve Nagel stayed
for their declaration.

671
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:36,378
Pardon for the nuisances,
A word?

672
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:48,389
This is not a police series
your you cannot interrogate.

673
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,324
Somebody should make it.

674
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:53,326
It should be frustrating to be
so good investigator

675
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:55,330
and to be surrounded of so many fools.

676
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,493
What is that he/she makes in Monroe?

677
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,364
I cultivate my garden.

678
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:04,330
It is a pain, think of all the
crimes that it could be solving.

679
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:09,241
If this goes in opinion the defense
he/she will say that your you poisoned the well.

680
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:11,269
- Non anger in opinion.
- What?

681
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,281
- Not it was the one.
- Do I sit down it?

682
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:17,241
Not you because they lie saying that
they were not with the when it was not this way.

683
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,513
They were fighting in the estacionanmiento.

684
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:23,419
Alone they were discharged, he/she would not understand it.
Not I will fight with somebody to my side

685
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:25,393
and then they would make him/her that.

686
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,388
In that world you will live?

687
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,501
Discover because they lie.

688
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,330
There will be a reason.

689
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,316
So you were there.

690
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,422
If.

691
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,517
Why did you lie?

692
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:58,519
It is complicated.

693
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,353
For that don't tell me what I happen.

694
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:12,463
We were in the club
passing it well, drinking.

695
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,309
Then Mike became strange.

696
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,374
You angers and I throw him/her change to the dancer.
And then it began to insult her and her also.

697
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:30,418
When we got into the car, Bonner was
angry saying that Mike should walk.

698
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:33,361
So Mike grabs it
and they began to fight.

699
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,464
It is the thing type that it always happens.

700
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:41,526
Garbage of warring male.
Nobody came out wounded so we get into the car

701
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,334
and we manage a while until seeing
Chicken Shack to the front of the base.

702
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:49,444
Mike payment for that you/they threw away us.

703
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,413
To that hour that was?

704
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,273
Not him you.
As at one o'clock.

705
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,451
And then we return here.

706
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,254
All?

707
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:06,484
No, alone the 3.

708
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,233
Why did they leave it?

709
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,233
We were drunk.

710
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,464
We had had enough but
Mike wanted to buy amphetamines.

711
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,371
Did he/she want drugs?

712
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,467
If, he/she needed to put on but.

713
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,436
Pardon for the language.

714
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:29,377
Does that believe that I pass him/her?
I look for drugs and he/she met with bad people.

715
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,277
Not him you, always had secrets.

716
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:35,319
It left always alone.

717
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,449
It was not taken very well with people.

718
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:45,424
So they threw away them from the club to 11 o'clock.
They went for chicken at 1 o'clock.

719
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,368
What did those two hours make?

720
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,498
We manage looking for
a party or women.

721
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,399
Did they stop in some part?

722
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,301
If, Sra.

723
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,476
Do you want him to guess?

724
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:08,485
We find a harlot in the highway.
I suck them to us at the 4.

725
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,520
Why non diiste that
when being questioned?

726
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:15,224
For that didn't want
that they know their potatoes.

727
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,289
Not you wanted that their potato
do know that they sucked it to you?

728
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:21,269
And that I buy drugs,
he/she didn't want them to tell to mine.

729
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,303
Why did they fight?

730
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,409
Mike was aggressive, not you because.

731
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:31,277
And then he/she told him/her those things
ugly to the dancer.

732
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,248
How what?

733
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:37,351
Sew that I won't repeat.
He/she was a dancer, he/she should not make it.

734
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:41,289
Penning said that they occurred hard
in the parking lot.

735
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,415
Not it was so much.

736
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:45,325
What was different your knife was?

737
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,352
Not I need a knife
to kill somebody.

738
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:52,299
I suppose that in Iraq it is different,
if somebody bothers you you can fight it.

739
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,461
- I lost it.
- It is a different world.

740
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,202
You have to be able to.

741
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,499
Obviously there is not
state in the I exercise.

742
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:01,532
No, but you that you/they have weapons and authority
they put to men face down in the mud

743
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:05,475
with their feet in the back,
if somebody comes against you they kill him.

744
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:09,450
They have that, they could have bombs.
He/she doesn't know it, first kill him.

745
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,419
- We decide... 
- He/she reacts or he/she dies.

746
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,353
Is that not what you/they say?
at some time I do stab somebody?

747
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,220
If it was this way not serious his matter.

748
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:19,421
These one day here other there,
if it was I would look for my weapon.

749
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:21,524
The interview you ends up.

750
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,461
I am glad him not to bother you
because when he/she saw to my potato

751
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,231
of return of the war, him
that he/she made it could not confront it

752
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,430
that destroys it.

753
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:33,498
Was your potato in Panama?
Not he/she has idea of that we made for you

754
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,237
For my?

755
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:38,337
Me of you alone he/she would thank the.
Kiss me the bottom.

756
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:39,439
Behind.

757
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,285
These happy one?
do you want a prize?

758
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,445
I want to close the case.

759
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,290
And I want exams of their bodies,
moretones and blows.

760
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:53,351
You can have what you want
but first look at this.

761
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,200
Do you even want them?

762
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:04,494
If.

763
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:41,342
But it is worth that you wait for yourself.

764
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,377
Mike, I surrender.

765
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,293
- Leave alone it.
- Jodete

766
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:47,240
Taenias reason, they could not have him fact.

767
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:50,344
They Were with Mike in the One
Chicken Shack that night.

768
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:55,381
Bonner, Penning and Long returned
to the base 20 minutes later.

769
01:15:57,252 --> 01:16:00,449
The field where we find
to Mike it was at half hour.

770
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:04,418
Non puedieron to have arrived on time.
Not they could.

771
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:10,226
So they left it there.

772
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,366
- They said that Mike wanted to buy drugs.
- For that reason they left.

773
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:25,542
Not they have idea where left.

774
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:30,375
No, and I have declarations of all
the men of the squadron.

775
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,511
Can I see them?

776
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:40,225
If they tell the truth, nobody
he/she saw it after the dinner.

777
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:44,431
Not there is blood in the clothes or belongings.

778
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:49,302
Did you dress the clothes?
He/she looks at the shirt.

779
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,229
He/she even has marks.

780
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,300
The clothes is but cheap in base,
him first that you make when returning

781
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:58,279
it is to wash all that you have above.

782
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,306
there are nine soldiers in a
infantry squadron.

783
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,381
If.

784
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:07,354
They lost a man in Iraq, it would should
to have 7 declarations and there are 6.

785
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:09,422
One was off.

786
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,485
When the sergeant arrives he told me that
all their men had returned.

787
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,460
He/she writes the names.

788
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:24,395
Hello this he/she is Fred Ganley,
of the officer's office.

789
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,437
Do they lack a man?
because I have a Robert Hortiz

790
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:32,241
drunk and uncontrolled,
he/she says that it is one of his.

791
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,441
Thank you, I will send to somebody for the one

792
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,382
I thank him/her for it.

793
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,382
This missing one.

794
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,410
It revises if there is you order.

795
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,482
You go if he/she has car.

796
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,322
Bad boy.

797
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:56,495
He/she is a local boy, their first arrest
he/she went at the 14 for I traffic of drugs

798
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:02,299
the witnesses disappeared, he/she makes a
year and half we find it with drugs.

799
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:04,502
and suddenly he/she put on
patriotic and you lists.

800
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,373
How did they allow it to enter?

801
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:11,248
Not he/she has condemnations, he/she has had
several problems from then on.

802
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:14,346
He/she has a Chevrolet Malibu the 99
registered to their name.

803
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:15,356
What color?

804
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:18,254
Blue.

805
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:19,522
Not it is enough.

806
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,228
Not we can go against the one.

807
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,290
He/she has 4 tickets without paying.

808
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,400
Something is something.

809
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,505
Some idea of where it can be?

810
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,341
To find Bob is never problem.

811
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:38,504
He/she returns to your motel, I will call you.

812
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,253
Open up, it is the police!

813
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:32,493
This in the roof!

814
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,431
I have it!

815
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:44,368
He/she takes the street, not the alley.
The street, curse.

816
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,294
Now all have knives.

817
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,398
Do you like to cut people?

818
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:20,433
High.

819
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:22,502
What do you make?!

820
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:24,507
Don't move.

821
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:29,511
- God.
- These well?

822
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,266
Take it to you.

823
01:21:56,478 --> 01:22:00,312
What does it happen? Already nobody wants
to load drugs for you?

824
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:03,349
Speak, imbecile!

825
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,345
Not serious comic that the one
did devil resemble you?

826
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:11,291
Ladybug returns, I will teach you
as you leave the devil.

827
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:12,418
Jodete!

828
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,456
- I see that you took out him/her everything.
- Be quiet.

829
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:21,463
Not it presented positions, you have much
luck, I am tempted to make it.

830
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:23,464
Not I wanted to hit you.

831
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:26,274
Is that an excuse?

832
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,435
- I sit down it.
- Stay it.

833
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:31,438
- Didn't they interrogate him?
- I made it.

834
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,341
We revise their house, there is not
it evidences that it incriminates it.

835
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,411
It has passed something.

836
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,256
They were hung it
in their room.

837
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,459
- Do I leave a note?
- No.

838
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:29,327
My father gave it to me
when I went to Vietnam.

839
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:31,422
I gave it to Mike.

840
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:36,328
It was in the pocket of Bonner.

841
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,237
The the taenia?

842
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:43,400
Non accent a note, single accent
the clock in their pocket.

843
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:48,280
I sit down it, but this is it but close
that we will arrive of a confession.

844
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,349
Confession.

845
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:02,490
What color is the car of Bonner?

846
01:25:04,365 --> 01:25:06,390
Blue why?

847
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:20,370
Non undergrowths to somebody without reason,
that clock doesn't prove anything.

848
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,483
Do you believe that your son gave it to him?

849
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:25,384
- Puedieron to have planted it.
- And for that one commits suicide?

850
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:28,514
Not him you, your you say I eat up I kill Michael.
He/she has an alibi, it was in the base.

851
01:25:29,257 --> 01:25:31,350
- When do I kill him?
- Not him you.

852
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,301
What?

853
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,402
Hello.

854
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:49,471
You remember to that woman
of the dead dog?

855
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,237
The drenamos.

856
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:15,362
Where this the boy?

857
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:20,267
Not it was at home, thanks to God,
it was in their grandparents' house.

858
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,266
That is good.

859
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:41,404
The remains will be sent
this afternoon if it confirms the address.

860
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:42,511
It is correct.

861
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,478
If we can help him,
make it to us to know.

862
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:53,252
Sr?

863
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:58,452
Do you have cables for battery?

864
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:09,428
Thank you.

865
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:18,369
He/she meant how much
lament what I pass Mike.

866
01:30:19,347 --> 01:30:23,443
I wanted to apologize to lie and
to say that he/she had not seen it that night.

867
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:28,479
I thought that of being Mike, he/she didn't want
that my parents know it.

868
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:34,461
- Do you have a cigarette?
- If.

869
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:56,212
Do you believe that Bonner kills him?

870
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,449
Not him you.

871
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:07,289
Not I understand anything of this.

872
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:11,356
What did it miss my son?

873
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:16,234
Anything, I sit down it.

874
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,272
Did Mike speak to him/her much of the I exercise?

875
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:28,405
He/she wanted him to make strange things.

876
01:31:28,516 --> 01:31:30,450
Treatment of putting on pantimedias?

877
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,248
Did he tell it to him?

878
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:36,518
- It shelters better than any thing.
- So he/she told the truth.

879
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:40,486
Alone that don't kill you in them
you never left of being condemned."

880
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:12,220
Is jodido truth?

881
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,386
If.

882
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:45,322
We can help you.

883
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:52,262
Calm, we will assist you.

884
01:32:56,337 --> 01:32:58,305
Do you feel well?

885
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:01,270
Where does it hurt you?

886
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:05,472
Here?

887
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,448
Will we take care well of you this?

888
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,388
Good night.

889
01:34:47,415 --> 01:34:50,407
Tell me that this it is your son's signature.

890
01:34:52,286 --> 01:34:54,254
It is not it.

891
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:57,252
We always assume
that Mike was there.

892
01:34:57,391 --> 01:35:03,261
It is the signature of Penning, three foods:
Penning, Bonner and Long.

893
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:41,460
Penning and Long, I want them now.

894
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,497
- Not I can.
- If, if you can.

895
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:46,363
And you will make it.

896
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:49,441
Penning admitted.

897
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:52,345
I Imply Long and Bonner.

898
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:58,342
Dog son, you made
a damned treatment.

899
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,481
- He/she will make serious time.
- How so serious?

900
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:06,290
Do tell it to me, how long?

901
01:36:06,494 --> 01:36:09,429
The time that can get.

902
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:15,394
For luck that doesn't mean anything.
Do you see these? they are you order.

903
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:19,233
We have jurisdicdion of arresting
to those men.

904
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:21,238
I want them now.

905
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:25,310
Not I am the only one that made a treatment.

906
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,415
My commandant speaks with yours.

907
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:34,448
It is a pain less than head for them.
Already this outside of our hands.

908
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:36,411
I sit down it.

909
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:40,451
For sure if.

910
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:45,499
I want to listen the confession.

911
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:48,392
Long doesn't speak,
I will give you that of Penning.

912
01:36:48,402 --> 01:36:51,496
I want to hear it of their lips
and I want that the this present one.

913
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,236
That didn't happen.

914
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:02,475
How many soldiers you believe that they leave
of here every night to go to a bar?

915
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:04,408
You that the ones... 

916
01:37:04,518 --> 01:37:09,455
Jodida am well! He/she guesses, in a
weekend. 7 or 8 thousand doldados?

917
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:13,425
You know that I will make, I will wait in my
car away from anyone

918
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,328
of your entrances and I will stop each
vehicle that he/she returns here

919
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:21,266
and I will arrest each soldier that
have but of the one it limits allowed.

920
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:24,328
How many do you believe that they would be?

921
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:26,306
How long it happened
before they say goodbye to you?

922
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:30,242
I will make it in my own time, I have
as 5 weeks of vacations.

923
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:34,314
How many arrests you believe that
can he/she make in one month?

924
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:37,477
Do we discover it?

925
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:00,500
To Speak with Cap. Hemi please.

926
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:09,347
We were leaving the club and we think
that Mike and Bonner had calmed down.

927
01:38:09,483 --> 01:38:13,249
They were sometimes this way, they laughed
a moment and they fought to the other one.

928
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:17,414
We were in the car and Mike
it was angry, and Bonner began

929
01:38:17,424 --> 01:38:21,258
to lean and to speak stupidities.

930
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,487
How what?

931
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:28,492
Not him you, the good driver
that he/she is Mike, not yet he/she makes sense.

932
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:33,395
But Bonner you full and you unemployment.
And they began to fight.

933
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:41,345
Long wanted to stop them to go home.
Then Mike began to insult him to the one.

934
01:38:42,316 --> 01:38:45,251
And then look to under and he/she stabs him.

935
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:49,413
- Your you made it?
- If.

936
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,258
Didn't your friends stop you?

937
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:58,322
I believe that they were drugged.

938
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:04,494
They screamed and then Mike key, dead.

939
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:09,240
And Long screamed:
"Now that we make?"

940
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:14,347
It was idea of Bonner to cut it.

941
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:19,375
He/she used to work for a butcher,
wise as using the knife.

942
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:22,289
He/she made it but easy.

943
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:28,450
We had buried the parts but
you toward late and we had not eaten.

944
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:33,528
Did they have hunger?

945
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:35,359
Much.

946
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,472
We stopped in Chicken Shack.

947
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:45,472
Mike pleased me, to all.

948
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:50,313
And I believe that of having been
another night had been to the revez.

949
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:56,512
I believe that the era lists.

950
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:00,520
He could see.

951
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:07,390
I sit down it a lot of Sr.

952
01:40:09,436 --> 01:40:11,370
Lament their lost one.

953
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:26,412
I saw a video recently,
when they were off.

954
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:33,283
It seemed that it was
torturing a prisoner.

955
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,460
We arrest an enemy.
It was wounded.

956
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:50,506
We were with the good time
and Mike sought that it was the I prescribe.

957
01:40:51,478 --> 01:40:58,316
He/she took their hand with the wound and
he/she asked him/her if it hurted him/her.

958
01:40:59,486 --> 01:41:02,319
And the type screamed: If, if!

959
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:09,261
And then it grabbed it in the same place
and he/she asked him/her the same thing.

960
01:41:15,269 --> 01:41:16,327
It was amusing.

961
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:23,340
He/she transformed into something common in Mike,

962
01:41:23,377 --> 01:41:26,403
for that reason they put him/her The dog"

963
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:31,442
It was alone a divetirse way.

964
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:35,244
We all make stupid things.

965
01:42:18,465 --> 01:42:20,365
Excuse., Sr.

966
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:41,353
Insurance bothered its partner.

967
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,299
Do you have one minute?

968
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:58,361
I have to apologize with you.

969
01:42:58,505 --> 01:43:01,303
You have very serious problems, friend.

970
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:02,330
If.

971
01:43:04,444 --> 01:43:05,468
It is true.

972
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:22,319
I have a honorable drop,
believe it or not.

973
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:25,231
It is the I exercise, he/she would believe any thing.

974
01:43:27,401 --> 01:43:29,335
It hated it there.

975
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:33,234
To sleep in carps,
without bathroom neither he/she takes a shower.

976
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:36,299
Neither hygienic paper,
you have to use the hand.

977
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:39,245
Not he/she saw the hour of leaving.

978
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:44,348
After two weeks here.

979
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:48,277
The only thing that wanted was to return.

980
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:52,458
What jodido is that?

981
01:44:02,336 --> 01:44:04,395
Do you know what that is?

982
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:13,211
- Mike the volume and me the control.
- Why did that make?

983
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,479
Not you that you/they have told you.

984
01:44:25,459 --> 01:44:29,225
But there is you order effective,
When these in a convoy

985
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:32,491
if something or somebody blocks
to your vehicle, he/she doesn't stop.

986
01:44:32,532 --> 01:44:36,366
If you stop, bombs explode
and you finish dead.

987
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:55,483
The first weekend in Iraq,
we were managing slowly.

988
01:44:56,390 --> 01:45:00,326
Six of us behind,
one could not see he/she swims there.

989
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:09,368
We gave to something.
We listen a noise of below.

990
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:18,277
He/she stopped, it left and continuous.

991
01:45:21,248 --> 01:45:22,442
Not he/she said anything.

992
01:45:25,385 --> 01:45:29,378
Then a type said that
we gave to a boy.

993
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,450
I don't believe it, if you ask me.

994
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:38,331
We gave to a dog.

995
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,265
We kill a dog.

996
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,366
Not you that it is that.

997
01:45:51,244 --> 01:45:52,506
Not I have idea.

998
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:21,339
Hello Bonner, there this your family.

999
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:23,367
He/she leaves of joder.

1000
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:26,377
- Leave you of things.
- You are a damned idiot

1001
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:30,312
- Carajo.
- Shit.

1002
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:32,376
- Don't stop!
- What do I make?

1003
01:46:32,419 --> 01:46:33,511
Hurry!

1004
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:44,396
What do you make?

1005
01:46:44,431 --> 01:46:45,398
Pope.

1006
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:48,234
Mike returns to the vehicle.

1007
01:46:48,502 --> 01:46:52,233
- Mike, carajo returns!
- Pope?

1008
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:05,374
- Let us go now Mike!
- These there potato?

1009
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:08,480
I am here.

1010
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,483
You have to take out me of here.

1011
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:17,286
They are alone the nerves.

1012
01:47:19,499 --> 01:47:21,433
Something spends today.

1013
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:32,502
For heaven's sake.

1014
01:47:36,349 --> 01:47:38,249
Is somebody there with you?

1015
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,385
No, I am alone.

1016
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:49,228
That is good.

1017
01:47:49,396 --> 01:47:51,523
This well, I have to leave potato.

1018
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:58,268
Take care son,
stay safe.

1019
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:02,272
If, your also.

1020
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:34,466
My son me this returning
madwoman since you were.

1021
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:37,436
He/she wants a sling.

1022
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:45,474
I suppose that it could be worse.
He/she could request a rifle of air.

1023
01:49:12,546 --> 01:49:14,480
Thank you.

1024
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:12,226
So every day Goliath went
to the valley to challenge anyone.

1025
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:18,361
But nobody wanted, until
that David you presents

1026
01:51:18,371 --> 01:51:21,499
and he/she said: " I will make it, I am a fighter.

1027
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:26,334
So the king gave him/her his armor
but it was weighed... 

1028
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:32,315
Why did he/she want to fight with a giant?
The single era a boy.

1029
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,448
Not him you, heart.

1030
01:51:39,426 --> 01:51:41,394
Do you believe that taenia fear?

1031
01:51:43,396 --> 01:51:44,454
Maybe.

1032
01:51:49,502 --> 01:51:51,231
If.

1033
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:54,407
I believe that the one would be very afraid.

1034
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:47,484
- Alone this way?
- Alone this way.

1035
01:52:48,528 --> 01:52:50,291
It is very old.

1036
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:53,432
It has been well used.

1037
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:06,206
Didn't it take out it at night?

1038
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:07,346
No.

1039
01:53:09,382 --> 01:53:11,247
Leave it as well as this.

1040
01:53:13,286 --> 01:53:14,446
It is a lot but easy.
