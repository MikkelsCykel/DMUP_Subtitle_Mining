1
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,029
- Up yours!
- Get out of the way!

2
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,527
Fine time piece, brother?

3
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,530
Goodbye.

4
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,667
"Who's the black private dick
that's a sex machine to all the chicks?

5
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,460
"Shaft

6
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,337
"Damn right

7
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:44,850
"Who is the man that would risk his neck
for his brother man?

8
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,518
"Shaft

9
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,604
"Can you dig it?

10
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:00,449
"Who's the cat that won't cop out
when there's danger all about?

11
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,534
"Shaft

12
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,077
"Right on

13
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,497
"They say this cat is a bad mother

14
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,665
"Shut your mouth

15
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,125
"I'm talking about Shaft

16
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,877
"Then we can dig it

17
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,046
"He's a complicated man

18
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,130
"No one understands him

19
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,883
"But his woman

20
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,384
"John Shaft"

21
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,345
What's happening, Marty?

22
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,889
Same old sixes and sevens, Shaft.

23
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:28,101
Two guys were looking for you
like 10 minutes ago.

24
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,561
Harlem cats?

25
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:34,441
How the hell should I know?
Everybody looks the same to me.

26
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,861
Take it easy, Marty.

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,696
Take care, Shaft.

28
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,531
Thanks, brother.

29
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,122
Too much sugar this morning.

30
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,457
Then don't drink it, baby.

31
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,421
A couple of dudes from uptown
looking for you.

32
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,965
Know them?

33
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,259
Not by name.

34
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,305
Seen them around uptown.
Come in here when I was opening up.

35
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,099
Asked where they could find you.

36
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,226
What did they look like?

37
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,563
One was wearing a funky plaid coat.
Other one was sharp.

38
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,276
$50 shoes. Black coat, gray flares.

39
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,739
- Is that all?
- They had heat on them.

40
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,159
The one in the plaid coat
had his hands in his pocket.

41
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,369
Pulled his coat tight, you dig?

42
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,040
Had some heavy iron in his belt.

43
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,168
You got a scuff on the toe of this left shoe.

44
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,593
What time you got, Tom?

45
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,178
8:16.

46
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:34,603
Pull over in front of that shoe-shine parlor.
He usually hangs out there.

47
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,812
Okay.

48
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,654
- You want me to go in?
- No. We'll wait.

49
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:52,454
Got yourself a nice shine. You can go out
and make something of yourself, man.

50
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,585
Go out and get rich and fat like you?
We're straight, baby.

51
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,092
Got a minute, Shaft?

52
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:09,221
Got no use for no dirty postcards, Vic.
Get off my back.

53
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,306
I just want to talk to you.

54
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,767
Call me up. You know my number.

55
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,982
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Go sit in the park a minute?

56
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,235
Hell, no. Just tell me
what you got to say right here!

57
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,656
Tom, go get us two cigars.
What kind do you smoke?

58
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,950
Just say what you've got to say.

59
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,246
Get us a couple of El Garcia's.

60
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,877
Look, I'm late.

61
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,005
What are you trying to lay on me?

62
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,799
Just love, Shaft.
Nothing but love and sympathy.

63
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,052
Then we're even. Go on, get on with it.

64
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,222
I thought you might know something
I want to know.

65
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,601
Seems there's been a lot of low,
quiet rumbles going on uptown.

66
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,563
Our people have been able to pick up
the sounds of it, but not words.

67
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,858
That's 'cause us black folk
talk mush mouth, Lieutenant.

68
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,278
I thought we'd get to it.

69
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,157
We did. But, you want me to pigeon.
I just said, "Up yours, baby."

70
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,829
How come two cats from Harlem
came downtown this morning...

71
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,706
...looking for John Shaft?

72
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:23,045
They're soul brothers. They came down
so I could teach them the handshake.

73
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,089
They find you?

74
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,008
Of course, I wasn't hiding.

75
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,930
If you find out anything, give me a call.
I'm still at the 38th Precinct.

76
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,182
Right on.

77
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,477
Where the hell are you going?

78
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,314
To get laid. Where the hell are you going?

79
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,113
That boy's got a lot of mouth on him.

80
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,037
The boy's man enough to back it up, too.

81
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,040
What did he tell you?

82
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,542
Nothing.

83
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,794
Got to lean on that kind.

84
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,672
You don't lean on that kind.

85
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,094
Give me a package of gum.

86
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,052
Make a noise, I'll cut you. Back up.

87
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,805
- Something wrong, Mr. Shaft?
- Sick friend here.

88
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,849
Jim, can you get us a car up?

89
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,355
I'll take that.

90
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,567
Now, be cool, man.

91
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,747
Where is your partner?

92
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,382
Open the door.

93
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:22,140
You've got about a half a minute
to tell me what the hell you want with me.

94
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:26,186
The police will ask why you threw
that son of a bitch out the window.

95
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:30,732
They can find you dead or alive.
Now, what's your goddamn story?

96
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,818
Bumpy...

97
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,446
Bumpy says to bring you uptown.

98
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,949
Did he tell you to mess me up?

99
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,120
I was to bring you.

100
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,585
It doesn't make sense.

101
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,671
You arrive at your office.
You have a sick friend with you.

102
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:56,049
Suddenly, another man you don't know
rushes up and a fight starts.

103
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,261
Your sick friend goes out the window.
Why, Mr. Shaft?

104
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,223
Ask the man who started the fight,
Mr. Leibowitz.

105
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,101
Your friend, the only name
you know him by is "Tex"?

106
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,145
- No last name?
- That's right.

107
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,605
I don't buy that, Shaft.

108
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:13,609
I think you know more than that.
Why the fight started, for instance.

109
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,778
What you think and what you can prove
are two different bags.

110
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,160
All your friends walk around
with weapons like that?

111
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,704
That depends.

112
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,874
My Negro friends don't walk around
with rabbits' feet no more.

113
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:32,169
Don't get wise with me.
There's a simple way for me to go.

114
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,089
- I'll put your goddamn ass in!
- I'll sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.

115
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,259
You want me to believe the man fell out
the way you said he did?

116
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:43,430
- What do I look like? Some kind of klutz?
- Don't ask, and I won't tell you.

117
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,849
You're licensed by the city and the state.

118
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,686
No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass
where a felony case is involved.

119
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,939
Are you suggesting I'd lose my license?

120
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:55,192
You are damn right I am!
You better believe it and level with me!

121
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,238
Threatening my livelihood is a violation
of my rights, isn't it?

122
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,993
Byron...

123
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,041
Let me have a talk with him in private.

124
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,920
You got an assailant to interview.

125
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,381
Start that and I'll join after we talk.

126
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:21,176
I think you are b.s. -ing me, too.
This thing stinks.

127
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,864
Maybe he didn't like the handshake
you taught him.

128
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,702
You know you can get your rump
in a sling for this mess?

129
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,705
- Static, a lot of hassle.
- You'll save me, Vic.

130
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,124
Well, I can try.

131
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,208
lf?

132
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,128
One hand washes the other.

133
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,924
All the hassle in the world wouldn't
make me sing a song to the police.

134
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:02,885
No way, baby.

135
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,806
That cat you threw out the window
was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas.

136
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:11,268
I didn't throw no cat
out no window, Lieutenant.

137
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,187
Bumpy isn't gonna like it.

138
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,982
I don't care what he likes!
What the hell are you pumping me for?

139
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,318
Two weeks ago
we started picking up rumbles.

140
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,906
- You already said that.
- We know it's not the Panthers.

141
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,951
Or the Young Lords.
But, something's on the boil.

142
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,871
I want to know what it is...

143
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,249
...before we need an adding machine
to count the bodies.

144
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,418
Bumpy wants you for something.

145
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,838
He knows what's going on.
And that's what I want to know.

146
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,965
Not who, just what.

147
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:47,346
It warms my black heart to see you
so concerned about us minority folks.

148
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,975
Come on, Shaft.
What is it with this black shit?

149
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:56,688
You ain't so black.

150
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,734
And you ain't so white, baby.

151
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,738
All right.

152
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,659
You want to play
your super heavy black number.

153
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm gonna play mine.

154
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,668
We can nail your tail for manslaughter
with what we've got on you right now!

155
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,381
You can waltz Leibowitz, but you
know the law. You could be charged.

156
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,633
Charged, Lieutenant.

157
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,135
Yeah, but your license'll be suspended.

158
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,013
You'll be out of business for six months.

159
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,350
You want to be out of business
for six months?

160
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,769
Out on the street.

161
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,272
No gun permit. Six months!

162
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,901
With Bumpy looking for you
when all hell's about to break loose?

163
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,361
You want it, you got it.

164
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,948
You scare me to death, Lieutenant.

165
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,952
You're buying trouble not only for yourself,
but a blood bath up in Harlem.

166
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:52,995
You want that?

167
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:58,709
All I'm asking you is to let me know
what's going on!

168
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,253
No names, no places, just what!

169
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,466
I'm not asking you to sell out.

170
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,263
Tell me the name of the game,
so I know the rules.

171
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,822
I'll think about it.

172
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,076
All right, I'll settle for that now.

173
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,623
That buys you 48 hours on the street,
and then we're gonna talk again.

174
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,460
You got the number
of Bumpy's private phone?

175
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:44,963
All right.

176
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,091
Take off. I'll see to Leibowitz.

177
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,595
Right on.

178
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,806
I'll see you.

179
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,567
Look at that.

180
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,525
- Wrong number.
- Don't bull me, I got the right number.

181
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,818
This is Shaft.

182
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,778
How did you get this number?

183
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,531
Off a bathroom wall
in the goddamn subway.

184
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,616
I'm looking for you.

185
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,535
I've got an office.

186
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,174
Here you are.

187
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:11,592
Thanks.

188
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,469
Bag of chestnuts, please.
Cold as hell today, huh?

189
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,431
Yeah, yeah. Good chestnuts.

190
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,601
How much?

191
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:21,852
Two bits.

192
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,896
- Here you go. Take it easy.
- Thanks.

193
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,147
Hey, taxi!

194
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,237
What the hell is this?

195
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,573
You white mother!

196
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,368
Taxi! Taxi!

197
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,208
Cat say he gonna be here,
he should be here.

198
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,501
Open it up.

199
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,240
Cat say he gonna be here...

200
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,368
...and he ain't.

201
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,706
It ain't right, Boss.

202
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,667
We'll wait.

203
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,755
You take crap off of him...

204
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,091
...he'll give you more crap.

205
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,635
We'll wait.

206
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,430
That's some cold shit...

207
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,517
...throwing my man, Leroy,
out the window.

208
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:30,564
Just picked my man up, and threw him
out the goddamned window.

209
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,777
Got us standing around and waiting
to say thank you.

210
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,785
Glad you let yourself in, Bumpy.

211
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,373
Give me a bad name,
have you hanging around in the hall.

212
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,545
If the man ever comes down here...

213
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,964
...again to see you...

214
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,842
...you make sure you be here.

215
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,011
Waiting.

216
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,472
You're in my chair.

217
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,158
Wait outside.

218
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,670
Sims and Leroy tried to muscle you, Shaft?

219
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:40,843
Well, I got no grudge about Leroy.

220
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,719
I couldn't give a damn.

221
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,304
I got a job for you.

222
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,224
I'm not on the hustle, Bumpy.

223
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,600
A detective job.

224
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,063
- What kind?
- Your kind. You take it.

225
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,150
Don't jive me. What are you talking about?

226
00:21:57,234 --> 00:21:59,611
Somebody kidnapped my daughter, Marcy.

227
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,655
Done in a couple of people.

228
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,117
Didn't leave no ransom note or nothing.
Nobody saw nothing.

229
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,704
I want you to find her.
That's the fucking job.

230
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:13,041
The police do that for free.

231
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,170
Not for me. You know I can't go
to the cops.

232
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:18,714
And you want me?

233
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,924
The spade detective.

234
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,261
Yeah, I want you 'cause
you're a black spade detective.

235
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:29,016
I want you 'cause you got your other foot
in whitey's trough! She can be anywhere.

236
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,520
Got any idea who grabbed her?

237
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,774
A lot of cats hate my guts.

238
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:42,070
A sweet, loving dude like you?

239
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,240
Sweet talking a man's lady...

240
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,952
...as you beat her man out of his paycheck
in the back room of a horse parlor?

241
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,246
Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm?

242
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,667
Who could hate you, Bumpy?

243
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,464
My baby never sold nothing to nobody.
Never took nothing from nobody.

244
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,384
She's a straight kid.
She's going to college.

245
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:09,765
Whoever grabbed her, got her to get at me.

246
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,478
They have a beef with me,
they should come to me.

247
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,565
So you got a rule
that somebody else don't.

248
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,948
Is that all you know?

249
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:30,160
There's a piece of Harlem I can't get at.
The one them militants got their arm on.

250
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:34,498
They could have my baby.
She's been into some of that stuff.

251
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,085
Bunch calls themselves the "La Mumba's."

252
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,337
Ben Buford's thing.

253
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,507
I could send my people to ask them.

254
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:45,717
Shit.

255
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:50,973
It'd come to a shootout and when
it's all over, a bunch of dead cats.

256
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,309
And maybe they'd kill Marcy.

257
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,523
Yeah, you're Papa pimp to them.

258
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:04,319
They want to see you burn
as bad as they want to see the police burn.

259
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,281
But kidnapping sisters,
that ain't their thing.

260
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,325
The only reason anybody grabs
anybody for is money.

261
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,663
What other bunch in Harlem needs money
bad enough to grab my baby?

262
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:18,709
If you believe that, what's all this
about me having a foot in whitey's trough?

263
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,962
I said I think they had her.
I didn't say they had her in Harlem.

264
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,756
They ain't dumb enough
to take her someplace uptown.

265
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:27,968
It don't lay right.

266
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,138
What the hell you think I need you for
if I knew who had her?

267
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:34,850
I'm guessing.

268
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,395
If they don't have her, all right.

269
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,480
Maybe they know something.

270
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,983
I got nothing.

271
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:45,444
That's the job, Shaft.

272
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,406
Will you take it, or no?

273
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,621
I get $50 an hour.

274
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,123
Plus expenses.

275
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,461
And no questions asked
about how I spend it.

276
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,047
You got it.

277
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,799
I get a free hand to move any way I want.

278
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,972
You find my baby.

279
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,602
That's all I want.

280
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,023
I got money.

281
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,568
You spend it.

282
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,197
And you find her.

283
00:25:43,544 --> 00:25:45,254
That'll get you started.

284
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,983
When will I hear from you?

285
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:12,072
When I got something to say.

286
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,118
One more thing:

287
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:23,834
You send another cat after me with a gun,
I'll kill him and I'll come looking for you!

288
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,837
And I'll get you, Bumpy.

289
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,338
You believe it.

290
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,446
Fake mother.

291
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,625
"Black man born free"

292
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,543
You seen Ben Buford around?

293
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,171
"The way it's supposed to be

294
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,883

00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,887

00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,390

00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,479
"It's got plenty of names
'Slums"'

298
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,316
Ben Buford used to live here.
He live here anymore?

299
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,235
No, why?

300
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,612
I'm looking for him.

301
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,281
I am, too. He owes me six months' rent.

302
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,368
Take it easy.

303
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:45,541
"Any kind of job is hard to find

304

"Little boy who needs a pair of shoes"

310
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,240
Hello, ma'am. I'm looking for a guy
named Ben Buford. You know him?

311
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,700
Yeah, I know him.

312
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,619
- Seen him around here lately?
- Not in a long while.

313
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,873
"Some of the brothers got plenty of cash

00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,611
I'm looking for Ben Buford.
You seen him around?

321
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:57,529
No, I ain't seen him.

322
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,531
Thanks.

323
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,868
Know what the number was today?

00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,558
Seen Ben?

337
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,227
Ben? Ben who?

338
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,729
Ben Buford. You know who I mean.

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,030
That Ben Buford.

342
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:25,701
He's holed up on a place
on Amsterdam, 710.

343
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,704
What apartment and what time?

344
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,416
Third floor. There's a meeting at 9:00.

345
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,960
I can't guarantee it.

346
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,213
I just heard some cat tell another cat.

347
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:41,383
They're both in the movement with Ben.

348
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,762
Yeah, well, stay loose, baby.

349
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,920
You all right?

350
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,631
Baby, are you all right?

351
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,844
I got to feeling like a machine.
That's no way to feel.

352
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,600
Come here, baby.

353
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,634
Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon.

354
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:50,387
What're you having?

355
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,306
A dog with mustard and onions.

356
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,183
No.

357
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,642
Hold the onions.

358
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,314
Cold, huh?

359
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,196
Well, John, what did you get?

360
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,579
I got laid.

361
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:39,478
Uptown, brother. Amsterdam Avenue.
Take your time. I'm early.

362
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,073
Champ, you lost?

363
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:34,116
No.

364
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,743
You live around here?

365
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:37,786
Yeah.

366
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,497
You look cold.

367
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,921
Get something to eat.

368
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:50,632
Gee, thanks, mister.

369
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,301
Okay, champ.

370
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,632
- Who is it?
- John Shaft, Ben.

371
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:36,780
Unless you want more visitors,
better split up that pair out front.

372
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,034
Put somebody on the basement door.

373
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,412
How did you find me?

374
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,039
Wasn't hard. You got a big mouth.

375
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,544
- Cool it, man.
- You cool it, boy.

376
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:56,675
Don't let your mouth
get your ass in trouble.

377
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,889
- I got nothing to say to you.
- Don't jive me.

378
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:08,145
- We've put in a lot of street time together.
- That was a long time back.

379
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,314
I don't know you no more.

380
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:13,734
A lot of hard years, man.
The kind you don't forget.

381
00:37:17,738 --> 00:37:21,617
Now, I'm gonna give you one minute
to say what you came here to say.

382
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:26,580
Then you go back out that door
you came in or I'll throw you out.

383
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,459
You know Marcy Jonas?

384
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,669
- Yeah, why?
- You know where she is?

385
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,547
- What do you mean?
- Somebody grabbed her.

386
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,926
Bumpy thinks maybe it was you.

387
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,014
We don't do that kind of thing.

388
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,058
You know anything about it?

389
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:50,020
Tom, you used up your minute. Get out!

390
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,605
Don't "Tom" me, man!

391
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,107
- Where are the guns?
- None here.

392
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:55,692
I'll be goddamned!

393
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,198
Sonny! Sonny!

394
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,574
They're coming!

395
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,409
- Up on the roof?
- Yeah. Go!

396
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:08,831
He's dead.

397
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,332
Come on, come on!

398
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,335
Not the roof, this way!

399
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:23,262
Stand back.

400
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,890
- What is this?
- Everything will be fine.

401
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:29,935
- What is this?
- Go over there and be quiet.

402
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,572
Everything's okay, ma'am.
No need to worry.

403
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:26,909
Sorry about your door.

404
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:29,077
That'll take care of it.

405
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,581
You set us up, man!

406
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,460
Young man, please.

407
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:38,921
Don't do that.

408
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:44,092
Don't ever threaten me again!
And don't call me Judas!

409
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,054
Come on. It's no time
to count your dead. Come on!

410
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:46,113
Look.

411
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:54,538
Come on!

412
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:01,920
This way, this way!

413
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,426
One of yours?

414
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,596
- No.
- Probably a finger man.

415
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:30,574
When you lead that revolution,
whitey better be standing still...

416
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,368
...'cause you don't run
worth a damn no more!

417
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:34,870
We're done running, man.

418
00:41:34,953 --> 00:41:37,331
What the hell do you call this, man?

419
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,771
I got to find out if they're after you or me.

420
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,743
I'll leave you with some friends.
They're straight people.

421
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,121
So don't you lay any of
that Uncle Tom jive on them.

422
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,590
I don't know what's connected to what.
I can't piece them together.

423
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:29,883
Answer that.

424
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:35,389
It's only a half an hour since it happened.
How could I have something this soon?

425
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:41,228
I'm not paid enough to worry about what
the Commissioner or the Mayor thinks!

426
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,730
It's Shaft. You want to talk to him?

427
00:42:43,814 --> 00:42:46,441
I got a call. I might have something.
Hold on.

428
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,694
No, better I call you back.

429
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:53,490
I'm coming to see you.

430
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,201
You've been holding out on me.

431
00:42:56,577 --> 00:43:00,038
I'll wait. Listen, several cats
were killed in Harlem.

432
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:01,748
You know anything about it?

433
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,625
I was there, Lieutenant.

434
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,806
The Captain's at home. Call him back.
Tell him I left to chase down a lead.

435
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:21,268
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. Just get him off my back.

436
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:23,979
A reporter from the News
wants an interview.

437
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,442
Tell him to call the Captain.
Serves the old bastard right.

438
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,362
This is that list
from the intelligence section.

439
00:43:32,654 --> 00:43:34,031
What about the pictures?

440
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,409
They're getting them together now.
Said about five minutes.

441
00:43:37,493 --> 00:43:40,078
Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.

442
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:58,222
Dina'll get you a bed made up.
Why don't you get some sleep, man?

443
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,643
Got some dead brothers laying out there.

444
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,395
And this ain't where I should be.

445
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:09,316
Till we find out why they're dead,
this is the only place for you to be!

446
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,235
You think like a white man!

447
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,903
You don't think! You want to get wasted?

448
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,530
If that's what it takes!

449
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:16,573
Marvin's sleeping.

450
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,499
I'll find out what I can and pick you up
in the morning.

451
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,919
If you think I'll owe you for this,
you're wrong.

452
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:30,629
You got nothing I want!

453
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:34,466
You can have the girls' room.

454
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:43,058
I got to go out. Got an extra key
so I don't wake you when I come back?

455
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,610
This'll open the downstairs door, too.

456
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,697
Watch your mouth.

457
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:58,240
I'll say anything I want.

458
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:01,743
Not in this house. Not here, you won't.

459
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,311
Have a chair.

460
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:29,438
I don't like your chair.

461
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,984
You gave me nothing, Vic.

462
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:38,447
You want to lock me up for manslaughter
'cause someone went out of my window...

463
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:40,699
...go ahead.

464
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,659
You got no deal.

465
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:47,915
I have nothing else to give you, then.
That's straight.

466
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,125
What do you got now?

467
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,752
One question first.

468
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:55,464
Anyone who could've identified those guys
with machine guns got wiped out!

469
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,465
Yeah?

470
00:45:56,548 --> 00:46:00,344
Five of Ben Buford's people
and probably the guy that fingered you.

471
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,931
Me? Are you sure it's me?

472
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:08,268
I'd be sure if I knew if the guys
were black or white.

473
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,521
I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.

474
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:13,065
But Bumpy could probably tell you that
for sure.

475
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:14,775
Just say what you got, man.

476
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:18,445
A few things that may fit.

477
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:24,326
Do you remember I told you that Bumpy
was doubling his crews up in Harlem?

478
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:25,244
So?

479
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,371
So, downtown we get some visitors.

480
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:32,125
Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix,
a guy from Decatur, Illinois...

481
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:36,505
...four guys from Philly.
Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.

482
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,507
Special guys, huh?

483
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,884
All suspected being guns for the Mafia.

484
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,636
Just got into town.

485
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,431
Most of them staying at a hotel
in the Village. Taking in the sights.

486
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,185
Is that it?

487
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,062
No, one thing more.

488
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,275
A couple of dudes from Harlem
go across to Jersey.

489
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:59,820
Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig.
They blew it.

490
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:01,822
They killed the guy's runner.

491
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:05,033
But the man says his runner
was in Florida on a fishing trip.

492
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,622
- Looks like war coming.
- It's a bad thing.

493
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,585
Mafia against Bumpy.
It's hood against hood, on the inside.

494
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,920
On the outside, it's black against white.

495
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:22,885
We could have tanks and troops
on Broadway if this thing breaks open.

496
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:26,263
Yeah, you got a point.

497
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,641
This is what some of our visitors look like.

498
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:32,853
Be a good time for it.

499
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:34,146
What? War?

500
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:36,565
Fishing down in Florida.

501
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,776
It might help if I knew
what Bumpy hired you for.

502
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,820
- Never said he did.
- He did.

503
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:45,824
It's against my ethics to say yes or no.

504
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:48,994
- He put you on the spot, Shaft.
- He did?

505
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:52,581
You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.

506
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:57,836
I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.

507
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,547
That's a comfort.

508
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,643
- Hello?
- Hello, baby.

509
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:14,728
I waited up.

510
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,731
- Sorry, I can't make it.
- Got problems?

511
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:20,943
Yeah, I got a couple of them.

512
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:25,489
I was born black and I was born poor.

513
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:28,617
I love you.

514
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:31,662
Yeah, I know.

515
00:48:32,704 --> 00:48:33,956
Take it easy.

516
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,721
Get up.

517
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,099
We've got a man to see.

518
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,744
See who that is, will you?

519
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:24,965
It's Shaft.

520
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:28,510
Let him in.

521
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:39,510
