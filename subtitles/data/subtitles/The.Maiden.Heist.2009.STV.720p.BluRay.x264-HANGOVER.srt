1
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:40,567
l sincerely apologize
for disturbing your afternoon.

2
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:46,474
lf you relax and stay calm,
you will all leave here alive.

3
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:50,217
We have come only for the girl.

4
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,729
Drop your weapons, Roger Barlow.

5
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:17,304
Today,

6
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,407
she will be mine.

7
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:24,014
l'm talking to a dead man.
You know that, don't you?

8
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,187
lf l cannot have her...

9
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,914
No!

10
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,869
Okay, we're gonna see
some old paintings now

11
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,673
that l think you all will really like.

12
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:53,111
<i>The Lonely Maiden</i>

13
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:57,242
<i>The Lonely Maiden</i> was painted
by Marcel de Robert in 1873.

14
00:03:57,385 --> 00:04:00,684
The girl in the painting is
the artist's own daughter.

15
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,054
Now, marked by assured brush strokes
and the use of fractured light

16
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,559
makes this painting a wonderful example
of a very brief

17
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:11,531
but influential time period known as
the Northern French naturalist movement.

18
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,695
-Northern French naturalist movement.
-Northern French...

19
00:04:13,768 --> 00:04:14,928
Ma'am.

20
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:16,294
l don't mean to interrupt,

21
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:19,465
but there are some things
l could clear up for the group.

22
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,701
-May l?
-Oh, no, l think...

23
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,209
Well, first, <i>The Lonely Maiden</i>

24
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:27,839
was painted in 1875, not 1873.

25
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,009
And the girl in the painting
is not the artist's daughter,

26
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:32,110
but in fact a niece from his wife's side.

27
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:35,520
Also, the painting technically belongs
to an offshoot

28
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,050
of the Northern French naturalist movement.
The post-naturalist movement.

29
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:43,723
-One of only three works completed.
-Yeah. l knew that.

30
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:47,859
<i>The Lonely Maiden</i> is marked
by the subtle use of tone and mood

31
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,371
to create a striking image
of desperate longing

32
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,566
and overwhelming passion.

33
00:04:55,176 --> 00:05:00,512
Sometimes, when you look at her,
the way the light glows on her face,

34
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,709
the eyes so full of sorrow,

35
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:07,652
you cannot help but ask,
''What is she searching for?

36
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,519
''ls there anything l can do for her?

37
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,660
''ls there anything l can do for her?''

38
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,196
-Okay. Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

39
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:28,401
That was a nice treat, wasn't it?
That was neat.

40
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:29,568
Good to see you.

41
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:32,443
She looks kind of fat.

42
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:38,809
-So, Roger, how was your day?
-lt was good. How was yours?

43
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:41,651
Mine? Mine was better than good.

44
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:46,559
You know how l've been doing Mondays
and Wednesdays down in Margie's shop?

45
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,927
Well, Margie decided they needed
another person on Thursdays.

46
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:54,435
-And who do you think she called?
-ls this the same soup we usually have?

47
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:56,902
-Chicken noodle.
-Same brand?

48
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,098
No, they didn't have your brand.
Why? ls it bad?

49
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,608
No, it's just different.

50
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:07,205
Anyway, today alone
l did seven colorings and six perms.

51
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:11,343
-lt's by far the most l have ever done.
-The noodles stick together in this kind.

52
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,716
l don't know what it is about Thursdays,

53
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,056
but l made more money in tips today
than l ever have on any Wednesday.

54
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:25,158
-l was so nervous walking home.
-You know, criminals can sense fear.

55
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,993
Well, l hope no one sensed me today.
l was nervous.

56
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:34,440
Every little bit gets us closer to Florida.

57
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,177
Our vacation, Roger. Our vacation.

58
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,150
-Who?
-l know you take your job seriously,

59
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:48,122
and that's great,
but l really think you need a break.

60
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:52,353
Someplace warm where you could relax,
take your mind off the museum.

61
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:54,987
You know what happens
when a security guard relaxes?

62
00:06:55,063 --> 00:06:57,361
l think l have some idea.

63
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:00,526
Rose.

64
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:43,209
Monsieur <i>Barlow,</i>
<i>you're supposed to be on break</i>

65
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:45,011
Yo, Mr. Barlow,
you're supposed to be on break, man.

66
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,842
Go, get out of here!

67
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,076
Go grab a soda or something, huh?

68
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,881
Okay, but watch out for children.
They like to touch things.

69
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:57,720
-They get too close, you have to be...
-Yeah, yeah, trust me.

70
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:00,188
lt's under control.

71
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,497
Look sharp, now.
Looks like ''The Man'' just walked in.

72
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:12,531
-l wonder what they're doing.
-You didn't hear?

73
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,705
Man, don't you ever read the bulletin board?

74
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:22,677
The display should be bold, in your face,
grab people by their throats and say,

75
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,810
''l don't care what you think, l am beautiful.

76
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:29,954
''Do not turn away.'' This middle area,

77
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:34,160
wonderful for the dung sculptures.

78
00:08:34,362 --> 00:08:37,763
The upstairs,
perfect for the series of animal genitalia.

79
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,562
Now, for the northern end of the hall...

80
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,765
-Can l help you with something?
-Yes, sir.

81
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:46,033
l was wondering, someone told me just now,

82
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:48,701
you're thinking of moving
<i>The Lonely Maiden</i>

83
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,243
ls that true?

84
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:54,476
-Who is this?
-That would be Barlow, sir.

85
00:08:54,816 --> 00:08:56,579
Security guard, sir.

86
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:58,679
Well, Mr. Barlow,
l don't know what you've heard,

87
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:01,187
but we are not thinking
of moving the exhibit.

88
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,280
We are moving the exhibit.

89
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:07,293
A gallery in Copenhagen made an offer
and we accepted.

90
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:12,629
-Let's go, gentlemen.
-Sir! Sir! Why Denmark? Why so far?

91
00:09:14,302 --> 00:09:17,135
l'm sorry we didn't consult you.

92
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:21,231
The visitor will be greeted
by a series of spirals here

93
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:23,800
in the northern end of the gallery.

94
00:09:25,413 --> 00:09:29,213
lt's that damned new curator.
We've had that exhibit 30 years.

95
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:31,877
People... lt needs to be there.

96
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:36,490
-Roger, were you wearing a beret again?
-No.

97
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:43,296
But it leaves a big mark on your forehead,
and it pushes your hair up in the back.

98
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:48,092
l know you like to wear it
when you read your art books.

99
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,435
lt doesn't make sense.
People love those paintings.

100
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:55,064
Maybe they'll like the new exhibit.

101
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:02,576
Roger, maybe you should retire.

102
00:10:02,817 --> 00:10:04,842
You've been at the museum
an awfully long time.

103
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,616
l can't retire, Rose.
What would l do with myself all day?

104
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:12,952
Roger, you wouldn't do it with yourself.
You would do it with me.

105
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,760
We could move out of the city,
someplace warm.

106
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,633
l don't know.

107
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,438
-Bob.
-Hey, Roger.

108
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:35,002
You thought about moving to Denmark?

109
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:38,170
A little bit, but l don't think
my wife would go for it.

110
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,269
How about you?

111
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,574
Looked into it.

112
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:48,118
-lt just doesn't seem right.
-No.

113
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,519
l mean, you stand there,
day after day, year after year,

114
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:55,326
and then...

115
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:59,898
They say she's going to be gone.
Just like that.

116
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,742
You know,

117
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:17,748
we don't have to let them leave.

118
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:22,752
l mean, if we're serious,
we can just make them ours.

119
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:28,358
-What are you saying?
-What do you think l'm saying?

120
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,797
l'm not sure.

121
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:35,635
For a second, l thought you were suggesting
that we steal the paintings.

122
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,402
And if l am?

123
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:40,463
We're security guards.
We're supposed to stop crime.

124
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:44,170
You don't think this is a crime?
Do you know how far Denmark is?

125
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:46,110
l don't know, Charlie.

126
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:52,147
We're not thieves.
And besides, you and me...

127
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,888
l don't see how we could do it.

128
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,665
lt's a silly idea.
l shouldn't have brought it up.

129
00:13:10,738 --> 00:13:11,898
-Wait, wait.
-l have to go.

130
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:16,137
l have things to do. l have responsibilities.
Thanks for the milk.

131
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,302
Sure.

132
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:21,312
Paintings.

133
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:26,477
Steal paintings.

134
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,849
-Hi.
-Charles.

135
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,082
Have you thought about
what we talked about yesterday?

136
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:35,179
No.

137
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:38,921
Okay, maybe a little bit. Why?

138
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,685
Can l show you something?

139
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:47,065
<i>About nine months ago</i>
<i>they started this new program</i>

140
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:50,467
of looking at the security tape
from the night before,

141
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,063
to make sure that the guards on duty
aren't slacking off.

142
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,632
So l volunteered, thinking a few hours
of overtime would help.

143
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:04,451
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, fellows.

144
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,330
His name is George McLendon.
He's been a guard for 1 2 years.

145
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,235
Works nights twice a week.

146
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:36,841
The statue he's looking at
is called <i>The Bronze Warrior</i>

147
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:39,242
Artist unknown.

148
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:44,148
A vivid and exquisite celebration
of the male form.

149
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,992
The naked male form.

150
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,685
That's him.

151
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:21,558
-Excuse me. Hello, how are you?
-Good, good. What can l do for you fellows?

152
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:25,258
My name is Roger Barlow.
This is Charles Peterson.

153
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:27,423
-Hi.
-We work at the museum.

154
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,800
-Right, l know, l've seen you around.
-Okay, well...

155
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:34,368
Well...

156
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:37,669
What?

157
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:43,343
You're on the security tapes.

158
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,343
So?

159
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:49,382
-Well...
-Jesus.

160
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,649
-Where's... Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
-George, it's not what you think.

161
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,292
George, George, George, please.

162
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,964
Listen, l don't know what you think you saw,
but l'm a happily married man.

163
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:06,200
-We're not here to judge you.
-No, we just want to talk about your statue.

164
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,471
We just want to talk.

165
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:16,645
You know they're moving the exhibit,
don't you?

166
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:18,582
That's why we're here.

167
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:21,850
Can we go somewhere?

168
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,651
The coffee shop?

169
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:34,064
-Do you know how far Denmark is?
-Yes, it's so far away.

170
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,932
-lt's too far.
-lt's a really hard language.

171
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:51,578
Hope you don't mind the mess.

172
00:17:53,921 --> 00:17:58,722
-We don't get very many guests.
-That's fine. Did you do all these yourself?

173
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:02,156
l can pretty much do it from memory now.

174
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,032
The hand sketch on the yellow envelope
over there is my latest.

175
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:09,702
-l finished it this morning.
-These are amazing.

176
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,101
Thank you.

177
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:16,605
That must be George.

178
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,078
-Hi, George.
-Charles.

179
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,909
-Roger.
-Hi, George.

180
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:27,083
l hope you didn't have any trouble
finding the place.

181
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:30,055
-No.
-Well, if you can just watch your step.

182
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:32,884
-Cats, see.
-Yeah. Where's the model?

183
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,052
lt's over here.

184
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:38,723
Matisse! Come on, darling.

185
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,431
Bad kitty.

186
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:48,635
So this is about the best l could do,
in terms of setting up a model for us.

187
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,276
You know, this is the main entrance,

188
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,246
this is the north entrance,
this is the south entrance.

189
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:56,579
Well, you know the layout.

190
00:18:57,017 --> 00:19:00,851
l thought the north entrance would be
our best chance. lt's quiet and secluded,

191
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,321
so we won't be spotted from the street.

192
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,656
The door has a triple-action security lock,
controlled electronically,

193
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:10,262
and there's only one posted guard.

194
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:15,057
<i>The guard on duty is permitted</i>
<i>two five-minute bathroom breaks</i>

195
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,727
<i>every three hours</i>

196
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:22,575
<i>We preset the electronic locks</i>
<i>at a specified time</i>

197
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:26,570
<i>Make our way down the corridor</i>
<i>to the main exhibit hall</i>

198
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,051
What about the two interior guards?

199
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:42,829
l don't know.

200
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:46,666
Well, we could always use
the south entrance.

201
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:49,433
There's only a guard posted there
on the weekends.

202
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:52,336
The door is an electronically-controlled
bolt lock

203
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:56,308
with a magnetic tripwire
that is triggered by opening the door.

204
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,670
There's a three-second delay.

205
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:03,975
<i>So, if we hurry, we could get inside,</i>
<i>reset it before it activates</i>

206
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:08,085
What about the motion sensors?

207
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,389
-Well, l hadn't quite worked that out yet.
-No, l guess you hadn't.

208
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,125
Gentlemen, l have a question for you.

209
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,569
Are you ready to get serious?

210
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:34,709
-Watch your step.
-You hit me in the face!

211
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:37,012
-Easy, easy. Use your goggles.
-Be careful.

212
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,984
All right, here we are.

213
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:40,650
This is something else.

214
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,916
-What a lovely evening.
-Yeah.

215
00:20:43,023 --> 00:20:45,014
-Wow! Look at that!
-Yeah.

216
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,754
Perfect. This is good. This will work.

217
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:50,758
Are you sure
nobody's gonna come up here?

218
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,061
No, no. Nobody else has a key.

219
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:56,661
Good. All right, gentlemen.

220
00:20:57,171 --> 00:20:59,639
l'll go first. When l get down,

221
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:04,102
l'll call for one of you to follow me.
And don't worry.

222
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:07,170
Once you've attached the rope,
you won't fall.

223
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:11,215
You do, however,
have to control your speed.

224
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,050
Remember, left hand is the gas,
right hand is the brake.

225
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:18,785
George, where'd you learn how to do this?

226
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,226
Marines. l was in Wave 3
of the Grenada lnvasion.

227
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,167
Wait, wait, wait.

228
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,802
l'm okay. l'm okay.

229
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,406
Charles, you don't care
about these flower pots, do you?

230
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,674
My flowers? Oh, dear.

231
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:45,480
-Well, l guess not.
-Okay, who's next?

232
00:21:47,287 --> 00:21:50,381
-Roger. Roger, you're next, okay?
-l don't want to do this.

233
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:54,757
-No, Roger, you've got to. You gotta do it.
-Well, why do l have to go first?

234
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:57,160
Well, 'cause l don't want to go first.

235
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,665
-Why not?
-Well, because l'm scared.

236
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:01,791
-l'm not going.
-Yes, you are.

237
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:03,427
Ladies, can we please get a move on?

238
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:06,769
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming. He's coming.

239
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:09,736
You're doing fine.

240
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,646
-You sure about this?
-Of course l'm sure.

241
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,517
Let her rip, soldier!

242
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:26,453
-Good luck, Roger.
-Okay, here goes.

243
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:38,429
Roger, you okay?

244
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:40,206
l'm not sure.

245
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:43,004
You're doing fine, Private.
The hard part's behind you.

246
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:46,136
Just remember, left hand gas,
right hand brake.

247
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,774
-l think my hand is slipping.
-Which one?

248
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:49,941
Both.

249
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:56,384
Roger, are you okay?

250
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,188
l can't believe it. l'm alive.

251
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:12,165
Rose, l've been thinking about
what you said, you know,

252
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:15,504
about me retiring
and us moving somewhere.

253
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,808
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.

254
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:20,869
Roger, really?

255
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,384
Roger, that's wonderful.

256
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:27,443
l knew,
once you wrapped your mind around it,

257
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:32,857
that Florida would be the place for us.
All of those beaches and sunshine.

258
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:37,122
As nice as Florida is,
l was thinking Denmark.

259
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:40,761
-Denmark?
-Yeah.

260
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,392
Are you kidding?

261
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:46,701
l realize it's not a conventional choice,
but l've heard nice things.

262
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:51,876
Are there beaches in Denmark?
Does it even get warm there?

263
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:56,413
Not like Florida, no,
but probably there's a few weeks a year

264
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:59,782
that are very pleasant.
l'm not sure about a beach.

265
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:04,186
Roger, that sounds like
a great place to retire.

266
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,061
l can't wait.

267
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:13,433
Yeah, well,
l thought it might be something different.

268
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,128
-lt's different.
-Yeah.

269
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:25,665
-Where's Charles?
-He said he'd be here.

270
00:25:30,377 --> 00:25:33,073
Sorry l'm late. l went to the wrong bench.

271
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:36,547
-The gentleman over there...
-Turn around, turn around.

272
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:40,677
We have to be extra careful now.
No telling who might be watching.

273
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:43,050
There's a new plan.

274
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,984
We're going to take the pieces
during the move.

275
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:54,233
-But won't there be guards?
-We are the guards. Tell him, Roger.

276
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:57,728
Needlebaum's taking volunteers
to work security.

277
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:01,632
lf we volunteer,
we'll have perfect access to the pieces.

278
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:07,838
-How do you know that?
-l snuck into his office and read the file.

279
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,373
-You did?
-Yeah.

280
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:13,182
Roger, l'm impressed.

281
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,616
-Thank you, Charlie.
-All right.

282
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:18,522
We should move on.
This is starting to look suspicious.

283
00:26:18,592 --> 00:26:21,857
l'll keep you men informed
on a need-to-know basis.

284
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:24,355
George, George, wait! Wait!

285
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,564
What is it?

286
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:29,802
You said we're gonna steal the pieces
during the move.

287
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,839
What happens when the crates are opened
in Denmark and three pieces are missing?

288
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:33,895
That's a good point.

289
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:35,635
Would you please turn around?
They're gonna see us.

290
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,769
-Who's ''they''? We're at the park.
-Gentlemen...

291
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:51,390
Gentlemen, let me ask you a question.
Do the Communists control Grenada?

292
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:56,485
l am not that familiar with Grenada. Do they?

293
00:26:56,797 --> 00:26:59,595
Hell no, they don't, and do you know why?

294
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:02,396
-Because you invaded?
-Exactly.

295
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:08,841
Operation Urgent Fury was a shining beacon
of military preparedness.

296
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:12,606
So when you ask me what happens
when three pieces are missing in Denmark,

297
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,944
it offends me.
lt's like you discount my training.

298
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:19,116
l'm sorry, George.
l didn't mean to doubt your training.

299
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:21,177
-Thank you, l appreciate that.
-But seriously,

300
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:24,018
what happens when three pieces
are found missing in Denmark?

301
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,421
All right.

302
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:31,120
Since the phrase ''on a need-to-know basis''
clearly means nothing to you,

303
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:39,533
we are going to have
three perfect fakes made.

304
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,870
But that's not the same, is it?

305
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:49,313
l thought the whole point
was to get the real pieces.

306
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:50,747
-Yes.
-No.

307
00:27:51,117 --> 00:27:54,951
No, we're gonna get...
We're going to get the real pieces,

308
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:59,520
but we'll exchange the fakes for the originals
during the move.

309
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:03,723
That way, when they open the crates
in Denmark, no one's the wiser.

310
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,602
-Charles. Can you handle the paintings?
-Well, sure, but what about your statue?

311
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,936
l'm not a sculptor. l don't do sculpture.

312
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:17,499
l've had something in the works
for quite some time.

313
00:28:17,577 --> 00:28:20,637
A few more adjustments,
and it'll be just fine.

314
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:26,046
You really got this figured out, George.

315
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:28,913
Operation Urgent Fury, gentlemen.

316
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:32,251
Operation Urgent Fury.

317
00:28:33,393 --> 00:28:37,420
We sign up to work the move on Friday.
l trust you'll be there.

318
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:01,015
-Charles, that's really good.
-Thank you.

319
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:05,353
-Would you like to see yours?
-ls it done?

320
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:07,552
Well, just a few finishing touches.

321
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:09,219
-Of course.
-Come on.

322
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:17,063
What do you think?

323
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,838
You don't like it.

324
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:31,676
l think it's a pretty good likeness, Roger.

325
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:33,480
Maybe if it had a frame.
You could see it a little better...

326
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,487
No, no, it's all wrong.
The face, the body, Charles.

327
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:36,954
-She looks like a pear.
-A pear?

328
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:39,457
-Look at the size of her face, it's huge.
-What are you talking about?

329
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:41,391
lt's called ''voluptuous.'' And the hair,

330
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:44,396
it's supposed to be long,
flowing, windswept.

331
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:45,725
What about the glow?

332
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,597
-Charlie, this girl has no glow!
-Roger...

333
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:50,802
-Look at the size of her jaw!
-l can only paint what l see,

334
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,997
and that's the way l see it!

335
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,034
The jaw, with the hips, what is that?

336
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:59,475
-l'm not a <i>X</i>erox machine, Roger!
-She looks like a Neanderthal!

337
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:01,980
-Got a jaw like a Cro-Magnon!
-Roger.

338
00:30:02,482 --> 00:30:03,949
-l'm sorry.
-l paint the way l feel,

339
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:05,951
and that's the way
your woman makes me feel!

340
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:07,816
But then how come yours is perfect?

341
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:11,880
Because l've had a lot of practice,
that's why. Almost 30 years.

342
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,726
And it's not perfect. lt's not perfect at all.
There's a... There's an aura

343
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:23,994
l can't seem to capture.

344
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:27,466
l mean, l've tried.
l've tried over and over and over,

345
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,269
and l just can't...

346
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:32,972
lt just eludes me.

347
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:40,044
Roger, l'm sorry.

348
00:30:55,769 --> 00:30:56,963
That...

349
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,798
Probably my wife. Could we take two?

350
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:09,772
-George here.
<i>-It's Roger</i>

351
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:12,941
l thought l said
we'd only use this number for emergencies.

352
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:16,477
This is an emergency.
Charlie couldn't do the painting.

353
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,652
What do you mean he couldn't do it?

354
00:31:18,725 --> 00:31:22,183
Roger, this is a vital part of the plan.
Without this, everything falls to pieces!

355
00:31:22,262 --> 00:31:24,696
Trust me, George, it was terrible.

356
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,657
-How did his look?
-His looked great.

357
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:32,068
What am l gonna do, George?
l don't know anybody else who paints.

358
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:34,538
All right, relax, soldier, relax.

359
00:31:34,607 --> 00:31:37,667
Look, the art world has a long tradition
of young painters doing forgeries

360
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:41,703
to make ends meet. Some of our
greatest artists got their start that way.

361
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:45,683
And if there's one thing that this city has,
it's lots of starving artists.

362
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:48,277
-lt'll cost you some coin, though.
<i>-How much coin?</i>

363
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:51,255
l don't know. A couple of hundred, probably.

364
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:55,155
-That's a lot of money.
-Roger, listen.

365
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:58,460
You've got to get something done.
Otherwise...

366
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,859
<i>Well, the whole mission is fubared</i>

367
00:32:02,602 --> 00:32:04,069
Okay, George.

368
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:02,893
Something l can help you with?

369
00:33:02,962 --> 00:33:06,125
Hi. l'm admiring your work.
lt's good, l like it.

370
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,360
Thanks.

371
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:12,336
How would you feel about doing some work
on a kind of commission basis?

372
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:17,001
lt's for my wife. lt's a gift,
and it needs to be identical, actual size,

373
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:20,105
with the artist's signature
in the exact same place.

374
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,445
-My wife's a stickler for details.
-Yeah, l'll bet.

375
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,182
-When do you need it?
-Five days.

376
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,220
This mean you'll do it?

377
00:33:29,722 --> 00:33:32,020
Yeah, sure. For 1,000 bucks.

378
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:36,427
-$500 now, the rest when you pick it up.
-But that's expensive.

379
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,922
Okay.

380
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:41,191
$500.

381
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:44,797
Got it right here.

382
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:53,907
Quiet down, please.

383
00:33:56,316 --> 00:34:01,481
Sector 3 will be the first to be moved,
starting from the north wall moving south.

384
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:05,155
The museum has been divided
into color-coded sectors,

385
00:34:05,258 --> 00:34:07,783
and each painting assigned a number.

386
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:12,128
Each piece is to be placed
in the crate and slot

387
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:17,334
designated by its color code and number,
then marked off of a checklist,

388
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:20,201
then double-checked off of a master list.

389
00:34:21,474 --> 00:34:26,207
The rest of the week will be dedicated
to the installation of the new exhibit.

390
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:29,075
Now, the curator has written a few words...

391
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:35,786
Hello, Rose?

392
00:34:53,172 --> 00:34:54,662
There you are.

393
00:34:57,477 --> 00:35:00,002
l didn't think you were here.
l yelled when l came in,

394
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,070
but you didn't answer.

395
00:35:06,653 --> 00:35:08,814
There's $800 missing.

396
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,628
Think we've been robbed?

397
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:20,989
What about the stereo?
Did you check the rest of the apartment?

398
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:24,230
-ls the TV still here?
-We weren't robbed, Roger.

399
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:27,529
That's all that was missing.
No more, no less.

400
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:32,840
l came home, l opened the jar
to put in my tips from the store

401
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:36,143
-and do my weekly count.
-l thought you did a monthly count.

402
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:39,912
No, Roger, l do a weekly count.
l've always done a weekly count,

403
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:44,320
and this week we're $800 lower
than last week.

404
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,258
That's weird.

405
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:49,489
-l should check the stereo, just in case.
-Roger.

406
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:52,656
lf you wanted money,
why wouldn't you just ask me?

407
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:55,496
We would've worked something out.
But to steal?

408
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:58,867
-Why would l take it?
-That's what l'd like to know.

409
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:00,899
You don't gamble.

410
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,903
You don't go to bars.
You're not seeing another woman.

411
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:06,002
How do you know?

412
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,206
All right, Roger,
are you seeing another woman?

413
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:12,081
No, of course not, but how do you know
l don't gamble, go to bars?

414
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:15,143
Maybe l drink and gamble.
Maybe that's my thing.

415
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:17,519
Hey, why am l the one to blame?

416
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:21,182
Money gets stolen
and you automatically accuse me!

417
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,851
How do l know you didn't take the money?

418
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,021
-Me?
-Yeah.

419
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:28,133
How could you, Roger?
l'm your wife! Your wife!

420
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,726
-You accused me!
-Well, this money, Roger,

421
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:33,897
this money was for us! Together!

422
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,905
To think that l would steal
from my own cookie jar!

423
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:39,103
Okay.

424
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,972
Rose.

425
00:36:43,149 --> 00:36:44,616
-Beast!
-Rose!

426
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:49,518
l'm sorry!

427
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:52,751
l didn't mean it.

428
00:37:28,461 --> 00:37:29,553
Rose.

429
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,520
Come on, Rose.

430
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,659
You know l don't like it
when you're mad at me.

431
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:37,259
Go away, Roger.

432
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:41,934
Okay, l admit l took the money.

433
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:46,143
Look, l wasn't gonna say anything, 'cause...

434
00:37:48,014 --> 00:37:52,280
lt was supposed to be a surprise,
but you kind of forced my hand here.

435
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:56,177
l'm listening.

436
00:37:57,123 --> 00:38:01,116
Remember how we talked about
maybe taking that trip to Florida?

437
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:10,093
Yes.

438
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:16,067
Well, again,
it was supposed to be a surprise,

439
00:38:16,142 --> 00:38:19,009
but l went to a travel agent
and l booked us a trip.

440
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,478
l needed the money for a deposit.

441
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:24,078
We're going to Florida? When?

442
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:28,343
Well, that's where it gets complicated.
l was thinking next week, but...

443
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:31,117
Our anniversary? Roger, you remembered?

444
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:35,417
You remembered.

445
00:38:36,729 --> 00:38:38,856
l thought you had forgotten.

446
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:43,063
l didn't forget.
l was all over it, but then it got complicated.

447
00:38:43,136 --> 00:38:44,728
How complicated?

448
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:51,207
Remember l told you
they're moving the exhibit next week?

449
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:53,469
Yes.

450
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,673
They put together a special security crew,

451
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:59,946
and my supervisor says they need me.
lt's an important assignment, and...

452
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,486
The whole thing's out of my hands now,

453
00:39:01,554 --> 00:39:05,012
but it looks like we have to postpone Florida
for another time.

454
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:08,527
Wait a minute.
So we're not going to Florida?

455
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,988
One minute you tell me
we're going to Florida,

456
00:39:11,063 --> 00:39:15,693
-then you tell me we're not going to Florida?
-l hate to disappoint you. Rose!

457
00:39:15,768 --> 00:39:19,135
l wasn't going to say anything,
'cause l know how you get your hopes up,

458
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:21,799
but then you noticed the money and...

459
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:24,601
l should talk to that travel agent,
get our deposit back.

460
00:39:24,677 --> 00:39:27,271
We're going, we're not going.
We're going, we're not going.

461
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:28,836
We're going, we're going.

462
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:53,833
Come in.

463
00:39:55,975 --> 00:40:00,503
-You wanted to see me, sir?
-Yes. Come in, Roger. Have a seat.

464
00:40:03,082 --> 00:40:04,413
Hi, Roger.

465
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:07,314
Rose, what are you doing here?

466
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,617
Your lovely wife was just telling me that
you're planning on taking a trip next week.

467
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,020
ls that right?

468
00:40:14,093 --> 00:40:16,254
Well, there was something
l had been planning.

469
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:20,390
-lt was supposed to be a surprise.
-Well, l was just explaining... Sit down.

470
00:40:20,466 --> 00:40:24,732
l was just explaining to the lovely
Mr. Needlebaum about the surprise.

471
00:40:25,371 --> 00:40:29,205
You know, Roger,
working this move isn't mandatory.

472
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:32,771
You didn't have to volunteer.

473
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:37,212
-Volunteer?
-l understand, Mr. Needlebaum.

474
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,909
l guess l got confused. l wasn't quite sure
what you meant by ''voluntary.''

475
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:45,788
Sometimes when people say ''voluntary,''
they mean ''mandatory.''

476
00:40:46,325 --> 00:40:47,519
Really?

477
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,318
No, l actually meant voluntary.

478
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:56,398
lf you two are planning a vacation,
l'll find somebody to take your place.

479
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:58,096
Consider it done.

480
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:02,468
-That's good.
-Roger!

481
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:05,237
So where are you two going?

482
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:08,678
Roger is taking me to Florida
for our anniversary.

483
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:12,806
You old dog, you.
l didn't know you were that romantic.

484
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:17,251
Florida? What's this thing about Florida?

485
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:19,686
l can't help it. Rose thinks we're going.

486
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:20,919
-Who's Rose? Your wife?
-Yeah.

487
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,984
-Why does she think that?
-l told her we were.

488
00:41:23,062 --> 00:41:24,552
-You told her you were going?
-lt's a long story!

489
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,790
Did you know about this?

490
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:30,063
No, l didn't know about it. l just found out.
Why are we having this emergency meeting?

491
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:33,503
Well, Roger, we can't have you going AWOL.
Not now.

492
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:35,733
We've done too much planning.
You're gonna go to Needlebaum,

493
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:37,537
you tell him
there's been a big misunderstanding.

494
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,339
You're not going on any trip.

495
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:41,573
You tell him to put you back on the list.
He'll understand.

496
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:43,171
Well, what about Rose?
What am l going to tell her?

497
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:46,946
-Hey, man. l can't complain. l'm all right.
-How you doing?

498
00:41:53,426 --> 00:41:55,553
Hey, who's working the move?

499
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:01,491
<i>K</i>ind of sick of looking
at the same old junk around here, huh?

500
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:03,535
Yeah, it'll be a relief.

501
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,135
Well, take care, fellows.

502
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:08,969
-Okay, man.
-See you.

503
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:15,140
-Roger, we can't do it without you.
-Let me ask you something.

504
00:42:15,214 --> 00:42:17,808
-Who calls the shots in your house?
-l do, but she's not going to like this.

505
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:21,250
She doesn't have to like it.
Women respond to authority and leadership.

506
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,914
They may say they don't, but they do.

507
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:25,547
Your wife responds to that?

508
00:42:25,624 --> 00:42:26,613
-Who?
-Yours.

509
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:30,093
My wife has nothing to do with this.
We are talking about his wife.

510
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:31,663
Come on, man.

511
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:34,357
-Stand up! Be a man.
-l do!

512
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:39,202
-Charlie, what's with him?
-l don't...

513
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:48,505
Rose, that's the way it's gonna be.
We're not going.

514
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:53,045
That's the way it's gonna be.
What? You want to argue with me? Okay.

515
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,016
That's it. That's the way it's going to be.
lt's final.

516
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:02,057
That's it.

517
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:18,799
Hey, Roger, your guy did a great job.

518
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:20,505
That looks exactly the same.

519
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,642
There's something missing. The glow.
And she's clearly not as lonely in this one.

520
00:43:25,718 --> 00:43:28,209
-Yeah, and mine's missing something, too.
-No, no, no, no, no, guys.

521
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,255
Of course they don't look perfect for us.

522
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:33,985
We've stood in front of the real pieces
for months! Years!

523
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:37,792
We've come to know them in ways that
the average person will never understand.

524
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:40,661
Look at the... Look at the <i>Bronze Warrior</i>

525
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:44,499
Look at the sense of power,
the feeling of potency.

526
00:43:45,404 --> 00:43:50,103
The abs. And yet,
this is no substitute for the original.

527
00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:54,509
lt's not important how they make us feel.
What's important

528
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:59,115
is whether some guy in Denmark
is going to recognize them as fakes!

529
00:43:59,185 --> 00:44:00,277
Yeah.

530
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:03,878
-We go?
-We go.

531
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:17,995
<i>It's 640 am,</i>

00:44:38,557 --> 00:44:40,047

-Yeah, so...
-Hey!

537

Let's carry <i>Mother and Child</i> over...

541

-Got it.
-lt's good.

Damn it!

547
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:42,627
Phil, would you mind finishing
these last few for me?

548
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:45,527
l've been at it all day. l need a break.

549
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:48,193
Sure thing, Roger.

550
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:07,009

-l'm all right.

554
00:50:40,419 --> 00:50:42,683

555
00:50:42,754 --> 00:50:48,056
-l thought you might get hungry later.
-Roger, l've been trained to endure hardship.

556
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,623

in the jungle without food.

557

you were in the Grenada lnvasion?

No, l'm...

559

-How's the paintings?
-They're right here. Everything's fine.

560
00:51:03,075 --> 00:51:05,270

Yes. This one is part of a special collection.

separately. lt took a little longer.

Roger, this looks awfully heavy.
Can we get some help?

713

No help. We have to do this ourselves.
All we have to do is push.

Forget the code names, gentlemen.
We did it. We beat them.

724

We took everything they had to throw at us

<i>Get back in the crate!</i>

737
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:18,012
l don't know. George, quick question.

738
01:11:18,222 --> 01:11:21,851
When we were back at the warehouse
and you said third crate from the left,

739
01:11:21,926 --> 01:11:26,590
<i>-was that your left or my left?</i>
-My left! My left! Why would it be your left?

<i>-Because it's my left</i>
-Oh, my God! This is a disaster!

<i>We don't have a battle plan!</i>

Don't panic! lf you panic, l'll panic.

743
01:11:37,408 --> 01:11:39,842
This is a soldier's worst nightmare,
gentlemen!

744
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:40,899
Chaos!

745
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:43,412
Calm down, George,
we're gonna get you out of there.

746
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:45,915
We just have to make one quick stop first.

747
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:47,644
-Stop?
-A stop?

748
01:11:47,718 --> 01:11:51,484
-We have to stop at my house.
<i>-A stop? What are you talking about?</i>

749
01:11:51,555 --> 01:11:55,184
<i>You can't leave me here! I'm down</i>
<i>behind enemy lines! They'll make me talk!</i>

-<i>K</i>eep him company. Make sure...
<i>-What are we going to do?</i>

754
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,432
-...he doesn't panic.
-l think he's already panicked.

755
01:12:05,503 --> 01:12:07,733
Good point. Make sure he stays in the crate.

756
01:12:07,805 --> 01:12:09,739
-Okay, thanks.
<i>-You gotta get me out of here!</i>

757
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:13,106
-Hi, it's me, Charles.
<i>-Charles? Where's Roger?</i>

758
01:12:13,777 --> 01:12:17,804
-Well, he had to go and get his wife.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

759
01:12:17,882 --> 01:12:19,941
l don't understand.
What's his wife have to do with this?

760
01:12:20,017 --> 01:12:22,178
l thought l told him to stand up to her!

761
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,914
Rose? Where are you, Rose?

762
01:12:26,123 --> 01:12:29,320
l'm in the bedroom, Roger.
Where do you think l am?

763
01:12:29,393 --> 01:12:32,055
-l can't stand it when you're late.
-What? You're not packed yet?

764
01:12:32,129 --> 01:12:33,994
You were supposed to be here
a half an hour ago.

765
01:12:34,064 --> 01:12:35,964
l know, l got hung up at work.

766
01:12:36,033 --> 01:12:39,264
But, look, we have to go right now,
l'm telling you. Get your things.

767
01:12:39,336 --> 01:12:41,395
-Roger, wait a minute.
-ls this everything?

768
01:12:41,472 --> 01:12:44,134
No, it's not... Wait. Roger, don't zip it.

769
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,506
-l'm not finished.
-l'm zipping!

770
01:12:46,744 --> 01:12:49,975
Roger, what is going on? Why...
Roger, you're making me very nervous.

771
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:51,036
Why are you acting like this?

772
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:53,583
l'm not... Acting like what?
l can't wait to get going.

773
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:56,017
ls there something wrong with that?

774
01:12:56,086 --> 01:12:57,849
Well, how are we getting to the airport?

775
01:12:57,922 --> 01:13:00,584
-l have a friend to drive us.
-A friend?

776
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:03,684
-What friend, Roger? Here.
-He's somebody l work with.

777
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:06,855
He's got a van he likes to drive.
Beyond that, it gets complicated,

778
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:10,389
but he's waiting downstairs,
so can we go now, please?

779
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:14,697
-Roger, you're acting very strange.
-l'm not strange. You're strange.

780
01:13:14,772 --> 01:13:17,400
-Come on!
-Roger, wait!

781
01:13:19,476 --> 01:13:20,568
What?

782
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:23,878
Say ''beach.''

783
01:13:24,148 --> 01:13:25,843
Okay, take the picture. Take the...

784
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:28,851
-Please, take the picture!
-All right, all right, all right!

785
01:13:28,919 --> 01:13:31,854
Roger, do you have some sort of surprise
planned for me?

786
01:13:31,922 --> 01:13:35,323
Yes, that's a good way to put it. Let's go.

787
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:39,862
Roger, Roger! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

788
01:13:41,532 --> 01:13:45,059
Are you sure you want to go to Florida
dressed like that?

789
01:13:45,736 --> 01:13:49,297
<i>I'm not panicked</i>
<i>I'm a little panicked, but God!</i>

790
01:13:49,707 --> 01:13:51,538
<i>We're gonna get you out, George</i>
<i>Don't worry</i>

791
01:13:51,609 --> 01:13:54,908
What would you do? l have to think like you.

792
01:13:55,946 --> 01:13:57,607
What would you do?

793
01:13:58,549 --> 01:14:01,109
You gotta get me out of here! Oh, no!

794
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:03,517
Sorry, l gotta go, George. Bye.

795
01:14:03,587 --> 01:14:04,849
<i>-No, Charles, don't</i>
-Over.

796
01:14:04,922 --> 01:14:07,652
l'm going, Roger, l'm going! All right.

797
01:14:15,933 --> 01:14:17,457
Roger, careful!

798
01:14:19,169 --> 01:14:21,228
-Roger!
-Everything's fine.

799
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:26,273
-l want you to meet Charles. My wife, Rose.
-Hello.

800
01:14:27,211 --> 01:14:28,906
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

801
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:33,473
Roger said that you volunteered to take us
to the airport. That's very nice of you.

802
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:36,212
-Well, l think the plan is...
-No, no, no.

803
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:40,849
Don't explain anything. l know that Roger
has a little surprise planned for us.

804
01:14:40,924 --> 01:14:43,518
-l don't want you to ruin it.
-Okay, l won't.

805
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:46,222
-Step on it, Charles.
-Yeah, yeah, yes.

806
01:15:15,059 --> 01:15:16,048
Wait, wait, wait.

807
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:17,684
Why are we stopping here, guys?
The airport's over there.

808
01:15:17,761 --> 01:15:18,887
We have to drop the crate off...

809
01:15:18,962 --> 01:15:20,520
-This is cargo.
-...and pick up George.

810
01:15:20,597 --> 01:15:22,155
-George?
-He's another friend of mine.

811
01:15:22,232 --> 01:15:23,790
l told him we'd pick him up.

812
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:25,630
Who are all these friends of yours?
l never met George.

813
01:15:25,703 --> 01:15:27,330
l'll be right back.
Charles is gonna stay with you.

814
01:15:27,404 --> 01:15:28,462
-We have a plane to catch.
-l am?

815
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:30,006
l'll be right back.

816
01:15:30,074 --> 01:15:32,804
-ls this part of the surprise?
-ln a way.

817
01:15:34,678 --> 01:15:36,908
l've never even heard of George.

818
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,973
Thirty-two years, and all of a sudden
he's got all these friends.

819
01:15:41,151 --> 01:15:43,142
-Do you know George?
-Yes.

820
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,781
l mean, yes.
Yes, he's a friend, like Roger said.

821
01:15:47,991 --> 01:15:52,894
A nice guy.
A little tense, but then who isn't, right?

822
01:15:53,697 --> 01:15:56,530
-How's it going? You two getting along?
-Roger!

823
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,592
l hope you realize
we are going to miss our plane!

824
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:02,332
We're fine, Rose. Plenty of time.

825
01:16:04,475 --> 01:16:06,705
We're going to miss our plane.

826
01:16:32,736 --> 01:16:34,829
<i>-George, is that you?</i>
-Yes!

827
01:16:35,139 --> 01:16:37,972
Yes, yes, it's me! Get me out of here, Roger!

828
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,942
My legs are falling asleep!
l can't feel my toes!

829
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:44,344
-Okay. Okay, George.
<i>-Get me out of here as fast as you can!</i>

830
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,940
Can l help you with something, mister?

831
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:49,349
Yes, as a matter of fact, you can.

832
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:54,255
You see, l need to get this crate
into that van ASAP.

833
01:16:54,691 --> 01:16:58,252
-And you are?
-l work for the museum.

834
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:02,688
l'm a security guard. Some items got sent off
when they shouldn't have,

835
01:17:02,766 --> 01:17:06,429
-and they sent me to work it out.
-Do you have paperwork?

836
01:17:08,872 --> 01:17:11,033
Nobody said anything about paperwork.

837
01:17:11,108 --> 01:17:14,737
Well, then, you don't get no crate.
That's how that works.

838
01:17:17,381 --> 01:17:20,009
You see, maybe we can talk about this.

839
01:17:20,384 --> 01:17:23,319
Because l've been sent to pick up this crate.

840
01:17:24,054 --> 01:17:27,888
l had a cat when l was a little girl.
A white cat.

841
01:17:29,893 --> 01:17:31,758
Her name was Snuggles.

842
01:17:34,798 --> 01:17:37,460
Well, this is Renoir.

843
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:41,197
Like the painter.

844
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:48,671
-Roger loves paintings.
-l know.

845
01:17:51,515 --> 01:17:53,278
This is ridiculous.

846
01:18:04,328 --> 01:18:05,556
Roger!

847
01:18:06,196 --> 01:18:09,529
Roger! Roger! What are you doing up here?

848
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,829
What are you doing?
l told you to wait in the van!

849
01:18:15,072 --> 01:18:19,133
lt is 10:20! We need to go right now!

850
01:18:19,243 --> 01:18:20,267
-Excuse me, miss...
-We're going, we're going.

851
01:18:20,344 --> 01:18:21,936
We need to go. Where's your friend George?

852
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:23,707
You said you were coming up here
to get your friend George.

853
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,804
Are you George?

854
01:18:24,882 --> 01:18:27,009
-Who is George?
-Sir, please.

855
01:18:27,317 --> 01:18:29,842
Rose, l've got things under control.

856
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,614
-Give me one more minute, l promise you.
-Roger,

857
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:36,216
l love surprises, l do. l'm very touched.
But we need to...

858
01:18:36,293 --> 01:18:38,158
l can't leave here without this crate!

859
01:18:38,228 --> 01:18:40,355
Listen, buddy, l already told you,
you're not getting the crate...

860
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:41,454
One second, please.

861
01:18:41,532 --> 01:18:44,467
Rose, l know how much this trip
means to you,

862
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:48,594
and l know l've been acting crazy lately,
but it's all going to end soon.

863
01:18:48,672 --> 01:18:53,507
We're gonna make that plane. l just
need you to please, please, wait in the van.

864
01:18:55,045 --> 01:18:56,205
Roger.

865
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,209
We're going to Florida.
We're gonna make that plane.

866
01:19:08,258 --> 01:19:10,852
Here's the deal. That's my wife, Rose.

867
01:19:10,928 --> 01:19:14,193
ln less than 20 minutes, l promised her
we'd be on a plane to Florida.

868
01:19:14,264 --> 01:19:16,755
lt's our anniversary.
lt'll break her heart if we don't go,

869
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:20,633
but l cannot leave here
until l get this crate into that van.

870
01:19:21,138 --> 01:19:23,231
Are you a married man, Leo?

871
01:19:25,008 --> 01:19:27,943
Then you know what l'm talking about.
Give me a break.

872
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:32,277
l really do work for the museum.
That's my wife. That's my crazy wife.

873
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:33,781
What a guy!

874
01:19:36,086 --> 01:19:39,783
Why are we turning off here? We need to go
to Departures! ls this a shortcut, Roger?

875
01:19:39,856 --> 01:19:41,881
-Yeah. We'll try. We'll try.
-We are never going to make it.

876
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:43,221
We are gonna have to go all the way.

877
01:19:43,293 --> 01:19:45,727
-Pull over here. Right over here.
-No, no, don't stop!

878
01:19:45,796 --> 01:19:47,855
-Pull over.
-Roger, why are we stopping?

879
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:49,762
-Hang on, George!
-What are we doing?

880
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:51,562
You're almost free.

881
01:19:52,869 --> 01:19:54,461
Hang on, George!

882
01:19:54,871 --> 01:19:58,602
-What are you doing?
-l'm free at last! l'm free!

883
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:03,539
Why are you naked?

884
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:10,582
-Hi.
-Roger, is this the surprise?

885
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:15,717
-Turn away! That's my wife.
-This is our friend George.

886
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,854
-You must be Rose.
-Put your pants on!

887
01:20:17,928 --> 01:20:20,021
-Are we going to Florida?
-Guys!

888
01:20:20,097 --> 01:20:23,066
We did it! We did it!
l cannot believe we did it!

889
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:25,533
Yes! We did it!

890
01:20:25,902 --> 01:20:27,233
We did it!

891
01:20:27,537 --> 01:20:30,665
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to sunny Miami, Florida,</i>

892
01:20:30,741 --> 01:20:33,642
<i>where the local temperature is 86 degrees</i>

893
01:20:33,844 --> 01:20:35,712
<i>Please be careful when opening</i>
<i>your overhead compartments</i>

894
01:20:53,964 --> 01:20:55,124
Roger?

895
01:20:58,201 --> 01:20:59,361
Roger?

896
01:21:03,273 --> 01:21:04,433
Roger?

897
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:07,868
Roger?

898
01:21:12,883 --> 01:21:14,043
Roger.

899
01:22:06,803 --> 01:22:10,170
Just a minute. Stay there.

900
01:22:17,614 --> 01:22:19,343
Stay right... What?

901
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:22,114
Are you feeling okay?

902
01:22:25,322 --> 01:22:27,313
