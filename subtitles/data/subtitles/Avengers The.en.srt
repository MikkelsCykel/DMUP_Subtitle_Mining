1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,213
Extraordinary.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,413
To have that impact,
he must have weighed 10 tons.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,616
Or be travelling 100 miles an hour.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,858
-Roller skates?
-I don't think he was wearing any.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,617
Maybe he was practicing his ski jump.
Launched himself over there...

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,453
-...flewthrough the air...
-Forgot to apply his brakes.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,011
No explanation at all.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,296
Whatever it was, it was very nasty.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:32,415
.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,978
I'm Cynthia Wentworth-Howe,
top-hush secretary.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,972
-How do you do?
-Top-hush?

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,978
assistants come in four grades.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,574
Confiidential,
secret, most-secret and top-hush.

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,816
You've reached the top of your profession.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,095
Not quite.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,009
My ambition is to achieve
the special category of button-lip.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,613
The pinnacle of secrecy.

18
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,534
Not a syllable passed on before being
vetted, examined, coded, and cleared.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,859
But to business.
I must assist you in any way I can.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,933
Good.
Let's start with the man who got plastered.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,175
We assistants don't approve of levity.

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,696
The gentleman in question
was Dr. Charles Grey.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,050
a.D, mem. of Royal Institution, C.B.E.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,170
R.I.P.

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,696
Dr. Charles Grey was a brilliant
and respected scientist.

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,215
In electronic development for the Ministry.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,489
His work was specialised...

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,133
...and of a highly secret nature.

29
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,215
Electric fans?

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,936
Pardon?

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,058
This diagram is of an electric fan.

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,978
Specialised and highly secret?

33
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,253
We better look in the safe.

34
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,051
What?

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,610
Dr. Grey's safe.
We'd like to look at his papers.

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,335
-His secret papers?
-You have the right idea.

37
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,059
You'll have to sign a chit.

38
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,609
In triplicate.

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,051
The three-headed bureaucrat.

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,650
Grey wasn't killed for the plans
of a fiiendishly new electric fan.

41
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,810
Still warm.

42
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,892
Be warned, if you take any papers...

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,295
...there'll be a dispensation from security.

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,853
No need to bother.

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,538
That's a neat trick.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,898
Burn the inside of a safe...

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,496
...while it's locked on the outside.

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,769
What were the papers?

49
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,091
I suppose they were the details
of Project 90.

50
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,459
-Pardon?
-Project 90.

51
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,579
Sounds more interesting.

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,539
I've no idea what it was.
It was abandoned months ago.

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,855
They overspent their budget
with no results.

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,210
-They?
-This was the team.

55
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,173
They were based
at Risely Dale Research Centre.

56
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,339
It's been closed down, too.
You recognise Dr. Grey, of course.

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,893
That's Dr. Creswell, Mr. Mankin,
Mr. Jubert, and poor Mr. Bryant.

58
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,737
He fell out of a window last week.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,733
-Badly hurt?
-Mortally. The twelfth floor.

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,373
That leaves Mankin, Creswell, and Jubert.
That has a fiine Gallic ring to it.

61
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,172
and your French is impeccable.

62
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,809
au revoir.

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,292
Don't forget to return the key.

64
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,139
Mr. Jubert.

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,133
You missed lunch again.

66
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,259
You should eat something.

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,253
Call the generator room.

68
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,173
Tell them there's something wrong
with their power supply.

69
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,012
Did you get the generator room?

70
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,289
Miss Clarke?

71
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,253
-What happened?
-I was hoping you could tell me.

72
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,449
I'm not sure.

73
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,569
I came out to use the phone and...

74
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,974
...there was someone here.

75
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,259
a man, I think.
and a sound.

76
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,528
-a strange sort of sound.
-Strange. How?

77
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,969
What kind of sound?

78
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,050
It was... Weird.

79
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,615
Like that.

80
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:28,568
.

81
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,014
You don't happen to be carrying
a large brandy, do you?

82
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,809
I'm travelling light. What happened?
You all right?

83
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,529
It happened like...

84
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,858
I haven't the faintest idea.

85
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,291
It was something to do with a door.
No, doors that bite back.

86
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,258
It was a car door.

87
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,491
It was around here.
a blue van.

88
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,495
and it bit you.

89
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,217
I went to open the rear door...

90
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,896
...and then bingo, a galaxy of stars.
Then oblivion.

91
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,011
You think someone came up behind you?

92
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,573
I'm sure they didn't.

93
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,608
I remember there was a very odd noise.

94
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,012
-What kind of noise?
-Very odd. It's hard to describe.

95
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,539
-Like that?
-Yes, like that.

96
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,895
Maurice Jubert's secretary heard it, too.
The late Maurice Jubert.

97
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,295
He's dead.

98
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,532
It seems we're on the right track.

99
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,973
That's about all.

100
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,095
Could it have been a woman,
whoever attacked you?

101
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,850
Make-up.

102
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,858
Odd, greasy sort of make-up.

103
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,410
We're dealing with a slippery customer.

104
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,216
Dr. Creswell.
Very nice to see you.

105
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,817
This is the gentleman I came to see.

106
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,417
allow me. My name is Steed.

107
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,212
The Ministry told you we were coming.

108
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,899
That's right.

109
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,258
But I wasn't expecting...

110
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,056
Mrs. Peel is at times a bit impetuous.

111
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,936
Do you always greet visitors at gunpoint?

112
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,653
Good heavens, no.

113
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,374
I was out shooting rabbits and I didn't...

114
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,134
Please, don't apologise.
Very glad to contact you.

115
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,012
You were in charge of Project 90.

116
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,129
-absorbing project.
-You mean you know about it?

117
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,895
-Couldn't understand why it was cancelled.
-You have friends at the Ministry.

118
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,973
Does that mean that the project
is going to be reopened?

119
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,413
Not here. Let's discuss it later.
at your home? You live near, I believe?

120
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,493
-about a quarter...
-How about a cup of tea?

121
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,695
Maybe even a drink?

122
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,452
-I suppose so.
-Good man.

123
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,570
Mrs. Peel will join us later.
She wants to have a thorough look around.

124
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,451
This is a pleasant spot. and very
conveniently close to the research centre.

125
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,690
I didn't think
there was much point in moving.

126
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,931
I must say that retirement doesn't have
any of the terrors that I expected.

127
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,379
Why did you retire early?

128
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,252
I didn't have a choice, did I?

129
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,657
-Project 90 getting the chop.
-More or less.

130
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,173
-Naturally I disagreed with the decision.
-Naturally.

131
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,459
We could do with a few breakthroughs
in that fiield.

132
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,369
Exactly. High-frequency electronics
has tremendous potential.

133
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,249
-Sherry?
-High-frequency electronics?

134
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,338
-The americans poured millions into it.
-Of course they have.

135
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,093
We were well-established.

136
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,412
We were developing ultrahigh frequencies
when the team went dotty.

137
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,411
-Dotty?
-Broadcast power.

138
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,896
-Broadcast power.
-I was against the idea from the start.

139
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,935
It just isn't feasible
Broadcasting electricity by radio wave?

140
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,933
But you were the director.

141
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,698
at fiirst it seemed harmless enough.
You know, simple bench tests.

142
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,211
Before I knew it, they built generators.

143
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,012
Used funds allocated for other work.

144
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,770
-Everything got out of hand.
-Then the Ministry closed you down?

145
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,530
Years of work,
thrown away on a senseless pipe dream.

146
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,697
The project ruined by one man.

147
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,495
One man?

148
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,130
The fool who started us on broadcast
power. James Mankin.

149
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:58,298
.

150
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,975
Remarkable.

151
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,055
astonishing.

152
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,048
Some kind of natural phenomenon.

153
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,929
Natural?

154
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,568
a fiireball.

155
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,531
a cloud of static electricity.

156
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,696
-Some sort of freak phenomenon.
-It could be possible.

157
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,772
I won't detain you any longer.

158
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,131
Thank you very much for the drink.
Don't worry, I'll fiind my way out.

159
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,218
-Find anything?
-I heard something a moment ago.

160
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,577
-a sort of crackling sound.
-You should've seen the fiireworks.

161
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,254
-I'll tell you later.
-Look. Just there.

162
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,098
-a hand print.
-Preserved in make-up.

163
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,615
When do you think you'll get
your fiirst bite?

164
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,617
Never, if you keep on talking.

165
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,734
Terribly sorry.
I forgot you are a top-hush girl.

166
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,733
Do you know,
it's quite surprising to fiind you doing this?

167
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,769
It's nice to get away from people
once in a while.

168
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,490
I'm not people, I'm Ministry business.

169
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,055
My day off.

170
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,292
-May I make a suggestion?
-What?

171
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,091
I would say a flaming Kestrel fly
for these waters.

172
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,694
I prefer a red Coachman .

173
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,416
-You're a fiishing man then?
-at least a stretch on the test.

174
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,055
I caught a 10-pound salmon last week.

175
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,892
-Really? Where?
-Bond street.

176
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,650
I was walking by a hotel,
it fell from a window into my arms.

177
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,169
Was in contretemps with his chef,
a volatile fellow.

178
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,854
But he had no aim with a salmon.

179
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,457
Of course, I threw it back.
It wouldn't be sporting to keep it.

180
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,855
Suits you.
It's very good for the face muscles.

181
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,938
You might as well laugh
as much as you can before it happens.

182
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,172
-Before what happens?
-Before you get elevated to button-lip.

183
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,376
You can hardly laugh in button-lip.

184
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,659
What can I do for you?

185
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,090
Project 90. I'd like to see the fiiles.

186
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,931
Ministry fiiles? That's utterly impossible.
No one sees them.

187
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,728
Only red card holders.

188
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,739
I'm sorry. It's out of the question.
Card holders only.

189
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,017
a red card, that's about as rare
as a salmon in Bond street.

190
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,695
I'd no idea.

191
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,500
all the confiidential war records
are kept here.

192
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,731
Have there been many confiidential wars?

193
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,532
Cleaning must be a bit of a problem.

194
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,530
No cleaners with red cards?

195
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,569
I couldn't see the Prime Minister whisking
around here with a feather mop.

196
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,733
Or maybe I could.

197
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,172
Voices aren't raised here.

198
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,939
This is the one you need. Project 90.

199
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,410
You seem to have pyromaniac mice.

200
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,779
There will be a terrible fuss.
a full inquiry.

201
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,695
Play havoc with your fiishing.
How do I fiind out about Project 90?

202
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,529
The only person who can help you now
is James Mankin.

203
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,813
Mr. Mankin is busy.
Do you have an appointment?

204
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,291
No, but I'm sure he'll see me.
John Steed, from the Ministry.

205
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,449
One moment.

206
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,855
What is it?

207
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,935
Mr. Steed is here to see you.
He says he's from the Ministry.

208
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,579
Send him in. I'll see him.

209
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,458
-Go through, please.
-Thank you.

210
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,168
Kind of you to see me.

211
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,259
-I'm very busy. You did say the Ministry?
-about Project 90.

212
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,332
and broadcast power.
Is it possible?

213
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,013
Your Ministry doesn't think so.

214
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,699
But you do.

215
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,414
I spent years proving it.
all it got me was the sack.

216
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,693
-Dr. Creswell thinks it wasn't fully proved.
-Dr. Creswell doesn't think.

217
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,620
Why are you so sure
about broadcast power?

218
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,413
Why are you so interested?

219
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,017
Because someone has been trying
to destroy all trace of Project 90.

220
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,209
and those who worked on it.

221
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,498
I heard about Bryant and Grey.
accidents, they said.

222
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,932
No accidents.
Yesterday Maurice Jubert was murdered.

223
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,215
Well?

224
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,613
You seem to be taking it calmly.

225
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,010
I'm busy and I don't believe a word.

226
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,376
I can assure you they were not accidents.

227
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,733
I don't doubt it.
But not because of Project 90.

228
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,050
The applications of broadcast power
are quite ordinary.

229
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,815
There was no motive for murder
in the work we did.

230
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,579
You could be mistaken.

231
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,379
Very well, I'll show you.

232
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,337
as simply as possible.

233
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,857
This device here produces static electricity.

234
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,535
a development of a Windshurst machine?

235
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,692
That makes things easier.

236
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,735
The electrostatic energy is converted
to a high-frequency wave here.

237
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,971
Fed into this transmitter.

238
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,780
and just about ready.

239
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,012
You see this electric fan?
No wires, no hidden batteries, but...

240
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,130
Observe.

241
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,493
No power source other than the energy
I'm broadcasting.

242
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,254
That's very strange.

243
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,340
Dr. Grey was designing a fan
when he was murdered?

244
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,814
Doesn't mean a thing. This is the
equipment we used on the project.

245
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,291
Hardly the ultimate weapon.

246
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,773
-What if the...
-Do be careful.

247
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,898
What if the range in power were unlimited?

248
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,053
and it could be unlimited.

249
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,130
If we'd been given time to develop it
you could power anything.

250
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,177
Cars, aircraft, entire cities.

251
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,094
Creswell never believed in it.
Treated it like a toy.

252
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,054
But he surely gave
the authorisation for the research?

253
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,976
Forced us into a demonstration
we were against.

254
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,097
You failed?

255
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,051
I knew we'd fail.
We weren't ready.

256
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,698
at least Creswell got the sack
along with the rest of us.

257
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,975
What are you doing here?
Still developing broadcast power?

258
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,255
Wish I was.
This is a commercial outfiit.

259
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,935
I spend most of my time tarting up
stereophonic sound and radar.

260
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,335
Whenever I get the chance,
I'll return to this.

261
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,339
I should be careful.

262
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,329
I have a feeling someone has another use
for broadcast power.

263
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,328
Know anyone who wants to buy
a vintage Bentley...

264
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,419
...in the newtwo-tone
shade of green and slightly singed?

265
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,449
I have survived an electrifying
experience and I'll swap the details...

266
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,099
For a large brandy?

267
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,214
I was driving along,
minding my own business.

268
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,335
Enjoying and breathing
the good country air.

269
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,173
Contemplating the glories
of England in summertime.

270
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,975
-You were driving along.
-When I noticed a van following me.

271
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,853
One with handles that fiight back?

272
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,934
Right,
and as soon as I recognised the fact...

273
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,258
all my car's wiring burnt out.
The car was full of smoke, I was blinded.

274
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,976
There was a gatepost rushing toward me.
With tremendous verve and élan...

275
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,172
-I may say, great driving skills...
-and a good deal of luck.

276
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,094
It was a very near thing.
The car is still working.

277
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,934
But all my little dials are kaput.
Even the altimeter.

278
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,658
If one day you happen to be driving
at 10,000 feet, I'm sure you'll notice.

279
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,055
What do you think did it?

280
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,219
Broadcast power.

281
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,052
Sending electricity
just as you would a radio message.

282
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,569
Mankin was working on that.

283
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,778
-You saw him?
-I saw Mankin.

284
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,092
I gave him something to think about.

285
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,011
He's here.
It's for you.

286
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,535
What you were saying started me thinking.

287
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,532
I decided to go to Risely Dale.

288
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,168
You've been there?

289
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,694
I'm there now.

290
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,857
I think you're right.
Something is going on.

291
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,573
Hold on.

292
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,933
Mankin's at Risely Dale.

293
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,170
-He's onto something.
-Or up to something.

294
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,928
-Do you want to meet him?
-I'll see you at Creswell's.

295
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,371
Mrs. Peel is on her way now.

296
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,538
Right. I'll be waiting.

297
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:58,529
.

298
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,173
Not disturbing you, I hope.

299
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,172
Thought you'd be free at this time.

300
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,014
-I'm very busy.
-Forgive the unconventional entrance.

301
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,058
Basic training. Old habits die hard.
You mind?

302
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,058
I don't wish to be rude.

303
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,695
But I was studying this circuit diagram
and I wish to get on with it.

304
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,016
I thought you were pacing before I came in.

305
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,133
Looked like you were waiting for someone,
not possible...

306
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,370
...if you were engrossed in the diagram.

307
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,659
-I was thinking.
-Go ahead. I'll be quiet as a mouse.

308
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,011
You're extremely edgy.
You've been working too hard.

309
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,853
Why not some of this excellent sherry?
It is excellent.

310
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,809
What do you want?

311
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,255
Information.

312
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,251
Mankin seems to feel
that you are sabotaging Project 90.

313
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,898
Sure you're not waiting for someone?

314
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,488
It's ridiculous.

315
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,890
-What is?
-Mankin's suggestion.

316
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,695
Why should l, or anybody,
wish to sabotage Project 90?

317
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,936
Broadcast electricity.

318
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,849
I thought the Ministry
abandoned that little pipe...

319
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,488
Perhaps, the Ministry have
but someone else is pursuing it.

320
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,259
It would make a neat secret weapon,
if it were possible.

321
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,575
-lf.
-That's what I said, if.

322
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,933
Hayworth.

323
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,617
This is an unexpected pleasure.

324
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,139
I didn't expect to see you.

325
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,412
This is Mr. Steed from the Ministry.

326
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,334
-This is Peter Hayworth.
-Delighted.

327
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,530
Forgive me.
Sprained a tendon playing bridge.

328
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,532
You play a rough game.

329
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,816
I expect you called for those papers.

330
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,779
Here we are.
We won't keep you then.

331
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,458
Don't go now. You just arrived.
Dr. Creswell's the host...

332
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,055
...but I'm doing the honours.
He's a tad off-colour.

333
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,099
You're an electronic expert, too.
Those papers, very complex to the laymen.

334
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,809
He does occasionally assist me.

335
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,893
So you've worked together before.
Project 90?

336
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,579
That must be Mrs. Peel.

337
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,618
Told her to meet me.
She may have news from Risely Dale.

338
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,217
-I thought I told you to kill her.
-I thought I had.

339
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,375
-How did it go at Risely Dale?
-False alarm.

340
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,652
I'm sorry, we haven't met.

341
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,179
May I introduce Peter Hayworth,
you know Dr. Creswell.

342
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,853
Hadn't we better get going?
We'll be late for dinner.

343
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,689
What dinner?

344
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,773
Thank you for jogging my memory.
I think we'd better say goodbye.

345
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,897
-Goodbye.
-allow me.

346
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,058
-I am sorry.
-My pleasure.

347
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,813
I don't fall for strangers.

348
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,255
What was that about?

349
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,094
You didn't trip.
We don't have a dinner.

350
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,939
and to plumb the depths
of utter banality with:

351
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,494
"I don't fall for strangers."

352
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,380
It was a corny situation
calling for corny measures.

353
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,132
Wanted to get my hand on his collar.

354
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,736
Didn't you see?
It was thick with make-up.

355
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,291
Odd, greasy sort of make-up.

356
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,971
This is enough to put under a microscope.

357
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,615
Good girl.

358
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,579
-and Mankin?
-Dead, I'm afraid. Electrocuted.

359
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,295
So would I be
if I didn't have rubber-soled shoes.

360
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,492
and the kick on the shin?

361
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,895
That?

362
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,568
I just felt like that.

363
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,617
are you sure you took care of Mankin?

364
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,493
Gave him a nasty shock.

365
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,572
So, they've all gone then.

366
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,329
Mankin, Grey, Bryant, Jubert.

367
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,971
all their fiiles are destroyed.

368
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,453
-all the dangers are eliminated.
-Except for Steed and Mrs. Peel.

369
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,217
They can only guess what happened.
They don't know how it was done.

370
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,130
I think it's about time we showed them.

371
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,458
I know it's late.

372
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,254
I've been slaving over a hot Bunsen burner.

373
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,420
I've been doing tests
on that sample of make-up.

374
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,175
It contains particles of aluminium.

375
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,898
There are also traces
of a nonconducting oil.

376
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,296
It doesn't conduct electricity.

377
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,378
It acts as a sort of insulation.

378
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,213
It's perfectly logical, an ordinary make-up
insulates a girl from lots of things.

379
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,936
Not those sort of things.

380
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,655
against the wind and the weather,
for example.

381
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,899
Why not a make-up that insulates
the wearer against high voltage?

382
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,377
all right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

383
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,450
I want you in my arms again.

384
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,530
Good morning.
I trust you slept well.

385
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,257
as well as can be expected.
What time's breakfast?

386
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,810
I would've rung but I'm all tied up.

387
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,652
and you'll stay that way.

388
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,210
It's you.
My shocking friend.

389
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,130
I hate to tell you
but you're losing your power.

390
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,259
Quite deliberate.
We didn't want to kill you.

391
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,535
Yet.

392
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,778
-I'm sure you have a very good reason.
-Certainly.

393
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,934
I imagine you know where you are.

394
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,568
I'm at Risely Dale.

395
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,774
That's obvious.

396
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,176
Then there's a question of Steed.

397
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,099
That's all we want.

398
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,619
That's why we had to keep you alive.

399
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,254
To get Steed to come here.

400
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,849
I'm the bait.

401
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,613
Two for the price of one.

402
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,414
He'll know its a trap.

403
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,011
Not if you call him.
and you will call him.

404
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,659
When I've edited our little conversation.

405
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,250
- I imagine you know where you are.
-I'm at Risely Dale.

406
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,209
Forgive me.

407
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,490
Mrs. Peel, good morning.
How are you?

408
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,608
Mrs. Peel, you all right?

409
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,295
Where are you?

410
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,333
I'm at Risely Dale.

411
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,851
He'll be here in about 30 minutes.

412
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,018
-Perhaps.
-He'll come.

413
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,460
He may have his suspicions
but that won't matter.

414
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,332
He won't suspect you.

415
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,293
You are going to kill him.

416
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:08,537
.

417
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,373
Spare my blushes.

418
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,856
You are looking at a superman.

419
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,620
You're wrong.
His pectorals are far from perfect.

420
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,374
He's a prototype.
The fiirst of many.

421
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,577
His power is unlimited.

422
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,569
Balls. His power is limited
by what your little blue van out there...

423
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,971
...your mobile generator is capable
of giving out.

424
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,570
Say about 10,000 volts.

425
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,572
Much more than that.

426
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,455
We take the power from a small engine.
We build it up, transform it.

427
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,895
Pushing it up...

428
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,255
Until he becomes a walking dynamo.

429
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,613
The technique is so simple.
First he's sprayed with a...

430
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,213
a nonconductive oil.

431
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,215
It acts as an insulation,
a sort of protection.

432
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,778
Then comes the substance containing...

433
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,813
...aluminium particles, a sort of outer skin.

434
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,934
-You said that you'd destroyed all the fiiles.
-I did.

435
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,336
It was an educated guess.

436
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,498
Plus a little research.

437
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,018
What a great pity.

438
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,014
That brilliant mind won't be with us
much longer.

439
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,173
I must test the generator.

440
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,018
a walking dynamo.

441
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,051
My pectorals may leave much
to be desired.

442
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,498
But I'm the most dynamic man...

443
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,412
...you are ever likely to meet.

444
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,179
Hear that? Power.

445
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,968
Broadcast power.

446
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,258
a life force flowing into me.
Fed by radio waves.

447
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,732
Making me the most powerful man
on Earth. a king. Omnipotent.

448
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,451
Careful you don't blow a fuse.

449
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,929
My protection is guaranteed.
See, you were right.

450
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,337
The inner skin protects me.
The nonconductive oil.

451
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,291
The aluminium particles
carry the electric charge.

452
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,250
Very good.
Top marks.

453
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,489
The power ripples across
my skin like muscles.

454
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,736
at least 25,000 volts of it.
I can kill, burn, destroy.

455
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,495
a superman.

456
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,296
In a few months time,
there will be a hundred like him.

457
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,019
For what purpose?

458
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,929
You might call it a takeover bid.

459
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,169
Society owes me many things.

460
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,018
When my army of supermen moves in
on society, I shall dictate the terms then.

461
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,933
I will bring the government to its knees.
I will become the government.

462
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,455
I will rule.

463
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,857
What happens if there's a power cut?

464
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:54,289
The table is completely insulated.

465
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,575
Soon,
you will be charged with 25,000 volts.

466
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,858
Then whoever touches you will earth you.

467
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,858
The shock will kill you
and whoever touches you.

468
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,130
I'm sure Mr. Steed will want to free you.

469
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,100
It's elaborate,
but it's the nature of an experiment.

470
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,650
a technique that we have been wanting
to try for a very long time.

471
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,175
He's coming.

472
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,174
I'd recognise those eyes anywhere.

473
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,652
I knew you had sterling qualities,
but bright silver.

474
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,459
Where are your hole marks?

475
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,811
Don't worry. Have you out in a jiffy.
Time for pleasantries later.

476
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,256
You realise I happen to be charged
with 25,000 volts?

477
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,496
I attribute that
to your personal magnetism.

478
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,300
-Listen to that generator.
-It's lucky I'm not earthed.

479
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,129
I happen to be wearing rubber galoshes.
The English gentleman's best friend.

480
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,413
Guaranteed to protect
against the vagaries of our climate...

481
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,049
...and also 25,000 volts.

482
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,219
There's something wrong.

483
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,937
She's still holding the charge.

484
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,892
It's up to me then.

485
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,139
Creswell's a complete megalomaniac.
He's planning to take over the country.

486
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,208
Then we've got to stop him.
How does that fiit?

487
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,570
Not exactly snug, but adequate.

488
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,536
Now.

489
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,176
You ruined his make-up.

490
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,053
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

491
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,529
I've been messing with all this electricity.

492
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,853
I don't know how, but I'm magnetised.

493
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,968
I'm stuck to the car.

494
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,455
It's no laughing matter. How am I to call
the garage and tell them I'm stuck to my...

495
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,731
How am I to call a garage?

496
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,220
Look, this is most indelicate of you.

497
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,812
Let me see.
How can I be constructive?

498
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,576
What are you, aC or DC?

499
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,930
I've never had occasion to fiind out.

500
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,414
Here, let me give you a hand.

501
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,811
Don't fiight it.
We're inseparable.
