1
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,582
Welcome to bonnie Scotland.

2
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,207
It is the year of Our Lord 1828.

3
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,832
And this is where I work,

4
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,749
the market square in Edinburgh,
our capital city.

5
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,582
They're calling this
the Scottish Enlightenment.

6
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,207
Enlightenment?

7
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,499
You could have fooled me.

8
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:37,207
I mean,
look at the state of them.

9
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:40,332
The only people round here
looking to be enlightened

10
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,790
are the medical students.

11
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,249
They come to study
at the feet of our famous doctors.

12
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,165
Edinburgh is the medical capital
of the world.

13
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,790
Get yourselves
an education there, lads.

14
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:55,415
On one side of the city,
you have Barclay's School of Anatomy,

15
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,749
And that's run by the esteemed surgeon
Doctor Robert Knox.

16
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:04,249
Now some say that he's the finest
surgeon in all of Scotland.

17
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,582
All I can say about Doctor Knox
is that he dresses well.

18
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,624
Quite the dandy.

19
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:15,249
Ah, there's nothing like starting off
a new term with a fresh corpse.

20
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,249
- Is there, Patterson?
- Indeed, sir.

21
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,707
Today I think I shall commence
by removing the top of the cranium.

22
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,499
It will certainly give the freshmen
something to write home about.

23
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:28,249
And on the other side of the city...

24
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,207
you've got Scotland's
Royal College of Surgeons.

25
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,707
And that's run
by Professor Alexander Monro.

26
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,749
He's...

27
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,957
how do you put it?
Old-school.

28
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,332
That would be an artery.

29
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,749
Anyway, you'll have to excuse me
for a wee moment, ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,749
It's... showtime.

31
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:29,582
Maggie O'Donnell of the West Port,
also known as Mad Maggie.

32
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,874
You are convicted of the heinous crimes
of thievery,

33
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:40,124
prostitution, public drunkenness,
and a bad attitude.

34
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,624
Do you have anything to say
before you are consigned to hell?

35
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,749
Aye!

36
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:49,957
Only that I hope it's as hot down
there as they say it is!

37
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:06,874
You see, you can only teach anatomy
by cutting up people's bodies.

38
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,207
And the law of the land says
you can only cut up bodies

39
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:13,082
of people like Mad Maggie here,
the recently deceased.

40
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,332
So we sell them
to the highest bidder.

41
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:27,624
But now, Professor Monro,
the swine,

42
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,957
has used his influence
to pass a new city bylaw.

43
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,332
Where's the body, Angus?

44
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,415
But we had an arrangement.

45
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,290
Professor Monro at the Royal College
gets all the bodies now.

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,749
Now when the demand for
a certain commodity exceeds supply,

47
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,499
it creates a business opportunity

48
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,874
just waiting for the right kind
of clever entrepreneurs to step in.

49
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:06,332
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round!
Gather round!

50
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,999
My name is William Burke.

51
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,374
Like many of you,
my colleague Mr. Hare and I

52
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,207
came to this land looking for work.

53
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,999
We've dug canals, we've built roads,
we've started a new life.

54
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,165
But none of us has forgotten that
Emerald Isle from which we came.

55
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,040
That mystical land where a man...

56
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,332
- Get to the bloody point, Willy.
- Right, sorry.

57
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,915
In the County of Donegal,
on the highest, greenest slopes,

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,499
there grows a certain moss
which any educated person will tell you

59
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,374
cures all known afflictions.

60
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,540
The smallest cut,
ladies and gentlemen,

61
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,665
can let in poisons from the earth
and the air,

62
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,957
and before you know it,
your very brain starts to boil.

63
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,457
But a touch of the moss from the hills
of Donegal, ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,957
and it's gone in a flash.

65
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,207
A boil appears.
You pay it no mind.

66
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,582
But suddenly there's a second!
And a third!

67
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,582
And before you know it,
the sufferings of Job are upon you!

68
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:02,249
A wart, madam.
Starts off small, doesn't it?

69
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:07,040
But without a touch of the moss,
it can grow as big as your head!

70
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,457
This is never moss.

71
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,957
It's cheese mould.

72
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,624
They're a pair of confidence men!

73
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,790
You bastards!

74
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,707
Fetch a constable!

75
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,915
Gentlemen!

76
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:53,415
Gentlemen, the Lord created
the heavens and the earth.

77
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,957
But His greatest work,
His most perfect creation is Man.

78
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:04,249
The study of human anatomy,
therefore,

79
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:10,957
is nothing less than a direct insight
into the mind of God.

80
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,249
Gentlemen...

81
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:24,374
I give you the human form...

82
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,124
in all its glory.

83
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,332
Jesus Christ!

84
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,457
I've a very,
very good explanation, sir.

85
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,624
Well, Patterson?

86
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,957
Let's hear this very,
very good explanation.

87
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,624
Not content with butchering
his own patients,

88
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,082
Monro has now taken
to using political influence

89
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,540
to hinder the advancement
of medical science.

90
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,040
Beggars can't be choosers, sir.

91
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,749
I had to take the only one that
Resurrectionist McTavish had left.

92
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,665
That's the third rotter I've had
from McTavish and his gang

93
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,540
of grave robbers
in the last three weeks.

94
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,040
I can't go on like this.

95
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,540
Is there anything I can do,
doctor?

96
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:18,832
You could start praying, Patterson,
for the one thing that could save us.

97
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,165
And what's that, sir?

98
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,082
An enormous and awful calamity
right here in Edinburgh.

99
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:27,624
An accident or a...
or a natural disaster.

100
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:32,915
Something which generates the large
numbers of cadavers I need for my work.

101
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,540
Wouldn't that be nice, sir?

102
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,999
Yes, Patterson.

103
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,874
It would be nice.

104
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,874
You told your wife
you was gonna get a job.

105
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,999
You lied.

106
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,874
An economy with the truth, Willy,
isn't the same as a flat-out lie.

107
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,332
And you think Lucky's
gonna grasp that distinction?

108
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,082
She's not exactly
a forgiving woman.

109
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,040
I'll not hear a bad word
said against her.

110
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,165
All right.

111
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,165
I'll grant you she's had her problems
with the bottle,

112
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,415
but she's fighting her demons.

113
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,249
Besides she's bound to be
in high spirits.

114
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,332
- It's rent day for Old Donald.
- Ah!

115
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,290
Ah, ya see?

116
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,499
Within every cloud,
there's a silver lining.

117
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,374
Where's the money you owe us,
Mr. Hare?!

118
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,790
I know this looks bad, love,
but there's a good explanation.

119
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:34,665
You see, Willy here came up
with this fantastic new product.

120
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,790
- Donegal moss.
- It started off a roaring success.

121
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:40,624
Aye, for a while it looked as though
all our troubles were over.

122
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,332
Jesus, what's that smell?

123
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,290
Er, it was an accident.

124
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,957
You're a lazy good-for-nothing,
William Hare.

125
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,124
We're flat-out broke.

126
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,665
What about Old Donald's rent money?

127
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,624
He's dead.

128
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,249
- Dead.
- Dead!

129
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,749
What do you mean "dead"?

130
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,749
I mean deceased.
He stopped living and died.

131
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,915
So he didn't pay his rent, then?

132
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,790
Are you telling us Old Donald
is dead?

133
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,957
As a doornail.

134
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:20,999
So my suggestion is that you sort
yourselves out

135
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,499
and get rid of the body
before it starts to stink up the place

136
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,540
more than you two.

137
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,457
How are we supposed to do that?

138
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,040
Use your imagination, William.

139
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,665
It's about all you're good for
these days.

140
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,457
That's not working.

141
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,207
- Right, now push his right leg down.
- It won't go!

142
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,290
- Gonna have to break his back.
- What?!

143
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,332
Well, it's either that,
or we chop his legs off.

144
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,249
I know a building site in the New Town.

145
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,790
We can dump him there.
No problem at all.

146
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:58,082
- Don't know about this, William.
- It'll be a piece of cake.

147
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,165
- It's only another mile or so.
- Only another mile or so?

148
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,124
Let's stop over there, William.
This is thirsty work.

149
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,207
Right, get it up.

150
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,874
Watch your language,
you fuckin' son-of-a-bitch bastard!

151
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,790
What are we gonna do, William?
There's no more canals to dig.

152
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,415
Don't you worry, Willy.
I have got all kinds of ideas.

153
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,999
Aye, but no money to speak of.
No plan.

154
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,957
Just enough money
for one last dram.

155
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,165
I'll drink to that.

156
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,040
- Couple of large ones, Eileen.
- Right away.

157
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,499
Willy!
How's business?

158
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,874
Never better, Fergus.

159
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,790
What about you?

160
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,540
Diversifying is what we're doing.

161
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:21,207
Mr. McTavish has moved into gambling,
opium distribution and...

162
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,207
pimping whores.

163
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,207
We've gone legitimate.

164
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,832
So no more digging up graves,
then?

165
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,040
Eh, it's nae worth
the bother anymore.

166
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,165
Wee Tam McLintoch
and his militia,

167
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,957
they've declared a war
on grave robbery.

168
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,915
They're patrolling the graveyards
every night.

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,749
It's a shame, really.

170
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:51,582
We used to sell to Doctor Knox
at 3 pounds a cadaver.

171
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:56,790
And these days,
he'd be happy to pay double that.

172
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,499
And I thought life round here
was supposed to be cheap?

173
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,874
It is.

174
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,499
But the price rockets
once you're dead.

175
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,290
Willy...

176
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,040
So, this doctor is gonna give us money
to cut Old Donald up?

177
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,665
Old Donald is in heaven.
These are just his mortal remains.

178
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,582
You seem to have given this
an awful lot of thought.

179
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,040
When have I ever let you down?

180
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,040
- When have you ever let me down?!
- Oh, come on now, Willy.

181
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,582
Oh!

182
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,499
Holy shite!

183
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,165
This is wrong.

184
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,124
There's only one Surgeon's Square
in Edinburgh, Willy.

185
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,290
No, what we're doing is wrong.

186
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,957
I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor,

187
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,832
but we've two gentlemen
at the door to see you.

188
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,957
They appear to have
a herring barrel with them, sir.

189
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,874
I have no taste for herring, Patterson.
Send them away.

190
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,415
I believe there's something else
in their herring barrel for you, sir.

191
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,082
I commend you both
on account of his freshness.

192
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,874
Thank you, Doctor.

193
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,665
Why is he bent in half like that?

194
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:58,415
Er, this man obviously died
in some kind of construction accident.

195
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,790
That is exactly what hap... isn't that
exactly what happened, Mr. Burke?

196
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,957
Aye, Mr. Hare, yeah,
that's exactly what happened.

197
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,040
Right.
I'll give you 3 pounds.

198
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,082
We was looking for 6 pounds, sir.

199
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,749
I'm afraid I can go no higher
than 4 pounds 10 shillings.

200
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:17,415
Doctor Knox, sir, y-you yourself
complimented us on account of its...

201
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,165
freshness, sir.

202
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,082
Quite the salesman, aren't you,
uh, Mr. Hare?

203
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,540
Could you make it
5 pounds 10 shillings?

204
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:31,040
What with so much... construction work
going on in Edinburgh,

205
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:35,457
if we were to, uh, stumble on
any other unfortunates...

206
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,457
would you be interested,
Doctor?

207
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,665
I'll give you 5 pounds for your efforts,
gentlemen.

208
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,124
And I'll pay you the same for any more
unfortunates that you can deliver,

209
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,332
Except in the summer, when we have
a few problems keeping them fresh.

210
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,374
I completely understand,
Doctor Knox.

211
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,957
All right, Patterson.
Prepare this gentleman for the lecture.

212
00:15:56,041 --> 00:16:00,040
What about his, uh...
posture, sir?

213
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,165
Uh, straighten him out.
I'm sure he won't complain.

214
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,874
Sir?

215
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,082
Unbend him.
These fellows will assist you.

216
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,374
And then show them out.
Goodnight.

217
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,915
All right,
give me a hand with this.

218
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,540
Here's to our new product.

219
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,749
And where exactly
are we gonna find more?

220
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:41,290
Oh, there's lots more... product
just waiting for us to dig it up.

221
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,499
He's looking at me.

222
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,665
I'm sure he knows
what we're doing.

223
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,040
Forget the damn dog, Willy.
Just keep an eye out for the militia.

224
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,415
- You know this is hallowed ground.
- Touch of frost is all.

225
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:32,957
Look lively, men.

226
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,165
Who goes there?!

227
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,582
Fix bayonets!

228
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,957
It's the militia!

229
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,624
Listen up, lads!

230
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,915
Agh!

231
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,457
They got guns!

232
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,665
Oh, for pity's sake, Private.

233
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,249
Come on.

234
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,874
Be careful.

235
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,665
Either we give ourselves up
and risk being transported,

236
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,624
or we run for it
and risk getting shot.

237
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,790
As much as I like to travel,
I think I'm gonna go with the latter.

238
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,582
- On three.
- Right. One...

239
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,290
Ow!!

240
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,582
Well shot, sir!

241
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,874
Thank you, Sergeant.

242
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,540
I can't believe this.

243
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,999
Six years in the Donegal Militia,
and I never got a scratch.

244
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,957
And three hours as a grave robber,
and I get shot in the arse.

245
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,874
All right, Willy,
show me your wounds.

246
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,165
All right, just be careful.

247
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,957
I think you've got a perfectly
lovely arse.

248
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,499
Evening, Mrs. McFie.

249
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,332
Is it bad?

250
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,624
It's nothing but a scratch,
you big baby.

251
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,874
- Well, it still hurts.
- Come on, Willy.

252
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,499
Oh, who was that screaming
in the graveyard like a wee girl?

253
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,707
You!

254
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,832
For the love of Lord Jesus.
She's fallen off the wagon again.

255
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,832
Are you all right, love?

256
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,999
It's God.

257
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,332
He's punishing us.

258
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,749
Oh, you know that's not true.

259
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,832
First Old Donald.
Now Joseph.

260
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,957
What's happened to Joseph?

261
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,749
That's two rents just gone.

262
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,874
Hello?

263
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,957
Are you all right, Joseph?

264
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,207
Do I look all right,
you bleedin' Irish bastards?!

265
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,999
You'll no' be takin' my coat.

266
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,374
I remember.

267
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,874
Old Nosey was there himself.

268
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,124
He says, "Stand up, guards.

269
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:10,165
Now, Maitland, now's your time."

270
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,499
And over we go, fightin',
fightin' the Frogs.

271
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,290
Did I ever tell you about the time...

272
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,624
The time...

273
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:28,124
I saw the man, the wee man himself,
Napoleon?

274
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,457
Aye, it were a treat.

275
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,415
And that idiotic hat.

276
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,957
Forgive me, Father...

277
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,874
for I know not what I do.

278
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:51,540
He shouldn't have to go like this.

279
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,707
A hero should be laid to rest among
his comrades

280
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,249
in the corner of some distant
foreign field,

281
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,332
on the battleground surrounded
by his fellow men-at-arms.

282
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,457
No, Willy, it's far better this way.

283
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,707
A man deserves to die in the comfort of
his own bed surrounded by his friends.

284
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,582
Never again, William.

285
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,249
Old Joseph
was the last one for me.

286
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,749
Look, we'll talk about it later, Willy.

287
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,124
For now just smile
and try to look important.

288
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,582
- Er, excusez-moi...
- You're not coming in wearing those.

289
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:38,624
- But they are French.
- Exactly. So sling your hook.

290
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,374
- Pardon?
- Sling your hook.

291
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,832
- Hook?
- Your hook.

292
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,790
- Hook?
- Your hook, sling it.

293
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,749
- We're on the guest list.
- Name?

294
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,457
William Wordsworth.

295
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,290
Plus one.

296
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,249
Welcome to McOakley's,
Mr. Wordsworth.

297
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:04,749
And may I say how much I admired
your poem about the daffodils.

298
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,499
Oh, too kind.

299
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,415
Very nice, very nice.
Aye.

300
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:13,040
No chance. Piss off.
Get out.

301
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,040
What are you having?

302
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,165
It's inconceivable
that the height of culture

303
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,999
on offer in Edinburgh
is this bloody dive.

304
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:42,040
Which is why I'm proposing...
and don't laugh at me...

305
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,582
that we put on...

306
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,332
"Macbeth."

307
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:53,124
It's got everything.
Sex, murder, magic, betrayal.

308
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,332
I think it's a great idea, Ginny.

309
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,374
- You do?
- I really do.

310
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,707
There's just one problem.

311
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,124
Wasn't Macbeth a king?

312
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,915
Wouldn't that make him a man?

313
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:10,707
I'm talking about the first all-female
production of a Shakespeare play!

314
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,957
But it costs money to put on a play,
Ginny.

315
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,624
None of us want to go back
on the game.

316
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,874
- Never.
- Nobody's going back on the game.

317
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:24,832
All we need is for a wealthy and
discerning patron to take the bait.

318
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:26,874
What are you doing?

319
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:30,082
That which hath made them drunk
hath made me bold, Em.

320
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:38,290
Had I but died
an hour before this chance,

321
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,832
I had liv'd a blessed time...

322
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:43,957
Someone's had a few too many.

323
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:49,707
Who can be wise, amaz'd,
temp'rate and furious

324
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:53,249
loyal and neutral in a moment?

325
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,374
No man.

326
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,957
The violent expedition of my love

327
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:59,374
has outrun the pauser reason.

328
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:12,415
Have you not heard
of William bloody Shakespeare?

329
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:16,415
Show some respect!
Bollocks.

330
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,332
Can I help you?

331
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:24,749
Uh... just, your...
your speech there was...

332
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,499
it was wonderful, madam.

333
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:35,374
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

334
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,374
Doctor!

335
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:41,374
You look like the proverbial cat that
swallowed the canary, Doctor Monro.

336
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,249
You must know what this is all about.

337
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,415
I do, actually.

338
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,749
But forgive me, I need to have a word
with Doctor Knox.

339
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,165
I'd be surprised if Knox
would speak to you, now that...

340
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,165
Excuse me Doctor Lister.

341
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,915
And please
do not misunderstand this, but...

342
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,165
your breath is appalling.

343
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,415
Ah!

344
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,249
Doctor Knox.
How wonderful it is to see you.

345
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,040
Yes, I'm sure it is.

346
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:18,415
And your new students,
are they enjoying your lectures?

347
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,832
Er, not as much as I understand
they're enjoying your wife, sir.

348
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,207
Oh, I hate that man.

349
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:34,415
Doctors, professors, gentlemen,
please take your seats.

350
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:42,499
Your attention, gentlemen.

351
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:48,249
His Majesty will be in residence
at Holyrood Palace in eight weeks' time.

352
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,957
The King has decided that,
in his wisdom,

353
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:55,915
he will create a competition to further
the progress of medical science.

354
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,665
Accordingly, His Majesty
has decided that during his visit,

355
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,999
he will listen to presentations
from Scotland's leading physicians.

356
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,332
Whomsoever he determines
has made the greatest advances

357
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,207
in the field of medicine,

358
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:14,874
will be awarded the Royal Seal
and a handsome monetary reward.

359
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,582
Mmm!

360
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:21,749
This honour will confer immeasurable
economic and social status on Edinburgh,

361
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,332
on Scotland,
on the medical profession,

362
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:27,499
and, of course, on its recipient.

363
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,290
I thank you, and goodnight.

364
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,957
Lord Harrington, I just...

365
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,082
Yes, I know.

366
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:38,499
I played Agnes in Molière's
"School For Wives"

367
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,249
at the Garrick Theatre in London.

368
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,332
And after that, times got tough,

369
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:46,124
and I branched out into...
physical theatre.

370
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,999
- Ah, like acrobatics?
- Sometimes.

371
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:51,540
Then I became a dancer and a showgirl,

372
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:54,374
and now I'm trying to produce
my first play.

373
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,374
- Sounds very exciting.
- It is.

374
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,707
I just need to put together
a consortium of investors.

375
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:03,665
Anyway enough about me.
Let's talk more about you.

376
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,957
What do you do for a living?

377
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:08,082
Er, I'm in surgical supplies.

378
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,707
Sorry to interrupt, Willy but, eh,
we should be heading home.

379
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,249
- Got an early start.
- It was lovely to meet you, Mr. Burke.

380
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,540
- Well, can I see you again?
- Oh, I'd like that.

381
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:18,957
- How about Friday night?
- I'll meet you here at 7:00.

382
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,915
Goodnight, miss.
Come along, Willy.

383
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,707
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

384
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,832
I'll not explain myself again.
Mr. Wordsworth is already in the club.

385
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,415
That cannot be.
I am he.

386
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,082
Newly returned from my tour
of the continent.

387
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,290
And I am Samuel Coleridge.

388
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,915
Aye. And I'm Robbie fuckin' Burns!
Now piss off, the both of youse!

389
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,540
Strange and peculiar gentleman.

390
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:53,624
I never realised there was so much
to know about the human foot.

391
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:57,082
Doctor Knox? Will you be presenting
to the committee?

392
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,874
I will, my Lord.

393
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:04,082
And I believe I shall prevail
in His Majesty's competition.

394
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,540
And how will you do that,
Doctor Knox?

395
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,957
I'm creating a complete map
of the human body,

396
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,915
both inside and out.

397
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:15,249
If such a thing were possible,

398
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,415
it would constitute the greatest
medical advance since Vesalius.

399
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,999
It is also impossible.

400
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:26,374
Such a map would be entirely useless
unless it was 100% accurate.

401
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,999
And no artist can guarantee that.

402
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:32,499
No illustrator or painter, I agree.

403
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:36,624
So how on earth
do you propose to achieve it?

404
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:40,832
You shall see, Professor,
in the fullness of time.

405
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:42,457
My Lord.

406
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,707
Come, Patterson.

407
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,624
Vous êtes prêt?

408
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,540
Aye, ready.

409
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:10,832
- Bon.
- Excuse me, sir.

410
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:15,124
Uh, Patterson?

411
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,124
Patterson?

412
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,249
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq,
six, sept, huit, neuf.

413
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:58,999
Patterson?

414
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:09,415
Voilà.

415
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:17,290
Mercí.

416
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,665
Ah! Merde.

417
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,749
Ah!

418
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,207
Voilà.

419
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:56,082
Excellent.

420
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,582
It is an heliographic,

421
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:02,499
a device
to capture the image forever.

422
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,499
An heliographic?

423
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,082
Oui.

424
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:09,665
We shall have to come up
with something better than that.

425
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,707
That was a great night.

426
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:16,832
Best night of my life.

427
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,749
It was a different world.

428
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:22,207
A world up high where the air
is balmy and anything's possible.

429
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,790
That's where we belong, Willy.

430
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:30,207
You know, we should probably keep
this run of good fortune to ourselves.

431
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,165
Just till Lucky straightens herself out.

432
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,415
Not a problem, William.

433
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,749
Besides, for us to come across
any more of those unfortunates,

434
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,832
we'd need the devil's own luck.

435
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,457
That's where you're wrong, Willy.

436
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:47,249
Men like us make our own luck.

437
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,832
What do you mean?

438
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,999
Have you gone mad?

439
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,874
No, Willy.
We've gone into business.

440
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:04,665
That doesn't give us the right
to determine another man's fate.

441
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,707
Man is gonna die from the moment
he leaves his mother's womb.

442
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,415
Their fate's already been determined.

443
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,124
All we'd be doing is...
helping them along a bit.

444
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:19,457
You know...

445
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,624
you look very elegant
in that new suit.

446
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,082
Fine tailoring becomes you.

447
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,082
If you think you're gonna convince me
like that, you're wrong.

448
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,832
I don't care about clothes.

449
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,790
No, but you care about women,
right?

450
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:41,624
And a fine one costs an arm and a leg,
at the very least.

451
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:47,874
And that Miss Ginny,
she's a very fine one indeed.

452
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,874
Beautiful.

453
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,457
Talented.

454
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:58,415
- Not to mention a fine pair...
- All right, you've made your point.

455
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,249
But not like this.

456
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,749
There's a place in the Old Town
that'll suit us fine.

457
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,707
Madam...

458
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:50,124
I-I-I-I'll...

459
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,332
take the high road...

460
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:55,040
Right.

461
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,415
The next one we just stab
in the heart with a knife.

462
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,957
No!

463
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:04,957
And I will be in Scotland afore ye!

464
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,957
Look, I have another idea.

465
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:26,582
Yah!

466
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,374
Yah!

467
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:32,082
I say, coachman!
Can't this bloody thing go faster?!

468
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,499
Yah!

469
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,290
They're coming!

470
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:45,124
Faster, Willy, faster!

471
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,582
Faster!

472
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,290
Yah! Yah!

473
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,874
Come on, Willy.
Put your back into it.

474
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,457
Yah! Yah!

475
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,124
Aaaah!

476
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,957
Fuck me.

477
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,249
I'm telling you, Willy,
it'll be over in a flash.

478
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,374
And I'm telling you
I don't like this one bit.

479
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,665
And I am confident
that this is the only way.

480
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,499
You know, William,
I had confidence in a fart once

481
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,124
and I shat all over myself.

482
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:57,624
When a body meets a body
comin' through the rye

483
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:01,540
When a body meets a body,
a body cry?

484
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:52,915
Who's there?
Is anybody there?!

485
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,499
Agh! Ah!

486
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,124
D'you have a light?

487
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,040
Agh! Ah!

488
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,249
Are you...
are you all right?

489
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:44,165
This man's untimely
and premature death...

490
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,249
was, as should be fairly obvious
to all of you,

491
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:52,790
the direct result of gluttony!

492
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:58,999
I cooked your favourite.

493
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,207
Arbroath smokie and champit tattie.

494
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,915
That's lovely.

495
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,499
Thank you.

496
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,415
I'm not stupid, William.

497
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,874
Three dead bodies
and a pocket full of money?

498
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:39,290
Doesn't take a genius to work out
what the pair of you have been up to.

499
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:45,124
I think it's the best bloody idea
you've ever had.

500
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:49,457
One condition...
I want a pound for every body you sell.

501
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:54,499
A pound?
- Man starts getting fancy clothes...

502
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:57,540
also starts getting fancy ideas.

503
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:01,457
Just think of it as a tax between
a man and a wife.

504
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:04,624
A kind of nuptial agreement,
if you will.

505
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,374
You may be named Lucky,

506
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,957
but I'm the lucky one, my darlin'.

507
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,915
I'm not listening to you.
I'm watching you.

508
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,207
I'm watching you.

509
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:24,249
Oh, champagne!
I am impressed, William.

510
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,540
That must have set you back
a pretty penny.

511
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,499
Well... thank you.

512
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:31,040
- To good news.
- To good news.

513
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:35,540
- Mmm.
- What good news?

514
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:37,582
I have decided to finance your play.

515
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:40,290
No!

516
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,457
Mr. Burke!

517
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,874
Who's that over there
with Ginny Hawkins?

518
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,124
- That's Willy Burke.
- Who?

519
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:01,415
Regular at The Gravediggers.
Always in the company of William Hare.

520
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:05,290
They're drinking champagne.

521
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,582
Find out what his racket is.

522
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,707
May I ask what persuaded you
to be so bold

523
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:15,374
as to invest in an all-female production
of the Scottish play?

524
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:18,207
You have an incredible talent,
Ginny.

525
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,707
I saw that the night we met.

526
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:22,874
A talent like that is a gift from God.

527
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,374
To see it go to waste over something
as trivial as money,

528
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,207
that'd be a travesty.

529
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:32,415
I had no idea you were so passionate
about the theatre, Mr. Burke.

530
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,124
Not the theatre, Ginny.
You.

531
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,957
Thank you for a lovely evening,
Mr. Burke.

532
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,415
Uh, William, please.

533
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:53,082
Oh, sorry. Um...

534
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,290
When will I be able to see you again,
Ginny?

535
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,040
At the Lyceum Theatre.

536
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,415
Really? When?

537
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,707
When we put down the deposit.

538
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,624
Goodnight, William.

539
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,124
I need to make more money.
Fast.

540
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,624
Don't tell me she charged you
for the night.

541
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,957
She is an actress, not a whore.

542
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,040
What's the difference?

543
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,374
I am gonna finance her play.

544
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,207
Well, with the economy
in its current condition,

545
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,957
I think I'd have to advise
against such a high-risk investment.

546
00:43:38,041 --> 00:43:40,957
Not everything is about money,
William.

547
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,874
William Hare?

548
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:46,374
This is no time to be resting
on your laurels.

549
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,207
Or to be getting yourself
inebriated.

550
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,124
You got a business to run.

551
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:54,040
We was just talking about that.
Why don't you join us, love?

552
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:57,957
- She knows?
- Yes, she does.

553
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:00,332
Don't worry, Willy.
I can keep me mouth shut.

554
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:02,040
I'm sorry to take so long.

555
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:04,249
But I was just having a word
with that old lady over there.

556
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:05,499
Tragic story.

557
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:09,624
Just lost her whole family to the pox,
and it's left her homeless.

558
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:11,249
I'll be back.

559
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,082
Lucky got her drunk.
Now you just hold her still.

560
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,249
I'm trying!

561
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:31,290
You know, this is how they put wounded
soldiers out of their misery

562
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:32,665
on the battlefield.

563
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,540
- Oh, aye, what's that called?
- Doesn't really have a name.

564
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:39,290
- Perhaps we should invent one.
- Just get it over with, William.

565
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:42,332
I've got it, I've got it...
in honour of my best friend,

566
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:46,749
from now on this shall be called...

567
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:48,082
"Burking."

568
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,832
Help! Help! Help!

569
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,540
Help! Help!

570
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,290
Is she dead?

571
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,832
I think so.

572
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,624
- Yeah, she snuffed it.
- I certainly hope so.

573
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:44,582
And thou opposed,
being of no woman born,

574
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,332
Yet will I try the last.

575
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,332
Lay on, Macduff!

576
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:53,124
And damned be him who first cry,
"Hold, enough!"

577
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,249
Thank you, Lucy.
That was...

578
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,832
Please let go.
That was interesting.

579
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:01,665
Well done.
We'll, um, we'll be in touch.

580
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,249
- Just don't hold your breath.
- Shh, silence, gentlemen.

581
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:06,957
Sorry.

582
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:09,499
I thought we'd agreed
you'd keep your mouth shut?

583
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,499
This is costing me enough
without incurring any further delays.

584
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,999
I was just being honest.

585
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:16,415
This is the theatre, William.
It's not a place for honesty.

586
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,249
Next!

587
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:23,124
Miss Clarissa Windsor reading
for the part of Macbeth.

588
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:25,915
Thank you!

589
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,040
We're going to need
another day of auditions.

590
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,374
Maybe even two, Willy.

591
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,957
That's not gonna be a problem,
is it?

592
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,415
Eh... no, no.

593
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,374
You take as much time as you like,
love.

594
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,332
Could you unbutton me, darling?

595
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,207
Aye, uh...

596
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:12,374
I trust
all is well with your business?

597
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:14,249
Aye, I...
Can't complain.

598
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:18,665
I just don't know if we're ever
going to find a convincing Macbeth.

599
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,665
Well, er, I think
you should play the role.

600
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:26,790
What makes you think I could star
and direct?

601
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,582
Your talent and your vision.

602
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:33,707
I have been blessed
with a lot of talent.

603
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:35,457
And I have a vision.

604
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:38,124
- D'you think?
- I know.

605
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,332
Climb in, Willy.

606
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:58,124
We're going for a wee chat
with Mr. McTavish.

607
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:07,540
Let me tell you how things work
in this little city of mine.

608
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:11,040
Anyone who attempts to start
a new business here

609
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,665
has to agree to pay me
a small percentage of the gross.

610
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,832
And in return,
I make sure you stay out ofjail.

611
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:22,624
You're not harassed by the authorities,
the competition,

612
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:26,082
or any other antagonist
that might just come along.

613
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,082
So we pay you for...

614
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,540
protection?

615
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:36,790
Why, yes, I like that.
Protection.

616
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,999
How much of a percentage
are we talking about?

617
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,957
- 50%.
- Half?!

618
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:43,290
Don't be unhappy, boys.

619
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:47,415
Mr. McTavish hasnae yet told you
the good part.

620
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,582
And, uh...
what would be the good part?

621
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,915
You get to remain alive.

622
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:10,832
We should leave town immediately.
Go to London or America.

623
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:12,207
I think I might even have
a cousin there.

624
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:15,249
And quit the most lucrative enterprise
we're ever likely to find?

625
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:16,915
I don't think so.

626
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,290
Willy, we have identified a demand
and found a supply.

627
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,540
It's perfect.

628
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,040
Yeah, but McTavish is not
the full shilling, is he?

629
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,332
The last thing I want to do
is get into bed with that man.

630
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,582
Ah, but you do wanna get into bed
with Ginny, right?

631
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,124
And to do that, you're gonna have
to stay right here

632
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:33,624
and continue to finance her play.

633
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:40,415
Will all great Neptune's ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand?

634
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,665
Ah! No! Aah!

635
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:47,499
This is my hand will rather
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,

636
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,999
making the green ones red.

637
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,124
My hands are of your colour,

638
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:55,207
but I am shamed
to wear a heart so white.

639
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,957
- Wait, stop right there.
- Oh, what now?!

640
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:02,082
No, something's still not quite right.
I need a minute to think.

641
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,165
Ginny, please!
Just say the words!

642
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:19,499
I can't work out what makes
this character commit murder.

643
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:24,207
Why, Ginny...
he does it for love.

644
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,707
And power.

645
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:31,582
Macbeth isn't wholly evil.

646
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:34,874
There are traces of... of goodness
and regret within him.

647
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:37,832
That's what makes him such
a great tragic hero.

648
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:42,332
The whole play is about his... his inner
struggle between good and evil.

649
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,290
Right and wrong.

650
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,957
You have hidden depths, William.

651
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:52,790
Women like that in a man.

652
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:59,874
- May I see you tonight?
- Uh, um...

653
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:03,415
I-I don't think that's a good idea.

654
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,915
I-I've got costume fittings tomorrow.

655
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:13,915
This is ground-breaking work, sir.

656
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:18,790
Now the King will be in residence
at Holyrood in just three weeks.

657
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,790
Will this work be completed in time?

658
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:24,999
Aye, I shall have to step up the pace,
but I don't foresee any major problems.

659
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,249
Sir Astley-Cooper acquired
his knighthood

660
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:30,624
by having successfully lanced
a boil on the King's head.

661
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,582
I can only begin to imagine the level
of patronage

662
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:37,082
His Majesty will confer on you
having seen these, uh...

663
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:42,540
Oh, I'm, um... I'm calling them
"photographs," sir.

664
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:44,999
Photographs.

665
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:48,165
Excellent.

666
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,207
My Lord.

667
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,582
Gentlemen.

668
00:51:58,375 --> 00:52:01,832
Any difficulties acquiring subjects,
Doctor?

669
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:05,957
I'll admit the anatomical bylaw
was a temporary inconvenience.

670
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:09,249
But not even you, Monro,
can stand in the way of progress.

671
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,415
Good day, gentlemen.

672
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:21,374
You know, you got a good business
going there, Willy.

673
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,707
I know.

674
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:25,999
But the problem is...
product acquisition.

675
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,124
What?

676
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:30,624
You know, killing people.
That's how you acquire your product.

677
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,207
It's not efficient.

678
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:34,332
It's bloody hard work,
that's what it is.

679
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,040
People are starting to notice,
you know.

680
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:39,415
There's all kinds of crazy rumours
flying around the West Port.

681
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,415
Keep going, Willy.
Helps me think.

682
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,707
The thing is that nobody likes
dealing with dead bodies.

683
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:52,165
So, for a fee, you could
take them off their hands.

684
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,207
Sell them a coffin for their loved ones,
arrange a burial.

685
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,624
Yeah, and when people are grieving they
don't think about how much things cost.

686
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,999
We could call it a "funeral store."

687
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:06,082
Funeral store, no.

688
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:08,124
Sounds too down-market.

689
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,415
I'd prefer something like
"funeral parlour."

690
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,040
Oh God, yes!
Yeah, that's a fantastic idea!

691
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:19,374
Oh, don't stop! Don't stop, Willy!
I'm almost there.

692
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:34,915
Ah, Mr. Hare.

693
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,624
Doctor Knox would like the pleasure
of your company.

694
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:41,832
As from now,
I shall require two bodies a week.

695
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,624
Fresh ones, mind you,
in good condition.

696
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:48,540
That won't be easy, Doctor.

697
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:52,374
Mr. Hare I've never asked you
how you came by these subjects.

698
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:55,290
Oh, my partner
and I have arrangements

699
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,749
with the low lodging houses
in the West Port.

700
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:01,915
- Whenever someone dies...
- Mr. Hare, I'm a doctor.

701
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,665
I know the difference between death
by natural and unnatural causes.

702
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,665
Edinburgh's a very dangerous place,
Doctor Knox.

703
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:15,665
And something tells me that recently,
it's become a lot more dangerous.

704
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,999
I don't presume to judge, Mr. Hare.

705
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:27,582
But I know that as a result
of my work and the doctors I train,

706
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:32,207
thousands, perhaps millions of lives
will be saved.

707
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,832
Two a week, Mr. Hare.
Can you manage that?

708
00:54:40,958 --> 00:54:42,415
At your service, sir.

709
00:54:45,791 --> 00:54:47,082
What more could a man ask for?

710
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,790
Mighty fine place you have here,
gentlemen.

711
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,624
How much will you be asking?

712
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,624
Nothing.

713
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,540
Willy, do something!

714
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,915
Unhand my boys!

715
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,332
Gentlemen...

716
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:25,957
we live, thank God,
in enlightened times.

717
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,499
The watchword of our age
is "progress."

718
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:32,332
Progress in the arts.

719
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:41,332
Progress in science.
Progress in technology.

720
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:45,124
Progress in transportation.

721
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,207
Progress in society.

722
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:58,415
Please help me.

723
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,790
Fox, get your sketchbook.

724
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:03,082
In all these fields,

725
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:06,624
we've moved further and faster
in the last two decades

726
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:09,082
than in the previous two centuries.

727
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:12,040
Never before have ordinary people

728
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:16,249
had so much freedom
and opportunity.

729
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:22,540
The year is 1828,
and we are building a new world.

730
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:27,832
A new and better world.

731
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:35,374
Sergeant, keep them quiet!

732
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,999
Quiet, please!

733
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:42,457
As men of science,
it is our role... nae!

734
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:49,040
Our duty to be in the vanguard
of that movement.

735
00:56:49,125 --> 00:56:52,499
This is not the time for rest.

736
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,207
It is not a time for half measures.

737
00:56:55,291 --> 00:57:00,040
This is not the time
to sit on our achievements.

738
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:05,624
It is the time to work harder...

739
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,957
and faster than ever before.

740
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:14,249
Gentlemen, I give you...

741
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,582
a multiple dissection!

742
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,582
You don't think I look a little bit
too masculine?

743
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:41,874
- You know, too much like a man?
- I think you look lovely.

744
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,040
I'll see you on Friday?

745
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:07,999
Excellent work, Fox.
Now we'll go and do the New Town.

746
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,915
Willy.

747
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:23,582
The militia have posters up
all over the streets.

748
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,040
- Of us?
- No!

749
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:29,665
Of the people we've...
you know...

750
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:34,124
They're closing in, William.

751
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:37,332
Then it's our good fortune
that we're not doing it anymore.

752
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,915
I've been doing the sums, Willy.

753
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,957
I have got enough money put aside
to start our new business.

754
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:47,290
- What new business?
- Funeral parlours.

755
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,707
Funeral parlours?

756
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,749
It's a place where people
bring bodies to be buried.

757
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:54,457
- And we wouldn't have to kill 'em?
- They're already dead!

758
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,957
Thank you. I like it.

759
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:02,374
I knew you would.
We're going straight to the top, Willy.

760
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:05,582
And nobody...
nobody is gonna stop us.

761
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:29,999
All right... Shh! Everyone.

762
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,582
I'd like to propose a toast.

763
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:38,790
To the man whose hard work
and whose commitment

764
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,415
made this possible.

765
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,832
To William Burke.

766
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:44,124
To William Burke!

767
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:47,082
- William Burke.
- No, come on, now.

768
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:52,915
- You embarrassed me.
- I know.

769
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:59,207
That's me!

770
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:02,957
Oh, Willy,
I don't know how to thank you.

771
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:04,957
I can think of a few ways.

772
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:12,707
Come to buy a ticket, Danny?

773
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:16,457
Blood and guts aren't entertainment
for me, William.

774
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:19,457
They're business.
Now get in.

775
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:30,249
I've decided to bring you
and Mr. Burke into the firm.

776
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,415
Sorry?

777
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,624
You'll have regular employment.
A steady wage.

778
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,374
We'll be partners.

779
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:39,915
Partners, is it?

780
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:46,040
But Willy and I are out of the
body-snatching business now.

781
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:48,832
Mm. So you say.

782
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:52,374
- Do I have a choice, Danny?
- Of course you do, William.

783
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:55,749
Free will is what distinguishes man
from beast.

784
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:10,124
Our final subject.

785
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,790
Isn't that Danny McTavish?

786
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,957
Danny McTavish has been dissected
by Doctor Knox.

787
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:35,165
I am Captain McLintoch,
and this is the Edinburgh Militia.

788
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:39,665
Your reputation precedes you,
Captain McLintoch.

789
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,499
Thank you, sir.

790
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:47,124
Your preposterous war on grave robbery
was a model of incompetence.

791
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:50,499
It has come to my attention, sir,
that earlier on today,

792
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,957
you publicly dissected a corpse.

793
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:56,874
Well, if this is him
then your information is correct.

794
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,749
Pull yourself together, Private.

795
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,457
How did you obtain this body?

796
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:08,499
Patterson?

797
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,457
I believe it was dumped
in the alley behind this building.

798
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:11,957
Some students found him.

799
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:15,374
This is a notorious villain.
Danny McTavish.

800
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:18,040
Ah, at least his demise
might not be in vain.

801
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:22,915
Saint Peter might look kindly on his
services to the teaching of medicine.

802
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:29,957
Fox, show me your hand.

803
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:39,290
A defensive wound,
clear evidence of foul play.

804
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:42,874
And you, sir, have been tampering
with the evidence.

805
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:46,957
That's an outrageous accusation,
Captain McLintoch.

806
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:50,499
I shall be reporting this matter
to the Solicitor-General.

807
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:53,249
Lord Harrington
will back my judgment on this.

808
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,207
I stake my job on it.

809
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,624
You just did.

810
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,374
Er, Ginny?

811
01:03:13,458 --> 01:03:15,832
How many people are out there?

812
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:17,957
Standing room only.

813
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,249
Thank you.

814
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:29,290
When shall we three
meet again?

815
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:34,499
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

816
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:36,957
When the hurly-burly's done.

817
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:39,999
When the battle's lost and won.

818
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,874
That will be ere the set of the sun.

819
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:46,749
Where the place?

820
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,707
Upon the heath.

821
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:53,040
There to meet with... Macbeth.

822
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:09,957
If I stand here, I saw him!

823
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:11,457
Fie, for shame!

824
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:16,165
Blood hath been shed here now,
in the olden time.

825
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:21,499
Ere humane statute
purged the gentle weal...

826
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:26,124
Ay, and since, too,
murders have been committed.

827
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:28,582
Too terrible for the ear!

828
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:32,749
There was a time that,
when the brains were out,

829
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:36,915
the man would die,
and there an end.

830
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,832
But now he rise again!

831
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:46,499
With twenty mortal murders
on their crown!

832
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:50,165
And push us from our stools!

833
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,832
This is more strange.

834
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:55,832
Than such a murder is.

835
01:04:55,916 --> 01:04:58,874
All our missing persons are here.

836
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,665
Qu'est ce que vous faites ici?

837
01:05:00,958 --> 01:05:03,707
Who did all this?!

838
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:05,707
C'est moi.

839
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:22,249
Bravo!

840
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:40,207
Ginny?

841
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:41,790
I think they liked it.

842
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:43,290
Five curtain calls
and a standing ovation.

843
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:44,832
I'd say it's a smash hit.

844
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,999
This is the happiest day of my life.

845
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:50,499
What's wrong, Willy?
You don't seem happy.

846
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:53,915
I'm happy for you, Gin.
I...

847
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,249
I just can't help thinking now this
is over,

848
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,874
you don't really need me any more.

849
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:01,290
You're right.
I don't need you.

850
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,707
But I do want you.

851
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,499
Really?

852
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,415
Mm! Oh!
We should take the play to London.

853
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,915
Make it a musical.
I'm blessed with the voice of an angel.

854
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,040
Aye, they could do with something new
in the West End.

855
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:21,957
Besides Edinburgh's changed.
You know, people have changed.

856
01:06:22,041 --> 01:06:24,582
- I've changed.
- Me, too.

857
01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:29,582
- Oh, I want us to be together, Willy.
- Tonight?

858
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,082
Tomorrow. Tonight I'm the star.
I must shine.

859
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:34,290
Oh, there's Mary. Mary!

860
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:38,457
Oh, Ginny!
They absolutely loved us!

861
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:49,707
These are not bad, but as you can see,
the heliograph is the future.

862
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:51,540
Did you kill these people?!

863
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:54,915
Certainly not!
They were all already...

864
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,790
How you say?
Chopped into pieces.

865
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,374
You disgusting little French fop!

866
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:02,332
I was just doing what I was told.

867
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:06,374
What you were told?
Told by whom?!

868
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,457
How do I look, Patterson?

869
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:14,332
Like someone who's about to go
down in history, sir.

870
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,665
Yes?

871
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:25,749
We have questions on urgent
militia matters for Doctor Knox.

872
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,915
He's not here.

873
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:32,082
Ow...

874
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,624
Well, I'd appreciate if you could
tell us where we can find him.

875
01:07:38,708 --> 01:07:41,624
He's making an official presentation
at Holyrood Palace.

876
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:49,707
Sharpen up, men.
We're going to pay the King a visit.

877
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:55,832
Morning, Willy.

878
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:02,707
For the love of Lord Jesus,
she finally gave it up.

879
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:05,874
No! No.

880
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:08,207
Although I'm pretty sure
tonight's the night.

881
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:13,457
I know this amazing trick
you can do with your tongue.

882
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:14,915
Thank you, William!

883
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:22,749
Well,
that could have been worse.

884
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:25,207
Do you mean
if he'd fallen asleep earlier?

885
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,999
Excuse me, what would you
like us to do with these, sir?

886
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:30,874
I don't care.
Just get rid of them.

887
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:33,415
Doctor Robert Knox!

888
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,457
The King is looking forward
to seeing your map of the human body.

889
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:40,707
Excellent.

890
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:42,999
My advice is to keep
the presentation short.

891
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,207
And don't ask him to read too much.

892
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,415
His Majesty can just, er,
look at the pictures.

893
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:54,957
Doctor Robert Knox!

894
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,665
Stop right there!

895
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:05,665
I demand you hand over these photographs
in the name of the Solicitor-General.

896
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:09,957
May I remind you, Captain,
that I am the Solicitor-General.

897
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,749
What exactly do you think
you're doing here?

898
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,624
Solving a crime, sir.

899
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:21,207
What on earth
are you talking about?

900
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,749
I'm talking about murder, sir.

901
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:25,874
That volume contains evidence
of foul play.

902
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,874
I don't know what this absurd
little man is trying to prove,

903
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:31,124
but he's making a mockery
of our profession.

904
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,374
I want him removed.

905
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:36,582
It is you, sir who is making a mockery
of the medical profession.

906
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:42,749
And if there is one single shred
of truth in this man's allegations,

907
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:45,790
we shall all have to pay the price.

908
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,999
His Majesty
has asked to see my work.

909
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,749
I intend to fulfill his wish.

910
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,124
Good day.

911
01:09:57,125 --> 01:10:00,249
Either you hand over the evidence,
Doctor Knox,

912
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,665
or I'll be forced to arrest you!

913
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,165
You're not touching it.

914
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:39,999
How many cadavers were used
to create the portfolio?

915
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:44,290
- 16.
- 16?!

916
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:47,540
And who provided
the 16 cadavers?!

917
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:25,332
Edinburgh Militia!
Nobody moves!

918
01:11:25,416 --> 01:11:28,790
Oh,
for the love of Lord Jesus!

919
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,124
I beg your pardon.

920
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,374
Mr. And Mrs. Hare.

921
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:45,665
I'm arresting you both on suspicion
of murder in the first degree!

922
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,290
We did terrible things, William.

923
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,915
A man has a right
to scratch out a living.

924
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,874
Nobody's gonna blame us for that.

925
01:11:57,958 --> 01:12:00,665
Ginny can.

926
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,374
Ah.

927
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:06,832
She's gonna find out, isn't she?
She'll know everything.

928
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:11,749
I won't lie to you, Willy,
it is a possibility.

929
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:23,415
This is unbelievable.

930
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:28,624
I can see the headline:
"Macbeth accused of murder."

931
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:30,790
You really have no idea, do you?

932
01:12:32,166 --> 01:12:36,624
Captain,
you've no right to keep us here.

933
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,499
I have every right.
Will you please sit down?

934
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,915
Now, Mrs. Hare, I have
some questions I'd like to ask you.

935
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,249
I'm not saying anything,
especially not to a Presbyterian.

936
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,582
I'm half Jewish.

937
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:54,082
I'm being persecuted
by a heathen!

938
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,790
This is an outrage.

939
01:12:55,875 --> 01:12:58,624
I demand to speak to the...
Solicitor-General!

940
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,207
- I demand to be released immediately.
- Immediately!

941
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:04,374
I demand to speak to a Catholic.

942
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,124
Miss Hawkins and Mrs. Hare,

943
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:09,290
either you keep quiet,
or I'll have you both shot!

944
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:17,207
"Wee Captain Tam McLintoch
of the Edinburgh Militia

945
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:22,165
"has apprehended the perpetrators
of the notorious West Port murders.

946
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:27,957
"The list of victims include
Mrs. Mary O'Toole of the New Town...

947
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,624
"Daft Jamie of the West Port...

948
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:34,582
"the freed slave
John Martin of London...

949
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:37,999
Mrs. Susanna McCorkindale
of Aberdeen!"

950
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,957
In the name of the law!

951
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:44,832
I demand you disperse immediately!

952
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,290
Let's get the bastards! Come on!

953
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:57,207
Stand fast, men.

954
01:14:06,541 --> 01:14:08,874
Kill the bastards!

955
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,249
I can't live
with this on my conscience.

956
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:27,540
All right?

957
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,040
I've got to confess.

958
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:34,332
The minute we're outta here,
we'll find you a priest.

959
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:37,957
There's no way I will ever be redeemed
in the eyes of the Lord Almighty.

960
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,749
I've gotta confess to the proper
authorities here on earth.

961
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:44,749
That's not such a, a good idea,
Willy.

962
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:48,874
'Cause you'd be putting a noose
around your own neck.

963
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:52,624
It's no more than I deserve.

964
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:57,415
Not to mention putting a noose
around my neck.

965
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,915
And Lucky's.

966
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,874
And Ginny's.

967
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,207
Let me handle this.

968
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:19,082
Ahh, pleasure to see you again,
Captain.

969
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:20,957
All right.

970
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:23,165
Can you tell us
what we're supposed to have done?

971
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:26,999
Sixteen counts
of first-degree murder.

972
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:31,499
That does sound serious.
And do you have any of the bodies?

973
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,915
Do you have any eyewitnesses?

974
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,582
In fact, do you have
a single shred of evidence?

975
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,290
It's all in there, laddie.

976
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:59,290
Captain,
a message from Lord Harrington, sir.

977
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,165
He wants to see you, sir,
at your earliest convenience.

978
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:06,624
His Lordship also said to bring
Doctor Knox's portfolio with you.

979
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,665
Captain.

980
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:20,915
Take a seat.

981
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,165
Oh, thank you, my Lord.

982
01:16:23,958 --> 01:16:27,040
- Chocolate?
- Uh, thank you, my Lord.

983
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,915
The Lord Provost and I are very
interested to know

984
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,832
how we're doing on this case.

985
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:37,874
Well, at present, I have Mr. Burke
and Mr. Hare under lock and key.

986
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:40,124
They're not admitting anything,
but I'm sure by the time

987
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:43,457
I have finished with them,
they will crack, I'm sure of that.

988
01:16:43,541 --> 01:16:47,374
But is that really what we want,
Captain?

989
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:48,749
Excuse me, sir?

990
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:51,915
This city is renowned
for its medical facilities.

991
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,624
Students come from all over the world
to train in our anatomy schools.

992
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:59,749
They bring a great deal of money
with them.

993
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:04,790
We're rightfully proud of our status
and of our traditions.

994
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:06,582
It would be a pity to sully them

995
01:17:06,666 --> 01:17:09,749
with a scandal such
as a high-profile murder trial.

996
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:13,374
Especially a murder trial
that might compromise

997
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:16,582
the reputations of our esteemed
teaching hospitals.

998
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:21,207
You're surely not suggesting
that I let these two men go free?

999
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:26,082
No, no, we need someone to swing
for these crimes, but no trial.

1000
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:28,082
The city will gladly show its gratitude

1001
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:30,207
for your delicate handling
of this affair.

1002
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,749
In fact, in a city of this standing,

1003
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:37,374
surely the militia
should be commanded by a-a Major.

1004
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:40,374
Or even a Colonel. Hmm?

1005
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:42,999
Indeed.

1006
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:47,540
Rest assured, my Lord, my Lords,
that the city can rely on me.

1007
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:49,124
That's settled, then.

1008
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,957
We'll look after that, Colonel.

1009
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,915
Thank you, my lord.
My lord.

1010
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:25,999
So let me get this straight,
Captain.

1011
01:18:26,083 --> 01:18:27,165
Colonel.

1012
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,290
Colonel?

1013
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:37,499
If one of us confesses
to having committed these crimes

1014
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,207
the others will walk free?

1015
01:18:39,291 --> 01:18:40,374
Precisely.

1016
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:43,874
But that is outrageous!
We're all innocent!

1017
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:46,249
Nobody's gonna confess to a crime
they didn't commit

1018
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,540
just to make you popular
with the mob out there!

1019
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:49,999
It's all right, William!

1020
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:52,790
This is the chance for one of us
to do the decent thing.

1021
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:55,790
You call that decent?

1022
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:58,749
What kind of man
would do such a thing?

1023
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:02,832
I will.

1024
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:09,707
Thank you, God.

1025
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:11,999
On one condition.

1026
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:31,332
I know what you did.

1027
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:33,957
I am so sorry, Ginny.

1028
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:39,832
I-I don't expect you to forgive me.

1029
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:42,207
It's just so romantic.

1030
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:47,540
Confessing to save the life
of your lover.

1031
01:19:49,291 --> 01:19:50,874
It's like Shakespeare.

1032
01:19:55,041 --> 01:20:01,040
For never was there a story of...
of such woe,

1033
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:03,207
as of Ginny and her Romeo.

1034
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:18,290
William Burke of the West Port,

1035
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,249
formerly of County Donegal
in Ireland...

1036
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:22,415
Irish scum!

1037
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:26,665
You are convicted of the heinous crimes
of grave robbery and multiple murder.

1038
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,915
Do you have anything to say
before you are consigned to hell?

1039
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:41,165
Only this.

1040
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,957
I did it for love.

1041
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,749
I know he seemed like
a nice guy and all that.

1042
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,207
And I suppose
you have to respect the fact

1043
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,374
that he made the ultimate sacrifice
for love.

1044
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:36,332
But he did kill all those people
just for money.

1045
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,124
And that's just evil.

1046
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,415
Thank you.

1047
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:47,082
As for the rest of them...

1048
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,915
The Doctor ended up
in the New World.

1049
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,290
After all,
anything goes over there.

1050
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,290
Rat catcher!
Rat catcher!

1051
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:05,790
Fergus took protection to a new level

1052
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,957
and made a fortune
selling life insurance.

1053
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:15,040
As for our French friend here,
he also became a minor celebrity.

1054
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:18,249
He returned to Paris
and continued his work.

1055
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,457
Allez, allez, allez.
Vite, vite, vite.

1056
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:22,582
Ah, come here.

1057
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,499
I can't live without you.
You're beautiful.

1058
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:28,249
Ah, arrêt! Arrêt!

1059
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:31,082
Say "cheese"!

1060
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:33,207
Fromage!

1061
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:37,415
Nicephore is widely credited as one
of the inventors of photography.

1062
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,457
Parfait. Bravo.

1063
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:44,707
Lord Harrington, having weathered
the storm of the West Port murders

1064
01:23:44,791 --> 01:23:48,999
was later forced to resign
after Colonel wee Tam McLintoch's

1065
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:52,915
racy private memoirs
were a publishing sensation.

1066
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,582
But the real star turned out to be

1067
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:59,540
Professor Monro's young assistant,
Charles Darwin.

1068
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:04,415
He went on to write a book that sold
almost as well as the Bible.

1069
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,040
It said only the fittest survive.

1070
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:10,707
And living proof of that
is young Ginny.

1071
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:15,082
She finally overcame her grief
and became a popular actress.

1072
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,457
She's terrible!

1073
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,957
Get her off!

1074
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:20,499
Well, not that popular.

1075
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:24,665
As for our two heroes,
William Hare followed his dream.

1076
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:35,832
In the end,
only Hare got the Royal Seal.

1077
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:41,624
And William Burke ended up
in the same place as his victims.

1078
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:43,499
Where shall I start?

1079
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,040
I think the feet.

1080
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:52,874
When I wake up

1081
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:54,624
Well, I know I'm gonna be

1082
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:58,249
I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you

1083
01:24:58,333 --> 01:25:00,040
When I go out

1084
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:01,832
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

1085
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:04,832
I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

1086
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:07,582
If I get drunk

1087
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,165
Well, I know I'm gonna be

1088
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,582
I'm gonna be the man
who gets drunk next to you

1089
01:25:12,666 --> 01:25:14,540
And if I haver

1090
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,582
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

1091
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:19,915
I'm gonna be the man
who's havering to you

1092
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,582
But I would walk 500 miles

1093
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:27,582
And I would walk 500 more

1094
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:31,999
Just to be the man
who walked 1,000 miles

1095
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,749
To fall down at your door

1096
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,332
When I'm working

1097
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:38,290
Yes, I know I'm gonna be

1098
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:41,832
I'm gonna be the man
who's working hard for you

1099
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:43,749
And when the money

1100
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:45,499
Comes in for the work I do

1101
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:48,915
I'll pass almost every penny
on to you

1102
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,249
When I come home
When I come home

1103
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:52,832
Yeah, I know I'm gonna be

1104
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:56,207
I'm gonna be the man
who comes back home to you

1105
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:58,124
And if I grow old

1106
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:00,082
Well, I know I'm gonna be

1107
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:03,707
I'm gonna be the man
who's growing old with you

1108
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:07,540
But I would walk 500 miles

1109
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:11,249
And I would walk 500 more

1110
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:15,749
Just to be the man
who walks 1,000 miles

1111
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:18,582
To fall down at your door

1112
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:37,999
When I'm lonely

1113
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:40,040
Well, I know I'm gonna be

1114
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:43,790
I'm gonna be the man
who's lonely without you

1115
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:45,665
When I'm dreaming

1116
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:47,332
Well,
I know I'm gonna dream

1117
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:51,124
I'm gonna dream about the time
when I'm with you

1118
01:26:51,208 --> 01:26:53,040
When I go out
When I go out

1119
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:54,624
Well, I know I'm gonna be

1120
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:58,290
I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

1121
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:00,332
And when I come home
When I come home

1122
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:01,957
Yes, I know I'm gonna be

1123
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:05,165
I'm gonna be the man
who's comes back home with you

1124
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:09,665
I'm gonna be the man
who's coming home with you

1125
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:15,707
But I would walk 500 miles

1126
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:19,374
And I would walk 500 more

1127
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:23,915
Just to be the man who walks
1,000 miles

1128
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,707
To fall down at your door

1129
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:59,415
And I would walk 500 miles

1130
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,124
And I would walk 500 more

1131
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:07,624
Just to be the man who walked
1,000 miles

1132
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:12,249
To fall down at your door
