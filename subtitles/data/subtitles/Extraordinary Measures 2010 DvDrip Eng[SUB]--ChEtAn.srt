162
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,215
Okay. Can I do something?

163
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,553
I'll call you when I know more.

164
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,457
I should really get back to Megan,
so I'll call you

165
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,257
as soon as I
know anything, okay?

166
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,955
Bye. Love you.

167
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,799
Excuse me, please.
WOMAN: Sir?

168
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,343
My daughter, Megan Crowley,

169
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,639
was brought in for observation.

170
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,045
Yeah. Actually,
they're moving her to the ICU.

171
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,014
Where?
That way.

172
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,113
Aileen.

173
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,188
John.

174
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,981
Has she told you
about the trip

175
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,457
that Fiona's taking with her
remote-controlled car?

176
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,188
Yeah, yes, she did.
You're right. That's right, sweetie.

177
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,856
You're gonna see all the penguins,
aren't you?

178
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,195
She might send some postcards
or something like that.

179
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,166
Lots of good stuff to see along the way...
It's okay.

180
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,000
like icebergs and
maybe a polar bear.

181
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,772
How about some seals?

182
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,354
DR. PRESTON: As you know,
Pompe patients suffer muscle deterioration

183
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,057
in every part of the body,

184
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,193
so this sort of respiratory
complication, well,

185
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,864
that's just an inevitable
fact of the disease.

186
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,477
Mr. Crowley, Mrs. Crowley,

187
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,581
Megan is not
responding well.

188
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,289
Okay? Now, we've done everything
we can, but she's just...

189
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,824
There's nothing more
we can do. I'm sorry.

190
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,256
As you know, she was already
well past the life expectancy,

191
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,590
for, you know, Pompe kids.

192
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:26,000
After all, it's not
just her lungs, okay?

193
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,064
Her heart, her liver,
these organs have been compromised

194
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,009
and would've
become fatally enlarged.

195
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,638
Now, I wish that we had a drug
to treat Pompe,

196
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,842
but we simply don't.

197
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,812
I'm so very sorry.

198
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,313
Look, maybe...

199
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,654
Maybe you can find
some small comfort

200
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,820
in knowing that Megan's
suffering will be over.

201
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,323
Maybe you can see
this as a blessing.

Let's go! Page Dr. Heder.

211
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,343
NURSE 1: Asystole!
Yeah, right through here.

212
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,112
AILEEN: Can you hear my voice?
Can you hear Mama?

AILEEN: Hang in there, Megan.

216

Hang in there, baby, okay?
I need to bag her.

217
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,059
JOHN: Aileen?
Some room right there.

218
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,354
DOCTOR 2:
Let us in, all right?

219
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,123
Please, Mrs. Crowley, let...
Stop it!

220
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,288

Your daughter
is some fighter.

231
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,336
She's gonna be okay.

232
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,435
Oh, my God.

233
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,981
Now, look, she's still a very
sick girl, obviously,

234
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,108
but her vital
signs have improved

235
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,619
and I'm cautiously optimistic.

236
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,651
So, I guess you could say
we dodged that blessing, huh?

237
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,069
Mrs. Crowley,
these came for Megan.

238
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,139
Thanks so much. Thank you.

239
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,237

Huh?

241
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:59,073
You gonna tell us
about the product launch?

242
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,249
John, you okay?

243
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,516
I have to go.

244
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,651
John.

245
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,526
Where you going?
Nebraska.

246
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,028
Excuse me, please.
There's a gentleman here to see you.

247
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,634
Best make yourself
comfortable, hon.

248
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,324
Oh, dear.

249
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,901
Sir, sir. That's Dr. Stonehill.
He just left, I'm sorry.

250
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,662
Thank you.
Yeah.

251
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,894
Dr. Stonehill!

252
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,973
Hey, Dr. Stonehill!

(SPORTSCASTERS
CHATTERING ON TV)

254
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,704
Dr. Stonehill?

255
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,473
Yeah?

256
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,674
I'm John Crowley.

257
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,850
Okay.
Didn't you get any of my messages?

258
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:51,880
What messages?

259
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,254
I left you 3 or 4 messages
in the last month,

260
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,089
and you even hung up
on me the night before last.

261
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,892
What the hell are you talking about?
I never hung up on you.

262
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,759
Dr. Stonehill,
2 of my kids have Pompe.

263
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,630
Oh, Jesus.

264
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,204
Well, I'm sorry.

265
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,706
A terrible disease,

266
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,337
but, hell, you shouldn't have
come all this way

267
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,540
without talking to me.

268
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,709
I do research, son.
I don't see patients.

269
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,980
Well, it's your research
that I'm interested in.

270
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,887
I've read all the journal articles
on Pompe disease,

271
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,393
and all the researchers
out there say that

272
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,394
your work holds
the most promise.

273
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,624
Get to the point, son.
What do you want from me?

274
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,564
We almost lost my
daughter last week.

275
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,903
I need to hear
about your research.

276
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,575
STONEHILL: Your kids have
a genetic disease.

277
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,075
They're missing an enzyme

278
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,917
which metabolizes a certain kind
of sugar, glycogen.

279
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,992
It's defective
in Pompe patients.

280
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,954
So, this sugar builds up
in the muscle cells,

281
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:08,431
especially in the heart,
the skeletal muscles, the diaphragm,

282
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,524
which is why they have
a hard time breathing.

283
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:11,897
Yeah, I know.
I know a lot about that.

284
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,131
Everybody's making
an enzyme,

285
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,167
but you can infuse kids all day long
with their enzyme,

286
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,607
and it's not
gonna do any good

287
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,009
'cause it's not gonna
get into their cells.

288
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,082
Understand what I'm saying?

289
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,877
Yeah, so that means that
if you put the sugar...

290
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,315
Don't interrupt.
Sorry.

291
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,877
I'm making a different version
of this enzyme.

292
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:35,551
My enzyme has a biological marker,
mannose 6-phosphate.

293
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,323
I'm the only one that's cloned the gene
for phosphotransferase.

294
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,229
I'm the only one who's cloned the gene
for uncovering enzyme,

295
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,497
so I can get more mannose 6-phosphate
onto the lysosomal protein,

296
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:51,633
and I can deliver a more effective
amount of enzyme

297
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,703
into the cells.

298
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,676
That's why people
are citing my work.

299
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,749
That's why you read my name
in the literature.

300
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,148
I can get more
enzyme into the cells.

301
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,250
What's the matter, Sal?
Not up on your glycobiology?

302
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,989
I thought Doc was
just your nickname.

303
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,257
No, that man's a genius. He's on
the verge of a scientific breakthrough.

304
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,865
Wow. Who knew?

305
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,326
I'm not on the
verge of anything, kid.

306
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,302
This is a theory,
not a therapy.

307
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,740
I'm just an academic.

308
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,808
You got any idea how
shitty my funding is?

309
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,502
No.

more money in a year
than my entire science budget.

312
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,512
Nobody's paying
attention to this work.

313
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,781
Half my grants
don't get approved.

314
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:42,257
I don't have the money to make
my theory into a useable medicine.

315
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,295
How old are your kids?

316
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,890
6 and 8.

317
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:58,809
Look, do yourself a favor.
Go home and spend time with your kids.

318
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,910
Enjoy 'em while they're still here.

319
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,113
How much?

320
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,213
How much what?

321
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,118
How much money would it take
to prove your theory,

322
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,720
to create your version
of the medicine?

323
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,966
I'd need half a million bucks
just to fund the lab work.

324
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,365
That's why you need me.

325
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,098
I need you? Why?

326
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,973
Because I'm the founder of the
Pompe Foundation for Children.

327
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,808
I've been working on this disease
for 10 years.

328
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,577
I have never
heard of you guys.

329
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,619
That's because
we're relatively new.

330
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,149
We're just in
the gearing-up phase.

331
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,150
How soon do you
need a grant?

332
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,890
Now would be good.

333
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:54,329
Well, not all the money's in place,
but it will be, and soon.

334
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,433
This is a very
exciting time.

335
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:12,282
JOHN: Thanks.
DRIVER: Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

336
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,392
Hey.

337
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,668
You okay?

338
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,308
Did you get my messages?

339
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,911
Your messages?

340
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,412
You suddenly walk
out of the meeting

341
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,143
and fly to Nebraska
without talking to me about it,

342
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,379
and you think
messages make it okay?

343
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,580
I'm sorry.
My God, John.

344
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,681
I wanna find a miracle
as much as you do, okay?

345
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,057
But how could you put
your job in jeopardy?

346
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,662
Aileen.
How exactly

347
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,096
do we pay $40,000 a month in healthcare
if you lose your insurance?

348
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,701
Honey, come on.
Look, I'm not gonna lose my job.

349
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,860
Oh, really?

350
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,565
Pete called here twice last night
to ask if you were okay.

351
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,504
You know, mentally.

352
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,870
(SCOFFS)

353
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:21,411
I'll just... I'll call, and I'll
smooth that one over.

354
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,277
Yeah, no shit.

355
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,584
(SIGHS)

356
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,726
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,897
Something in me
just kind of snapped.

358
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:42,270
That night at the hospital, when we
thought that we were losing her,

359
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:51,779
I prayed that if it was her time,

360
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,749
she'd go quickly,
without so much suffering.

361
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,727
But morning came,
and she pulled through.

362
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,457
Her eyes,

363
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,296
so determined, so defiant.

364
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,404
The fight in her.

365
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,474
(SIGHS)

366
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:32,252
Was he worth it?
This Stonehill guy?

367
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,086
He's really eccentric,
but his science

368
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,988
is way ahead of
everybody else's.

369
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,721
He's definitely the one to put
our money on.

370
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,263
(CHUCKLES)
If we had any.

371
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,731
I promised him
that we'd raise some,

372
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,893
because he's got this conference
up here next month,

373
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,335
and I said I'd have
a check ready for him.

374
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,632
How much?
500.

375
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,799
That's all?
Thousand.

376
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,603
Is it $500 or $1,000?

377
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,143
$500,000.

378
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,774
By next month.

379
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,317
(CHUCKLES)

380
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,823
Sweetheart, are you totally insane?

381
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,318
Apparently.

382
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,325
AILEEN: We're holding our first fundraiser
on the 23rd at the school,

383
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,797
and we would love if
you and Frank could join us.

384
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,889
Ready for your spelling test?

385
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,765
I'm gonna nail it.
Okay. Good luck.

386
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,031
My name's John Crowley.
I'm calling from Oregon,

387
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,632
and I got your name from the
Atlanta-area Pompe parents' group.

388
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:26,733
Yeah.

389
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,039
AILEEN: And I was so sorry
not to see you at the reunion

390
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,911
because you were one of my most
favorite people in high school.

391
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,076
(CHUCKLES)

392
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,677
Anyway, John and I
are starting this foundation.

393
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,518
Hey, Dad? Dad.
No, you know what I mean.

394
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,114
Just make it right.
Dad?

395
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,786
Can't you see
I'm on the phone?

396
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,159
Okay, well, tell me he told you.
Dad!

397
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,390
No, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

398
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,830
I can't talk. All right, bye.

399
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,833
Yeah, what is it?
I sold my RipStik.

400
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:51,924
Okay.

401
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,100
Is it enough to give to Megan
and Patrick's foundation?

402
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,041
Yeah, it's more than enough.

403
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,214
Are you John?
Yes.

404
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,908
Marcus Temple.
We spoke on the phone.

405
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,781
Right. Absolutely.
Good to see you.

406
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,378
All the way in from Atlanta.
Yes.

407
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,420
Well, this is for your foundation,

408
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,619
from my relatives,
friends and church group.

409
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,423
Oh! My goodness.

410
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,724
(MARCUS CHUCKLES)

411
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,628
JOHN:
Thank you very much.

412
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,102
Thanks.

413
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,825
Hi, Dr. Stonehill.
I'm Megan.

414
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,396
Hi, Megan.
I'm Dr. Stonehill.

415
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,724
Yeah, that's why I said,
"Hi, Dr. Stonehill."

416
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,129
Are you coming in or not?

417
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,098
Yeah, thanks.

418
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,732
Where's Mom and Dad?

419
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,104
They'll be down
in a minute.

420
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,771
Patrick's vent alarm is going off,
so they need to fix it.

421
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,678
His alarm goes off
even more than mine.

422
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,324
So, what's your deal?
You married?

423
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:25,986
Do you have a wife?

424
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,463
Uh, ex-wives. 2 of 'em.

425
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,193
Yeah? How come?

426
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,030
'Cause I'm so easy
to get along with.

427
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,402
Any other questions?

428
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,133
No. Your turn to ask one.

429
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,467
You're probably wondering
what grade I'm in.

430
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,875
What grade are you in?

431
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,072
I'm in 3rd.

432
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,878
My hobbies are video games and penguins.
How about you?

433
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,119
I already graduated.

434
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,881
No, I mean hobbies.

435
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,246
Oh...

436
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,017
Mostly I just work.

437
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,459
Little bass fishing
every once in a while, but...

438
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,197
What's your favorite subject?

439
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:06,667
I'm good at reading, but I like P.E. best,
especially the sprint races.

440
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:07,999
Sprint races?

441
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,403
Wanna see?

442
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,565
Sure.

443
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,179
Come on.

444
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:20,977
Is he here yet?

445
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,143
I don't know.

446
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,063
I'm gonna win!

447
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,665
Come on, slowpoke.

448
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,699
Yeah, I won!

449
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,738
(CHUCKLES)
I won.

450
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,841
Oh, yeah.

451
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,707
Told you I'm gonna beat you.

452
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,009
Hi.

453
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,877
Dr. Stonehill has 2 ex-wives.

454
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,250
I see that Megan's introduced herself.
Yeah.

455
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,379
How are you, Dr. Stonehill?
I'm okay, thank you.

456
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,424
This is Aileen, my wife.
So nice to meet you.

457
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,493
And John Jr.

458
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,686
Hello.

459
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,057
Here's Patrick.
Hi.

460
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,927
Hey, Patrick.
I think we should probably go inside.

461
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,358
AILEEN:
Yeah, come on inside.

462
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,368
Megan, we'll see you inside.
Come on.

463
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,106
Night, Patrick.
Good night.

464
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,939
Night, SpongeBob.

465
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,570
You gotta say good
night to Dr. Stonehill.

466
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,273
Kiss SpongeBob.

(SQUEAKS)

468
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,257
Good night.
Good night, son.

469
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,555
Good night, Patrick.

470
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,825
I'm not gonna say it again.
It is bedtime now.

471
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,960
It's for him.

472
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,336
AILEEN:
Oh.

473
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,630
Me?

474
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,298
For good luck.
For bass fishing.

475
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,331
Oh, thank you.

476
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,674
You like it?

477
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,905
Well, sure.

478
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,542
A happy-go-lucky little fellow,
lots of personality, huh?

479
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,584
He's a plastic toy.

480
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,516
I know.

481
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,089
JOHN:
Here's the father-daughter dance.

482
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,987
You haven't lived
until you've seen

483
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,582
Megan do the
Wheelchair Watusi.

484
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,161
Here you go.

485
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,526
Go ahead and eat
the cobbler while it's hot.

486
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,223
Smells great, honey.

487
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,858
(LAUGHS)
This was hilarious.

488
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,233
Bob, we went to
this dude ranch.

489
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,672
All right if
I call you Bob?

490
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,365
You got a check for
a half-million dollars,

491
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,339
hell, you can
call me Peggy Sue.

492
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,501
(CHUCKLES)

493
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,371
I'll just...

494
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,317
Well, Bob.

495
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,592
This is the first installment against
the promised half a million.

496
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,673
Tell you the truth,
that's more than I expected.

497
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,874
Dr. Stonehill,
we promise that...

498
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,814
Yeah, I know.
If... In enough time, then...

499
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,887
I know. I know.

500
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,822
You can learn a lot about a person
on the Internet these days.

501
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,384
Learn about a working-class kid
from New Jersey,

502
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,498
worked his way through
Harvard Business School,

503
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,067
clawing his way up the ladder
at Bristol-Myers.

504
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,669
But what Google
can't tell you

505
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,204
is that this scared, desperate,
bullshitting son of a bitch...

506
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,204
Wait just a minute...
Don't interrupt.

507
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,641
Will do and say whatever it takes
to get results.

508
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,043
Which is why you
and me are going

509
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,138
into business
together, Jersey.

510
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,375
Excuse me?

511
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,747
I'm tired of begging breadcrumbs
from the university

512
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,411
and giving them
the patents to my ideas.

513
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,353
They don't value
my work. You do,

514
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,754
which is why I'm
setting up my own shop.

515
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,226
Figure any dude
in a business suit

516
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
can help me raise venture capital
and run the company,

517
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,362
but who's gonna be
half as motivated as

518
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,662
a dad who's trying
to save his own kids?

519
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,067
So, this is...

520
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,673
So this is the shittiest offer
you're ever gonna get.

521
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,734
I can promise you less money,
longer hours, lousy working conditions,

522
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,815
plus, if we raise the money, you're
gonna have to relocate to Nebraska.

523
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,247
(SCOFFS)

524
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,018
Oh, and with
the right business plan,

525
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:22,058
I can also promise you a working
enzyme for Pompe disease.

526
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,158
I can't cure your kids,
you know that.

527
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,127
They're always
gonna be in wheelchairs,

528
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,728
but I think I can save their lives.

529
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,571
Outstanding cobbler.

530
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,975
AILEEN: Okay, okay.
So, we agree we can't uproot the kids.

531
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,944
What if Stonehill fails?

532
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,357
Or what if he succeeds too late
to help Megs and Patrick?

533
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,551
Then what?

534
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,220
I know.

535
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,987
If we're gonna
lose them young,

536
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,362
you want to spend every
minute you can with them.

537
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,505
John, that day that
you flew to Nebraska,

538
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,172
when you suddenly
just ditched work and...

539
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,143
My God, I thought you'd lost it.
You scared me.

540
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,517
But once we
rolled our sleeves up,

541
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,890
and we started fundraising and
meeting other Pompe families,

542
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,667
it made me feel like...

543
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,331
I mean, do we
just accept our fate

544
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:43,032
and do what we're told by
all the well-meaning doctors

545
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,176
and wait for the worst to happen,
or do we fight it?

546
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:54,681
PETE: I think you're making
a mistake. I really do.

547
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:59,382
Even if you were credible as a CEO,
which you are not,

548
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,157
the odds against
you are crushing.

549
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,888
9 out of 10
biotechs crash and burn.

550
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:09,995
So where does that leave your kids
when their dad is flat broke

551
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,162
with no job and no
health insurance?

552
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,530
Now, if you
stay at Bristol,

553
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,937
the guys upstairs
are ready to put you in

554
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,874
the VP slot at the end of
the 3rd quarter

555
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,172
with a 40% salary bump.

556
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,174
John.

557
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,814
Your family's gonna need that money,
aren't they?

558
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,650
Pete, you're right.
This is crazy.

559
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,924
I'm chasing the wind.

560
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,162
But I can't just

561
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,361
sit around and wait
for my kids to die.

562
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:46,828
I can't do it.

563
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,362
AUTOMATED VOICE: You have
arrived at your destination.

564
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,440
Come on in. It's open.

565
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,878
Hey, there, Bob.
Hey, John.

566
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,780
How are you?
You have trouble finding me?

567
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:34,942
No problem.

568
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,116
Sit down.
Thanks.

569
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,829
Ex-wife. She loved cats.

570
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,297
Well, say, what do we...

571
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,903
What are we gonna do?
How about we work up a strategy

572
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,808
for the meeting at
Renzler next week?

573
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,949
We don't need to show
those guys anything.

574
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,784
The meeting's a formality.

575
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,446
George Renzler and I have known
each other since med school.

576
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,356
He's been telling me for years that
he'd give me the seed money

577
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,930
if I ever decide to make the big move
and set up my own shop.

578
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,293
Well, that's good.
That's good,

579
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,593
but, still, all the same, you know,

580
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,667
if we're gonna go in to pitch 'em,

581
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,962
we should have something tangible.

582
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,703
Those guys understand me.
They're real scientists.

583
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,775
They're not like a lot of these
big biotech moneymen.

584
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,472
Okay. All right, tell you what,

585
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
how about if we just talk it through,

586
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,612
and then that way we can just sketch up
something rough on paper?

587
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:44,017
You give it to me,
I'll make up a business plan.

588
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,825
JOHN:
We need to rough out a real strategy.

589
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,194
These guys are venture capitalists.

590
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,027
That rough enough for you?

591
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,631
Bob? Look, Renzler's
crucial to us.

592
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,138
Without them onboard,
we got zero credibility

593
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,832
with any of our investors.
That's why you're here, Jersey!

594
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,502
Whip up some business bullshit
by tomorrow.

595
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,873
I'm going fishing.

596
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,140
This is... This is gibberish!

597
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,345
Then you better get busy.

598
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,850
See you.

599
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,666
JOHN:
As you know, the market potential

600
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,606
for an orphan drug is enormous.

601
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,337
If you were still in business school,
I'd give you an A

602
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:45,711
for all these lovely
charts and graphs and...

603
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,048
But school is out.

604
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,983
Most of us here are scientists.

605
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,112
We need to see the science.

606
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,389
Bob, make us believe.

607
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,925
Love to, George.

608
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,230
(INAUDIBLE)

609
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:18,912
...the phosphotransferase and
the 2nd uncovering enzyme...

610
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,153
STONEHILL: At this point,
the challenge is to scale up this process

611
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,953
to produce kilogram
quantities of HPGAA.

612
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,153
And the question is
whether or not it's cost-effective

613
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:36,733
to contract this work out or to build
our own manufacturing facility.

614
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,098
Either way, we're gonna
eventually need

615
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,967
an investment on
the order of $10 million.

616
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,769
It's a lot of information
in a short period of time.

617
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,537
Does anybody
have any questions?

618
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,613
This is astonishing.
STONEHILL: Well, thank you, George.

619
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,011
This man is light years
ahead of the field.

620
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,708
(CHUCKLES)
Okay.

621
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,945
Well, why don't you have your
money guys get together with John

622
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,783
and work out
the business...

623
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,856
Sounds great.

624
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,357
Of course, we'll need you to explain

625
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,952
some of the mundane stuff, Bob,
the nuts and bolts.

626
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,597
Nuts and bolts? What...
RENZLER: Yeah.

627
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,189
You're a brilliant
theoretician,

628
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,961
but you've never actually
brought a new drug

629
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,969
to market
before, right?

630
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,838
No, I've never brought a drug to market.
I haven't.

(CLEARS THROAT)
I mean, for example,

632
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:21,806
how are you getting
the phosphotransferase?

633
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,604
I'm purifying it out of
a lactating bovine udder.

634
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,543
I see. And where are
you getting the udders?

635
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,223
From the stockyards.

636
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,915
Pretty straightforward stuff.

637
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,014
Not really.

638
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,117
You can't inject cow
protein into people.

639
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,821
I know that.

640
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,557
The bovine version
of the enzyme

641
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,599
is for lab work,
for proof of concept.

642
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,296
I'll make a copy of the human enzyme
for actual drug trials.

643
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,668
What about uncovering enzyme?
What about it?

644
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,502
How exactly do you plan
on making an exact replica?

645
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,908
I'm making it in T-293,
out of human kidney cells.

646
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,774
Oh, my goodness. No.

"Oh, my goodness. No?"

648
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,876
No. The FDA will
never allow that.

how you're planning to make

658

FDA-approved GMP in...

answer a question,

667
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,734
you say you're
working out the details.

You don't storm out
on these guys

669

spoiled child, okay?

670
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,740
Now, we're gonna
go back in there.

671

No, I'm not going

That was personal.

right out of the gate.

Okay, I get that
he's a loose cannon,

678
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,457
but do you still
believe in his science?

679
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:26,366
Honey, if I don't raise
$10 million in capital,

680
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:29,666
his science doesn't
matter. At all.

Hey, buddy, you okay?

00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,847
You all right?
I can't throw them anymore.

684

That's right.

I have a proposal for you,
and I was hopeful

721
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,542
that you could
take a look at it.

Fine. I'll read it in the car.

Of course.

Young ones like risk,

790
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,834
not afraid of new ideas,

791
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,074
and you can pay 'em less.

792
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,047
We all believe in Bob Stonehill's

793
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:30,051
bold vision, otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

794
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:33,918
But to reach clinical
trials inside of a year,

795
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:39,459
I'm gonna have to ask you
to commit to a brutal schedule.

796
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:45,024
Ladies and gentlemen,
reset your watches to Priozyme Time.

797
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,400
How long?

798
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:51,802
3, 4 hours.

799
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,515
Well, if you can get it any quicker,
that'd be good.

800
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,173
NILES:
I'll try.

801
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,489
MAN:
Come on.

802
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,789
STONEHILL: Vinh, check the breakers.
VINH: Got it.

803
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,590
(SWITCH CLICKING)

804
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,601
VINH:
No, the whole building's out.

805
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,864
Well, get the backup
generator going.

806
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,197
We...
Wait, wait, wait.

807
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,970
STONEHILL: You never bothered
to buy a backup generator?

808
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,841
We're in the middle
of tornado country,

809
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,413
for Christ's sake!
Yeah, so I'm a meteorologist?

810
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,210
If I don't have my
refrigeration back

811
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:36,444
in 45 minutes,
I lose the whole cell line.

812
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,714
4 months of work pissed away!

813
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,757
It was never in the budget.
We never had the money for it.

814
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,725
I'm sorry, sir.
Your card, it's been denied.

815
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,490
What?

816
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,723
It got maxed out. I bought
the roller bottle unit for the lab.

817
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,426
Shit, I...

818
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,300
Just pay me back by the end of the month,
or I lose my apartment.

819
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,571
Hi, here you go. Thanks.

820
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:06,943
Yes!

821
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,046
Yes!

822
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,053
DRIVER:
Sir.

823
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,794
Thank you.

824
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:35,266
Fiona's in Mexico this week.
They've got pyramids there.

825
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,470
Mmm-hmm.

826
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,670
She's still got lots of things to see

827
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,613
before she gets to Antarctica.

828
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,414
Yeah.

829
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,657
She's gonna chop up all the
penguins with an ax.

830
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,452
And feed their bloody remains
to the walruses.

831
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:55,963
I see.

832
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:58,856
What?

833
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,995
Every time you come home for the weekend,
you don't even listen to me.

834
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,469
Megs.

835
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,975
You know what,
you're right. I'm sorry.

836
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,578
It's just that
I've been so busy

837
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,876
trying to make the special medicine
for you and Patrick.

838
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,280
I want it pink.

839
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,316
You want what?
The special medicine.

840
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,217
I want it to be pink.

841
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,488
Okay. I guess I can
ask Dr. Stonehill.

842
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:26,152
Tell him dark pink,
like this.

843
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:28,921
Not light pink.
That's for babies.

844
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,160
Okay.

845
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,364
SCIENTIST:
Here you go.

846
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,840
Dr. Renzler, be reasonable.
The company is only 6 months old,

847
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,912
and we are making great progress
towards in vivo testing.

848
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,776
I don't know.
The way the company is burning money...

849
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,213
Well, we've got to get
a leg up on the competition.

850
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,685
You know that Zymagen has far
more spending power than we do.

851
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,018
So, what you're saying,
I should have invested in Zymagen.

852
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,252
No, what I'm saying is, is that
we've got to beat 'em to the punch.

853
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,794
Either that, or scare
them into buying us out.

854
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,396
Well, you're scaring us investors

855
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,160
a hell of a lot more than
you're scaring Zymagen.

856
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,199
You sell the company
to Zymagen,

857
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,897
you're in clinical trials
by the end of the fiscal year,

858
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:12,497
or we pull the plug and cut our losses.
Goodbye.

859
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,339
Hello?

860
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,050
This construct's
looking pretty good,

861
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,785
but we gotta get
better cleavage

862
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,589
between the alpha
and the beta subunits.

863
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,895
Well, what if we
add a furin site

864
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,124
like the one in
uncovering enzyme?

865
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,097
Why would you wanna do that?
Doesn't it have its own...

866
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,327
We need to talk.

867
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,131
I'm busy.
You're always busy.

868
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:42,761
You always wanna talk.

869
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,569
Yeah, we could add furin and try
and cleave it before purification.

870
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

871
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,970
What are you doing?

872
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,070
Giving you a preview...

873
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,308
Guys, would you
excuse us for a minute?

874
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:57,682
of what's going to happen if we
are not in clinical trials in 4 months.

875
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,719
Our investors will
turn out the lights.

876
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,293
Science takes time, Jersey.
Don't they understand?

877
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,193
Yeah, they do.
They can read the Wall Street Journal.

878
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:12,233
They see that Zymagen is testing
3 different Pompe drugs.

879
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,735
They're testing 3 'cause they don't
know what the hell they're doing.

880
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:17,170
I'm testing one 'cause it's the right one!

881
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,400
I know. I believe you, Bob.

882
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,477
Why else do you think
I put up with all your shit?

883
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,807
Look.

884
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:30,718
I want you to go toe-to-toe
with Zymagen's scientists.

885
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:33,516
Prove to them that
your enzyme is best.

886
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,612
I can do that.

887
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,919
That's the reason I've entered
into conversations with them

888
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,755
to buy our company.

889
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,760
You're telling me?
You're not asking me?

890
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:46,232
Oh, come on, Bob.
I am just being fiscally responsible.

891
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,032
Nobody is gonna tell me
how to run my lab!

892
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,667
If I can engineer a deal,
and that is a really big "if,"

893
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:54,801
you're going to
have to forgive me

894
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:56,310
for all the money
I'm gonna make you.

895
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,347
I don't care about money.

896
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,407
I'm a scientist. I care about
more important things than that.

897
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,855
Don't you tell me about more
important things to care about.

898
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,716
Do the math.

899
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:16,029
Either we sell the company
and get a huge cash infusion,

900
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:20,361
or the investors
will shut us down.

901
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,075
Where you going?

902
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:40,623
I'm gonna go take a crap,
if that meets with your fiscal approval.

903
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:03,006
What, they can't drive from
the airport like ordinary people?

904
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,614
Bob, we need to
make this happen.

905
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,744
They're gonna ask us
some tough questions.

906
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:14,350
Don't take 'em personally, all right?
All right?

907
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,527
STONEHILL: These lab results confirm
what I've been preaching for years,

908
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:33,472
that phosphorylation is key
to enzyme absorption.

909
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,812
My theory works for Pompe,

910
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,781
and eventually it'll work for
enzyme replacement therapies

911
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,648
for other lysosomal
storage disorders.

912
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,017
Is it too complicated?

913
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,384
Too complicated?

914
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,923
The number of
variables built into

915
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,323
your approach
are mind-boggling.

916
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,525
I mean, Jesus,
if you get even one piece wrong

917
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,961
in the synthesis,

918
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,124
just one carbohydrate
ends up in the wrong position...

919
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,533
Well, it's gotta be done right,
like anything worth doing.

920
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:04,835
You've never actually gotten
a drug approved.

921
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,136
Isn't it naive to
think you can solve

922
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,609
these kinds of
manufacturing challenges?

923
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,812
(MOUTHING)

924
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,818
You're right, I'm a theory guy.

925
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,987
My head is in the clouds.

926
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,057
Which is why we need you.

927
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,660
Unless, of course,
your reputation for solving

928
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,797
protein-manufacturing
problems is undeserved.

929
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,238
(CHUCKLES)

930
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,441
Nice one.

931
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,877
I still need to hear
about profitability.

932
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,713
JOHN:
Certainly, certainly.

933
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:53,253
As you know, this is not a one-time
treatment. It's a lifelong therapy.

934
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,186
And these patients,

935
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,954
they are going to
generate revenue

936
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,223
over the span of
their lifetime that is...

937
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,764
But even if you
make a usable enzyme,

938
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:05,265
clearly it won't work for all patients.

939
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,993
So, what survival rate do we need
to achieve a robust profit?

940
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:13,131
What rate of patient death
can be defined as acceptable loss?

941
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:16,068
Acceptable loss?

942
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,945
I understand the question.

943
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,124
Because the profit margins
on this orphan drug

944
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,524

Even with
a mortality rate of,

946
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:39,527
say, 25% over 5 years still indicates

947
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,771
that there is a highly lucrative

to see Dr. Renee.

You need a security badge.

I haven't earned it yet.

have a usable enzyme.

Of course.

(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

983
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,273
I've got some pretty good ideas

984
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,439
about how to help
the flow of information

Whoa, John, slow down.
That's not our established procedure.

Pardon me?

988
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,119
The 4 core teams are essentially

989
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,056
in competition with each other.

990
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,319
It's an entrepreneurial
model. It works.

991
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:32,093
I'm all for competition,
but surely there must be some channel

992
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,864
for allowing sharing
scientific insights

993
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,135
that can help develop
all 4 enzymes.

994
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:43,975
John, in the interest of saving us time,
let me be blunt.

995
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,443
Most of the scientists
here don't like the idea

996
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,646
of having a non-scientist
as senior VP of the Pompe program.

997
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,180
Especially one whose objectivity

998
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:59,055
might be clouded by having children
with the disease.

999
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:03,393
I'm telling you this in your own
best interests.

1000
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,299
Erich wanted to buy
Stonehill's ideas,

1001
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,336
and he couldn't do
that without also

1002
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:10,667
swallowing you as
part of the pill.

1003
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:17,872
My advice to you, John,
is to keep your head down.

1004
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,442
Thank you for that wisdom.

This is my lab now! Get out!

explain the protocol!

1010
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,499
Dr. Stonehill...
Shoo!

1011
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
Fine.
Shoo.

1012
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,540
What do you want?

1013
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:52,612
I just dropped by
to say that I think

1014
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,410
that we might be
missing an opportunity

1015
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,281
to open a dialogue with
the other 3 core teams.

1016
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,947
The other core teams?
Core teams.

1017
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,580
Core bullshit.

1018
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,789
I'll come back another time.

1019
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,592
DR. WALDMAN: The decline in muscle
strength is very troubling, of course,

1020
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,068
but it's really,
in both kids,

1021
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:20,734
the organ enlargement, the liver,
and especially the heart,

1022
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,641
that's the real
threat to their lives.

1023
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,643
We'll continue to monitor
the rate of cardiac enlargement.

1024
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,148
We'll keep tabs on
their other organs...

JOHN: Please.

Dr. Waldman,
we won't hold you to it.

know something.

all bets are off,

that people ask me all the time

is how we have 2 kids with Pompe.

1061

By the time we realized
that Megan had Pompe,

1062
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,423
I was already pregnant
with Patrick.

1063
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,365
I mean, I can't tell you
how many doctors we saw,

1064
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,199
and the message
was always the same,

1065

that there is no drug
to treat Pompe.

that message is changing.

She's a little weak,

Hey, Kent.
John.

1091
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,664
JOHN:
So what did you think of the event?

1092
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:54,515
In medical research, John,
objectivity is key.

1093
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,078
If researchers get all emotional,

1094
01:10:59,221 --> 01:11:03,817
all desperate to help suffering patients,
they'll cut corners.

1095
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,086
It's counterproductive.

1096
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:09,926
Counterproductive is having
4 core teams of scientists

1097
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,625
working together
on the same disease,

1098
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,862
but not talking to each other.

1099
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:18,370
Most of these guys have never even
seen a kid with Pompe before.

1100
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,237
I don't see how
that's relevant.

1101
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:24,574
Did you see Erich? That's the kind
of motivation that we need.

1102
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:26,442
I'm gonna ask him

supposed to build cooperation.

you want your leadership team,

optimistic assumptions

1261
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,057
about where our
enzyme supply will be.

1262
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:15,893
I see.

1263
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:21,259
Well, what do you think
that a more realistic...

1264
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:24,167
John, I'll give to you straight.

1265
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,139
The clinical trial
will be for infants only.

(EXCLAIMS)

1267
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,876
Infants need so
much less enzyme,

1268
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,777
and, as you know,
our initial supply will be so limited.

1269
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:37,946
And the drug has much higher
odds of being effective

1270
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,611
with infants than
with older children.

1271
01:22:40,755 --> 01:22:44,191
We have to consult Erich on this.
We have to consult Erich.

1272
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,626
I already did. He confirmed
the decision. Infants only.

1273
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:51,223
I understand your
personal reasons for...

(SIGHS)

1275

These decisions have to be
made objectively, rationally.

1276
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,569
I'm sorry. I...

1277
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:05,269
I really am.

You're not authorized.

No... I can
explain everything.

01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:33,150
What's the matter, Chuck?
Is there a problem?

1286
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,746
Yeah, there's a problem. I got
Mr. Crowley in here without clearance.

1287
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:38,223
That's my fault, now.

1288
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:40,794
I got busy in the lab,
I sent Jersey boy here

1289
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,420
to get me a couple
jugs of enzyme.

1290
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:45,429
Sorry.

1291
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,068
Thanks, Chuck.

1292

Thanks for saving my ass.

1293
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,080
It's really big of you,

1294
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:13,786
especially after what
went down between us.

1295
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,529
You mean your ruthless,
cold-hearted betrayal?

1296
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:25,830
Yeah, well, when I thought
about it from your point of view...

1297
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,701
Shit, if it was my
kids dying, I wouldn't

1298
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,278
have hesitated to
crush you like a bug.

1299
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,525
Do you remember
when we first met,

1300
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:53,828
and you told me that
I should stop chasing miracles

1301
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,836
and should go home
and enjoy my kids,

1302
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,367
while they're still here?

1303
01:28:05,213 --> 01:28:07,704
Yeah. I made the wrong choice.

1304
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:26,361
Jersey, you know
what a sibling study is?

1305
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:27,892
No.

1306
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:30,163
It's a drug trial with just 2 patients

1307

with the same genetic inheritance.

1308

Megs and Patrick.

1310
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:44,847
Well, would Zymagen
go for something like this?

1311
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,585
There's real research value in it.

1312
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:52,084
And with just two patients,
it wouldn't take much enzyme.

1313
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,889
But Webber would
have to sign off on it.

we've got our ducks in a row.

Excuse me?

We got a call this morning from
Portland Rose Hospital,

1337
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:42,765
about sending them
enzyme for your kids?

1338
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,304
Right. Yeah, I know.
That's what I'm here to talk to you about.

1339
01:30:45,406 --> 01:30:49,240
You and Stonehill set this up behind
my back. Now you come to me.

1340
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,242
It's all tentative.

1341
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:55,475
You want this company
to sponsor a drug study,

1342
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:59,883
for 2 children whose father
is an executive of this company?

1343
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,012
Have you never heard the term
"conflict of interest?"

1344
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:03,249
It has nothing to do with a...

1345
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,188
Do you know what the FDA
would do if they found out?

1346
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,626
There is strong scientific justification
for this study.

1347
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,458
There is great research value.

1348

I'm a doctor, John.
I know the research value!

1349
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:17,766
But you guys just can't go off
half-cocked without consulting us!

1350
01:31:17,905 --> 01:31:19,668
And I'm sure that if we just go
and talk to Erich, we can...

1351
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,366
Erich already knows.

1352
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,671
He's furious about
being blindsided.

1353
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:25,311
I didn't try to
blindside anyone.

1354
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:29,008
This is the reason why
we have a reporting structure,

01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,950
why we have established procedure,
why there is protocol.

the kids with Pompe
to the doorstep!

1360
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,465
You weren't thinking
about those kids

1361
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,967
when you put your
children into that program

a decade's worth of

made by this company!

1364

This is not about
a return on an investment!

1365
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:58,540
It's about kids,

1366
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:02,143

I may well be a tight-ass

The reason we're terminating

is to eliminate the
conflict of interest.

01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:15,737
Why is Mommy sad?

1417
01:35:16,811 --> 01:35:19,609
Not sad, baby, so happy.

1418
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:24,281
So happy.

1419
01:35:24,385 --> 01:35:26,285
Why is Mommy being so weird?

1420
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:29,015
Well, it's because
we got the special medicine

1421
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:30,783
for you, Megs,
and for you, Patrick,

1422
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:32,118
and you're gonna
get it really soon.

1423
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:34,126
(GASPS) JOHN JR.:
That's great!

1424
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:52,278
So, who wants to
push the button?

1425
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,524
JOHN:
Megs, Patrick, you ready?

1426
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:29,979
When will we know if it's working?

1427
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:32,143
It'll be a while, honey.

1428
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,845
It's not pink.

1429
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:16,827
Excuse me?
Your Uncle Bobby is here.

1430
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:18,325
Huh?

1431
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:19,922
I don't know.

1432
01:37:27,007 --> 01:37:28,235
You can go back if you like.

1433
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,637
Okay.

1434
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:37,141
John.
Uncle Bobby.

1435
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,447
They wouldn't let me in
unless I was family.

1436
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:45,920
Some things for the kids.

1437
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:47,251
Thanks.

1438
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:48,953
Sleeping, huh?

1439
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:56,326
Hey, thanks for coming.

1440
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:03,401
I'm a scientist.
Gotta track the experiment.

1441
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:16,311
JOHN: I wish your enzyme was
the one that passed the test.

1442
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:19,452
But the one the kids are getting,

1443
01:38:19,793 --> 01:38:22,455
it's the right one, right? I mean...

1444
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:24,997
It's gonna help them.

1445
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,928
Yeah, you guys have done
everything humanly possible.

1446
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,271
We just have to see
what the tests show.

1447
01:38:39,013 --> 01:38:41,914
JOHN:
You and I have had our differences,

1448
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:45,508
and I just want you
to know something.

1449
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:48,111
I want you to know that...

1450
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,985
Yeah.
Don't interrupt.

1451
01:38:50,124 --> 01:38:51,352
Okay.

1452
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:57,020
I want you to know
that I appreciate everything

1453
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:59,029
that you've done
for Megs and Patrick,

1454
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:02,761
and I'm never gonna forget it
for the rest of my life.

1455
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:08,441
Not gonna kiss me, is he?

1456
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:10,442
I will restrain him.

1457
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:13,540
Don't tempt me.

1458
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:20,684
PATRICK: Daddy loves SpongeBob,
Daddy loves SpongeBob.

1460
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,561
MEGAN: Stop!
PATRICK: Daddy loves SpongeBob.

1461
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:37,068
Guys?

1462
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:40,367
(CHUCKLES)
What's going on?

1463
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:43,504
What's so funny?

1464
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,738
(CHUCKLES)
What are you laughing at?

1465
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,243
What are you laughing at?

1466
01:39:52,119 --> 01:39:53,416
Sugar.

1467
01:39:57,124 --> 01:39:58,921
It's a sugar high.

1468
01:40:00,027 --> 01:40:03,394
The enzyme's breaking down
the sugar in their muscles.

1469
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:04,963
The medicine's working?

1470
01:40:05,065 --> 01:40:06,225
Yeah.

1471
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:08,762
John.

1472
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:19,005
Megs!

1473
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:20,505
Hi.
