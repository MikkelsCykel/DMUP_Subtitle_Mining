1
00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:04,097
I believe you.

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,658
Your child will need a father.

3
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,932
I will declare him as my own.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,071
People, they will not look at you the same.

5
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:17,011
They will not look at us the same.

6
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:19,071
You are my wife.

7
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:24,349
I am your husband.
That is all anyone need know.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,129
And after this...

9
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:39,225
there shall arise a star from Jacob.

10
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:43,197
And a man shall arise like the sun...

11
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,370
walking with the sons of men
in gentleness and righteousness.

12
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:52,672
This is the shoot of God most high.

13
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:56,310
This is the fountain of life,
of all humanity.

14
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:01,087
You see, Gaspar...

15
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:03,956
that's why we follow the star.

16
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,537
Rome is requesting a census.

17
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,481
Each man to return
to the place of his birth.

18
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:03,041
Such an order will lead to unrest.

19
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,178
The people whisper
of rebellion even now.

20
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:07,189
It is the will of Caesar.

21
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:09,521
My father lost his life...

22
00:02:09,558 --> 00:02:11,287
because he failed to see the threat...

23
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:13,693
that was mounting against him.

24
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:16,425
From his own people.

25
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:20,060
Now, all it will take is one man.

26
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:25,096
One man to convince the people
he is their Messiah.

27
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,578
The prophet said this man will rise
from the house of David.

28
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:36,646
This census
would bring him back home.

29
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,422
Have your soldiers and your spies...

30
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:44,620
keep watch for a man
returning to Bethlehem.

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,719
A man of power.

32
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:49,162
A man the people will follow.

33
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:02,674
Town of Nazareth...

34
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,771
in the name of King Herod
and the almighty Caesar...

35
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:10,911
you are ordered to participate
in a census of all people.

36
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:15,913
Each man will return
to the land of his ancestors...

37
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,051
along with each member of his family.

38
00:03:18,093 --> 00:03:20,220
And what if it's a four-day journey?

39
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:23,129
Then you would be wise to leave soon.

40
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,293
You have one month!

41
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,895
And any resistance will be dealt with.

42
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,243
A census can only mean one thing.

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,373
More taxes for Herod.

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,316
- Does that surprise you?
- Ha ha!

45
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:44,615
I cannot register here.

46
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:47,955
The order was for each man...

47
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,619
to travel to the place of his ancestors.

48
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,423
I must go to Bethlehem.

49
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,863
But the journey to Bethlehem
is more than a hundred miles.

50
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:58,958
I know.

51
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,367
For me and for each member of my family.

52
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:05,164
They will allow her to stay.

53
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,971
- They cannot expect you...
- They will allow nothing.

54
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,773
Mother...

55
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:11,336
the days before my child comes...

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,473
are greater than those of this journey.

57
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:14,948
There is time.

58
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:18,818
That is a question
for God to decide, not you.

59
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:26,619
I'm going with my husband.

60
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,358
Then you must leave in the morning.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,992
Take the animal.

62
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:34,730
No. No.

63
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,738
Take it, Joseph.

64
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:40,268
Thank you.

65
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:45,574
I will protect
your daughter and the child...

66
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:47,809
with all that I am, I promise you.

67
00:04:55,357 --> 00:04:58,520
There is no well
before the Sea of Galilee.

68
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,221
Here.

69
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,061
Mary.

70
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,589
You're a strong young woman.

71
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:07,693
- Thank you, Father.
- Go.

72
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:14,736
Ha ha!

73
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,090
They're going to miss us.

74
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:34,493
Yes.

75
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:24,639
Yes, come.

76
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,752
For you.

77
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:04,345
He's moving.

78
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:16,929
You've never really told me of your dream.

79
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,628
My dream?

80
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:24,432
No.

81
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:26,464
No, please.

82
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,908
Tell me.

83
00:07:31,346 --> 00:07:34,782
The angel came to me...

84
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:37,911
and he told me the child within you...

85
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:42,219
had been conceived by the Holy Spirit.

86
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:45,192
And that I should not be afraid.

87
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:48,226
Are you afraid?

88
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,792
Yes. Are you?

89
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,802
Yes.

90
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,833
Do you ever wonder when we'll know?

91
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,900
Know? Know what?

92
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:04,970
When he's more than just a child.

93
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:09,011
Will it be something he says?

94
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,545
A look in his eye?

95
00:08:13,522 --> 00:08:15,649
I wonder if...

96
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:18,683
I will even be able
to teach him anything.

97
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,372
I have a snake.

98
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:14,075
It was good we brought one more camel...

99
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:16,380
or that might be your dinner.

100
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,617
Perhaps we should have brought another.

101
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:21,919
The journey would be more bearable.

102
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:23,549
Tell me, Gaspar...

103
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:26,186
how many days has it been
since we departed?

104
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,856
One hundred and four.

105
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:30,159
And how many of those days...

106
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:34,294
have you spoken with regret
for having journeyed with us?

107
00:09:34,336 --> 00:09:37,169
One hundred and five.

108
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,604
Huh?

109
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,130
I'm counting tomorrow.

110
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:41,665
Aha.

111
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,443
Stop.

112
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,279
Where are you headed?

113
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:56,223
From Nazareth to Bethlehem.

114
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:57,850
Bethlehem?

115
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,554
Search him.

116
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,941
Go.

117
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,241
He's not the one.

118
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:32,287
Goats!

119
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,956
Shout in triumph,
O daughter of Judea.

120
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:39,058
Behold, your king is coming to you.

121
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:41,865
He is just and endowed with salvation...

122
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:45,964
and his dominion
will be from sea to sea...

123
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:49,307
and from the river
to the ends of the earth.

124
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:53,371
And he shall speak peace
unto the heathens.

125
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:03,286
Almonds! I have almonds!

126
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:11,062
Olives!

127
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:16,327
Yes, yes, lovely...

128
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,963
- For you.
- No.

129
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:18,973
No, no. For you.

130
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:20,770
For your child.

131
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:22,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

132
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:32,618
You carry him like a son.

133
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:41,862
To see yourself in a young face,
there is no greater joy.

134
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:58,338
Behold, your king
is coming to you. He is...

135
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,474
- Help, help! Soldiers!
- Soldiers!

136
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:03,108
And his dominion will be...

137
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:04,413
- From sea to sea...
- Silence!

138
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:05,852
In the name of King Herod...

139
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,913
And from the river
to the ends of the Earth.

140
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:11,790
Aaaaaaaah!

141
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:17,788
I will end this threat to my rule,
as I will all threats.

142
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:43,424
Pass your sins onto the animal.

143
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,111
Aaaaaaaah!

144
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,521
Their animal is weak.

145
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:23,146
For the first time in 3,000 years...

146
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:25,618
all 3 will appear to touch.

147
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:44,530
Mm.

148
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,444
Mm.

149
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:02,616
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh-shh.

150
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,955
What? More?

151
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,585
No, no, no.

152
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:09,392
I am the hungry one, not you.

153
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:40,184
If I am doing your will,
I pray you'll give me a sign.

154
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:36,243
Hm. Come on.

155
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,945
Come.

156
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:52,059
Come on. Come.

157
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,866
Come on.

158
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:02,299
- Aaah!
- Aah!

159
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:09,472
Uhh!

160
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:11,781
- Joseph!
- Mary!

161
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,481
Joseph!

162
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:15,954
Mary!

163
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:19,780
Joseph.

164
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:58,122
My child, you will have
a good and decent man to raise you.

165
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,890
A man who will give of himself
before anyone else.

166
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:18,241
Ha ha ha!

167
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:39,523
Jerusalem.

168
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,437
The holy city.

169
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,322
Almonds here!

170
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:03,790
Fresh-picked almonds!

171
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:06,953
Some jewelry for your beautiful wife.

172
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:09,293
That's a good animal.

173
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,195
Would your husband
be willing to sell him?

174
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:13,826
No.

175
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,928
What belongs to us stays with us.

176
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:27,112
Almonds. Almonds.

177
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,113
For sacrifice.

178
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:37,788
Doves! Golden doves!
No blemishes.

179
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:40,316
For you. Good for sacrifice.

180
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:46,925
- Herod, Herod!
- Herod's here!

181
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:47,957
It is the king!

182
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,264
The king. The king is here!

183
00:21:50,905 --> 00:21:54,170
- Shh. It is him.
- The king.

184
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:10,457
No, no. No.

185
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:16,227
Pigeons. Pigeons for sacrifice.

186
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:17,993
Good pigeons!

187
00:22:18,032 --> 00:22:21,433
- Pigeons!
- Pigeons for sacrifice.

188
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:23,061
No blemishes!

189
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:25,504
No. Enough! No.

190
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,811
This was meant to be a holy place.

191
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:42,914
Bethlehem. This way.

192
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:09,115
These shepherds...

193
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:12,516
they live alone most of their lives.

194
00:23:19,594 --> 00:23:22,119
Your woman looks cold.

195
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:25,930
Just for a moment.

196
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:35,199
I will tell our child about you.

197
00:23:36,244 --> 00:23:38,644
About your kindness.

198
00:23:39,847 --> 00:23:44,443
My father told me a long time ago...

199
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:47,818
that we are all given something.

200
00:23:47,855 --> 00:23:50,050
A gift.

201
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:55,424
Your gift is what you carry inside.

202
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,131
What was your gift?

203
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,934
Nothing.

204
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:08,430
Nothing but the hope of waiting for one.

205
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:17,242
We must go if we're to reach
Bethlehem by dark.

206
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:25,252
We thank you.

207
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:35,600
- Good for sacrifice.
- Good pigeons.

208
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:38,833
- Good pigeons for sacrifice.
- One half shekel.

209
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,137
One half shekel!

210
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,639
What brings you here?

211
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:45,578
We are visitors from the East.

212
00:24:45,613 --> 00:24:47,604
We follow the star.

213
00:24:50,551 --> 00:24:52,109
The star of the prophecy.

214
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:53,711
The prophecy of the Messiah?

215
00:24:53,754 --> 00:24:54,618
- The Messiah!
- Messiah!

216
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,955
Come. All of you.

217
00:24:57,992 --> 00:25:01,018
Magi. The wisest of the wise.

218
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,627
Tell me what they claim.

219
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:07,657
They believe that a new king
awaits them now in Judea.

220
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,969
Father, we must send
your soldiers to follow them...

221
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,032
until they find the man we seek.

222
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:17,909
And raise their suspicions?

223
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:20,413
Then we risk not finding this king at all.

224
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:26,715
Invite them to dine with us.

225
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:31,414
Your arrival
is by the hand of Providence.

226
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:35,259
For years I have studied
the words of the prophets.

227
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:38,925
"Out of Bethlehem shall come a ruler...

228
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:42,060
"who shall shepherd my people, Israel."

229
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:45,368
Your Excellency, I, too,
have studied these words.

230
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:49,900
I have waited a lifetime
for the signs I now see.

231
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:51,935
As have many.

232
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:57,208
This star, the one
that you have followed...

233
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:00,152
tell me, what does it mean?

234
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,655
The prophecy speaks of a child...

235
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,184
Heralded by the star we have followed
these many months.

236
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:08,957
What do you mean, a child?

237
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:12,955
Are you not here seeking a man?

238
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,198
A man ready
to proclaim himself Messiah?

239
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,728
No.

240
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:21,367
A child.

241
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:25,436
A Messiah for the lowest of men
to the highest of kings.

242
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,944
We, too, have been waiting
for God's king.

243
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,978
For years.

244
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,985
When you find him...

245
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:46,830
please return to us so that
we may come worship him as well.

246
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:06,951
Joseph, the child is pressing.

247
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:08,421
The child...

248
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:11,584
- Now?
- Now.

249
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,423
Yes. We're very close.

250
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,867
Bethlehem.

251
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:27,567
We're here.

252
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,042
We will find a place.

253
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,140
I promise.

254
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,788
God be with you.

255
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:49,887
Is there a place
for my wife and me to stay?

256
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,864
I'm sorry, there is no room here.

257
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,568
Please. Please!

258
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:06,512
Is there an inn?
Is there a place for us?

259
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:08,014
My wife, she's in pain.

260
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,279
- Is there a place for us?
- No!

261
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:14,846
- Open the door!
- Go away!

262
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,015
Help!

263
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:19,618
Please, Lord,
will you not provide for us?

264
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,992
Is there someone? Help us!

265
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:23,394
Leave us alone!

266
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:26,696
Joseph! Joseph!

267
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:29,066
Mary! Mary!

268
00:28:30,838 --> 00:28:32,499
Uhh.

269
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:40,369
Help!

270
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:43,341
I beg you!

271
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:47,252
I ask not your home,
but any place you have!

272
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:50,086
It's all I can do.

273
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:19,584
Melchior, Gaspar.

274
00:29:26,727 --> 00:29:29,321
A star shall come forth.

275
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,836
Oh.

276
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:49,373
- Oh!
- Aaaaah!

277
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:51,850
Aaah!

278
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,547
Sorry.

279
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,130
Aaaah!

280
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:20,937
Aaaah! Aah!

281
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,980
Aaah! Aah! Aaaah!

282
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:36,556
- Oh, Mary!
- Aaaah!

283
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,463
Oh! Oh!

284
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:45,863
Ha ha ha!

285
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,416
Oh, Mary! Ha ha ha!

286
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,658
How is your faith now?

287
00:32:33,781 --> 00:32:37,239
Rejoice.

288
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:38,945
Rejoice.

289
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:43,450
I bring you good tidings of great joy.

290
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,890
For unto you is born this day...

291
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:51,592
in the city of David,
a savior who is Christ the Lord.

292
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:58,663
You will find a child wrapped
in cloths and lying in a manger.

293
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,277
Are you well?

294
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,847
I have been given the strength I prayed for.

295
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,149
Strength from God.

296
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:30,025
And from you.

297
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:57,984
He is for all mankind.

298
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:13,324
We are each given a gift.

299
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:03,839
The greatest of kings,
born in the most humble of places.

300
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:16,792
God...

301
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,355
made into flesh.

302
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:49,558
Gold for the king of kings.

303
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:10,608
Frankincense for the priest of all priests.

304
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:55,520
A gift of myrrh to honor thy sacrifice.

305
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,272
If I am right, and I usually am...

306
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:22,509
perhaps we should keep
what we have seen to ourselves.

307
00:40:36,563 --> 00:40:39,930
We shall not return to Herod.

308
00:40:50,677 --> 00:40:55,512
What if your soldiers
were to go to Bethlehem...

309
00:40:55,549 --> 00:41:01,146
and find every young boy there
under two years?

310
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:06,519
What would happen
to their new Messiah then?

311
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:29,547
The prophecy will end tonight, Father.

312
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:33,610
The sons of Bethlehem shall be no more.

313
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:48,825
A child for the lowest of men
to the highest of kings.

314
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,201
Arise, Joseph.

315
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:57,267
Huh?

316
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,391
Look over there!

317
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:55,997
Take the child and his mother...

318
00:42:56,036 --> 00:42:58,766
and flee to Egypt...

319
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:01,899
and remain there until I bring you word.

320
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:30,603
The Almighty has done great things.

321
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,374
And holy is his name.

322
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:42,640
He has shown strength with his arm.

323
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:49,084
He has scattered the proud.

324
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:00,356
He has filled
the hungry with good things.

325
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,601
And the rich,
he has sent away empty.

326
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:17,842
He has brought down rulers
from their thrones...

327
00:44:20,954 --> 00:44:24,048
...and has exalted
those who were humble.

328
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:28,117
~... Hallelujah ~

329
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:41,473
~ Christus natus est ~

330
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:52,942
