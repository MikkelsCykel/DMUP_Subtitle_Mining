1
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:37,708
I love it here.

2
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,971
I know you do.

3
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,019
I can feel my life, you know?

4
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:28,621
... pitch to Aderberg, and fall over
the outside corner of the field.

5
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:32,888
He was expecting a home run.
Pryor didn't say anything.

6
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,691
-Morning, Dr. Fowler.
-Morning, Natalie.

7
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,867
-How you doing, boys?
-Great!

8
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:12,502
Hey, Duncan,
sure you don't wanna go?

9
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,332
-You wanna get in here?
-No, he wants to stay here.

10
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,906
Scootch up,
get in the middle there.

11
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:20,543
Come on.

12
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:22,577
-Bye, Dr. Fowler.
-Bye.

13
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,011
You don't wanna wave goodbye?

14
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,208
You don't wanna wave goodbye?

15
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,379
Sweetie, what do you
want for breakfast?

16
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,984
Cereal.

17
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,751
...WEPI, Red Sox Radio Network.

18
00:03:35,961 --> 00:03:38,259
You've been listening
to Red Sox Replay.

19
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:42,627
The USS Camden repeat broadcast
of Boston Red Sox baseball...

20
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,564
has been brought to you by
George C. Hollison of Rockland...

21
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:48,501
In business in Midwest since 1940.

22
00:05:15,427 --> 00:05:17,156
There you go.

23
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:06,570
Oh, boy!

24
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,243
You see what happened
to this poor fella?

25
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:13,417
-What?
-Well, look. He lost an arm.

26
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:17,347
The trap has nylon nets
called "heads".

27
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:21,958
Two side heads
to let the lobster crawl in.

28
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:26,693
And inside, what 's called
a bedroom head holds the bait...

29
00:06:26,898 --> 00:06:30,390
and keep him from escaping.
You know the old saying:

30
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:33,571
"Two's company, three's a crowd"?
Well, it 's like that.

31
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:38,935
More than two of these in a bedroom
and something like that 's happen.

32
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:42,408
That 's why Frank can't leave
these traps for more than a day.

33
00:06:42,614 --> 00:06:44,912
Dad. Show him this one.

34
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:51,686
Now, the older females,
like this old gal...

35
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,819
are the most dangerous especially
when they're growing berries.

36
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:58,425
-Berries?
-Yeah, eggs.

37
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,098
She can take out two males,
no problem.

38
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,699
That 's when you get
a lobster you can't sell.

39
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,663
But this fine lady,
she has it easy...

40
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:11,170
because the state says
we have to let her go.

41
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,645
Okay, now...

42
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,080
you think you can handle this?

43
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,316
Are you sure?

44
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:25,284
Okay, go ahead.

45
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,424
Put him in the tank.

46
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,757
Good!

47
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:33,860
-Higher, higher!
-Higher!

48
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,555
I'll swing you higher.

49
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,295
-Is that high enough?
-Yep.

50
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,937
-Ruth hates these.
-What?

51
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:51,980
-I got the wrong kind of buns.
-Maybe we could borrow hers.

52
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:59,751
What I would give
to have back my youth.

53
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,825
Well, Willis,
you never had that in your youth.

54
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:05,488
You can go play.

55
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:11,735
Father, you made it.

56
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:15,872
If I don't get to see you fellas
here, I don't get to see you at all.

57
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,144
You want a beer?

58
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:26,544
No. I'm gonna go see if
you mom needs any help, okay?

59
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,776
All right, good luck.

60
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:56,870
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything here?

61
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:00,848
-You can hand me that bowl, dear.
-Great.

62
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:04,715
-This one here?
-Yes, thank you.

63
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:13,054
I'm looking forward
to that concert on Labor Day.

64
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,596
The music's so unusual.

65
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:18,429
It 's haunting, really.

66
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,864
It is, isn't it?

67
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:27,044
How did you learn about that...

68
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,878
...style?
-At Brown.

69
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:34,108
I did my thesis on
Eastern European folk music.

70
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:37,345
-I thought about becoming a teacher.
-Why didn't you?

71
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,455
Mommy.

72
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:43,223
-Yeah, what are you eating?
-Nothing.

73
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:45,988
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

74
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:47,661
Swing me, swing me!

75
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:51,267
Okay, I'll swing you, Dunc.
I'll be right back.

76
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:54,700
-So Mr. Strout mentioned you again.
-I'll bet he did.

77
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:58,342
Still talks about you. Says you're
the best can-packer he ever had.

78
00:09:58,543 --> 00:10:00,170
Says you looked cute
in that hairnet.

79
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:04,371
Excuse me, boys. An offering.
Here, Father. Thank you.

80
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:07,380
That 's what Charles Senior
is doing and...

81
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:11,248
Becky went to the hairdressing
academy after high school.

82
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,917
Of course, after she got married...

83
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,458
she decided she wanted to stay home
with the boys, you know.

84
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:20,453
She still loves doing hair, though.

85
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,596
Where do you go, Father?

86
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:26,133
I just go to Supercuts.

87
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:30,272
You can't request
the same girl at Supercuts.

88
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:32,966
The boys are having a great time.

89
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,169
It was good of you
to do this for them.

90
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,113
She hasn't brought them before cause
she's embarrassed. She shouldn't be.

91
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:43,687
I wish you hadn't put up
that monstrosity.

92
00:10:43,888 --> 00:10:46,823
-We'll have to take it apart later.
-The swing?

93
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:48,549
The swing.

94
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,422
Come on, Ruth! He's a kid.
What do you expect?

95
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:54,962
"Happy birthday, here's a box.
Drag it around for a while!"

96
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,294
He's a kid, he's like me.
He wants it now.

97
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:02,134
Oh, the cake!

98
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:09,710
Great.

99
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:20,783
-Happy birthday, boy. Come here!
-Daddy, Daddy!

100
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:23,050
Yeah, Duncan!

101
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:26,792
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

102
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:30,991
Happy birthday, dear Duncan
Happy birthday to...

103
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:33,136
Mom, I don't wanna go.

104
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:35,472
Mom, I don't wanna go.

105
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,402
Shit. What 's he doing here?

106
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,872
Hey, Jase.
Come on over here, buddy.

107
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:49,153
Daddy's taking us to the arcade.

108
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,788
I told you he'd come, buttface.

109
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:56,687
Jason, don't do that to your
brother. Want me to do that to you?

110
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:59,419
We're supposed to meet
at the house at 6:30.

111
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,656
I thought we were meeting here.

112
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,027
Alright.

113
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:09,798
You're welcome to stay and
have some food. My dad's cooking.

114
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:20,709
Matt?

115
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:26,013
Should we do something?

116
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:28,715
No. It 's okay.

117
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,794
Well...

118
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:40,568
...l'll see you later, then.
-Okay.

119
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:43,665
A little while.

120
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,974
She's not divorced yet, you know.

121
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:57,052
It 's the same thing.
Maine has crazy laws, that 's all.

122
00:12:57,722 --> 00:12:59,781
Anyway, he loves her boys.

123
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:05,019
-God, you don't think...
-No, he's not gonna marry her.

124
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:07,493
Well, then what 's he doing
with her?

125
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,929
She probably loves him.

126
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:13,626
Girls always have.
Let 's just leave it at that.

127
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,733
Well, he won't listen to me.

128
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:20,809
I've asked him 3 times
to dismantle that swing set.

129
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:25,506
Leave it up. Looks like
ayoung couple lives here.

130
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,252
Well, he needs his head
in school, not in her.

131
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:33,646
So to speak.

132
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:39,755
It would help
if you were on my side.

133
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,094
I can be on your side.

134
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:48,428
I've got a needle!

135
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,233
-I've got a needle!
-You don't need those.

136
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:06,346
Mr. and Mrs. Adamson?

137
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,716
You can put your shirt back on now.

138
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:14,631
Yesterday he was up and around
all afternoon...

139
00:14:14,832 --> 00:14:16,800
but today he tumbled.

140
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:21,934
He's fallen twice, I have all
I can do to get him up.

141
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,698
He's weak.

142
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:27,001
Said when he couldn't work no more,
he didn't want to live.

143
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:29,941
So, for awhile he sat
and just mended our nets...

144
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:32,013
but he can't do that no more.

145
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:35,845
-How's you dad, Matt?
-Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.

146
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:40,251
Now, Elwyn, you remember. Jesse
Fowler passed away awhile ago.

147
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,449
We were at his funeral, remember?

148
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,895
Back in an hour, Janelle.
I forgot my lunch.

149
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,590
Starting to become a habit.

150
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:59,767
You just missed him, Matt!
He went home for lunch today.

151
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:03,045
Right. I forgot,
he's got an interview.

152
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:06,846
Frank?

153
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,880
Hello?

154
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:11,148
Frank?

155
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:14,023
Yeah, Dad.

156
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:19,859
What are you doing here? I thought
you were in Boston for an interview.

157
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:21,998
No. It was rescheduled.

158
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,327
Hi, Dr. Fowler.

159
00:15:28,506 --> 00:15:30,030
Oh, hi.

160
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,933
Where are the boys?

161
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:35,639
They're with my mom.

162
00:15:42,153 --> 00:15:43,916
Do you like coleslaw?

163
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,565
Have some more.

164
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,526
You sure?

165
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,251
We gotta...

166
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,787
Come on, son!

167
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:21,888
-There, I see him right there!
-Hands up, chin up.

168
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,823
-Mom, I want to play!
-All right, all right.

169
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,192
-Mom, there's Frank!
-Here's your hat.

170
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,797
Wave, you guys.

171
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,768
-Mom, hurry up, I'm late!
-I'm hurrying.

172
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,565
-Mom, I want to play.
-All right, you'll play too.

173
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,243
But first watch...

174
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:44,676
Frank, did you tell your mom
how good it was?

175
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,508
How good what was?

176
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:49,447
Frank had quite a time
this afternoon.

177
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,718
Loved you coleslaw.
Ate enough for two.

178
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,085
Well, that 's what it 's for.

179
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:58,991
-Hot dogs?
-Yeah, I'll take one.

180
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:08,364
So, how are the kids?
Things okay?

181
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,174
Yeah, they're fine.

182
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,605
Good. That 's good.

183
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:16,275
How was your interview?

184
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:20,213
-It was great.
-Good.

185
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:25,253
Jason? Jason!

186
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:27,286
Here!

187
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:33,053
-She's such a brave girl.
-That 's it. You're driving me nuts.

188
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:35,288
I've had lots of girlfriends and...

189
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:38,593
I don't understand why
this one's any different.

190
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:41,235
I know you don't.

191
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,300
We're not serious, Ma.

192
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:50,176
No?

193
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,110
No.

194
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:56,244
It 's a summer thing.

195
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:58,684
I see.

196
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,851
-How'd did you get in this time?
-Chimney.

197
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,061
Thank you.

198
00:18:44,435 --> 00:18:46,733
What can I help you with?

199
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:49,765
I was just dropping that off
for Jason.

200
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,566
What?

201
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,368
That.

202
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,841
I didn't know where
he'd want to put it.

203
00:18:57,882 --> 00:19:01,443
It 's about time he got it.
What am I gonna do with it?

204
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:05,418
It 's really gonna mean a lot to him.
He's really been improving lately.

205
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:07,648
Yeah, so I heard.

206
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,886
It would have been nice
if you'd come to his game.

207
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:13,325
Well, I just got your message.

208
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:18,224
Where are they? With him?

209
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,699
That 's none of your business.

210
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:25,171
They're my boys,
but they're none of my business.

211
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,570
You know what I mean.

212
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:33,814
I was thinking about moving back.

213
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:37,252
Here. With you and the boys.

214
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,216
What are you talking about?

215
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,983
What am I talking about?
About moving back, that 's what.

216
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:50,164
I know what you're thinking.
It 's different now.

217
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,802
How's the job? Your father take
you back on at the cannery?

218
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:02,071
That 's funny.
Still getting checks, aren't you?

219
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,180
Do I have to call
my father's accountant?

220
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:10,219
Did you see my new rig out there?

221
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:12,416
It 's really nice.

222
00:20:12,623 --> 00:20:16,150
It 's not exactly new.
I traded David the truck for it.

223
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,452
Got room for all of us.
Good grocery-getting car.

224
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,965
You wanna take a ride?

225
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,765
Richard, you don't change.
You don't change, do you?

226
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,109
Change? No.

227
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,613
No, I don't change.

228
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:40,581
Everything around me changes.

229
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,446
You change.

230
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:45,480
You take my house...

231
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:48,187
and you take my kids...

232
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:51,158
and you fuck this other guy.

233
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,592
But me, I don't change at all.

234
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:57,229
-It 's not your house.
-Oh, really?

235
00:20:57,434 --> 00:21:00,028
No. And as far fucking goes...

236
00:21:00,237 --> 00:21:02,296
who answered the phone
the other morning?

237
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:05,942
-She...
-Doesn't matter! It 's not working!

238
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:12,309
Nat, I just want a chance.

239
00:21:14,151 --> 00:21:17,985
For what? So you can pretend to be
a real father for a few days, and...

240
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:21,955
I am their real father!
I am their father.

241
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,096
No, Richard. You know what defines
a father? It 's what he does.

242
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:28,925
Not what he promises.

243
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:33,263
It 's being a positive,
consistent presence.

244
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:40,900
A positive, consistent presence.

245
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:44,279
What does that mean?

246
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:46,380
I just don't get it.

247
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:49,178
But I'm not fucking
a college boy, am I?

248
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,653
Look, you...

249
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:59,191
Can you just go now? I don't want
you here when they get back.

250
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:02,229
You wouldn't want that?

251
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,634
No, you have to leave now.

252
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:12,268
Fine.

253
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,138
-I'll see you later, Richard.
-Goodbye, Nat.

254
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:42,836
I've ignored our difference in age,
but you play with those blocks.

255
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,531
I'm gonna start to worry.

256
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,405
You're not looking at the house.
Look.

257
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:00,019
It 's not all mine, it 's part Mack.

258
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:05,719
What Mack was trying to achieve
was a common area in the center.

259
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,454
Large open spaces
aren't unique to Mack...

260
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:11,157
but the idea of
separating the family...

261
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:15,566
so that the parents were on one side
and the kids are on the other side.

262
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:20,833
So they all spill into the center.
It 's brilliant. It 's...

263
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:25,145
I'm boring you, aren't l?

264
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:31,348
I was just thinking.

265
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:36,454
About what?

266
00:23:37,594 --> 00:23:39,585
About you.

267
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,894
School.

268
00:23:47,237 --> 00:23:49,432
What if I wait ayear?

269
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:53,700
Frank!

270
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:57,938
-A year won't make a difference.
-You can't do that, Frank.

271
00:23:58,148 --> 00:24:01,208
Why not?
I've thought a lot about this.

272
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:04,353
I have, and...

273
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:06,317
No. You...

274
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,853
You told me it takes forever
just to establish yourself.

275
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,461
Exactly.
So what 's ayear in forever?

276
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,430
That 's twisted logic.

277
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,544
Do you know what Duncan
said to me today?

278
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:30,339
You wouldn't be changing
the subject, would you?

279
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:35,475
He said, "Frank, I don't think
Jason really understands girls".

280
00:24:35,753 --> 00:24:38,221
-Oh, he didn't.
-He did.

281
00:24:39,723 --> 00:24:41,918
Understands girls.

282
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:45,358
What did you say?

283
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:47,530
I just didn't know
what to say to that.

284
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:51,827
I said, "Give him time, Duncan,
he'll come around".

285
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,035
If this is how he is now,
then we're in trouble.

286
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,956
What is this? Action Man?

287
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:21,764
Richard gave it to Dunc
for his birthday.

288
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,098
Very good.

289
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:04,205
Okay, it 's 7:30.
We should stop now.

290
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:07,775
Now remember,
when you sing these words...

291
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:10,208
the way we feel about
the harbor is the way...

292
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,541
the Balkans felt
about the River Sava.

293
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:14,876
And listen to your tapes.

294
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:18,816
"Moilih Ta" is still very rough
and we've got a 40-minute...

295
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:22,014
program to have ready
by Labor Day.

296
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,124
Labor Day.

297
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,629
-And Anna?
-Yeah, Mrs. Fowler?

298
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,730
Next time, duck.

299
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:34,567
Great.

300
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,198
Dad.

301
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:41,103
Is it acid?
What are you putting in there?

302
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:45,214
-My God, what happened?
-Frank, hold still.

303
00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:48,213
-Dad.
-This was her husband, wasn't it?

304
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:50,978
Ex. He dropped in.

305
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:53,486
You gonna press charges?

306
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:55,788
What 's to stop him
from doing it again?

307
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,858
Did you hit him at all?
Tell me you hit him.

308
00:26:58,061 --> 00:27:00,655
-Just so he doesn't do it again.
-I don't think I touched him.

309
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:03,697
-Jesus! Dad. dad.
-So what are you gonna do?

310
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:08,463
-Take karate.
-That is not the problem.

311
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:12,733
-Mom, you know you like her.
-I like a lot of people, Frank.

312
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,910
What about the boys?
Did they see it?

313
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:17,012
No, they were asleep.

314
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:19,444
Did you leave her alone with him?

315
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,813
He left first.
She was yelling at him...

316
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,715
I believe she had
askillet in her hand.

317
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:27,755
For God's sakes.
Did you call the police?

318
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:29,983
-Not yet.
-You didn't call them?

319
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:32,719
Well, I just got in. When did I have
the chance to call the police?

320
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,955
-Where's the phone?
-No, Mom. Don't call them!

321
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:37,895
They'll come over
and scare the kids.

322
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:42,537
-You gotta call them.
-It was ascuffle, wasn't serious.

323
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:47,142
-Like the relation isn't serious.
-Ruth, now is not the time.

324
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:50,313
When is the time?
After he knocks him into a coma?

325
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:54,075
-This is stopping now.
-Oh, really?

326
00:27:54,818 --> 00:27:58,584
Come fall, you're on a plane.
Are you taking them with you?

327
00:27:58,855 --> 00:28:01,380
What are the boys gonna think
when you just disappear?

328
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,025
Easy, Mom.

329
00:28:03,227 --> 00:28:07,220
Frank, this is not some sweetie from
Vassar you can visit on holidays.

330
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:09,399
You're not in this alone.

331
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,933
And the sooner you end it,
the better.

332
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:21,440
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

333
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:26,311
Well, you gotta talk to him, Matt.

334
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:30,343
I don't know.

335
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:34,916
Maybe he's right
about scaring the kids.

336
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:39,355
Why don't we just sleep on it,
deal with it tomorrow?

337
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:41,664
Are you gonna call the police
or do I have to?

338
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:44,867
I just told you what I think.
If you want to call them, call them.

339
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,684
It 's not the first time
she's played around, you know.

340
00:29:09,893 --> 00:29:13,590
-She's not with the guy anymore.
-No, I mean from before.

341
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:17,426
-What do you mean?
-You've heard the same things.

342
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:22,328
You seem to forget. I don't take my
lunches in the teachers' lounge.

343
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:31,706
Maybe he still loves her.

344
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,717
Best part of the cod.

345
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:40,287
The outsiders, they won't touch it.

346
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:43,789
The summer fishermen.
They're part-timers like Frank here.

347
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,825
Get in your hair.

348
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,190
As many as 80% of them
now with licenses.

349
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,357
Should put up asign: "Stay in your
own back yard, or lose your traps".

350
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:56,664
Henry is just sore because I catch
about twice as much as he does...

351
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:58,534
with an old second-hand Boudreau.

352
00:29:58,742 --> 00:30:03,145
Now don't you listen to him, son.
That boat is fine. She was my first.

353
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:09,551
I kind of miss her sometimes.
And that truck you're driving.

354
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,055
When you heading
back to school, Frank?

355
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,298
Hello, Dr. Fowler.

356
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:33,567
-How you doing, Jason?
-Good.

357
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:45,177
What 'd you pull?

358
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,518
Not too bad. About 40 pounds.

359
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:53,952
I haven't caught sight of you
in days.

360
00:30:54,498 --> 00:30:58,059
-You know where to find me.
-When are you coming home?

361
00:30:58,735 --> 00:31:00,635
Has it come to this?

362
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:02,634
Come to what?

363
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:06,804
You having to run errands for Mom.

364
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:13,105
I'm thinking of building
a couple hundred more traps.

365
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:16,114
See if I can do better
than break even.

366
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,379
It 'll take you more then 2 years
to get an off-season license.

367
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:22,786
Unless Henry takes me
on as his sternman.

368
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,785
-You think he'd do that?
-Maybe.

369
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:30,459
It 's as good a life as any.

370
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,362
It was good enough for your father.

371
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:35,697
And sometimes things
just skip a generation.

372
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:40,373
You don't think...?

373
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,372
You don't think you might
need something more?

374
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,882
Why? So I can have an lvy League
education like you, and...?

375
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:54,849
If it 's so great, why do you
sneak out every day to come here?

376
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:01,193
I like spending time with my son.

377
00:32:16,913 --> 00:32:18,847
I don't know, Dad.

378
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:24,646
It 's just... I don't know.

379
00:32:27,757 --> 00:32:30,385
She's a wonderful girl.

380
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:34,794
And that 's what I see.

381
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,571
Frank! How long will
you be parked here?

382
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,842
I'd like to unload.

383
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,772
-Give me a hand?
-Yeah, sure.

384
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,126
You can't hypnotize
the cards into changing, Matt.

385
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:07,321
Christ! Bet, or Carl'll start.

386
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,999
"The beggar's dog
and the widow's cat...

387
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,532
Feed them and thou wilt grow fat.

388
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:17,935
The gnat sings his summer's song,
poison gets from slander's tongue.

389
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:23,304
The poison of the snake and newt
is the sweat of envy's foot.

390
00:33:23,547 --> 00:33:26,983
The poison of the honey bee
is the artist 's jealousy."

391
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:29,344
All right, Carl. Two bucks.

392
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,050
I tell you, man, you gotta
get out of this Blake thing.

393
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,121
-You're in a rut.
-Don't get him started.

394
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:38,920
Whenever I do my own stuff,
you guys bitch and moan.

395
00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:43,088
-That 's not true.
-We love your stuff. It 's great.

396
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:46,492
-Carl?
-I'm in.

397
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:48,898
Everybody in? Frankie, you in?

398
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:55,775
Guess I'm the winner.

399
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:58,573
Always the quiet ones.

400
00:33:58,782 --> 00:33:59,908
Deal.

401
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,879
Come on. Come on.

402
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:20,868
Don't mind me.
Your father's snoring.

403
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:43,449
Eat. You must be hungry.

404
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:46,258
I'm not hungry.

405
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:48,863
Coffee?

406
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:57,298
So you talked to her?

407
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:05,511
And? How is she?

408
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:07,813
She's great.

409
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:14,154
Frank, I just want
to tell you that we...

410
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:17,318
That I liked her.

411
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:19,652
Do like her.

412
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,158
She's a wonderful girl.

413
00:35:22,365 --> 00:35:25,300
Ma, you're not gonna have
this conversation with me...

414
00:35:25,502 --> 00:35:27,333
right now, are you?

415
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:40,380
-Good night.
-Good night.

416
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:45,077
Okay.

417
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:48,951
All right. No, that 's fine, sir,
I'll send right away.

418
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,355
Okay. I'm very excited. I'm...

419
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:59,761
It 's a beautiful campus
and I'm preparing already.

420
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:04,066
Yes, Thank you, thank you, sir.

421
00:36:04,274 --> 00:36:06,868
Yes, well, compared
to your models...

422
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,704
It doesn't compare
to your models, but...

423
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,748
I am. I'm aware
of the Lautner house.

424
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:18,652
Yeah. Excuse me, sir,
can you hold on one second?

425
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:26,591
Jase?

426
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:29,697
Jase, what is it?

427
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:35,527
Okay, Jason, stay put.

428
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:37,733
I'll be right there. Stay put.

429
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:42,377
He just... he just pushed me.

430
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,742
-He didn't hit me.
-He didn't hit you?

431
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:49,441
Great. We should throw a party
for him. He didn't hit you.

432
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:53,419
-We're calling the police.
-No, wait, wait!

433
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:55,955
-We're calling the police.
-No, I don't...

434
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,218
I don't know what I want to do.

435
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:01,522
I hate this.
I hate the kids seeing this.

436
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:04,526
-I don't know what to do!
-Listen.

437
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:07,202
It 's okay, it 's okay.

438
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:11,103
I'm here now. I'm here now.
It 's all right.

439
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:13,800
I'm not going anywhere.

440
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:17,208
Okay.

441
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:19,972
It 's all right.

442
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,483
Mom!

443
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:33,562
-Go upstairs with the kids.
-No. Frank...

444
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:37,489
I'm not letting him in the house!
Go upstairs!

445
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:40,395
It 's better if he doesn't see you.
Go upstairs!

446
00:37:40,703 --> 00:37:42,933
Don't let him in. Don't let him in.

447
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,004
-Go.
-Frank, don't let him in.

448
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:48,271
Open the door!

449
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:51,407
Frank?

450
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:54,048
Frank, buddy. You in there?

451
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:58,052
Sorry about what happened.
All right?

452
00:37:58,254 --> 00:38:01,587
I apologize. I'm sorry about
what happened. Now open the door.

453
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:03,725
-Richard, leave.
-Open up.

454
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,521
-Leave now! I'm not letting you in.
-Open the door!

455
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:11,029
She left! And I'm calling
the police if you don't leave.

456
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:13,559
Just go.

457
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:15,998
All right. All right.

458
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:39,355
Get out, motherfucker!

459
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:42,053
Read him astory,
I'll be right back.

460
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:45,564
-I don't want to stay here!
-You have to.

461
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:48,362
You have to stay here! Look at me!
You're staying here, okay?

462
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:49,799
Read him astory.

463
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:52,236
Where is she?

464
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:56,438
You're fucking lying!
Where is she? Natalie!

465
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:58,705
Put that away!
Put that away!

466
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:19,963
Mommy!

467
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:30,044
There's a Mrs. Strout on line two.
She says it's very Important.

468
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:37,517
Natalie?

469
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:16,983
Great.

470
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:29,832
"Your fear of death is but the
trembling of the shepherd...

471
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,166
when he stands before the king...

472
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:35,276
whose hand is to be laid
upon him in honor.

473
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:38,873
Is the shepherd not joyful
beneath his trembling...

474
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:41,949
that he should wear
the mark of the king?

475
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:46,019
Yet is he not more mindful
of his trembling?

476
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:50,858
For what is it to die
but to stand naked in the wind...

477
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,358
and to melt into the sun?

478
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:55,656
And what is it to cease breathing...

479
00:40:55,898 --> 00:40:59,732
but to free the breath
from its restless tides...

480
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:05,270
that it may rise and expand
and see God unencumbered?

481
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:10,669
Only when you drink from the river
of silence shall you indeed sing.

482
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:13,438
And when you have reached
the mountaintop...

483
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:16,379
then you shall begin to climb.

484
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:19,917
And when the earth shall
claim your limbs...

485
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:23,320
then shall you truly dance."

486
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:17,305
Can I get you anything?

487
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:25,747
-Where's Ruth?
-She went to lie down, Matt.

488
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:30,087
Excuse me.

489
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:46,224
My next guest is a very talented man
who'll performed live this month...

490
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:49,398
at the Montreal Comedy Festival,
"Just For Laughs".

491
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,033
Please welcome Anthony Clarkl

492
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,636
Some more?

493
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,549
-How we doing?
-So nice I Wawl

494
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,877
-They're good people.
-They really are.

495
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:12,554
Some ofthem were packing,
but we've cleared that up.

496
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,188
-That's good.
-So, what's been on?

497
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,850
Actually I've been out with Ricky
Martin "Living the Vida Loca".

498
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:24,562
When you hang out with Ricky
people speak Spanish to you...

499
00:45:24,767 --> 00:45:30,262
and i think that's cool after three
years of Spanish in high school...

500
00:46:10,246 --> 00:46:12,510
Matt, I'm gonna go to lunch.

501
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:18,344
Can I get you anything?

502
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:22,421
No, I'm fine.

503
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:25,923
Are you sure?

504
00:46:28,264 --> 00:46:30,562
Yeah, I'm okay.

505
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,529
Okay.

506
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:01,660
Don't worry. I didn't make them.

507
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,962
-I wanted cheese.
-What? Oh! That 's mine.

508
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:10,535
Sorry.

509
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:19,712
You got back to work so quick.
It 's no too soon?

510
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:22,145
I can't stay home.

511
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:27,288
-So, how's business?
-You know. Same old crap.

512
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,355
Got held up again. You know that.

513
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:33,585
-No, I didn't.
-Yeah. They got 75 bucks.

514
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:35,961
Were you on the till?

515
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:39,032
They'd have gotten something else
if I'd been on the till.

516
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:47,238
So how you doing? You don't
write or call. Where'd the love go?

517
00:47:47,443 --> 00:47:49,570
Nag, nag, nag.

518
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:01,817
They set the bail hearing yet?

519
00:48:02,658 --> 00:48:06,025
-Sometime in the next few days.
-Are you going?

520
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:09,621
I don't know.

521
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:14,600
Davis says it 's a formality,
really.

522
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:19,768
I haven't talked with Ruth about
whether or not we ought to go.

523
00:48:19,975 --> 00:48:22,341
If it 's too much for Ruth,
I'll come with you.

524
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:25,605
Thanks. It 'll be all right.

525
00:48:27,183 --> 00:48:29,708
Davis says it 's a formality.

526
00:48:33,022 --> 00:48:35,388
The criminal trial set yet?

527
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,957
-October.
-October?

528
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:43,063
-That 's what they tell me.
-Christ, they take their time.

529
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:48,999
-He's in there now.
-They're keeping him busy, I'm sure.

530
00:48:49,205 --> 00:48:51,639
You know where they'll move him
once he's sentenced?

531
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:56,501
You got any tabasco?

532
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:02,039
Anita! Tabasco!

533
00:49:04,386 --> 00:49:06,013
Shit!

534
00:49:24,373 --> 00:49:28,070
Next weekend we really want
you to come up to the camp.

535
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:31,542
Katie's insisting. Not to pressure
you, but if you don't come...

536
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:34,614
she'll invite her sister
and that idiot, and...

537
00:49:34,817 --> 00:49:37,251
I'll wind up insulting him again.

538
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:39,944
The future of my family
is in your hands.

539
00:49:42,057 --> 00:49:44,457
Let me ask Ruth.

540
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:59,565
-How was your day?
-Fine.

541
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:03,110
I had lunch with Willis.

542
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,979
-It was really great to see him.
-My day was fine too, thanks.

543
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:11,319
Sorry, did you say something?

544
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:23,764
Katie and Willis invited us
up to the camp for the weekend.

545
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:27,868
I said I'd check with you, in case
we were doing something else.

546
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:32,234
That sounds fine.

547
00:50:33,475 --> 00:50:36,069
We don't have to go.

548
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:38,779
You don't want to?

549
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,908
Yeah, I want to.

550
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:44,410
Then tell them yes.

551
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,387
I thought you might be
busy getting the girls ready.

552
00:51:12,715 --> 00:51:18,244
AI right. The next matter is the
state of Maine vs. Richard Strout.

553
00:51:18,454 --> 00:51:20,888
The record should reflect
the defendant was...

554
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,719
incarcerated in Knox County
Jail without bail since...

555
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:29,421
the 17th of July.
We're here for a bail hearing.

556
00:51:29,665 --> 00:51:32,793
Mr. Davis, given the fact we have
avery crowded trial calendar...

557
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:36,733
I suggest we do both bail hearing
and probable cause hearing today...

558
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:39,999
at 2:00. So unless I hear
any objection on the contrary...

559
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,608
I'd like to set it for 2:00...

560
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,745
and we will take testimony
of your witness at that time.

561
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,718
I...

562
00:51:49,822 --> 00:51:52,120
I closed the door.

563
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:03,635
I walked through my room.

564
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:10,399
I heard some yelling.
I heard yelling. Heard yelling.

565
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,745
I got to the stairs...

566
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:25,186
and then I heard...

567
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:28,952
I heard the shot.

568
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:33,596
-And Richard...
-I'm sorry.

569
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,201
-Richard...
-Could we go back just a minute?

570
00:52:37,603 --> 00:52:41,130
Mrs. Strout, you said
you heard the shot.

571
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:48,179
You heard the shot? Did you
actually witness the accident?

572
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:51,873
Objection. There are no grounds
to indicate this was an accident.

573
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,384
Sustained. Strike the word
"accident" from the record.

574
00:52:55,588 --> 00:52:58,318
Rephrase your sentence, Ms. Keyes.

575
00:53:00,293 --> 00:53:04,059
Mrs. Strout, in the police
report you stated...

576
00:53:04,263 --> 00:53:09,667
that you had witnessed
the firearm discharge.

577
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,130
Did you witness
the firearm discharge?

578
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:35,586
I thought you said there'd be
ajury trial sometime in October.

579
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,729
If he was incarcerated...

580
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,989
the judge would have set
an October court date...

581
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:43,657
to save the county the cost
of housing him as an inmate.

582
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:49,035
But with bail, unfortunately,
the court date is always later.

583
00:53:49,242 --> 00:53:51,107
You mean there's nothing
we can do about this?

584
00:53:51,377 --> 00:53:54,744
You let him walk out,
and we're supposed to sit here?

585
00:53:55,214 --> 00:53:58,547
We can't appeal bail.
It 's just not set up that way.

586
00:53:59,352 --> 00:54:03,721
The state's bail code is to ensure
future court appearances.

587
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:09,327
In this case, Strout 's family put up
a great amount of property as bail.

588
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:12,123
That, along with his ties
to the community...

589
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:16,392
made it hard to convince the judge
there was a risk of flight.

590
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:20,561
Now, you can file a civil suit.
I recommend it.

591
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:23,571
But not now.
After the criminal trial.

592
00:54:23,776 --> 00:54:25,744
And when will that be?

593
00:54:25,945 --> 00:54:31,315
Well, honestly, could be
anywhere from 12 to 18 months.

594
00:54:31,517 --> 00:54:33,314
My God.

595
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:36,750
You're confident you can put him
away for good then, right?

596
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,164
The things she said in there.

597
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:53,135
What 's the damage?

598
00:54:55,174 --> 00:55:00,544
The way this is going,
potentially... manslaughter.

599
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,510
Jesus Christ!

600
00:55:03,783 --> 00:55:06,946
He killed our son!

601
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:12,751
-He... It was no accident!
-Ruth, Ruth.

602
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:18,686
How long will he be sent away for?

603
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:22,891
That 's hard to say.
Anywhere from 5 to 15 years.

604
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,536
But we're confident
we'll get the maximum.

605
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:31,540
-So even with good behavior...
-5, 10 years? Are you crazy?

606
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:38,183
Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler,
I'm sorry.

607
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:41,785
-I understand.
-No, you don't.

608
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,314
No, you don't.

609
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:36,005
-Doctor, what were you expecting?
-I have no idea.

610
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:40,209
Dr. Fowler, how do you feel
about Strout 's bail?

611
00:56:43,449 --> 00:56:46,941
Dr. Fowler, have you had
contact with Mr. Strout?

612
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,721
How's Mrs. Fowler handling this?

613
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,537
-Dr. Fowler!
-Please! No more questions.

614
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:09,502
Can you believe this?

615
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:12,940
I ask those idiots to leave
and no one budges, not one.

616
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:15,272
What are we supposed to do,
make them sandwiches?

617
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:18,575
-What are you asking for?
-What?

618
00:57:18,784 --> 00:57:22,242
If you want them to leave,
tell them to leave.

619
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:28,885
-Okay, I'll tell them to leave.
-Good.

620
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:40,762
They never come up
to the standard.

621
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:43,942
Andso they're always
disappointed. Always.

622
00:57:44,143 --> 00:57:47,135
They're never doing enough
or working hard enough...

623
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:50,315
they never behaved right enough,
were never a good enough father...

624
00:57:50,516 --> 00:57:53,883
or husband. And not only can
they not please themselves...

625
00:57:54,086 --> 00:57:57,180
sad to say, nobody else
can please them either.

626
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:17,837
-You slept late. For you.
-Yeah, I took one of your pills.

627
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:21,311
You never do that.

628
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:27,311
Well, there it is
in black and white.

629
00:58:27,687 --> 00:58:31,214
You should read some of the
things he says. It 's unbelievable.

630
00:58:39,198 --> 00:58:41,928
I'd better be going.

631
00:58:42,702 --> 00:58:44,670
Where? It 's Saturday.

632
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:49,204
There's some stuff I have
to catch up on at the office.

633
00:58:50,076 --> 00:58:52,374
I won't be long.

634
00:59:13,899 --> 00:59:16,527
Do you want your receipt?

635
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:23,075
Natalie?

636
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:32,875
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

637
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:36,946
Not at all.

638
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,556
Could you break a 50, please?

639
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,789
Excuse me.

640
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:56,472
Thank you, dear.
Could I possibly have another bag?

641
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:58,233
Sure.

642
01:00:08,754 --> 01:00:10,585
Yeah, well, I was just...

643
01:00:11,657 --> 01:00:14,888
Just wondering how you're doing.

644
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:17,528
I tried to reach you.

645
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,769
We're at my mom's house now.

646
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:31,907
-I wanted to call you.
-No, that 's... It 's okay.

647
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:37,381
Dr. Fowler, l...

648
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,679
Yeah, I know.

649
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,190
I didn't lie.

650
01:00:53,799 --> 01:00:58,429
I didn't lie the first time.
It was...

651
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,209
It 's how it came out.

652
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:12,312
Mrs. Fowler?

653
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:17,315
Can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds?

654
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:45,078
How are the boys?

655
01:01:45,985 --> 01:01:48,044
They all right?

656
01:01:56,328 --> 01:01:58,159
I gotta go.

657
01:01:59,198 --> 01:02:00,756
I'll see you.

658
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:16,179
So how much of this is yours?

659
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:18,873
You ask me that every time.

660
01:02:19,084 --> 01:02:21,712
You know the cove
on the other side of the cabin?

661
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:26,949
All the way to the other shoreline.
Almost 350 acres.

662
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,525
Know what it went for
when I bought it?

663
01:02:29,795 --> 01:02:31,786
You don't want to know.

664
01:02:39,805 --> 01:02:43,172
Oh, and that 's little Charles
down at the pool.

665
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,469
He figured out how to get down
to the pool on the elevator...

666
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,510
by himself.

667
01:02:48,714 --> 01:02:51,512
You must have been very proud.

668
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:55,984
That 's Shannon waiting in line for,
Oh, my God, that roller coaster.

669
01:02:56,188 --> 01:03:00,056
-You know that one? My God.
-Were the lines very long?

670
01:03:01,126 --> 01:03:04,584
Sometimes.
60 minutes and upwards.

671
01:03:04,797 --> 01:03:09,791
Unless, of course,
you got the... FastPass.

672
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:12,904
What 's the FastPass?

673
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:17,802
Well, you know, you got all
these different kingdoms there.

674
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:21,537
So you take this FastPass.
It 's kind of a laminated card.

675
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:24,944
You put into a machine, and
it tells you when to come back so...

676
01:03:25,150 --> 01:03:29,450
so, you know, you don't have to wait
in line. You just go right in and...

677
01:03:29,822 --> 01:03:32,154
You guys ever go to Florida?

678
01:03:36,595 --> 01:03:39,621
How many grandchildren
do you have now?

679
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:48,772
Well, all right, there's little
Charles and Shannon...

680
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:53,742
the three older ones,
and the babies...

681
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:58,914
That 's eleven.

682
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:01,652
It must be wonderful.

683
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:06,223
Willis always says, "I guess
there's no danger of us dying off".

684
