00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,160
LV!

2
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,240
# Come fly with me #

3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,440
# Let's fly, let's fly away #

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,480
# If you can use
some exotic booze #

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
# There's a bar in far Bombay #

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,560
# Come fly with me #

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,880
# Let's fly, let's fly away #

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
# Come fly with me #

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,880
# Let's float down to Peru #

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,760
# In llama land there's
a one-man band #

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
# And he'll toot his flute
for you #

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,280
# Come fly with me #

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,960
# Let's take off in the blue #

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
# Once I get you #

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,200
- # Up there where the air #
- LV, will you shut that up?

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,800
# Is rarefied #

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,560
- # We'll just glide #
- Come on, then.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
# Starry-eyed #

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840
- # Once I get you up there #
- Come on now!

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
# I'll be holding you so near #

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,400
# You may hear #

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,320
# Angels cheer
'cause we're together #

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,880
# Weather-wise
it's such a lovely day #

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,240
# Just say the words #

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,160
# And we'll beat the birds #

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,520
# Down to Ac-apulco Bay #

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,440
# It's perfect #

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,920
# For a flying honeymoon #

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
# They say #

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,080
# Come fly with me #

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,920
# Let's fly, let's fly away #

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
LV, cool it!

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
- # Weather-wise #
- Oi!

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,560
# It's such a lovely day #

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,240
# You just say the words
and we'll beat the birds #

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,440

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360

# Let's fly, let's fly #

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,040
# Pack up, let's fly away ##

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Yeah, we're late, thanks
to you and Tweetie Pie back there.

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,320
- I wasn't worrying about work.
I'm worrying about Duane.
- Duane?

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,080
Aye. There's a big race today.
They start off from France at 9:00.

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,960
Strong winds forecast.
Don't like winds, don't Duane.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,360
Duane's a pigeon, right?

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,120
Aye.
Where's the first call?

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,160
Shipley Street.
Domestic installation.

50
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,880
I'm nearly done.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,240
Ooh, I'll be wired up to the world soon,
me... in touch with all parts.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,600
- Nearly done.
- Goodley.

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,600
I spend me life and me fortune
in them slot boxes. Really, I do.

54
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,800
Ooh, but them uniforms
are not very becomin'.

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
You look like you been chucked
in a tool bag, you.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,160
Put me right off,
that has.

57
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,000
And I always liked a man
in a uniform, me.

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,360
- Oh, I bet you did.
- Hey, watch it, sparks. Sparkler.

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,280
Hey, speakin' of sparks,

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
you don't know nothin'
about electrickery, do ya?

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,480
Only the wires of me home's
cracklin' up on me.

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
No, no. We're just phone boys, us.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,880
He's quiet, isn't he?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,920
- Is there anybody there?
Or has he been disconnected?

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,200
Been cut off?
I've got a daughter like that.

66
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Like one of them answerin' thingies.
You can only leave messages, like.

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,360
- Say hi, Bill.
- Hello.
- Bill?

68
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,160
- Hey, you're not the famous
phone Bill, are ya?

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
Eh, but look at you
in that bag. You ought to complain.

70
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,840
Good-lookin' on top and then that.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,640
- Clark Gable in a bag.
Or should I say "Clark Cable"?

72
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,120
Ooh, eh, look at them two lookin' now.

73
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,120
Hey, this one doesn't speak
neither, love.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,920
You could go out, you two,
for a silent night, holy night.

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Or stop at home for a bleeding quiet
night in. Be a real riot, that would.

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,800
What did I say?
What did I say?

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,320
Eh, look at the red on him now.
Lookie. Oh, dear.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,880
Aye, you see, that's all you get
when she's upset...

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
crappaty records
full-bloody blast.

80
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,320
Hey, you! Trash the calypso!

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,120
# Or come shine #

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,160
# High as a mountain #

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,720
# Deep as a river #

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,120
# Come rain #

85
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
# Or come shine #

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,600
Right. We're all done.

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,560
- I'll just ring through
and test the line.
- Oh!

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh, let me do it. Let me. Let me.

89
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,960
What's the number again?
Oh, no. Don't tell me. I remember.

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,440
Start of the war,
Bobby Moore.

91
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Thirty-nine, sixty-six
and me age, twenty-eight.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,320
What are you laughin' at?

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Music.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,040
Music ringin'
in my bloody ears.

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Hello, me.

96
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,000
# Or come shine #

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,040
# Happy together #

98
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,000
# Unhappy together #

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,840
# Won't it be fine #

100
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,080
# Days may be cloudy #

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,920
# Or sunny #

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,240
# We're in or we're out #

103
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,920
# Of the money #

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,240
# I'm with you always #

105
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,360
- # I'm with you rain or shine #
- Stupid, isn't it?

106
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,400
Cooped up there in the dark
all day, like a friggin' bird
trapped in the rafters.

107
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,640
Hey, steady on.
Billy's fond of his birds.

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,120
Ah, well, I didn't think he looked
like the shirt-liftin' type somehow.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,680
No, feathered variety...
pigeons and that.

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,680
What?
Oh, frig me, no!

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,840
I can't be doin' with that.

112
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
All that cooin' and flappin'
and shittin' all over shop.
They want shootin', them.

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,080
The only good pigeons
are in pies.

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,240
# I'm gonna love you #

115
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,400
# I'm gonna love you #

116
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Right. If you could
just sign this, Mrs., er...

117
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,680
Hoff. Mari Hoff.
Crappaty name, isn't it?

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,920
Me late husband Frank left it me.

119
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,240
You can imagine me feelin's
on signin' marriage register...
Mr. And Mrs. F. Hoff.

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,080
See ya.

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,400
Thanks very much,
Mr. Cable.

122
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,320
See ya, then.

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,680
What's it like then, eh?
To watch your master at work.

124
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,640
Did you not see her?
Legs of jelly she had for me.

125
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,040
Husband dead and
out the way and all, eh?

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh, bloody hell. Here's me imaginin'
all sorts of slap and tickle,

127
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,200
and all you can dream about
is bloody Duane.

128
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,480
LV, we out of bacon?

129
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,680
Recent bacon, I mean.

130
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,880
Oh, come on, phone. Ring.

131
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Here, make me a cup of tea,
LV, love.

132
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
Come on.
Look after me.

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,880
Hey, give us that paper, here.

134
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,720
Oh, take it back.
I don't like the front.

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Oh, shove something on,
something for me, LV, love.

136
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,200
Go on.
Slap some food about for me.

137
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,360
Go on. What's that
you're eatin', anyway?

138
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,560
A brown envelope?
What's on telly?

139
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,240
Oh, sod that.

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,680
Oh, sod this.
I'm off down the cafe, me.

141
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't start the day
without some dribblin' fat, can I?

142
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,280
Eh, speakin' of which, I can
call Sadie on me new instrument.

143
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,200
That will freak
her flabby ass.

144
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
Eh, and listen, you.

145
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,480
If anyone phones
before I return,

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
you tell them I'll be back
in five minutes, all right?

147
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,200
All right?

148
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
Are you receiving me?

149
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,520
Ah, Sadie, it's me.

150
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,080
Aye, callin' long distance, me.

151
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
That I am, sexy.
Well and truly plugged in.

152
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Eh, listen. You, me, cafe, now.
Last one out door pays, all right?

153
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,760
Okay.
Leg over and out.

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,840
Five minutes, tell 'em.
All right? Toodle-pip.

155
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,280
Fuck me.

156
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Mention bacon and eggs and she shifts
like Linford friggin' Christie!

157
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,800
- How are ya, sexy?
- Okay.

158
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
You look a bit
on peckish side to me.

159
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
Move it.

160
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,440
You stick with me, son.
You'll learn a few tricks.

161
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,440
Reading matter.
That's the best one.

162
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Next day or something...
when hubby's out,

163
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,920
you go back with the reading matter...
leaflets and that.

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,360
Works every time.
Bedtime readin', I call it.

165
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,920
Bangers and bubble and
a fuck hot tea, ta. Twice.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,320
Bangers, mash,
fuck hot tea times two.

167
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,440
But, Sadie, what a night
I had me last night, eh.

168
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,160
What a friggin'
championship night!

169
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,160
You should've seen me.
Queen for a night, I was.

170
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,840
You'll never guess who.

171
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,880
Ray Say.

172
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,840
Ray friggin' Say.

173
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,120
You know him.
He's agent to the stars...

174
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
king of cabaret...
manager of miracles.

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,640
He's down at Mr. Boo's nightclub
all the time.

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Has that slight look of Elvis
about him.

177
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,920
You know him.
Everyone knows him.

178
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,560
And he knows everyone.

179
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,240
Eh, it was Mr. Boo himself
introduced us the other night.

180
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,480
And two seconds, Sadie,
I fib you not...

181
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,560
two seconds
and his hand's on me ass.

182
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,480
My ass. My golden old ass
in Ray Say's hand...

183
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,960
while he stands there
tellin' jokes to Mr. Boo.

184
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,720
Well, I saw him again
last night.

185
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Oh, the music was in our heads...

186
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,480
in our heads
and in his wanderin' hands.

187
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
He'll make it in anything,
Ray Say.

188
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,360
He's one of them lovable
twat sorta types.

189
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,160
- Drivin' me round
in his lovable twat mobile.

190
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,400
- He motored me round
about a million miles an hour.

191
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,840
Me heart in me mouth,
his hands up me skirt...

192
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,360
and me mind on his meat and veg.

193
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,040
Listen. Then it's down to
the harbor for a pronto snog.

194
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,600
Oh, lip-lappin' like old hell.

195
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,360
But at least he knows how
to slide and dart and take a throat.

196
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
And at least there's the thick
wad of his wallet...

197
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,880
Up against your tit for comfort.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh, up and down
and down and up...

199
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,120
and under the bloody stars.

200
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,280
Heaven it were, Sadie.

201
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,360
What's up with you lot?
Never had a shag in a Chevy?

202
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,600
Hiya.

203
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,600
F- Forgot to leave
your, er, reading matter...

204
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,200
about services
and all that.

205
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720
Your phone's ringin'.

206
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,600
Would you like me
to get it for ya?

207
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,760
Hello...

208
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Dead.

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,520
Hey, you. What's this, then...
one of them rave thingies?

210
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,080
Oh, stop it.
Me ears won't take it.

211
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,960
I thought you were done,
you.

212
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,800
You suddenly remember
a socket ya unplugged, eh?

213
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,560
Telephone Bill.
Little birdy boy.

214
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,760
N- No, I forgot to leave this,
er, readin' matter. It tells you...

215
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,280
Did he ring, LV?
Did he ding-a-ling? Eh?

216
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, for fuck's sake,
speak, girl.

217
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,840
We just... m-missed a call.

218
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
I can do 1-4-7-1.
It tells you who was ringin'.

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,360
It's one of the services mentioned
i- i-i-in the readin' matter.

220
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,160
- There you go.
- Oh, it, it don't give a name, then?

221
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,360
No. I'm afraid we're not
quite that advanced yet.

222
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,680
Ah, well, you'd best
advance on out then, eh?

223
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,560
Ta very much,
but just... flap off.

224
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,240
Bloody hell, I don't even know
who I'm ringin' here.

225
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,160
Hello?

226
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,520
Boo's? You what?

227
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Oh, Mr. Boo's.

228
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,640
Oh, hello. Um...

229
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,520
Is Mr. Say there presently,
please?

230
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,440
It's Mari Hoff.

231
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,360
Ray Say. Oh, hello, love.

232
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Oh, just working, you know.

233
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Giving Mr. Boo here
a shufti at me clients.

234
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,440
Yeah. Of course I do. I'll
see you at the Red Lion, okay?
All right, love. See ya.

235
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,000
Are you messin' with that Mari Hoff?

236
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,920
Hoff and on.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,480
- More on than Hoff, I should imagine.
- Excuse me!

238
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Are you watching this
or what?

239
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,720
- She'll go far, this one.
- Yeah, she will and all.

240
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,800
- Scunthorpe, if she's lucky.
- You're not interested?

241
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,040
- Good nipples.
- Heating's off. That's why.

242
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,600
- Mine are the same.
- All right, love.

243
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,600
Thank you.

244
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,360
You'll love this next one,
Mr. Boo. Singing combo...

245
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,720
five lads
all built like Buddha.

246
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,480
- What are they called?
- Take Fat.

247
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,200
# I get knocked down
but I get up again #

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,320
# You're not ever gonna keep me down
I get knocked down ##

249
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
- Hello, Billy, lad.
- Arthur.

250
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,160
Hey, did you win?

251
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,280
He's, er...
He's not in yet.

252
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,720
Not in yet?
That's not like your Duane.

253
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,120
Don't worry, Billy.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,600
- He'll be in before dark.
- Aye.

255
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,560
I'll see you, Billy.

256
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,480
See ya, Arthur.

257
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
# No more #

258
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,760
# That all-time thrill #

259
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,680
# Boy #

260
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,360
# You've been through #

261
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,840
# The mill #

262
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,200
# And #

263
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,800
# Never a new love #

264
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,200
# Will be the same #

265
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,960
# Good riddance, goodbye #

266
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,120
# Every trick of his #

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,160
# You're on #

268
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,800
# To #

269
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
# The road #

270
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
# Gets rougher #

271
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,200
# It's lonelier and tougher ##

272
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,880
Right, you. You got
a fuckin' second to get in shape.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,840
Perk, girl. Perk!

274
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,680
Aye. Come in, Ray.
Come in.

275
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,600
Here he is...
Mr. Ray Say.

276
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,280
Here it is.

277
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,280
Me home, me walls,

278
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,760

279
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,640
- And me daughter.
- How do you do?

280
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,280
Ray. Sun Ray.
Sting Ray.

281
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,600
Ray gun.
Me very own Ronnie Ray gun.

282
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh, I'm just friggin'
into him so!

283
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
Well, say hello.

284
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
God, she's a misery.
A miserable bloody misery.

285
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,000
- Whatcha havin', Raymondo?
- What you got?

286
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,560
Everything your throbbin' throat
could desire, lover boy.

287
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,400
All right?

288
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,080
Ta-da!

289
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,240
I'll have...
a cup of tea.

290
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,640
You what?

291
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,440
You'll have a cup of tea!

292
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,440
Hey, don't just
go off like that, you rude...

293
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,920
- Leave her! She's all right!
- Hey!

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,600
No, it's not all right.
She spoils everything, her.

295
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm tryin' to make an impression and
she can't even be swivel to a friend,

296
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,880
the tiny little slit!

297
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, what am I doin',
and in front of you?

298
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,920
Well, that's it.
I give up.

299
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,280
This is me crappaty home,
and this is how I am, Ray.

300
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,440
No gracey airs, and if you don't like
it, you can piss off out of it.

301
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,960
Hey, stay calm.
Don't get mad at me.

302
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,320
I- I never said anything
about anything.

303
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,320
Come on, then.
Let's roll about.

304
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,360
Oh! Here we go!

305
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
On and on and friggin'...

306
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,600
- Cut that racket, girl!
- Calm down. She's all right.

307
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Oh, you, you little raver.

308
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,160
# That's a dream of romance
on the scene #

309
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,600
# Where the villain is mean #

310
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,000
# That's entertainment #

311
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,240
- Don't!
- # The lights #

312
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,000
# On the lady in tights
or the bride #

313
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,880
# With the guy on the side
or the ball #

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,200
# Where she gives him her all #

315
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,320
- I'm not having this.
You can't bloody concentrate.
- # That's entertainment #

316
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,240
Cool it, will ya?

317
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,160
Think of the fuckin' neighbors!

318
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,320
# A gay divorcee
who is after her ex #

319
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,560
Right. Sod the bitch.
We'll have our own on.

320
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,680
# Where a chap
kills his father... #

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,440
# It's not unusual
to be loved by anyone #

322
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,360
# Who is doing him dirt #

323
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,240
# Fun with anyone #

324
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,880
# Of entertainment #

325
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,680
# It's not unusual
to see me cry #

326
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,480
# I wanna die ##

327
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,960
Hey, you.
You've blown me fuse!

328
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,120
Shh, shh!

329
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
- Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
Wha-Wha-What's that?

330
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,920
- She got her own radio up there?
- Eh?

331
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,000
No. That's her.
That's LV.

332
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,160
What?

333
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,160
- No.
- Yeah.

334
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,920
- No.
- Yeah.

335
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,880
- No.
- Yes.

336
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,720
# For you've been through #

337
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,640
# The mill #

338
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,640
# And never knew love #

339
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
# Will be the same #

340
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,120
- But I don't believe it.
- Oh, God, Ray.

341
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,600
She plays records
all the time.

342
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,800
Every God-sented sec.

343
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,760
They're stuck in her head and she can
sing 'em and it gets on my wick.

344
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,640
End of story.
Now come on, Ray.

345
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,720
- Let's roll.
- # Fools will be fools #

346
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,240
# And where's he gone #

347
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,080
# To #

348
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,360
# The road gets rougher #

349
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,000
Eh, come on, lover.
I'm mad for it here.

350
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,960
Shh! I'm listening.

351
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
# Tomorrow he might turn up #

352
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,560
# There's just no let up #

353
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
# The livelong night #

354
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,600
# And day #

355
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,880
Oh, sod it.

356
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,680
I'm off then.

357
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,720
# There is nothing #

358
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,040
# Sadder than #

359
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,680
# A one man woman #

360
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,760
# Looking for the man #

361
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,840
# That got #

362
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,640
# Away ##

363
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
# It's not unusual #

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
# To go out at any time #

365
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,200
# But when... #

366
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,920
Normal service resumed, eh?

367
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,280
Bit of gray matter and a bit
of gray matter. All it takes.

368
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,640
Bit of nouse, bit of coat hanger,
and, bingo, let there be light.

369
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,320
But you wanna get this lot seen to,
you know. Could bring the house down.

370
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,000
Hey. So could you...

371
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,560
with what you did
last night, you know.

372
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,200
Bloody marvelous, that.
Who else you do?

373
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,880
Don't go. I'm just interested.
You know, what with me being
in show business myself, like.

374
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,520
Didn't your mum tell you?
No?

375
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,480
Oh, well. Never mind. Er,
let's plonk you down here, love,

376
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,200
like the twinkling star
that you are.

377
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,040
And let me rustle up one of
Ray Say's famous breakfassays.

378
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,040
I do 'em for all me artists... when we're
on foreign engagements, you know.

379
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,960
It's not all glamour,
this game.

380
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,000
Fuckin' hell.

381
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,720
# For you are #

382
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,640
# Beautiful #

383
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,640
# And I loved you dearly #

384
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,440
Marvelous...
up there in the dark.

385
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,000
Something I'll never forget.
Fuck.

386
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,800
What do you say we continue our little
conversation down the cafe, eh?

387
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,680
No? What, and me all dressed up
and no place to go?

388
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,160
Certainly stripped to the waist.

389
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,720
There you go.
Best I can do.

390
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Une tasse de the
a la Ray.

391
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,600
Yeah?

392
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,520
Go on, love.
Fire away.

393
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,680
In show business...

394
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,200
l- ln show business, yes?

395
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,080
In show business,

396
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,920
did you ever meet...

397
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Shirley Bassey?

398
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,640
Shirley? Dear old Shirley?
Shirley, Shirley, Shirley.

399
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,800
To be honest, love,
as I remember,

400
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,200
I don't think our paths
ever crossed.

401
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,480
I did meet Des O'Connor, though,
and Charlie Williams.

402
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,880
Freddie
"Mr. Parrot Face" Davis?

403
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,040
I suppose the biggest name
I ever met was... Monroe.

404
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,440
- Marilyn?
- Matt.

405
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,320
You remember him?
The singing bus conductor.

406
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,320
No?

407
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,600
You like Marilyn, yeah?

408
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,520
- Yeah.
- Can you do her as well?

409
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,640
Go on.
I bet you can.

410
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,960
Oh, well, there you go.

411
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,680
I have
this thing about saxophone players.

412
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,840
I don't know what it is.
My spine turns to custard.

413
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,160
I get goose-pimply all over.

414
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,560
Frig me. That's ama...
That's amazing.

415
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,680
Christ! I don't believe that.

416
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,600
Listen, LV.
Listen.

417
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,400
You are my discovery.

418
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,560
I found you, right?

419
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,200
Me. Always remember that.

420
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,520
As a matter of fact, here.
Take one of me new cards.

421
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,920
I left it for you
in case I missed you.

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Look. It's gold.

423
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,840
I wouldn't give one of these
to just anyone, you know.

424
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,840
Now, look. I know
you're a bit on the quiet side,

425
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
but I'm a big noise
in these parts.

426
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,560
And together... you and me...
we could set this place on fire.

427
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,320
You are a star, you.

428
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,960
You're a nutter.

429
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,840
No, it can't wait. No.

430
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,200
All right. Well, hold him there.
I'm coming down now.

431
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,120
Mari, you look...

432
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,440
Don't speak
for a minute.

433
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,800
I, I gotta go, Mari,
but what can I tell ya?

434
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,720
It's happened at last, eh?

435
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,000
It's like at the races when
you know you're on to a certainty,

436
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,960
and you're feeling,
"This is it."

437
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,240
She's the one.

438
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,720
I am the one?

439
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,200
Give us another one, Ray!

440
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,600
Honest, Mari,
I, I can't believe it.

441
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,240
It's what I've been lookin' for
for ages.

442
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,160
It's just one of those
once-in-a-lifetime things, eh?

443
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,760
I, I've never felt like this
before... about anyone!

444
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,520
I'll see you at the Seabirds later.

445
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,480
- Yes!
- Bloody hell, Sadie.
The bastard wants me!

446
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,120
Too bloody right, Sadie.
Get up there and get it on.

447
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,040
Our fave bloody rave!

448
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,320
At last! Yes! Yes!

449
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,080
I shall go to the ball!
Oh, you darlings from the sky!

450
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,720
# Burn, baby, burn #

451
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,720
# Burn, baby, burn #

452
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
Ooh!

453
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,920
- Oh, what a life life can be!
- # Burn, baby, burn #

454
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,120
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

455
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,840
# Burn, baby, burn #

456
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,240
- # Burnin' #
- # To my surprise #

457
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,480
- Mari!
- # One hundred... #
- Oh!

458
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,240
Oh, bloody hell.
What now?

459
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,160
Er, I forgot to leave you this...
reading matter.

460
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,640
I only ordered a phone,
not a mobile bloody library.

461
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,720
- What?
- Young birdy boy's already
been and done all that.

462
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,000
Come on. Off out of it.
Make way for a woman in lust.

463
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,440
Hey, you, you twat!

464
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,320
What do you think
you're bloody playin' at?

465
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,760
- F-Feedin'.
- Feedin' my ass.

466
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,760
Screwin' around more like.
You come on all quiet...

467
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,640
like you're only interested
in these bloody things here.

468
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
But, really, you're a devious
little bastard, aren't ya?

469
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,760
You know what I'm on about.

470
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,280
Reading matter.

471
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,240
Ah, yes, you little bastard.

472
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,280
Though what you want to get your leg
over that for I'll never know.

473
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
Old enough to be
your bloody grandma.

474
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,280
Went to see the girl,
George...

475
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,120
the one with music.

476
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,040
What, her up...
Oh, Jesus.

477
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,800
- I thought...
- Just to talk to her, like.

478
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,160
- Oh, aye?
- Yeah.

479
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,800
- Thought she were... interestin'.
- Interestin', like off
her bloody rocker, you mean.

480
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,120
Didn't I say to you,
though, Sadie, eh?

481
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,760
I knew there was something down
for us, me and red hot Ray.

482
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,360
I just had that feelin'
in me twat bone.

483
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,280
Eh? And you know me.

484
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,960
I can predict rain with that.

485
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm wearin' me share-price
knickers tonight,

486
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,720
down as likely as up,

487
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,400
and some shit-tight
bloody bra.

488
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,040
'Cause I'm one high razzamatazz
in here today, me.

489
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,040
It's like there's a circus
parade passin' over me paps!

490
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,720
# While tearing off #

491
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,640
# A game of golf #

492
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,800
# I may make a play
for the caddy #

493
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,840
# But when I do #

494
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,840
# I don't follow through #

495
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,880
# 'Cause my heart
belongs to Daddy #

496
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,120
# If I invite #

497
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,320
# A boy some night #

498
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,720
# To dine on my fine finnan haddie #

499
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,400
I'm just checking to see
if your wires are all right.

500
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,680
# His asking for more #

501
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,400
- # My heart belongs to Daddy #
- I'm just seeing
if your wires are all right.

502
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,400
# Yes, my heart
belongs to Daddy #

503
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,240
- I'm just seein' if your...
If your wires are all right.
- # So I simply couldn't be bad #

504
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,720
# Yes, my heart #

505
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,680
# Belongs to Daddy #

506
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,880
- Do you go out much?
- No.

507
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,200
# Da-da-da-da-da-da #

508
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,560
- # So I want to warn you, laddie #
- Are you a telly fan?

509
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,840
- No.
- Goin' anywhere on your holidays?

510
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,160
No.

511
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,240
# That my heart
belongs to Daddy #

512
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,120
- There are no wires.
- Eh?

513
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,280
I finished work hours ago.

514
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,440
Oh, I don't know
what to say now.

515
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,560
I'm Billy.
Can I ask you your name?

516
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,280
- LV.
Oh.

517
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,040
Does, does that stand
for something?

518
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,920
- Little Voice.
- Oh, on account
of bein' soft-spoken, like.

519
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,640
Nice tune, that.

520
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,360
"My Heart Belongs To Daddy."

521
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
Oh. Right.

522
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,560
- Marilyn Monroe.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

523
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,800
Eh, your mom's a live wire,
ain't she? Bloody hell!

524
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,800
Not fond of pigeons neither,
is she?

525
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,040
- Pigeons.
- Aye. I keep 'em, you know.

526
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,480
- Homing pigeons.
- Oh.

527
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,000
I love 'em. I'm up Pigeon Hill
all the time, where lofts are.

528
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,560
- Feed and exercise twice a day.
- Exercise?

529
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,840
Aye. You let 'em out,
they fly around and come back.

530
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,480
That's what homin' pigeons do...
except Duane, like.

531
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,320
- Duane?
- Aye... me best bird.

532
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,800
Not back from France yet.

533
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,640
What's he doin' in France?

534
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,400
# My heart belongs
to my daddy #

535
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,480
- # Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da #
- He's comin' back here.

536
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,880
- Oh.
- # So I want to warn you, laddie #

537
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,520
- Anyway, it can be boring
to the nonenthusiast.
- Oh, no.

538
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,320
- N-No. You're all right.
- When you let 'em go...

539
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,760
and see 'em fly, and better
still, see 'em back, well,
it's, it's dead exciting.

540
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,440
You'll have to come up there
with me, LV. See for yourself.

541
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,120
Oh, I, I don't go out.

542
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,160
What, never?

543
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,920
I'd best go, Billy. Bye.

544
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,080
I'll see you again
somewhere then. Eh?

545
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,120
- # That little old man
he just plays it so good #
- Talkin' to yourself and all?

546
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400
- Now were you?
- No.

547
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,160
Aye, well, I'm off
out on the razz.

548
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,480
You have a nice night
in with your pals, eh?

549
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Bloody hell,
where you been? I said 8:00.

550
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,840
Aye, but look at me,
luvvy, eh?

551
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,360
Takes time to get dressed up
like this.

552
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,080
Arndale Centre weren't
built in a day, you know.

553
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,320
Yeah, and with half as much plaster.

554
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,200
- You smooth talker, you.
- You know Mr. Boo, don't you, eh?

555
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,560
- This is Little Voice's mum.
- Oh, aye. Once-in-a-lifetime
thing, Ray tells me.

556
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,760
Never felt like this before
about anyone, he says.

557
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,760
Yeah, well, we'll get a few
quick drinks down us,

558
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,160
then it's back to your place
for a, a listen.

559
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,720
A spot of "Who do you do?"
For Mr. Boo, like.

560
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,840
What are you havin', love?

561
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,200
- Eh?
- Gin.

562
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Double,
and a Campari chaser.

563
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,320
# And it's all #

564
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,200
# Comin' back to me now ##

565
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,600
Oh, God.
You make me sick, you lot.

566
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,880
First that little phone fart,
and now you all droolin' over
that little stick of shite.

567
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
I got tits and all, you know...

568
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,440
and a gob on me
for every occasion.

569
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,400
Tits, gob and an ass
to die for, me!

570
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,280
- Good looker, eh, Boo?
- Just as well, with that mouth.

571
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,000
No. The car, Boo.
The car.

572
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,920
Oh, aye. Yeah.

573
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,840
Very nice.

574
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,800
- Put her in the back.
- I'm stoppin' here.

575
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,120
# Oh, the chirruping of the birdies
on the sycamore tree #

576
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,040
# They're lucky to be
so happy and free #

577
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,440
# I know that they're chirruping
out a little ditty to me #

578
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,160
# I hear them saying early
every morn #

579
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,680
- # Get up, get up, get up #
- Get up, you.

580
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,520
Ray wants ya downstairs.

581
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,200
- What for?
- You know what for.

582
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,000
You've got him thinking you can
do something or something.

583
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,040
He wants you down anyway.
Show Mr. Boo what you can do.

584
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,560
- It's private.
- Private, my privates.

585
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,840
You're just damn selfish
and useless, you.

586
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,240
And you can do nothin' but whisper
and whine like your father before you.

587
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,480
Couple of bloody nothin's,
the pair of ya.

588
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,160
Look at it. Just a pile
of old junk no fucker wants.

589
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,680
- Now come on downstairs!
- Don't you dare touch these!

590
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Ever!

591
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,960
Up yours, stick leg.

592
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,920
- She'll not come down.
- What?

593
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,160
Well, it's just like I said.
She'll not sing. I told you.

594
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,080
Dad.

595
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,200
Dad.

596
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,680
Dad.

597
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,080
Well, I'm sorry, Ray,
but Boo's a busy man.

598
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,000
I've got to be off.
Got other acts to see.

599
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,320
Acts that can be bothered.
Night, all.

600
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,240
Boo! Boo!

601
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,160
Hold on, Boo. It won't take a minute.
Honest. She's dead special.

602
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,560
Listen, Say. I didn't get where
I am today by wasting my time...

603
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,440
By wasting my time listening
to singers that don't sing.

604
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,520
All I can say is that she might
stand an outside chance as a mime act.

605
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,080
Dad.

606
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,680
# Somewhere #

607
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,120
# Over the rainbow #

608
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,760
# Way up high #

609
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,680
# There's a land #

610
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,880
# That I heard of #

611
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,720
# Once, in a lullaby #

612
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,480
You know me, Boo. I wouldn't bring you
down here for nothing.

613
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,400
- You've gotta...
- # Where #

614
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,280
# Over the rainbow #

615
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,040
# Skies are blue #

616
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,800
# And the dreams #

617
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,440
# That you dare to dream #

618
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,760
# Really do come true #

619
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,520
# Some day
I'll wish upon a star #

620
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,040
# And wake up where the clouds #

621
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,360
# Are far behind me #

622
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
# Where troubles melt #

623
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,480
# Like lemon drops #

624
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,200
# Away above the chimney tops #

625
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,240
# That's where #

626
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,920
# You'll find me #

627
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
- # Somewhere #
- That's never her.

628
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,240
- It is.
- # Over the rainbow #
- No.

629
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
Yeah.

630
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,280
- No.
- Yeah.

631
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,600
- No!
- Yeah!

632
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,880
- Oh, here we go again.
- That's Judy.

633
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,840
- You got Judy Garland in there.
- Oh, aye. She's round here
all the time...

634
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,960
her and that Shirley Bassey
drinking our bloody cocoa.

635
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,400
You have a remarkable
daughter, Mrs. Hoff.

636
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,200
- Aye, don't I bloody know.
- Well, Ray. We must have her,
if you can arrange it.

637
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,680
There's the makings of a first-class
act there... real class.

638
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,000
- We could do a lot with that.
- Right, Mari, love.
Me and Boo are off up the pub.

639
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,360
Talk finer details
and finances.

640
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,880
- Leave the latch off, eh?
- What about me then?

641
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,480
Where do I fit in, eh? Need
a fuckin' second-class act?

642
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,440
Er, mine's, mine's a double Scotch, Boo.
I'll see you up there, eh?

643
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,200
- # Like lemon drops #
- What are you saying, Mari?

644
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,720
I'm tellin' you you're sittin'
on a gold mine...

645
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,400
- not over a bloody rainbow,
but up there in that bedroom.
- # That's where you'll find #

646
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,440
# Me #

647
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,520
- # Somewhere #
- "Dreams that you dare to dream," eh?

648
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,120
- # Over the rain #
- She can make them come true.

649
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
# Bow #

650
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,560
# Bluebirds #

651
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,800
# Fly #

652
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,360
# Birds fly #

653
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,240
- She's our chance, Mari.
- # Over #

654
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,200
- # The rainbow #
- We've been shoveling shit
long enough, you and me.

655
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,560
Now's our chance to step out of it.

656
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,360
- Our chance?
- Oh, I'm going nowhere
without you, girl.

657
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,040
- # Someday I'll wish upon a star #
- Oh, Elvis breath.

658
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,040
# And wake up #

659
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,080
Come on then.
Lead us to the dotted line.

660
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,960
# If #

661
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,840
# Happy little #

662
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,240
# Bluebirds fly #

663
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,760
# Beyond the rainbow #

664
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,920
# Why #

665
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,280
# Oh, why #

666
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,200
# Can't #

667
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,560
# I ##

668
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,920
Love, luvvy. Don't worry.
It's only us... me and Ray.

669
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,800
- Coming bearing good news, m'lady.
- Stupendous news, actually.

670
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,800
Mr. Boo would like you
to sing at his club on stage.

671
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,240
- Sing what you like.
- He'll pay. Good money and all.

672
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,200
- Could be up to 50 quid, right?
- Yeah, and that's just to start.

673
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,480
- No!
- No? Listen. Ray'll look after ya.

674
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,920
He knows all about showbiz,
and all you have to do is sing.

675
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,640
Sing!
Like what you do best anyway.

676
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,240
- You might feel shy.
- Oh, nothin' wrong
with being shy at first.

677
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,680
- It's natural, that.
- Had a girl recently
wouldn't say boo to a goose.

678
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,800
- Now she's toppin' the bill
at the Reform Club.
- Who's that? That stripper?

679
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah. Well, I mean, it's similar,
innit? I mean, similar case, Tina.

680
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,520
- Please go.
- It's not healthy being cooped up here...

681
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,800
Just go!

682
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,640
Bloody hell.
That's gratitude for ya.

683
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,840
You great long streak
of piss!

684
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,840
You are bloody doin' it, girl!

685
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,800
Come on. You can do better than that.
So how you all doin'?

686
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,160
The manager says, "Do you want
that condom on your bill, sir?"

687
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,640
And the duck says, "Certainly not.
What sort of duck do you think I am?"

688
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,240
Hey, true story, this. Two...

689
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,440
All you've gotta do
is stand here and sing.

690
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,680
Like at home.

691
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,960
Just... stay calm
and relax.

692
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,600
What are you talkin' about,
relax? Look at her!

693
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,320
Think about... Judy.

694
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,080
Think about... Shirley.

695
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,040
Think about... Marilyn.

696
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,640
Anyway, on with the show,
ladies and gentlemen.

697
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,400
As you know,
Boo braves anything,

698
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,720
goes anywhere
in his perpetual quest...

699
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,680
for fresh talent to spice up
your midweek merriment here.

700
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,000
And guess which exotic part of the world
I came across tonight's star turn?

701
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,240
Shipley Street.

702
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,320
Well, it saves on travel
expenses, don't it?

703
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,720
Anyway, pretty people,
enough of me.

704
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,440
A talent...
an undiscovered treasure...

705
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,560
an act of wonder,
ladies and gentlemen.

706
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,760
A little girl that's big...
a northern light... a rising star...

707
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Order and hush.
Hush and order...

708
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,320
for the turn of turns...
a- the one, a-the only...

709
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,720
Little Voice, ladies and gentlemen!

710
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,640
Little Voice!

711
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,680
Go on.

712
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,320
You're on.

713
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,080
Go on. Go on.
Go on. Sing.

714
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,440
I'll do anything.
Just sing.

715
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,000
Sing, for fuck's sake.
Sing!

716
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,520
The lights.
It's the lights.

717
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,480
Turn out the lights.

718
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,240
# I don't know why #

719
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,000
# But I'm feelin' so sad #

720
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,440
# I long to try #

721
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,840
# Something I've never had #

722
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,080
# Never had no kissin' #

723
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,600
# Oh, what I've been missin' #

724
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,000
Get off!

725
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,920
Do another one. Go on.
Do some more.

726
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,840
More? Do you really want more?

727
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,240
Oh, aren't you tired?

728
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,200
Well, we've got,
we've only got one more.

729
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,440
We-We'll do, we'll do,
we'll do "Chicago."

730
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,280
# Chicago, Chicago #

731
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,000
# That toddlin' town
A toddlin' town #

732
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,360
# Chicago, Chicago #

733
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,280
# I'll show you around #

734
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,320
# I love it, bet your bottom dollar
you'll lose the blues #

735
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,280
# In Chicago, Chicago ##

736
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
What have you
stopped for? Don't stop now.

737
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,720
Do anything. Anything.
And, Jesus, look happy!

738
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,360
# Happy birthday #

739
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,560
# To you #

740
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,920
# Happy birthday #

741
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,120
# To you #

742
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,640
This is crazy, Ray.
The punters can't see.

743
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,840
# Happy birthday
Mr. President #

744
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,480
All right, then.
Get 'em back up.

745
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,960
- Get the lights back up.
- # Happy birthday #

746
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,360
# To... ##

747
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,080
Thought things couldn't go downhill with
you, Ray. What am I gonna tell 'em?

748
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,520
Tell 'em...
she'll be back.

749
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,320
Embarrassin'. One hundred
bloody chunk embarrassin', that.

750
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,360
I'm shown up, which was more than
she was, stood there in bloody dark.

751
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,840
- He wasn't there.
- And what was she singing?
What the hell was that?

752
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,760
She could've made an effort
and done some Spice Girls or
something, for Christ's sake!

753
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,800
I told you you was wasting
your time on the little slit!

754
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,200
She did the whole thing
to spite Mother. I know her.

755
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,440
Oh... go on.
Drop her off.

756
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,880
Dump her home.
Let's go eat.

757
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,280
Now then.

758
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,240
- Oh, Jesus.
- Guess what.

759
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,400
- I've just seen your bird.
- Where?

760
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,320
On stage, down at Boo's.

761
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,360
What?

762
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,280
Oh, no.
Not Duane.

763
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,240
I meant the other one.

764
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,600
That lass.

765
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,480
- Hello?
- LV?

766
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
- Hello.
- Eh, listen.

767
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,040
I, I heard about
what you did tonight.

768
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,480
- At Boo's club.
- They made me.

769
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,360
- Who made you?
- Him and her.

770
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,320
They go on till you do.

771
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,640
They trying to make you
do it again?

772
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,920
Don't think she liked it.
Won't be doin' it no more.

773
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,840
Oh, but, Ray,
it were crap awful, weren't it?

774
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Well, er, she's not
what you'd call a performer.

775
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,440
I- I'll grant you that, no.
But I can take care of that.

776
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,200
She just needs a, a big band
or something to boost her confidence...

777
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,480
er, a big, flashy set.

778
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,360
Bright lights, a bit of glitz,
snazzy frocks. All that.

779
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,720
I love it
when you talk swanky.

780
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,400
Has, has Duane come home?

781
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,480
No. No, no.
Not yet.

782
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,400
Happens sometimes,
once they're out.

783
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,920
Flyin' free.

784
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,840
They like it.

785
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,280
You should try it
sometime, LV.

786
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,720
Oh, I've got to go.

787
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,440
- I've, I've got to go. Bye.
- LV?

788
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,640
What was she like?

789
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,560
Well, if it's a roller-coaster
of unbridled excitement you're after,

790
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,120
I reckon you're better off
up here.

791
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,240
You're all right, love?

792
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,160
It's only me.

793
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,480
Been workin' on the act...
planning and that.

794
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,640
Got Boo to let us have another go.
I've worked it all out.

795
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:31,160
You'll love it...
everything tailored to your personality.

796
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,880
All you've got to do
is step on from the side.

797
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,240
What's up? Hey, angel.

798
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,120
You're not gonna let a little hiccup
like tonight put you off, are you?

799
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,320
That happens to the best
of 'em, you know.

800
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,240
If you could ask her
or her or her,

801
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,200
they'd all tell you
the same thing.

802
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,880
They've all had nights like that,
you know. Isn't that right, Judy?

803
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,760
"It sure is, Mr. Say."
And what about you, Marilyn?

804
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,880
- "Too, too true, boo boo be doo."
- Don't!

805
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Seriously, LV.
It'll never happen again.

806
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,960
Not with this.
It's foolproof.

807
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,240
Believe me.
Let's do it, eh?

808
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,520
You won't even look at it?

809
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,200
Well, never mind then, eh?

810
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,680
Never mind.
That's it, then, eh?

811
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,640
No problem.
Pas de problemo.

812
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,560
Got it nice here,
haven't you?

813
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,640
Clean and tidy.
That's nice.

814
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,480
All your records
all around ya.

815
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,640
Your dad must have spent years
buildin' up a collection like this.

816
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,240
- He did.
- Yeah.

817
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm not one for
collecting things meself.

818
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,680
Only debts.

819
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,560
I had an auntie once
who was, though.

820
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,280
You'll never guess
what she collected.

821
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,160
Go on.

822
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,080
Bluebirds.

823
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,080
Honest.
Wild bluebirds.

824
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,120
Flyin' all over her house.

825
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,600
Marvelous with 'em
she was and all.

826
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,960
Even taught one of them
to talk once.

827
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,520
Timid little thing, it was.
No bigger... than your thumb.

828
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,240
Too scared
even to leave his cage.

829
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,720
But what she did
was so simple.

830
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,800
All she did was keep it
shaded and safe...

831
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,960
at all times,

832
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,440
and then sing to it
and stroke it...

833
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,960
very, very soft
every day.

834
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,960
And after a while,
it gave her his heart.

835
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,800
Later,
when it grew strong,

836
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,720
she set it free.

837
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,480
But before it flew
to its freedom,

838
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,880
it stopped...
on the window ledge.

839
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,680
Then it turned to her...

840
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,600
and, to her great surprise,

841
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,440
sang.

842
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,000
# There'll be bluebirds over #

843
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,360
# The white cliffs of Dover #

844
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,280
See? There she goes.

845
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,000
True story, that.

846
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,600
Which are your dad's
favorites?

847
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,520
Them three there.

848
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,400
Oh, good.
You know what we'll...

849
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,000
- Oh, no. No.
- What?

850
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,920
No. Well, I, I, I was just
thinking we, we could have
included them, uh, in the, er,

851
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,840
you know... the act.

852
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,160
But we're not doin' it now.

853
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,000
I bet your dad
would have liked that, eh?

854
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,720
A tribute
to his life's loves.

855
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,640
One love, his songs,

856
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,320
sung by his only
other love...

857
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,240
his daughter.

858
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,520
Huh? That would have
really been something, eh?

859
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,160
Yeah. A shame.

860
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,040
'Cause the man
and his music...

861
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,280
they don't get much respect,
do they?

862
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,360
You know what I mean.

863
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,680
- Ray.
- Hmm?

864
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,880
Nothin'.

865
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,200
Whoops.
There she goes again...

866
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,520
the bluebird under the moon
and over the stars.

867
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,800
I'll do it.

868
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,520
Do what?

869
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,320
Oh, that. Oh, okay.

870
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,760
- Just once.
- Yeah.

871
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,840
Whatever, whatever.

872
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,440
I'm pleased.

873
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,400
I'll just pop down
and get me cigarillos.

874
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,880
Won't be a tic.

875
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,200
# Goldfinger #

876
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,880
The overall effect I want,
Frank, is like Las Vegas.

877
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,880
- Plush up the bandstand,
big musical notes...
- # He's the man #

878
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,400
# The man with the Midas touch #

879
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,680
- Up here on the stage...
- # A spider's touch #

880
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,280
# Such a cold finger #

881
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,520
# Beckons you to enter
his web of sin #

882
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,680
# But don't go in #

883
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:51,040
- # Golden words he will pour
in your ear #

884
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,280
# But his lies can't disguise
what you fear #

885
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,880
- Hold on. Thank you, lo...
- # For a golden girl #

886
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,400
# Knows when he's kissed her #

887
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,480
- # It's the kiss of death #
- Come on!

888
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,360
# From Mr. Goldfinger #

889
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,320
# Pretty girl #

890
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,640
# Beware of this heart
of gold #

891
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,280
# This heart is cold #

892
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,800
Bloody hell.
All right, all right.

893
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,800
# Golden words he will pour
in your ear #

894
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,080
# But his lies can't disguise
what you fear #

895
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,160
- This has come to a lot more
than I thought, Frank.
- # For a golden girl #

896
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,840
# Knows when
he's kissed her #

897
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,160
- # It's the kiss of death #
- There you go.
- Thanks.

898
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,200
- Right, Phil.
- Yes, Mr. Hoskins.

899
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,520
# From Mr. Goldfinger #

900
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,400
# Pretty girl #

901
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,440
# Beware of this heart
of gold #

902
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,400
# This heart is cold #

903
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,000
# He loves only gold #

904
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,080
# Only gold #

905
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,960
# He loves gold ##

906
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,800
Well, a man with a plan
or what, eh? My Ray.

907
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,200
Worked it all out, he has.
Gonna take us all to Tarby-land.

908
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,000
I had me doubts about her doin' again
at first, but, well, he won me over.

909
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,440
Try as I do,
I cannot say no to that man.

910
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,240
What a tongue he has on him, eh, Sadie?
Half raspberry, half razor.

911
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,800
Oh, I don't know, Sadie.
Maybe this once...

912
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,040
that fucker fate's
smilin' down on us, eh?

913
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,400
Ohh. Liquor, lacquer.
Liquor, lacquer.

914
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,440
Ow! Bloody hell!

915
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,360
Oh, my God!
I've blinded me god.

916
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,040
No, I'm all right.
I'm all right. All right.

917
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,200
Here you are.
I've got you something.

918
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,960
- Ow.
- Oh, Raymondo!

919
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,880
Lookie here,
little sparkle-neck me.

920
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,880
See, Sadie?
It's a love token.

921
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,960
That's right,
isn't it, Ray?

922
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,000
Someways I wish I could
lash it 'round me finger.

923
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,960
You look stunning, Sadie. We gonna
have a dance down there later, eh?

924
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,400
Go upstairs now, Sadie.
See if star turn's ready.

925
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,040
I can't wait, Mari, can you?
I'm buzzing. Fit to burst.
Big crowd, proper job.

926
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,520
- I've even got a talent scout
coming down.
- Oh, give us your lips, you,

927
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,000
and double me palpitations.

928
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,960
- Fuck me.
- Not now, Ray, we got
a show to do. Ha ha!

929
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,520
Right. Are we set, then, or what?

930
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,920
Let me open
that front door...

931
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:05,760
the door that leads
to success.

932
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,200
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Yea, thrice welcome to Mr. Boo's.

933
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,360
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

934
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,280
- Boo.
- Boo who?

935
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,360
Don't be so fucking pathetic.

936
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,880
How are you all doing? All right?

937
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,800
Come on! You can do better than that.
How are you all doing? All right?

938
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,960
That's more like it.

939
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,000
Because we've pulled out all the stops
for your Friday night frolickings!

940
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,400
We haven't had a band in here
this big since VE Day.

941
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,560
In fact, now that I look at 'em,
it's the same band.

942
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,960
It's all right. They know me.
We're in for a grand night tonight!

943
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,320
So smack one hand against t'other, if
you will, for the turn of turns return!

944
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:45,720
The voice of a thousand stars.
The girl with the greats
queuing up in her gullet!

945
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,920
A- the one, a-the only Little Voice,
ladies and gentlemen!

946
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,200
Li-i-i-i...

947
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,120
ttl-l-l-le...

948
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,960
Voi-oi-oi-oice!

949
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,880
# The minute you walked in the joint #

950
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,280
# I could see you were
a man of distinction #

951
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,840
# A real big spender #

952
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,960
# Good looking
So refined #

953
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,880
# Say, wouldn't you like to know
what's going on in my mind #

954
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,920
# So let me get
right to the point #

955
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,920
# I don't pop my cork
for every man I see #

956
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,680
# Hey, big spender #

957
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,040
# Hey, big spender #

958
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,920
# Hey, big spender #

959
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,760
# Spend #

960
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,360
# A little time with #

961
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,680
# Me ##

962
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,480
Yes!

963
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,200
# I want to be loved by you #

964
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,680
# Just you
and nobody else but you #

965
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:00,080
# I want to be loved
by you alone #

966
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,000
# Boo boo be doo #

967
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,440
# I want to be kissed
by you #

968
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,840
# Just you
and nobody else but you #

969
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,200
# I want to be kissed
by you alone #

970
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,640
# I couldn't aspire #

971
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,240
# To anything higher #

972
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,240
# Than to fill the desire #

973
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,240
# To make you my own #

974
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,720
# Pa dum, pa dum
Pa doo be dum #

975
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,680
# Poo ##

976
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,520
# Men cluster to me #

977
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,960
# Like moths around a flame #

978
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,360
# And if their wings burn #

979
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,000
# I know I'm not to blame #

980
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,800
# Falling in love again #

981
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,640
# Never wanted to #

982
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,760
# What am I to do #

983
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,520
# I can't help it ##

984
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,720
# Sing as we go
and let the world go by #

985
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,760
# Singin' a song we'll march
along the highway #

986
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,960
# Say good-bye to sorrow #

987
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,480
# There's always tomorrow
to think of today #

988
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,960
# Sing as we go
although the skies are gray #

989
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,760
# Beggar or king you've got
to sing a gay tune #

990
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,880
# A song and a smile
making life worthwhile #

991
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,480
# So sing
As we go #

992
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:41,280
# Along ##

993
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,080
# Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy #

994
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,840
# You better chase
all your cares away #

995
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,520
# Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy #

996
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,040
# Get ready for
the judgment day #

997
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,600
# The sun is shinin'
Come on, get happy #

998
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,600
# The Lord is waiting
to take your hand #

999
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,400
# Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy #

1000
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,920
# We're goin' to
the promised land #

1001
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,920
# We're headin'
'cross the river #

1002
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,720
# Wash your sins away
in the tide #

1003
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,520
# It's oh, so peaceful #

1004
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,000
# On the other side #

1005
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,640
# Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy #

1006
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,520
# You better chase
all your cares away #

1007
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,280
# Shout hallelujah

1008
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,520

1009
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,400
# Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy #

1010
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,240
# Chase your cares away #

1011
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,720
# Hallelu... get happy
Before the judgment day #

1012
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,960
# The sun is shinin'
Come on, get happy #

1013
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,040
Who's on the phone?

1014
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,440
- It's Bunny Morris.
- Bunny Morris?

1015
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,480
- That's right.
- # We're gonna be goin'
to the promised land #

1016
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,720

1031
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,000

1036
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,840

1037
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,280
# Shout hallelujah

1038
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,360
# Get ready #

1039
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,040
# Get ready #

1040
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,760
# Get ready #

1041
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,720
# For the judgment day ##

1042
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,320
That's my fuckin' daughter!

1043
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,040
Well, a star
is bloody born or what, eh?

1044
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,480
Guess who I just spoke to...
only Bunny Morris.

1045
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,320
- Never!
- Who's Bunny Morris?

1046
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,600
The fixer.
Bunny "Mr. Starmaker" Morris.

1047
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,160
Any new star you name,
love, he got 'em started.

1048
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,840
He puts 'em in all the big clubs
and all the TV shows.

1049
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,760
If he rates 'em, that's it. Nobody says
no to Bunny Morris, and neither did I.

1050
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,440
- He's only comin' here
tomorrow night to see her.
- No!

1051
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,040
Yeah, he is. He's comin' here,
honest. I gotta pick him up
at the Grand at 7:00.

1052
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,960
- Tomorrow? We're on
tomorrow night and all?
- Yeah.

1053
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,360
Aye, aye. I've had to cancel
Silverados and Gringo Hodges.

1054
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,920
- Had to. They were going
mad in here tonight.
- "Once," we said.

1055
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,960
When Bunny sees her,
he'll do the same.

1056
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,000
We'll never be off the telly. MFI
Friday, Letterman... he'll fix 'em all.

1057
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:33,000
"Just once," we said.

1058
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,440
Today this crap-house,
tomorrow the bloody world.

1059
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,240
Route bloody One...
London, Leeds, Las Vegas.

1060
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,040
- Yee-haa!
- Just remember where
you got your start...

1061
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,280
my crap-house,
and you know what they say,

1062
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,360
"Shouldn't shit on folk
on way up, 'cause you're
bound to meet 'em on way down."

1063
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,880
Yeah, but we're not comin' down,
Boo. Up to the sky we're goin'.
Up to the bloody sky.

1064
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,760
Here's to the rise
of rise of Little Voice.

1065
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,200
God! The little bird's bleated
and died with all the shock.

1066
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:10,000
It's all right, Mari. She's just tired.
Bright lights and all that.

1067
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,920
Blessed are the meek for they shall
inherit the Earth. But when, eh? When?

1068
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,680
- Don't push her too hard.
- She needs pushing. That's the point.

1069
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,240
I've seen a lot of big talent
wasted in my time.

1070
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,680
Don't come the fucking
impresario with me.

1071
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,080
You run a club that no one
in their right mind wants to go to.

1072
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,760
You tell jokes that no one
in their right mind wants to laugh at.

1073
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:33,440
You're a nothing, Boo. It's me
with the contacts now, me with
the friends in the high places.

1074
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,760
Remember that. It's Ray
who's the big shot.

1075
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,240
- Do you not want a ride home?
- Yeah.

1076
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,400
I may not have friends
in high places, Ray,

1077
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,920
but I've got 'em in
the fuckin' used car business.

1078
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,640
LV!

1079
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,120
I know you're there, LV.

1080
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,800
You did it again, didn't you?
And again, tonight, it says.

1081
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,960
LV!

1082
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,200
LV, I'm worried.
Are you all right?

1083
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,280
Look, just don't let them
do it to ya.

1084
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,000
LV, I know you're there. I just want...

1085
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,880
Duane?

1086
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,760
Hey, fuck off, Romeo!

1087
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:38,080
You want to see her? Then sod off
down club and pay like everyone else.

1088
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,720
Do without that sort of crap
just before show, eh?

1089
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,680
When you need to be
concentrating your mind.

1090
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,920
Come on, love.
Enough of this.

1091
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,480
You've not opened your beak
all day to eat or to squeak.

1092
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,440
And even you squeak
from time to time, don't ya?

1093
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,040
Come on, love.
Squeak to me, eh?

1094
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,160
Duane.

1095
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,840
Steady, steady.
Steady.

1096
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,720
A long time since I've been
dragged down the Northern clubs, Say.

1097
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,040
- Better be good.
- Oh, yeah. Great, eh?

1098
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,840
Come in.

1099
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,840
Now, then, I'd thought you'd be showin'
up here sooner or later. You goin' in?

1100
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,000
Eh, don't know. Hello.
You must be George's wife.

1101
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,280
Wife? You bastard!

1102
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,520
Sorry, George.
Sorry.

1103
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,000
For one not known for his over-usage of
words, you don't half pick 'em, do ya?

1104
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,000
- Spare ticket now if you want one.
- Sorry.

1105
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,840
No, she's not moved, Sadie, love.

1106
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,720
But she's going to have
to in a minute, otherwise
she'll be going on like she is.

1107
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,440
I bet that Judy Garland never went
on stage in her bloody pajamas,

1108
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,960
so I don't know
why she wants to.

1109
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,560
Oh, Come on, LV, love, whatever it is
that's buggin' ya, just let it stop, eh?

1110
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,360
Just for a few hours, 'cause, look,
we're cutting things a bit fine now.

1111
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,360
Ray'll be here in a minute and
your mum's getting just a little
bit fucking irate, all right?

1112
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:43,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
will you welcome, please,
on this night of all nights...

1113
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,960
the compare
of all compares;

1114
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,640
the world's finest emcee;

1115
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,480
the funniest man ever
to have been on television;

1116
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,160
the man the Northern Echo called
"quite amusing";

1117
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,120
the chuckle bag himself:

1118
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,400
Your very ow-w-w-wn...

1119
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,320
Mi-i-i-ister Boo!

1120
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,360
Welcome to Mr. Boo's.
I'm Mr. Boo.

1121
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,240
- Don't shout my name too loud.
I'll think you don't like me.

1122
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,360
How y'all doin'? All right?

1123
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,040
Come on. You can do better than that.
How y'all doin'? All right?

1124
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,120
That's more like it. Have we
got some entertainment tonight.

1125
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,400
I don't know. Have we got some
entertainment for 'em tonight?
Of course we have.

1126
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,080
And we all know what
that entertainment is, don't we?

1127
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,160
Tonight, for the second
consecutive night in a row,

1128
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,240
sees the return
of young Little Voice.

1129
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,520
Thank you.

1130
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,440
Thank you. Thank you.

1131
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,880
But that's all in the future.
That's to look forward to.

1132
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,720
Ray's going to kill me.
He's going to throttle me.

1133
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,720
Then what'd you be like, eh,
with me murdered? Oh, be up
and about, then, I suppose.

1134
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,880
Happy as a lark. Oh, there be
no bloody croonin' for your dead mum.

1135
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,280
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1136
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,440
Oh, no! He's here!
He's here! Jesus! Jesus!

1137
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,640
Oh, come on!
LV, love, please.

1138
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,000
Eh, do it for
your mum, eh?

1139
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,800
Oh, do somethin' for me,
for Christ's sake,

1140
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,160
instead of that lousy,
dopey drip of a dead dad!

1141
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,080
Fuck!

1142
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,120
Darling.

1143
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,080
All right, Mari?
Okay?

1144
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,360
Bloody hell.
This is it, eh?

1145
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,440
Where's she then?

1146
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,800
LV,
management is here.

1147
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,760
Ray, love, there's, um...

1148
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,680
a bit of a...

1149
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,080
It's LV. She's dead tired.
She's really...

1150
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,680
Aren't we all, love. She'll be
all right once she gets on there.

1151
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,800
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for our first act...

1152
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,400
- five lads from Grimsby who have
a history of touching assholes.

1153
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,160
I said "our souls," madam.
The biggest thing in rock,

1154
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,240
Take Fat!

1155
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,000
# We'll be singing
when we're winning #

1156
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,920
# We'll be singing #

1157
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,320
# I get knocked down
but I get up again #

1158
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,480
# 'Cause you're never
gonna keep me down #

1159
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,880
# I get knocked down
but I get up again #

1160
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,080
# 'Cause you're never
gonna keep me down #

1161
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,360
# I get knocked down
but I get up again ##

1162
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,240
- Could she not have this night off?
- This night off?

1163
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,080
What are you on about? Bunny Morris
is there. He's there now, waiting.

1164
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,840
This night off? This night?
This is the night, love!

1165
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,520
Fuck! Fuckin' house!

1166
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,760
- But, Ray...
- Ray, Ray, Ray, what?

1167
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,640
Did you get her dress from
the dry cleaners okay? Yeah?

1168
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,840
Sadie, love,
you pick up the dress?

1169
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:58,760
- Oh, no. You forgot it.
- I've been so busied with her, Ray.

1170
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,000
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey! Watch me furniture, you!

1171
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,880
- Furniture?
- Now, then, a novelty act...

1172
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,280
noveler than any I know.

1173
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,560
So please give
a big Mr. Boo welcome...

1174
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:15,240
to Brenda Bailey
and her farmyard frolics.

1175
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,280
Two things... that's all you had to do...
get the dress and have her ready.

1176
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,000
Oh, I know.
I'm sorry, darling.

1177
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,480
- But don't be crossy with
your darling puss-puss.
- Never mind all that crap.

1178
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,600
Good boy. Jump!

1179
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,280
Where's LV?
Have you seen Ray Say or LV?

1180
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,960
- No.
- Christ. Trigger,
you better string it out a bit.

1181
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,680
- Do an extra five minutes.
- I'll do it blindfolded.

1182
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,440
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

1183
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,600
- Sadie, give that
a once-over with iron, eh?
- Okay.

1184
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,400
What? She's not even dressed?
We can't have this, Mari.

1185
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:56,680
I'm gonna have to get
someone else to look after her.

1186
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,080
Ray, no.
What are you sayin'?

1187
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,480
Eh, you're too quiet to be
me friend, you. Fuck off!

1188
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,240
Eh, I'm doin' it now,
Ray, love. Yes, I am.

1189
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,600
So a big welcome, please,
to Wild Trigger Smith...

1190
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:29,680
and the lovely Elaine!

1191
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,560
# Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' #

1192
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:40,000
# Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rawhide #

1193
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,280
- Leave it! Aah!
Oh!

1194
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,200
- Fuckin' house!
- Ray!

1195
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,640
- Aah! What? What?
- Kiss me, Ray.

1196
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,120
- Oh, give over. We haven't got the time.
- Eh, lover...

1197
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,320
Stop clinging, will ya? You're all over
me all the time, like the bloody pox.

1198
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,320
Don't spoil it, Raymondo.
We go so well together.

1199
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,560
We go nowhere. For a start,
you're past it. You're body's gone.

1200
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:07,600
When your clothes go, I can't keep
track of it. It's all over the place.

1201
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:12,600
There's no way that
you're coming with me and her
to better things. No way, love.

1202
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:15,160
LV! You got
ten fucking seconds!

1203
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,920
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

1204
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,240
All you're doin'
is gettin' in the way.

1205
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,320
You were in the way
the first night I heard her,

1206
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,600
and you're still
in the way now.

1207
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,000
Christ. Do you think
I don't have birds I go to?

1208
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,640
Don't you think it's like puttin'
me face in flowers after you?

1209
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,880
You've had it, Mari.

1210
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,760
For God's sake,
wise up, woman, eh?

1211
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,120
Eh?
And fuck off.

1212
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,920
# Keep them doggies rollin'
Rawhide #

1213
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:06,680
Elaine, are you still there?

1214
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,600
- Get 'em off, Boo!
You go on. It's not right.
- They're doin' fine.

1215
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,200
Curtains!

1216
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,080
- Ta. Thank you. Ta. A big hand,
ladies and gentlemen,

1217
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,360
For Wild Trigger Smith...

1218
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,360
and the lovely,
lucky Elaine!

1219
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,840
- # Hah, hah #
- Sadie!

1220
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,600
What're you doin'?
Here, get this on.

1221
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,960
Come on. I've had enough
of you lot tonight.
Dress on now. Move it, will ya?

1222
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,480
Hello, number one.

1223
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,720
- What's your name,
where'd you come from?
- What?

1224
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,040
Hello, everybody.
This is Mrs... Norman... Maine.

1225
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,440
Stop messin' about.
We're late.

1226
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,600
So hurry before they shut the gate.
- Save it for the punters.

1227
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,720
# Click, clack, click, clack
Click, clack, click #

1228
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,280
- # There's music in the clatter
of the clogs ##
- I'm warnin' you, LV.

1229
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,640
I know... I'll
sing 'em all and we'll stay all night.

1230
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,400
See what I mean? Not very bright.

1231
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,800
But the villain only laughed!

1232
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,200
- LV, come on.
Run, Toto, run!

1233
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,160
- Stop it.
# When you smile, smile, smile #

1234
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,200
- We're on our way together.
# Happy together #

1235
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,280
# Unhappy together ##

1236
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,560
- LV, why?
# Because Because, because, because #

1237
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,720
# Because, because of the
wonderful things he does ##

1238
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,600
- I warned you...
Shame on you!

1239
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,120
Never mind your teeth! Leave 'em out!

1240
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,120
Fuckin' house!

1241
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,720
Lions and tigers and bears. Oh, my!

1242
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,600
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!

1243
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,720
I'm frightened, Auntie Em!
I'm frightened!

1244
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,120
Now we're cookin', aren't we?
You hear about this chicken?

1245
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,280
He went into a library
in Essex...

1246
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,640
No, uh... No, that weren't
a chicken, was it? Uh...

1247
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,960
- Uh... Oh, it's gone.
Boo! Bollocks! Boo!

1248
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,880
# Look what you started
This conflagration #

1249
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,800
# Baby, that's what #

1250
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:26,160
# Don't let the flames go out
Some like it hot ##

1251
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,240
She's a redhead, my wife. No hair,
just a read head.

1252
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,400
I love her terribly, I do.
That's what she says, anyway.

1253
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,560
Listen, calm down, calm down.
She'll be along in a sec.

1254
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:40,720
What did I tell ya? I said if you
didn't laugh at my jokes, I'd sing.

1255
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,720
That's what I said. Well, Boo's
a man of his word, I'm afraid.

1256
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,200
Will you bear with me? Uh, anyway,
as they say in the business,

1257
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,400
this, ladies and gentlemen,
is me.

1258
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,400
# Your baby doesn't love you any more #

1259
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,960
# Two, three, four ## Ray!

1260
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,840
I had something...
ladies and gentlemen.

1261
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,560
I had something
really special.

1262
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,120
This is
my room... and you're all here...

1263
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,680
and I'm not gonna leave here
ever, ever again,

1264
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,600
because I love you all.

1265
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,960
# Golden days before they end #
End?

1266
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,960
They never bloody started.
Bunny Morris. Bunny "Starmaker" Morris.

1267
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,400
Fuck off,
ya jumped-up little prat.

1268
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,320
# Your baby won't be near you #

1269
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,360
# Anymore #
Just as well, 'cause they always
fuck it up for ya, don't they?

1270
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,600
# Tender nights
before they fly #

1271
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,560
Well, mine has.

1272
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,840
# Send falling stars
that seem to cry #

1273
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,720
That's because they
can't fucking hack it.

1274
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

1275
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,360
- I had a dream.
- There's no place like home.

1276
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:01,080
- There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
- # It's over #

1277
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,640
- When I think of
what might've been, eh?
- There's no place like home.

1278
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,480
# It breaks your heart
in two #

1279
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,000
Finished,
fucking finished me.

1280
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,840
# To know that
she's untrue #

1281
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,480
# But, oh
what will you do #

1282
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,920
What will I do, eh?

1283
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,680
What the fuck
am I gonna do?

1284
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,520
# We're through #

1285
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,240
- # It's over #
- There's no place like home.

1286
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,320
- # It's over #
- There's no place like home.

1287
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,240
LV!

1288
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,000
# It's over #

1289
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,440
# All the rainbows
in the sky #

1290
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,800
Over the fuckin' rainbow,
eh?

1291
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,320
# Start to weep
then say good-bye #

1292
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,160
Good-fucking-bye!

1293
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,200
# You won't be
seeing rainbows #

1294
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,200
# Anymore #

1295
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,920
Okay.

1296
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,960
- LV! My baby!
- It's all right, love.
Everybody's out.

1297
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,920
# It's over, it's over #

1298
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,680
# It's over #

1299
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:40,200
# It's over ##

1300
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,720
The adorable Mr. Ray Say,
ladies and gentlemen,

1301
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,800
with a little song about
his show business career...

1302
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,160
called, "It's Over."

1303
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,400
So, how you all doin'?
All right?

1304
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,800
- There you go.
- Oh.

1305
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,160
- Thanks, Billy.
- Yeah, all right.
It's just old stuff from the van.

1306
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:46,440
No, I mean,
thanks for gettin' me out.

1307
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,840
Oh, that's all right.

1308
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,240
- Hey, you should get out
more often.
- Heh!

1309
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,000
W- Why did you want
to come down here?

1310
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,000
My dad used to
bring me here.

1311
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,080
Listen to concerts.

1312
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,000
LV, uh...

1313
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,920
There's people other
than your dad who, well,

1314
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,440
other people who...

1315
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,560
who might think something
of you, and, ah,

1316
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:31,640
other people who are,
well, still alive.

1317
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,160
Billy. I've got to go.

1318
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,080
- Oh!
- LV?

1319
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,760
Didn't handle that very well.

1320
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,760
What's happened here,
then, little match girl?

1321
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,560
The little stick
who wrecks everything.

1322
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,280
I can't start again,
can I, now?

1323
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,560
Who'd want me anyway,
hmm?

1324
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,960
Who'd want me?

1325
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,400
Wait a minute.

1326
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,560
What do you want,
anyway?

1327
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:35,640
Oh, I know. Your records.

1328
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:40,200
Well, all salvage
crap's out on back roof, LV, love.

1329
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,560
Maybe they'll be there.

1330
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,640
What's up?
Cat got your tongue?

1331
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,240
Can you hear me now, Mother? My dad...

1332
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:29,560
You drove him as fast
as you could to an early grave!

1333
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,360
With your men
and your shouting...

1334
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,640
and your pals
and your nights...

1335
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,000
and your nights
and your nights...

1336
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,560
and your nights and your nights
and your nights...

1337
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,960
of neglect!

1338
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:46,520
Ohh.

1339
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,320
When he had his records on,
he sparkled.

1340
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,360
Not dazzling, like you,

1341
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,360
but with fine lights.

1342
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,280
Fine lights.

1343
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,400
He never spoke up to ya,

1344
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,840
'cause you would
never listen.

1345
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,360
I never spoke up to ya,

1346
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:15,280
Because I could never get a word in!

1347
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,360
Little Voice.

1348
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,240
Me name's Laura.

1349
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,040
Everything all right then?

1350
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,080
Fine. Is that Duane?

1351
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,960
- Aye. Just about back
to normal now, I reckon.
- Yeah.

1352
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,880
I think I know
how he feels.

1353
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,120
Do you want
to give me an 'and?

1354
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,720
With exercise?

1355
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,640
Yeah.

1356
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,520
All right.

1357
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,040
Let's fly! Come on.
Let's go for a fly.

1358
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,120
- Shoo! Shoo, fly. Fly.
- Go on, up!

1359
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,400
Up you get.
Come on. Come on.

1360
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,480
# There's no business
like show business #

1361
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:12,440
# Like no business I know #

1362
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,880
# Everything about it
is appealing #

1363
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,280
# Everything the traffic
will allow #

1364
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,200
# Nowhere could you get
that happy feeling #

1365
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:25,840
# When you are stealing
that extra bow #

1366
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,560
# There's no people
like show people #

1367
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,200
# They smile when they are low #

1368
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,400
# Yesterday they told you
you would not go far #

1369
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,080
# That night you opened
and there you are #

1370
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,400
# Next day on your dressing room
they hung a star #

1371
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:48,120
# Let's go on with the show #

1372
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,760
# The costumes, the scenery
The make-up, the props #

1373
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,280
# The audience that lifts you
when you're down #

1374
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,680
# The headaches, the heartaches
The backaches, the flops #

1375
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:03,800
# The sheriff who escorts you
out of town #

1376
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:09,480
# The opening when your
heart beats like a drum #

1377
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:15,360
# The closing when the customers
don't come #

1378
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,240
# There's no business
like show business #

1379
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,760
# Like no business I know #

1380
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,120
# You get word before
the show has started #

1381
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,400
# That your favorite uncle
died at dawn #

1382
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,280
# On top of that
your pa and ma have parted #

1383
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,840
# You're broken-hearted
but you go on #

1384
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,480
# There's no people
like show people #

1385
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,080
# They smile when they are low #

1386
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,400
# Even with a turkey
that you know will fold #

1387
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:51,840
# You may be stranded
out in the cold #

1388
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
# Still you wouldn't change it
for a sack of gold #

1389
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,600
# Let's go on with the show #

1390
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:06,240
# Let's go on with the #

1391
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:12,080
# Show ##
