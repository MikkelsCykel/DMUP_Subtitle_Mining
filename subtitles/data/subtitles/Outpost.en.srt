00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,115
<i>- You speak the language?
- Better than most of the people in here.</i>

2
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,450
The locals all said
you were the go-to guy on this.

3
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,687
- You work with a regular team?
- Just the redneck.

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,598
Tell me about this area.

5
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,197
Hundred and fifty Ks northwest of here.

6
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,706
Every couple of months it switches
between government and insurgency hands.

7
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,206
My advice, don't go there.

8
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,341
<i>I have to.</i>

9
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,621
<i>When the war is over,
this place will be a free market.</i>

10
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,132
<i>- It's mineral rich.
- Are you some kind of geologist?</i>

11
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,634
<i>An engineer.</i>

12
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,637
I'm on a retainer to a company
that acquired some real estate here.

13
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,765
I go in, survey it. You ensure my safety.

14
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,037
- I'll operate a six-man fire team.
- How much?

15
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,410
- Six thousand US per man, cash.
- Four.

16
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,779
Payable only on my safe return.

17
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,680
- You've worked with mercenaries before.
- Where the guidebooks recommend.

18
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,689
But where you've been
has nothing to do with where you are.

19
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,883
Five.

20
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,785
Equipment will run to another five, up front.

21
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,234
Be here tomorrow night.

22
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,365
I'll have a squad by then.

23
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,744
Fucking ride, eh?

24
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,879
This big fancy company
can't pay for a bird, huh?

25
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,823
And let those RPGs blow us out the sky

26
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,759
like the Red Cross
a couple of months back?

27
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,420
Smart moves.

28
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,794
How am I supposed to work with this shit?

29
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,526
So don't get hit.

30
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,870
So what do you think this place is?

31
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,909
- Fucked if I know. Same if I care.
- Right.

32
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,639
Man pays the money, he picks the tune.

33
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,650
<i>He's kurac, anyway.
There's nothing built out here for sure.</i>

34
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,844
Yeah, whatever.

35
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,649
Take a good look at secrets man up here.

36
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,289
Now, why does a prick like that
hire seven swords in a bar?

37
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,257
For the same reason he doesn't go
with private security, either.

38
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,799
Secrets, man.

39
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,499
So what is real story, huh, Top?

40
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,083
Yeah, this is it.

41
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,420
- What do you think?
- Think we're gonna get wet.

42
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,203
All right, roll it out.

43
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,036
There's a lot of traffic.

44
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,442
Regular Army has positions to the south.
Insurgents to the north.

45
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,106
UN safe area is southwest.

46
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,514
Right, lads, places to be.

47
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,927
Jesus Christ!

48
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,744
Why have we gone dark?

49
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,084
'Cause this thing was built
before they invented fucking trees.

50
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,385
Well, we're not going anywhere
with it down,

51
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,016
so get it done.

52
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,188
Fifty says that company of his
lost some new flyer out here.

53
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,822
Serious?

54
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,060
- An airplane?
- Sure.

55
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,797
Some high-tech shit on board, too.

56
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,738
Got to test those bad boys
in live conditions, man.

57
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,709
And what, you a CIA operator?

58
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,978
No.

59
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,878
But 100 says he could be.

60
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,295
Well, it's not a plane.

61
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,434
Cotter, give me a base of fire from here
in case we have to double-time it back out.

62
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,070
The rest of you give me a perimeter.

63
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:31,969
<i>Four, okay.</i>

64
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,562
Five, good.

65
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,907
<i>- One, okay.
- Six, okay.</i>

66
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,535
<i>Two, all good.</i>

67
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,541
He's underground, huh?

68
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,140
<i>You'd be smart
if you weren't so fucking stupid,</i>

69
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,878
<i>do you know that?</i>

70
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,583
You're with him.

71
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,286
Okay, everyone on me.

72
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,573
Hunt.

73
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,247
- This is it?
- Yeah.

74
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,348
Minerals, huh? Right.

75
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,689
Cotter, Tak, doors.

76
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,833
Jordan and Tak, hold. Everyone else on me.

77
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,588
Down here.

78
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,959
Right. Hunt, on me.

79
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,362
Prior, Voyteche, left.

80
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,263
Cotter, McKay, right.

81
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,930
Clear.

82
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,322
What the fucking hell does a guy like him
want with a shithole like this?

83
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,031
- What?
- Quarter right. On the tree line.

84
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,903
How many?

85
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,638
<i>In the tree line!</i>

86
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,876
You, stay.

87
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,181
Rounds received?

88
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,114
- Come on. Rounds received.
- None.

89
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,310
What?

90
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:16,946
Someone confirm me a fucking target!

91
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,551
Cease fire.

92
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,391
Mac, shut that off.

93
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,428
Man down!

94
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,702
Jordan, get the fuck over here!

95
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,249
- Cease fire, everyone, cease fire.
- Cease fire. We're fucking bleeding here!

96
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:50,880
- Shut the fuck up! Mac!
- I said cease fucking firing! Tak!

97
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,691
Hey! Take it easy.

98
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,456
- Where's the shooter?
- Right. 60 meters. I don't know!

99
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,976
See? I got him.

100
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,706
Lucky if you hit that tree out there.

101
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,513
That's one nervous little bitch finger
you got on your trigger there, teardrop.

102
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,022
When I say, "Hold fire," you hold fire.

103
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,221
I got him.

104
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,289
You sure of that?
Fine. Sweep and clean that area.

105
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,301
- Oh, fuck, Sputnik, I'll do it.
- No!

106
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,801
I do it.

107
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,905
The rest of you, cover him.

108
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,731
- It's nothing.
- Bodies? Blood?

109
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,733
Not even shell casings.

110
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,472
Are we good?

111
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,301
Yeah.

112
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:56,314
It was probably some passing patrol
or someone out for a jolly.

113
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,873
But this place is a tactical nightmare.

114
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,942
I've got an elevated tree line
bordering open ground,

115
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,885
and I need to deal with that.

116
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,820
How long will it take?

117
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,417
I need any available power on-line
down here, in case we have to hole up.

118
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,587
Can you help me with that? Right.

119
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,928
Voyteche, Tak, hold here
until we square it away down below.

120
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:21,838
- We're gonna be bottled up down there.
- Beats getting ventilated up here.

121
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,206
Jordan, Mac, need you mobile.

122
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,507
I need a fortnight in Tijuana.

123
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:42,358
You know, what you're doing here
is your business, and I respect that.

124
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,952
But when we start taking fire,

125
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,260
your business
can quickly become my business.

126
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,199
Could there be others, like you, out here?

127
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,601
No, there's no one else looking.

128
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,913
Why so sure?

129
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,916
My backers are wealthy enough
to ensure silence.

130
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,451
From anybody.

131
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,298
War has been played out around here
for years.

132
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,773
Anybody could have stumbled across it.

133
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,969
That entry was easy enough.

134
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,383
Sure, the odd patrol could have come
down here from time to time, maybe.

135
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,884
But they don't know what to look for.

136
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,615
And that would be?

137
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,159
Minerals?

138
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:52,493
Who does he think he's kidding?
This place is wrong, very wrong.

139
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,515
Is it just me, or does that not belong here?

140
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,174
Generator.

141
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,652
- Can you get it going?
- Let's see.

142
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,540
What the fuck is this guy looking for?

143
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,210
What is that?

144
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,644
Motherfuck!

145
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,615
Fuck!

146
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,635
- I think we're good if...
- Medic!

147
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,398
- Jordan!
- Stay here.

148
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:20,699
Jordan!

149
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,299
Clear.

150
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,074
Over here.

151
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,806
Principal's back that way,
keep an eye on him. Jordan.

152
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,871
We need a fucking medic!

153
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,977
Medic!

154
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,544
Jordan!

155
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,384
We've got a fucking breather down there!

156
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,220
Jesus!

157
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,360
Don't just fucking stand there! Help me!

158
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,159
- Shit!
- Jesus fuck!

159
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,669
Look at him.

160
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,661
Name?

161
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,566
Poor bastard.

162
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,334
His brain is totally minced.

163
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,533
Name?

164
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,974
Back off!

165
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,245
He's fucking gone, guys. Pluto.

166
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,182
I'm shot.
What part of me looks like I give a fuck?

167
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,277
Wait a sec.
He could just be a fucking farmer.

168
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,686
Farmer? Yeah, right.

169
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:21,089
- Talk, fuckmeat!
- That's enough.

170
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,457
Top, I reckon the locals used this place
for a little bit of ethnic cleansing

171
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,763
- then moved on.
- It's possible.

172
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,004
It's like a slaughterhouse down there.

173
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,306
- He's the only one we found breathing.
- Christ.

174
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,073
Your guess is as good as mine.

175
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,674
So what does that make you?
Some kind of fucking tourist?

176
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,718
- I could ask you the same.
- I'm a soldier.

177
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,185
No, you're an employee.

178
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,518
Speaking of which, aren't you supposed
to be protecting someone?

179
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,887
How do you think I got that?

180
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,722
- And how does beating him up help?
- It made me feel better, all right?

181
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,024
Running a little low on causes, though,
wouldn't you say?

182
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,427
Walk away.

183
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,072
You know, getting punchy
isn't the smartest play with these guys.

184
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,202
Which is why I hired you to hold their leash.

185
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,577
You seem pretty concerned for his welfare.

186
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,707
It's just a little thing called compassion.

187
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,944
- So he's nothing to do with you?
- Nothing.

188
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,919
And finding all those dead bodies
and him in the middle

189
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,424
has got nothing to do
with your assignment?

190
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,483
I don't think he looked like
he was in my line of business, do you?

191
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,689
Now, am I dismissed?

192
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,563
That being the case,
I think you might all want to see this.

193
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,808
You can say what you like about the Nazis,
but they had style.

194
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,245
What the fuck are we doing
standing in a German bunker?

195
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,372
SS.

196
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,149
- But not since about 1945.
- Aye, right.

197
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,449
Wait a minute.

198
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,991
You're looking for gold out here, right?

199
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,027
I know about all this shit.

200
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,652
Lost Nazi gold.

201
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,871
Right. Fuck gold.

202
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,567
I want three primaries up there
in the tree line, 30 meters spread

203
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:19,940
- and lay some wire beyond that.
- Whoa, stop the fucking bus.

204
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,138
I thought this was strictly a 48, in and out.

205
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,704
And now we've got an unknown number
of hostiles sending down fire.

206
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,876
So we, meaning you, dig in.

207
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,125
Bodies.

208
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,961
Dead men this high.

209
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,396
Why dump them here?

210
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,407
Because they more than just killed
these men.

211
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,672
Burying someone already, eh?

212
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,510
Set in for the night.

213
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:01,348
- Mr. Cunt thinks he's onto some Nazi gold.
- Gold?

214
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:04,411
Those bushwhackers out there
think they're following a money train.

215
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,855
They'll be back.

216
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,758
So you better watch your arses. All right?

217
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,726
Forty-eight hour job.

218
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,993
You have better places to be?

219
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,889
Nice.

220
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,495
You play?

221
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,967
All this shit is why I left the Marines.

222
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,873
- Strike gold yet?
- Can't even find a match to strike. You got?

223
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,035
Sure.

224
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:25,248
I hate that feeling you get in the field.

225
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,217
You know, always like
someone is watching you.

226
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,017
Apparently someone is.
Didn't take you for a religious girl.

227
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,216
Yeah.

228
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,784
My old boy was a priest.

229
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,490
Said it was just like being a soldier.

230
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,194
Both do a lot of things on faith.

231
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,395
Yeah.

232
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,536
We both get to burn twice, too.

233
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,733
Once here, then in Hell.

234
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:59,544
Why don't you police up any med supplies
we got downstairs?

235
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,721
Any time now is just fine, nurse.

236
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,255
Go on.

237
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,473
Your move, by the way.

238
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,427
Nice.

239
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:56,266
You're gonna have me
in trouble pretty quick by this rate.

240
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:25,035
Bet you'd talk to her if she bent down
and touched her toes, eh, big lad?

241
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,577
Checkmate?

242
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,712
Just slipped on some loose gold, eh?

243
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,189
- How is our comm situation?
- Not good, Tops.

244
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,726
Not since you ripped
the battery out backwards.

245
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,991
There's a radio room back there
you can cut into. Detail Prior on him

246
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,329
and see if you can scare us up enough
to get back online.

247
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,393
Whoever shot you is still out there
and I don't want to be deaf.

248
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,745
Your men need to grow up.

249
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,821
That's a nine mil hollow-point.

250
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,879
Now, a shell like this
is gonna push your lungs

251
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,152
clean through your spine.

252
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,286
Leave an exit wound big enough
to jump through.

253
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,403
You're gonna talk sooner or later, Gunst.

254
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,876
And it's gonna be to me.

255
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,574
So, this is what all the fuss is about?

256
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,681
What is it?

257
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,146
- The last 18 years of my life.
- This?

258
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,747
It may not look like much right now,

259
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,256
but this could be the Holy Grail of physics.

260
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,661
I never really trusted science.

261
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,757
Well,

262
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,894
there are four forces that control matter.

263
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,737
The key has been trying to find
how those forces interact.

264
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,402
If we can do that,
then we can explain the behavior

265
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,672
of all the substance in the universe.

266
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,443
Einstein coined a phrase,
unified field theory.

267
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:36,316
Many people thought he was close
to finding a solution.

268
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,719
But when he saw the atomic bomb tests
at Trinity,

269
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,986
he abandoned the research
and destroyed his notes.

270
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,761
Nobody has even come close
to finding a solution since.

271
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,458
So you came all the way out here
because you think that the Nazis...

272
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,864
Were working on the same thing.

273
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:56,896
I think this machine was designed
to manipulate a unified field.

274
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,071
And that chamber above it
where you found the bodies,

275
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,581
was built to control the resultant energy,
contain it.

276
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,213
- Why?
- The Germans were trying to win a war.

277
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,847
But with this technology,

278
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,380
its application and impact
in the modern world would be

279
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,959
limitless.

280
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,364
And probably priceless.

281
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,700
Mr. Hunt, is that you, sir?

282
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,111
You okay?

283
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,565
What's the matter?
You look like I fucked your sister.

284
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,608
You ain't gonna get an answer, you know.

285
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,911
Shut up!

286
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,752
Killed a man once, asked for two things.

287
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,418
When he was done crying for his mama,
he begged for his God.

288
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,928
And you know what the answer was?

289
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,827
A bullet.

290
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,728
See...

291
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,067
That bright light...

292
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,736
It ain't Heaven, son.

293
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,633
It's just a muzzle flare.

294
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,779
Hey.

295
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,184
Listen.

296
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,880
Fucking love culture.

297
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,651
Mac, turn that shit off!

298
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,662
Incoming!

299
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,556
Contact!

300
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,773
- How many?
- Fuck knows!

301
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,546
You, hold fast.

302
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,851
Stay down. Pick your targets.

303
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,662
Mac, quarter left. Cotter, quarter right.

304
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,814
Jesus!

305
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,493
God damn it!

306
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,650
Sound off.

307
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,345
- One, okay.
- Two, okay.

308
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,354
- Three, okay.
- Four, okay.

309
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,688
- Six, okay.
- Seven, okay.

310
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,493
Five. Sound off. Five?

311
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,988
- He's gone.
- What the...

312
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,534
- Tak? Taktarov?
- No, stay down.

313
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,696
Voyteche. What happened?

314
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,138
- I don't know. The wind...
- Tak!

315
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,273
- Where the fuck is he?
- Maybe he done a runner down the bunker.

316
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,472
- Maybe they took him.
- Tak!

317
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,606
How close did they get in?

318
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,844
Prior, check the perimeter.

319
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,945
No way they got that close.
Too much open ground.

320
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,220
What, the wind and light show
didn't distract you?

321
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,828
Wire ain't touched.
The Claymores are intact.

322
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,199
- They didn't even get close.
- So he ran.

323
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,328
No.

324
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,063
He didn't run.

325
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,033
Fuckers must really want
a piece of that gold.

326
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,773
There is no gold.

327
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,051
All right, hold fast.

328
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,118
- Top?
- Later, Jordan.

329
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,319
Sir.

330
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,664
I've been holding this.

331
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,393
The round I dug out of Mac's arm.

332
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,526
An old 7.62, huh?

333
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,028
Yeah, except look at it.

334
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,701
There's no way it could have been fired,
it's totally wasted.

335
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,267
You sure?

336
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:32,076
Trust me, that could never have
cleared a barrel's end.

337
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:36,381
This, Tak, that cross, and before...

338
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,380
Jesus, 18 hours ago this was an easy ride.

339
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,322
Aye, and 36 hours ago
you could handle anything.

340
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,587
Now wind your bloody neck in!

341
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,255
Sir.

342
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,756
Fuck with me.

343
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,057
Please.

344
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,308
- Which one?
- Tak.

345
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,452
Whoever took him left that.

346
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,285
This was a Nazi bunker, DC.
There are plenty of relics here.

347
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,715
See where that's decayed?

348
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:53,422
That should have killed the man firing it.
Instead we pulled it out of Mac's arm.

349
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,829
Your team can function
with a man down, right?

350
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,493
Oh, sure. Maybe you'd like to shoulder arms

351
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,160
and come and sample the fucked up
weather and light show

352
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,670
we've been having as well, eh?

353
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:05,071
- Weather and lights?
- Yeah, fireworks and a wind.

354
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,476
Well, like nothing
I've ever experienced before.

355
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,980
Things happen in the field, but...

356
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:13,974
Ludicrous.

357
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:17,714
Well, trust me, after what I've just seen,
nothing is ludicrous.

358
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,190
Maybe he took it himself.

359
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,660
Or whoever took him left it.

360
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,425
Right. So whoever they are,
wear the Iron Cross

361
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,363
and are fucking invisible to you, eh?

362
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,369
Mac, think about it. Behind the wire.

363
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:37,032
Oh, come on, you've seen that complex.
They could be right beneath us.

364
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,007
- We cleared it.
- Did we?

365
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,503
We're in charge.

366
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:03,426
The Third Reich was renowned
for dabbling with the occult.

367
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,903
Fantasy blending with scientific research.

368
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,041
Field theory would have been
perfect for them.

369
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,978
An equation
that could bend space and time.

370
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,440
Potentially alter reality.

371
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:28,849
They were running some kind of trials
on these soldiers.

372
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:35,829
Exposing them to the energy
harnessed in that chamber above.

373
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:36,957
Why?

374
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,666
Honestly, I think they were trying
to enhance the men.

375
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,799
Enhance them?

376
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:50,142
Theoretically, the human body
could become fused, disappear.

377
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,775
Interwoven with
the magnetic fields themselves.

378
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,554
The Americans tried something similar
in '43.

379
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:04,452
<i>An attempt was made to render a warship,
the USS Eldridge, invisible,</i>

380
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,496
using Einstein's theories.

381
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,054
The Philadelphia Experiment.

382
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:12,363
Urban myth has it
they were partially successful.

383
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:15,769
I think the Nazis were attempting
something similar.

384
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,100
Maybe even more ambitious.

385
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:29,278
A soldier that was invulnerable,
unstoppable.

386
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,081
You're not serious?

387
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,754
They were.

388
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:22,271
An Army that could travel
thousands of miles,

389
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,206
and nobody would be any the wiser

390
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,733
until it materialized at the gates
of the White House.

391
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,971
Well, that's great.

392
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,846
But as far as I remember,
the Germans lost the war.

393
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,820
And I don't think we're fighting
a bunch of pensioners, do you?

394
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,554
In theory, the men could still be
trapped within the fields.

395
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:49,359
They would only resurface
when the fields are disrupted, like, by us.

396
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,135
In English.

397
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:55,797
All existence is nothing more than vibration.

398
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:59,137
For years, those who believe
have claimed that

399
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:05,106
apparitions are merely ripples
in electro-magnetic fields.

400
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:09,642
- Echoes of a previous vibration.
- Apparitions, you mean ghosts?

401
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,314
You need help, really. Fucking ghosts?

402
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,483
Ten minutes ago you were
talking about magic bullets

403
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,494
and men who vanished into thin air.

404
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,621
So, fuck your Nobel Prize!

405
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,165
I'm pulling the plug right now.
Start packing.

406
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,326
- You can't do that.
- Oh, you watch me.

407
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,962
No, you really can't do that.

408
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,038
Sometimes it's not the bullets that kill you.

409
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,739
It's the orders.

410
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,877
I was surprised some of your men
had loved ones.

411
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,586
You ran us through.

412
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:53,520
There was no exaggeration
in what I said before.

413
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,566
This machine could be worth billions.

414
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:59,158
The backers have assets in Interpol.

415
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,764
They'll go after the families first,
yours and mine!

416
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,738
I've told the financiers.

417
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:16,143
- Another team's been dispatched.
- How long?

418
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,744
They're moving as fast as they can.

419
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:36,237
Please, I have a little child.

420
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,376
Fucking hell are they doing to him?

421
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,094
They're playing with some black dice now.

422
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,753
They say you can feel them.
The bad ones, you know?

423
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:11,164
How you know that?

424
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,670
- Been talking to the dead?
- I've seen some things, I'll tell you that.

425
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,333
But this, this shit is just fucking weird, eh?

426
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,535
I wouldn't know.

427
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,044
Never lived another way.

428
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:27,243
Yeah? Well, where I come from,
a lad doesn't join the British Army.

429
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,251
Not a good son, anyway.

430
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,257
I held my first AK-47 when I was five.

431
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,518
Fired it at nine.

432
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:42,622
I make my first clean kill when I was 15.

433
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,828
Families forgive.

434
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:50,696
But one thing I know,

435
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,175
there's no motherfucker care less
about us right now.

436
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:10,811
Fuck!

437
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:27,956
No way.

438
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,522
No fucking way did someone
get past us to do this.

439
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,194
- He's right. Wire is intact.
- Because they did it.

440
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,464
- Who the fuck are "they"?
- Oh, come on Mac.

441
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,632
- You've seen something, I know you have.
- No such thing.

442
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,437
No such what?

443
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,138
- They put an empty in Tak's fucking skull!
- Jordan.

444
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,271
To fuck with reason!

445
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,146
These are no ordinary guys. Think!

446
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,277
- That Nazi shit. The bullet in his arm!
- Shut it.

447
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:52,753
Oh, come on, Christ!

448
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:56,258
They've punched his head
into a fucking canoe here!

449
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,887
Brass knuckles.
Savages have got skills, I'll give you that.

450
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,864
- Put them in their ponchos.
- It's a message.

451
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,065
They own this place.

452
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,370
That's enough. We pull out.

453
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,902
- We can't leave.
- We can and we are.

454
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,005
We'll never make it
through those trees alive.

455
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:22,347
And even if we could,
then the financiers would...

456
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:25,046
- You know what happens if we leave.
- I'll take my chances.

457
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:28,716
You won't have any chance
unless you start listening!

458
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,918
- I think that... If we could only get...
- Enough!

459
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,086
...the machine online, then maybe...

460
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,994
We've been compromised
by a superior force

461
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:36,554
and we are pulling out.

462
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,329
You think a normal enemy would do that?

463
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,231
I've seen worse.

464
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,297
You certainly will unless you start to listen.

465
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:48,743
Fine.

466
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,905
You want to stay? Go ahead.

467
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,078
Didn't think so.

468
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:05,123
...For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

469
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,458
What, you really believe that shite?

470
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,590
Like there's, you know, after?

471
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,135
I know a man's soul
deserves to rest in peace.

472
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,670
We gave up that right
when we started killing men

473
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:18,673
who believed in things for money.

474
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,265
Boy has got it.

475
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,275
Yeah, right, well, meantime...

476
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,147
I've got bills to pay in the real world, eh?

477
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,549
Cotter. Hunt's busy playing fuckwit
down there. Go and police him up, will you?

478
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,316
The rest of you,
I want out of here within the hour.

479
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,132
You prick.

480
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:48,653
Mr. Hunt,
I've been ordered to get you mobile, sir.

481
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,598
You wouldn't be in such a hurry
if you knew what was out there.

482
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,067
And what is that?

483
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,937
- We're all going to die.
- Right. Of boredom.

484
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,567
Listening to you whine and complain.

485
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,115
Run!

486
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,463
- Are we good?
- What about Tak and Voyteche?

487
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:58,694
- It's too much weight to carry.
- And him?

488
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:00,065
Fuck him!

489
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,303
Shots fired! Clear!

490
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,104
- Where's the contact?
- Engine room, now!

491
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,238
Christ, come on, this way!

492
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,311
Shit.

493
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,475
Fuck!

494
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,292
Oh, Jesus.

495
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,595
All right. All right.

496
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:54,746
Someone want to tell me
what the fuck he's talking about?

497
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:58,851
- Thinks we're being stalked by dead Nazis.
- Ghosts?

498
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,419
I didn't get shot
by some fucking spectral entity, here.

499
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:02,862
These things are solid.

500
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,093
But the one that killed Cotter
vanished right in front of us.

501
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,067
So why don't they swoop down here
like God's own wrath

502
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:08,967
and take us out
right here and now, then, eh?

503
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:11,472
I don't know.
Maybe God's not in on this miracle.

504
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,839
What difference does it make? We're fucked.

505
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,778
You said that, that machine of yours
was made to control them.

506
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:21,374
Not control, contain.
But they obviously got the maths wrong.

507
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,712
You know, for a smart man,
you don't say much

508
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:23,843
of anything useful, do you?

509
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,151
Now, the last time you found yourself
dealing with the undead, what did you do?

510
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,784
Fuck this bullshit.
There ain't nothing but men out there.

511
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,628
Jesus, Prior, why don't you just admit it?

512
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:44,161
It's real simple.
I can't see it, I don't believe in it.

513
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,504
You don't believe in the dark?

514
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:51,842
How much you want to believe, right now?

515
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,475
You take a life, you take it for good.

516
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:59,077
There ain't nothing waiting on you.

517
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,684
Got it?

518
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,359
Okay, okay. Fuck. Okay.

519
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:31,952
Bring it on.

520
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,057
By early 1945, the party was over.

521
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,691
The war was essentially lost,

522
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,958
and the German military machine
was falling apart.

523
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,565
All the files show that the SS sent in
a unit to shut this place down.

524
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:51,572
And as far as I can see,
nobody walked out alive.

525
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,007
So does your instruction manual say
what the fuck these things want?

526
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,635
Want? They don't want anything.

527
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,909
They just do what they were trained to do.
They kill.

528
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:03,784
Those bodies we found...

529
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,286
Those were their bodies?

530
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,414
That might explain
why they stayed with the machine.

531
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,324
Any consciousness that remains
might believe that their only chance

532
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:14,158
- to live again is through it.
- Guys.

533
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:15,788
Yeah, that or they're just
the last poor fuckers

534
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,355
to walk through this bone-yard.

535
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,559
Guys!

536
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,340
Motherfuck!

537
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,217
- Prior!
- Where the hell is he...

538
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:51,728
- Well, that worked.
- So we can kill them, right?

539
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:55,567
His brains are all over the wall.
That's good enough for me.

540
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,401
Oh, you're humming my balls!

541
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,441
Oh, shit!

542
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,509
- What was that?
- Jesus.

543
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,845
- Fuck!
- Mac?

544
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:16,816
Mac!

545
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,341
Oh, Christ.

546
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,437
You fucks!

547
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,448
You fucking animals.

548
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:42,211
Fuck you all!

549
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,854
Why us, huh?

550
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,151
- Why us?
- Why not?

551
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:56,430
Always the same answer, isn't it?

552
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,861
Take a look, all of you.

553
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:05,270
You're no different to them out there.

554
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:08,936
Men who once had a purpose,
and now have nothing but death.

555
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:12,003
- Except we're not dead.
- Give it up.

556
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:15,209
They're gonna tear us to pieces here.
All of us.

557
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,342
They can try.

558
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:31,355
When it's operating fully,
it emits a high-pitch frequency

559
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:35,563
that within a certain radius might act
as a counterbalance, neutralizing...

560
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:38,266
Blah-fucking-blah.
Can we use it to stop these things?

561
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,934
Do you mind? Those of us with brain cells
are trying to think.

562
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,444
- I'll do you...
- Listen to the man.

563
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,146
If it was designed to contain them,
then, theoretically, if I can get it going,

564
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,278
and you can get them in close,
we could trap them,

565
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,289
and leave ourselves an exit
out of this mess, maybe.

566
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,587
- How close?
- I'd say 20, 30 meters.

567
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:00,823
- Is he having a fucking laugh?
- You have a better idea?

568
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,524
But I don't know if I've got enough power.

569
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:08,161
Maybe if I can hard-wire the current
from that generator...

570
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:11,764
But we're gonna need some time
to get the sort of levels we're gonna need.

571
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,365
Also, the machine was designed
to be operated by three men.

572
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:17,901
- I'm gonna have to work it on my own.
- I'll buy you time.

573
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,279
And how exactly
are we supposed to get them in here?

574
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,251
They want soldiers,

575
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,749
let's give them soldiers.

576
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:35,788
<i>We've got to lure them in.</i>

577
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:40,301
<i>So, we use ourselves as bait, and then run
a controlled retreat and bring them with us.</i>

578
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,395
I want fall-back positions every 50 feet.

579
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,707
We need wire out there, funnel them in.

580
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:51,610
<i>Double up on the anti-personnel mines
all along the tree line.</i>

581
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,651
When they come, we need to draw them in,
close as possible.

582
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,154
Then, fall back in stages on me.

583
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:06,755
We need to shore up all the corridors.
Take them only where we want them to go.

584
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:10,263
<i>Hold your positions for as long as possible.
Keep them interested.</i>

585
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,823
<i>But don't overextend your positions
and get yourselves caught.</i>

586
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,335
<i>I want your eyes open,
your movements clean</i>

587
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:16,803
<i>and your fire accurate.</i>

588
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:20,933
Now, we're not gonna get them to that cell,
so, take them to the engine.

589
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,137
- The closer, the better.
- What if Hunt can't get it done?

590
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,670
<i>What if they spring out
of thin air right behind us?</i>

591
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:29,411
<i>Then we're fucked.
Use what you can, whatever way you can.</i>

592
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:34,613
<i>Keep your focus. Balance is everything.</i>

593
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:38,592
<i>Don't fall back too late,
don't fall back too soon.</i>

594
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:42,290
- We need to draw them in.
- But they're fucking unstoppable.

595
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,059
Right.

596
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,794
So were we, once.

597
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:09,215
Never did care much for the great outdoors.

598
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,815
Yeah.

599
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,954
Ain't like we were gonna do good things
for the rest of our lives.

600
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:18,825
Fuck, we killed most everybody else.

601
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:22,894
I figure it's about time we touched gloves
with some Nazis, huh?

602
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,495
You know the one thing
they don't teach you in basic?

603
01:12:56,572 --> 01:13:01,032
No matter how bad things get,
there's always time

604
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,372
for another joint.

605
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:19,525
So, what do you do
when you're not being a soldier of fortune?

606
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,325
Drink.

607
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,835
You know, in every culture,

608
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:41,009
they believe all the souls
of the men you killed

609
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:44,184
haunt you for eternity.

610
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,850
Guess that's us fucked, eh?

611
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:59,428
Okay. I think she's ready.

612
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:02,436
I really don't know how long it'll take
to generate enough power.

613
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:06,406
Well, keep the door locked until I come back
and knock it down.

614
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,905
You do know how to use this?

615
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:07,463
Hail Mary, full of Grace...

616
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:32,220
Weapons free. Fall back on my command.

617
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,392
Hold your fire.

618
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,426
Hold.

619
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,763
Easy. Hold.

620
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,962
Hold.

621
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,667
Firing!

622
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:31,216
Fall back!

623
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:36,851
Moving!

624
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,335
They're coming!

625
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,876
Contact!

626
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,879
- Sarge!
- Jordan!

627
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,183
Moving!

628
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,422
Top, set.

629
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,521
Moving!

630
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:16,257
- Bring it on!
- Prior, set.

631
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,327
Moving!

632
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:26,598
Holding. Holding. Holding.

633
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,576
- Fall back!
- Moving!

634
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,878
Set!

635
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:44,589
Prior. Prior!

636
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,135
Fall back!

637
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,633
Move!

638
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,110
Move it, move it!

639
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,481
- Hunt, come on!
- Hunt?

640
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,480
Hunt?

641
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,425
Move! Set?

642
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:55,292
Last stop! Do it now, for fuck's sake!

643
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,061
Right!

644
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,778
Come on!

645
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:41,369
We fucking did it!

646
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:43,736
Hunt?

647
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:52,115
It's time to leave, Mr. Hunt.

648
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,620
Smart moves.

649
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,103
No.

650
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,734
Shift it!

651
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:44,067
- Moving!
- Shit!

652
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,034
Sarge.

653
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,633
It's not gonna work.

654
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,042
We're gonna have to find another way out.

655
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:25,272
Where?

656
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:33,314
There.

657
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,753
Get me up.

658
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,405
Well, go on, then.

659
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:30,391
Clear.

660
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,305
Fuck.

661
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,051
Check this out.

662
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,143
I think I might have got one breathing here!

663
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,956
<i>- Unit two reporting one survivor.
- Copy that.</i>

664
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:04,327
What the fuck is that?
