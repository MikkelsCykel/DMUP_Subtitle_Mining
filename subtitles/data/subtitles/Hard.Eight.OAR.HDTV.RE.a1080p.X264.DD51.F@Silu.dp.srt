1
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

2
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,900
You want a cup of coffee?

3
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,000
You want a cigarette?

4
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,500
What?

5
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm a guy that's offering
to give you a cigarette...

6
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,100
buy you a cup of coffee.

7
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,900
What's your name?

8
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,900
John.

9
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,300
Sydney.

10
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,800
You wanna see the menus?

11
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,600
No, I don't think so.

12
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,400
Come from Vegas? Reno?

13
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,300
From Vegas.

14
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,100
You lost some money?

15
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,200
You won some money.

16
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,900
I broke even.

17
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
What were you playing?

18
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,100
Blackjack.

19
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,200
You know how to count cards?

20
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,400
What?

21
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,300
You said you were playing blackjack.
Do you know how to count cards?

22
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
In my experience,
if you don't know how to count cards...

23
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
you oughta stay away
from blackjack.

24
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,400
Thanks for the tip, Mr. Helpful.

25
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,900
Hey, John.
- What?

26
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,700
John, we're sitting here. I bought you
a cup of coffee, gave you a cigarette.

27
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Look at me.

28
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,800
You wanna be a wise-ass,
go outside and take a seat.

29
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,500
If you wanna talk to me...

30
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
well, then...

31
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,600
Never ignore a man's courtesy.

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,900
Let's talk about Vegas.

33
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,400
Let's talk about
what happened to you.

34
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,900
Because something did happen.

35
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,500
Maybe I can help.

36
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,200
You wanna help me?

37
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,700
You look like you could use a friend.
- You wanna be my friend?

38
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,900
Then give me $6,000.

39
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,200
Do you have that?
Can you give a total stranger $6,000?

40
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Because that's my trouble.
Okay?

41
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,800
What do you need $6,000 for?

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,500
- I need it.
For what?

43
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,700
To bury my mother.

44
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,500
- You went to Vegas to win some money
- No, I went to lose some money.

45
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,700
You went to win some money
to bury your mother?

46
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,500
To pay for her funeral?

47
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,400
That is very admirable.

48
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,100
I admire the intention.

49
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't say it's wise, though.

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,900
Do you have $6,000
to give me?

51
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,800
No. I can't.

52
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,200
I didn't think so.

53
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,500
Isn't there someone who could

54
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,100
Family?

55
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
There's no one else.
It's me.

56
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,100
I'm alone.
That's it, okay?

57
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,400
There you go.

58
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,600
That gonna be it?

59
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, I think so.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
Thank you.

61
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
How much money
do you have left?

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,100
Nothing.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,900
If I were to give you $50,
what would you do with it?

64
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,900
I'd eat.

65
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
How long can you eat
How long can you live on $50?

66
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,200
I don't know.

67
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,900
I would bet...

68
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,100
not very long.

69
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,500
You would bet?

70
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,800
I tell you what.

71
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,900
You come with me back to Vegas.

72
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,300
I'll loan you $50
and show you what you did wrong.

73
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Why?
What are you, man?

74
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,700
You think you're St. Francis
or something?

75
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,200
No, I don't think
I'm St. Francis.

76
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,900
Are you looking for a fag?

77
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm not some boy hooker,
if that's what you're after.

78
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,300
I'm not looking
for a hooker, John.

79
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm offering you a ride.

80
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,500
I'm offering to teach you
something.

81
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,200
Well, I'm telling you something
right now... I don't suck dick.

82
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,200
I understand that,
and this is the last time I'll ask.

83
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
You want my help?

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll fuck you up
if you fuck with me.

85
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,500
I know three types of karate...

86
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,800
jujitsu, aikido and regular karate.

87
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,900
Okay.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,400
All right.

89
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,500
A You give me a ride.

90
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,200
Two... You give me 50 bucks.

91
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
C I sit in the back.

92
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,600
Believe me, if you pull anything
I will fuck you up.

93
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,000
I believe you.

94
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
This is a nice ride, actually.

95
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Comfortable.

96
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,000
Can you pull over
for a second?

97
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,300
Can I get a cigarette?

98
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
Thanks.

99
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,000
The lighter doesn't work.

100
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Here.

101
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,700
No, thanks.

102
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,200
The lighter doesn't work.

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I heard you.

104
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,200
I just don't use matches.

105
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,600
Wanna hold the wheel a minute
so I can light mine?

106
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
Thanks.

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,500
You gonna smoke that?

108
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,300
Why don't you use these matches?
- It's just a rule with me.

109
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,100
I don't use matches.

110
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
Why not?

111
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,300
I had a really bad experience once
and I promised I'd never use 'em again.

112
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Tell me.

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,300
You know those big monster
books of matches?

114
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,100
Those big daddy ones
with, like, 40 matches in 'em?

115
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,900
I had one of those in my pocket once
and they lit on fire, exploded.

116
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
Huh.
Matches just went off?

117
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,500
Yeah, it had something to do
with spontaneous friction, I guess.

118
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,200
They just went off.

119
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,200
I'm standing in line for a movie
and all of the sudden

120
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,600
Like that!
Scared the shit out of me.

121
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,900
I had a third-degree burn on my leg
this close to my dick.

122
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,000
That was a brandnew
pair of jeans too.

123
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,900
I thought about suing
that matchbook company too.

124
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,100
What are you gonna do,
you know?

125
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
Things happen.
This happens, that happens.

126
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,500
Shit just happens.
You deal with it.

127
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,800
John, I'm gonna loan you 50 bucks...

128
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,200
so why don't you tell me
what you're gonna do with it.

129
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,800
You asked me before...

130
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,400
You could take it
and play it a certain way...

131
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,300
long enough and hard enough
to get a bed and a meal.

132
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
You're not gonna win $6,000,
though.

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,100
I can assure you of that.

134
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, if you show me
how to do that

135
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,300
how to get a meal and a bed-
then I'll do that.

136
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,100
If you wanna show me.

137
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,000
First thing, go in the bathroom
and clean yourself up.

138
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
The attendant has a razor you can use.
Yeah, but I'm growing a beard.

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,900
Once you're done,
find me in the bar.

140
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,500
- How's that?
- Much cleaner.

141
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
Okay?

142
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,700
Much better.

143
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,300
So, what now?

144
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I lied when I said 50.
You're gonna need 150.

145
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,900
- I knew it.
Just relax, John.

146
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,500
Listen.
Are you listening?

147
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,900
Go over to that woman
in the cashier's cage...

148
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,300
and ask her
for the floor man.

149
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,200
She'll point to a guy in a tuxedo
the floor man.

150
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
You find this guy and say...

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,200
John Finnegan.

152
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,500
So, anyway,
I just flew into town and...

153
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I'm gonna be playing
in this casino.

154
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
I like this place.

155
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm gonna be spending
some money.

156
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,100
I hope I win some money
and...

157
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,300
I just need someone to keep track
of what I'm spending...

158
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,200
'cause I'm an impulsive gambler.

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,100
Can I get a rate card?

160
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,900
I got it.
He gave it to me.

161
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,100
Good.

162
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,700
Take this $150
to that cashier...

163
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,700
and cash it in
for dollar tokens.

164
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,400
He'll note on the rate card...

165
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,300
the amount you've cashed
and the time of day.

166
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,200
I'd like 150 in dollar tokens.

167
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Here's my rate card.

168
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,500
- There we are. Good luck.
- Thanks a lot.

169
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Now find a slot machine.

170
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,000
Find one that's off to the side a bit
but don't go unseen by the floor man.

171
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,400
Sit at that machine
and play $20.

172
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Only 20, so make it last.

173
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Play slowly,
one dollar at a time.

174
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,900
- Did you order a drink?
- Huh?

175
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Did you order a drink?

176
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,700
Oh, yeah. They're free.

177
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,600
It'll turn out to be
a $150 cocktail.

178
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
Don't drink.

179
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,900
Okay. Sorry.
It's all right.

180
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,700
- Did you finish that 20?
Almost.

181
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,600
Get your stuff.
Come with me.

182
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
Give the cashier $100 in tokens.

183
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,900
She'II give you cash.
Get a bill.

184
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,200
I'd like to cash these in, please.

185
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,400
Would you like a bill
or some 20s?

186
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,100
A bill.
- All right.

187
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,100
- There you are.
- Thank you.

188
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Now give this cashier
the bill and the rate card.

189
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Ask for more tokens.

190
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
I'd like another $100 in tokens.
There's my rate card.

191
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,100
There's a hundred. Good luck.
- Thank you.

192
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,700
So, how much do you have
on your rate card now?

193
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,800
Well, I cashed 150 first,
and then another 100.

194
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,400
So, 250.

195
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,800
And you have only spent $20.

196
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,300
Just keep circling the bill,
John.

197
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Cash to tokens,
tokens to cash.

198
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Now, slowly spend
what's left of the 50.

199
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,100
That's just for show
when the floor man comes around.

200
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,400
Do it for an hour.
Take a break.

201
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Do it again for an hour,
and so on.

202
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
- See you around.
Where?

203
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,600
I'll find you.

204
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,200
Look.
I started with half that.

205
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,900
We're not as lucky.
We're losing big time.

206
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
You are? Huh.

207
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,700
I haven't been playing that one.
Put a lot in here, though.

208
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,400
I'd like to cash these in again
for a bill.

209
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,700
Good luck.

210
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Oh, well.

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,500
I need a bucket!

212
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,500
I need a bucket!

213
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Guess who.

214
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Pretty big investment here.

215
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,400
I need another 300
in tokens, please.

216
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,700
Good luck.

217
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,600
Yeah, I'll need it.

218
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Thanks a lot.

219
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Hey, Sydney.
John.

220
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,000
I kept doing that until I racked up
two grand on the rate card.

221
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
It worked.
They gave me a room.

222
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,400
The guy comes up and says...

223
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,700
"Can I get you anything?
Do you want a room, show tickets?"

224
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,500
I got two tickets to a show.
I got you one.

225
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,600
Plus that machine I was playing,
I accidentally hit it for 200 bucks.

226
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,000
- It works.
Fucking-A, it does.

227
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,800
- This is what you do?
- Not anymore.

228
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Shit, Sydney, this is great.
I mean, really.

229
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,300
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

230
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,200
You're welcome.

231
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,400
Oh, I got that 150
that you gave me.

232
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
- All right?
Good.

233
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
You wanna hang out?
I got payperview movies.

234
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,500
- I got a minibar.
No, thanks, John.

235
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,700
So, John,
what are you gonna do?

236
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
I don't know. I was...

237
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,100
I don't know.

238
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,500
Well, you can't keep doing
the same thing all week.

239
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,100
Yeah. I didn't think so.

240
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
Sydney, I was gonna ask you

241
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200
I was wondering...

242
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I know you showed me
all this stuff.

243
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
You taught me.

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
But I still have to-

245
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,300
You can't win $6,000, John.

246
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,500
I told you that before.

247
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,800
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

248
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,500
I have a friend in Los Angeles.

249
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
Someone...

250
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
maybe someone who can help.

251
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,100
I can make a call for you,
tell him you're a friend...

252
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
and we can work this thing out.

253
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,200
If you need help paying for
your mother's funeral...

254
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,400
we can work it out.

255
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,500
I want you to see...

256
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,700
that my reasons for doing this
are not selfish, only this...

257
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,900
I'd hope that you would
do the same for me.

258
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
I would.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,100
Thank you.

260
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,300
It's always good
to meet a new friend.

261
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,200
I'll see you later.

262
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,100
Are you gonna gamble?

263
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Yeah.

264
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,000
Can I come down with you?
If that's what you want.

265
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,600
Just to watch.

266
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,200
Cupid has found its way.
Good to see you.

267
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,100
If there's anything you want,
please don't call me.

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,900
Keno?
- How are you?

269
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,200
Keno?
- Things are going well?

270
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
- Keno?
Yeah.

271
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Play two dollars, please.

272
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,900
Hello, Captain.
Hello again.

273
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,300
Do you remember my name?

274
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Clementine.
That's right.

275
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,900
Just like the movie.
Exactly.

276
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,800
- Do you remember my name?
Sydney.

277
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
Then why do you call me "Captain"?

278
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,200
Because you seem like
the captain of a ship to me.

279
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,000
I see the way John follows you
and worships you...

280
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,600
like you're his captain.

281
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,400
John is a very old friend.

282
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,700
Good luck, sir.

283
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

284
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Well, you're
a good tipper, Captain.

285
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,500
Tell me something.

286
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,200
Are you required to flirt...

287
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,400
to behave as you do
toward those men over there...

288
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,300
as some part of your job?

289
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,400
They don't say to do it.

290
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,300
But if you don't?

291
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,100
Well, then I get questioned.

292
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,000
Like, "Why were you so rude
to them?"

293
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And
I mean, I can't talk back.

294
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,800
I can't tell 'em
to fuck off and leave me alone.

295
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
As a rule.

296
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
I'd also lose the tip.

297
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,200
Sounds like
an occupational hazard.

298
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,000
You don't have to do that
with me.

299
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Jimmy paid for your drink.

300
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,800
Thank you.

301
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,200
Thank you, Captain.

302
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,000
Hey, thanks.
- You want another?

303
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
Yeah.

304
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Whatever Syd's having.
- Hi.

305
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,000
Hello.

306
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,300
Syd, you remember Jimmy.
He's a friend who lives up here.

307
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,700
Thanks for the drink.
My pleasure.

308
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,800
Have a seat.

309
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Jimmy works at the Sand Dunes.

310
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,700
Oh, yeah. I remember.

311
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,000
What do you do?

312
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,500
I do some consulting over there.
Security on busy nights.

313
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,300
Parking lot?

314
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,800
No, I work inside the casino.

315
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,500
He saw you play in Vegas
a few years back. Tell him.

316
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,300
Yeah, yeah.
See, I used to live there.

317
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,300
I saw you playing craps
over at the original Dunes.

318
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,100
You bet the hard eight for a thousand
and pressed it for two.

319
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,900
- Did I hit it?
No, you didn't.

320
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,300
But it was a big balls bet,
and I remembered your face.

321
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,600
Stupid bet.

322
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,500
You were with that old dude
with the voice thing.

323
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,000
He talked like that.
What's his name?

324
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,300
Excuse me.

325
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,100
Say, partner, let me get
one of them cigarettes.

326
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,500
Damn.
You ain't got no menthol?

327
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
No, man, I don't do menthol.

328
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,100
Shit.

329
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,000
Let me get a light too.

330
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,700
So you gave up big balls bets
on the hard way...

331
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,100
to play keno, huh?

332
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,200
What's that,
a sign of aging?

333
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,200
It passes the time.

334
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,400
Syd and I saw a guy win 38 grand
playing keno once.

335
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,700
Played all day, sat in the same spot
something like 12 hours.

336
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,100
Must've cost him four grand
to win the 38. Jesus.

337
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,900
The other night
over at the El Dorado...

338
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
I saw a cat have a heart attack
right at the craps table.

339
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,400
He's in the middle of a hot shoot
and starts getting all sweaty and shit.

340
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,700
Next thing you know, bam!
Old motherfucker just keels over.

341
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,600
The joke of it is,
the game just keeps going on.

342
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,100
People are yelling, "Place the eight!
Somebody call an ambulance!

343
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Place the nine! Place the six!
Somebody dial 911!"

344
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,100
Meanwhile this old bastard's laying on
the floor, tongue out, turning purple.

345
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,700
And the people are still playing.

346
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
Keno.

347
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,500
Keno.
Any winners?

348
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,400
Uh, no, not here.

349
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,900
But... let's try it again.

350
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,400
Jesus, we are fucking surrounded
by pussy here.

351
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,000
Hey, hey. Jimmy.

352
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,800
What?

353
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,800
Not for my ears, but hers.

354
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,900
She can hear that sort of thing
across the lounge.

355
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,300
Puts her in a very
uncomfortable position.

356
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,200
I doubt if hearing
she's got a great pussy...

357
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
puts her
in an uncomfortable position.

358
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,700
I just don't want it
coming from my table.

359
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You may not know this...

360
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,600
but half the women that work here
are takehome whores anyway.

361
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,600
They get off on that shit.

362
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,000
I got a friend, works over
at the Sand Dunes where I work.

363
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,500
This man's in charge of corralling
waitresses for that sort of thing.

364
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
He's in charge.

365
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,400
He is the pussy patrol.

366
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,200
Jimmy
What?

367
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,500
Just, you know

368
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,700
Hey, I live up here.
I know what flies and what don't.

369
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,000
To tell a babe she's got a nice ass
is no crime, believe me.

370
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,100
You said it as she walked away.

371
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,600
Let's go play.

372
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,900
We're waiting on our drinks here.

373
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,500
We'll get 'em at the tables.

374
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
You got a point.

375
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,300
Sydney.

376
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,400
It was a pleasure
seeing you again.

377
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,500
John here's got my digits.

378
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,900
Anything you need in this town,
you call me.

379
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,800
Syd, I'll see you later.

380
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
I'll be here.

381
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,400
How are you, Mike?
Good, Sydney. How are you?

382
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,200
What are you doing out here?

383
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,000
Fresh air.

384
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,500
I was...
I was just visiting my friend.

385
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,900
But we're not supposed to be
in the rooms, you know, so...

386
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,400
I could lose my job.

387
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,000
But you'll be fired...

388
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,300
if you tell them
to leave you alone?

389
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
This is something
I mean, if the hotel knew...

390
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Do you live alone?

391
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Yeah. I do now.

392
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,400
I had this girlfriend,
this roommate...

393
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,300
but it's a big nightmare story.

394
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,500
Do you go to school?

395
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,100
No.

396
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,600
- Do I look like I go to school?
- Oh, I don't know. Maybe.

397
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm not with all that.

398
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,100
What are you saving up for?

399
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,400
The money that you make.
Are you saving?

400
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,800
No. I mean,
I have to make money, you know.

401
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,700
I have bills.
I have an apartment.

402
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,900
I have a car a Camaro.
That costs money, you know.

403
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,000
If I don't pay my bills every month,
my credit gets fucked up.

404
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,500
I can't have fucked-up credit
because then I'm fucked.

405
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,700
You think I'm a piece of shit now
because you saw me leaving that room.

406
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,600
No, I don't.

407
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,000
Just a good girl, you know,
trying to save up...

408
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,500
open a beauty salon.

409
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,400
Maybe that, yes.

410
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,300
I don't know.

411
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,100
I don't wanna open
a fucking beauty salon.

412
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,900
It's just that it's so much different
than what you think.

413
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,700
Explain it to me then.

414
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,300
I don't... I don't do anything
that I don't want to do.

415
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,800
You understand?

416
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
Are you...

417
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,700
Are you gonna tell John
that you saw me?

418
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,100
No. I'm not.

419
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,100
So...

420
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,500
I wanna know...

421
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,600
how you know him.

422
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,200
So you took care of him?

423
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,400
Sort of.

424
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,400
And you paid for her funeral?

425
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,600
We worked it out.

426
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,900
He's pretty adorable...

427
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,100
the way he follows you around
and looks up to you.

428
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
He orders the same drinks as you.
He dresses the same.

429
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
We share the same tastes,
I guess.

430
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Do you have real kids?
Kids of your own?

431
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,900
Yes.
You married?

432
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,800
A boy and a girl.
No, I'm divorced.

433
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,000
I have a boy about your age,
daughter a few years older.

434
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,700
Where do they live?

435
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm not sure.
I haven't spoken to them in a while.

436
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,400
That's too bad.

437
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,200
Yeah.

438
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,100
Maybe you'll see them.

439
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,500
Maybe.

440
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Fuck this.
I'm outta here.

441
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm going to...

442
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,000
I'll get a robe
and some shorts or something.

443
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,300
Here's a robe
and some stuff for you.

444
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Captain?

445
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
Yeah?

446
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,300
Do you wanna fuck me?

447
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,700
Do you think that?

448
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,900
Well, you brought me here.

449
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,800
Do you think that?

450
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,200
I don't know.

451
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,800
You should know before you ask
a question like that.

452
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,600
Well, you're being nice to me...

453
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,200
So you'd think I'd want that?
- If you wanted to fuck me-

454
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,800
Stop saying that.

455
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,800
- It just seemed like...
- Well, don't let it seem that way.

456
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,500
This is a comfortable bed
for you.

457
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,400
I want you to sleep on it...

458
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,000
to give you something to...

459
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,500
a place to have a nice shower
and a bed.

460
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,500
Don't get angry.

461
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,400
No, I'm not...

462
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
because I understand...

463
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,900
how you could ask
a question like that.

464
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,900
Now you really look at me
as a piece of shit.

465
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,300
No.

466
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,600
All right.

467
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,900
John won't be back
until very late.

468
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
He won't disturb you.

469
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,700
This is John's room?

470
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
Not tonight.

471
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,400
Boom! It exploded
right in my pants.

472
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,300
Totally burned a hole...
- The matches went off?

473
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,200
I could've caught on fire.

474
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,300
Hey, Captain.

475
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,900
Morning, Captain.

476
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,000
Good morning.

477
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,400
"Captain." That is a nickname
Clementine has given me.

478
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,000
It is not for you.
Okay.

479
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,900
What are you gonna do today?

480
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,300
Oh, I don't know.

481
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,600
But if you wanna do something,
go someplace or buy something...

482
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,000
John will take you.

483
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,600
Yeah. You need something?

484
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,800
Just to go home
and get some clothes.

485
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,300
So, go to the mall...

486
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,100
buy something nice.

487
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,200
Here.

488
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,200
I got it, Syd. I got money.
Oh. Okay.

489
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,100
You wanna go get something?

490
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,400
Yeah.
I mean... Yeah.

491
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
And that is that.

492
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,000
- See you later.
- Bye.

493
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,900
Bye.

494
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,400
Well?

495
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,200
Why do you have two TVs?

496
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,200
See, they got pay-per-view here...
That's this box.

497
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,000
There's a wire that comes up
from the front desk...

498
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,500
that goes through this box.

499
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,700
Then when you pick a pay movie
it tells the front desk.

500
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,600
So you have to get
these little things off.

501
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:06,200
You stick a key inside
this little cuff, twist it around...

502
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and take the wire
that brings the movie...

503
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,100
and you put it
straight into the TV.

504
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,800
You gotta use a regular TV,
so I bring this one wherever we go.

505
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,900
I take the cable that comes
from the wall straight into this TV.

506
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,800
Then you get free movies.

507
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,200
Cool.

508
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,700
Don't say anything...

509
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,800
to the front desk or anything.

510
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,900
No, I won't.

511
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,900
'Cause they'd probably make me
pay for all of 'em.

512
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,500
I gotta go talk to Syd
for a second.

513
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,600
I'll be right back.

514
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,100
Okay.

515
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,500
- How'd you do last night?
- Fair.

516
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,900
You?

517
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,600
I won about 300.

518
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,200
You didn't show up in the bar.

519
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,900
I'm sorry about that, Syd.

520
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,600
I was with Jimmy.

521
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,500
You know?
Yeah.

522
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,400
I'm sorry about last night.
He gets- The second drink...

523
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,100
It's not a problem.

524
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,600
He just gets a little flagrant.

525
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,000
It's fine.

526
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,600
He thinks
you don't like him.

527
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,100
I don't.

528
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Well

529
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,000
What?

530
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,700
I don't know.

531
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,100
You be good to Clementine today.
Take her anywhere she wants to go.

532
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,800
Did you...

533
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,200
What?

534
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,800
You know, did you...

535
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,800
No.

536
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,500
Okay.

537
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,900
Good.

538
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,900
I'll see you later.

539
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,300
I'll probably be in the sports book,
or maybe poker.

540
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,800
- Maybe I'll see you there.
Okay.

541
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
Bye.

542
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,600
Excuse me.

543
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,000
- Can I get you anything else?
No, that's fine. Thanks.

544
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,200
Seven, the winner.
Pay him on the pass line.

545
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,900
Coming out again.
Bet 11 after 7.

546
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,700
Come on, old-timer.
You gonna join us, my friend?

547
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,000
Come on!

548
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,800
I don't wait for old people

549
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,200
Here we go.
Let's see another seven.

550
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,900
Eight, easy.

551
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,000
Bet it back hard.

552
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,900
Okay, I'm gonna light
a cigarette now, oldtimer.

553
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,700
See, I like you, so I'm gonna
let you have this time...

554
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,600
to place your bet before I finish
lighting this cigarette.

555
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,400
Then I'm just gonna roll,
and fuck you.

556
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,200
You're laughing? I just said
"fuck you" to the man. Jesus Christ!

557
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,100
The way you look,
I think you know what I'm saying.

558
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,900
Jesus Christ, why don't you
have some fun? Fun!

559
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,700
All right.

560
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,500
Got a little bit more.
Coming in there, baby.

561
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,300
I'm gonna light the cigarette.
What are you gonna do?

562
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,200
Two thousanddollar hard eight.

563
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,300
Two thousand-dollar hard eight's
the bet.

564
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,800
What the fuck.

565
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,600
Oh, man.
You play that game, don't you?

566
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,100
Oh, shit!

567
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,000
You're big time.

568
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,800
You are big time!

569
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,600
Oh! Hard eight.

570
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,700
Okay, here we go.

571
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,200
All right,
this is for you, Big Time.

572
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm not even looking.

573
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,500
Here we go!

574
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,600
Six the hard way.

575
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,000
That's a hard six, old-timer!

576
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,800
That's not bad for me,
is it, sister?

577
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,600
Is it, Sister Sledge?

578
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,900
Here we go.
It's me and you.

579
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,800
You know what I'm saying?

580
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,000
Fuck it. A hundred.
Hard eight.

581
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,100
Me and you, Big Time.
Me and you.

582
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,000
You can buy yourself another suit
with this roll.

583
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,400
Fortyfour.

584
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,300
Fucking 44, Big Time.

585
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,000
Two thousand.
Two thousand. Hundred.

586
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,900
- Fortyfour!
Crack.

587
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,400
Eight, easy. Five and a three.
Frontline winner. Pay him.

588
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,800
Fuck!

589
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,100
All right. Shit.

590
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,500
I'm sorry, Big Time.

591
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Hey, Big Time,
I'll buy you a drink!

592
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,700
Where?

593
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,600
Yeah. Yes.

594
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,300
Right now?

595
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,500
You okay?

596
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,000
Yeah, I'll get up right now.

597
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,600
John?

598
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,900
- Syd?
Yeah. Open up.

599
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,800
Everything cool?
- What?

600
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,100
Yeah, everything's cool.

601
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Are you all right?

602
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,700
I'm fine.

603
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,900
You gonna open the door?

604
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,500
I said on the phone...

605
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,800
it's kinda screwed up.

606
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,100
Yeah. So?

607
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,100
Open the door.
Let's see what's going on.

608
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,200
You promise you'II help me?

609
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,800
John, it's cold out here.
Open the door.

610
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,500
Is everything cool?

611
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,000
John, open the goddamn door,
will ya?

612
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,800
What's going on?
- Shut the door.

613
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,100
Why are the lights out?

614
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,200
- Just leave 'em off.
I'm not gonna stand here in the dark.

615
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
You promised you'd help me.

616
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,300
What is this, John?

617
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,200
I'm sorry, Syd.

618
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,100
John, what is this?

619
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,300
Who is this man?

620
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,900
He's a-

621
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,300
He's a hostage.

622
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,900
- A hostage?
Yeah.

623
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,500
Why?

624
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,400
Because...

625
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,500
For money.

626
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,000
- Is he dead?
No.

627
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,900
He's just passed out.

628
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
How did he get here?

629
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,200
I'm sorry, Syd.

630
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,600
Fuck.

631
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,200
I'm so sorry.

632
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,300
I fucked up. I know.

633
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,700
I'm sorry.

634
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,300
Clementine.

635
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,900
She doesn't want to talk.

636
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,000
Clementine. Hey.

637
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,300
What?

638
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,600
You all right?

639
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm fine.

640
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,400
Tell me what happened.

641
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,400
This man won't pay me.

642
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,600
You know this man?

643
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,400
Not before tonight, I didn't.

644
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,800
Then how does he owe you money?

645
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,800
I met him in a bar.
We came here.

646
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,700
You came here for sex?

647
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,200
- He won't pay me what we agreed.
How did John get here?

648
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,500
You can ask me.

649
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,800
She called me.

650
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,800
I asked him to come help me.

651
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,700
This fucker hit her, Syd.

652
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,000
Clementine, let me see.
Come on.

653
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,200
You're okay.

654
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,600
How long you been here, John?

655
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,600
Since 10:00.

656
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,200
Why don't you just let him go?

657
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,900
What? We can't.

658
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,300
Tell me why, John.

659
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,300
- Because he owes her money.
- So? How much money?

660
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,700
Three hundred dollars.

661
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,300
You're holding him hostage for $300?
- That's what he owes her.

662
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,200
This fuckhead cheated her, Syd.

663
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,900
Who knows this man is here?

664
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,900
Well, me and Clementine.

665
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,200
And you.

666
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Yeah? And?

667
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,600
- And his wife.
- His wife?

668
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,900
Someone's got to get the money, Syd.

669
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,200
I don't understand. How did you
get in touch with his wife?

670
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,200
He's staying at the Sand Dunes.

671
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,400
I got the name from the wallet.
Clementine saw her there before.

672
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,400
You talked to this man's wife?

673
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,400
I called her and told her to get
the money. She said she would.

674
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,900
- Did you tell her where you were?
We're not stupid.

675
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,000
No, of course. You're not stupid.

676
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,500
Are you gonna help us?

677
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,600
So? What do you want me to do?

678
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,600
I don't know.

679
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,800
First, this guy's wife has obviously
called the cops. Understand?

680
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,600
- Not necessarily.
- Yes, necessarily!

681
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,600
She wants to deal with it.

682
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,600
She's not gonna tell the cops
that her husband was...

683
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,900
fucking...

684
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,200
Fuck!

685
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,800
I mean, she might not, right?
She might not.

686
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,100
What did you tell her, John?

687
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,100
I just said that we would call her
and tell her what to do.

688
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,500
No. Did you tell her that
you'd kill him if she didn't?

689
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,700
What'd you tell her?

690
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,300
Yeah.
- "Yeah" what?

691
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,900
I told her we'd kill him.

692
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,700
This is a very...

693
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
fuckedup situation here.

694
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,200
- You promised you'd help me.
- I didn't promise you anything.

695
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,600
At the door. Come on! Syd!
You gotta help me!

696
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,400
You don't have to help us.

697
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,800
I sure as hell don't.
Then get the fuck out of here!

698
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,600
Oh, good.
- You got yourself in this situation.

699
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,500
I did not get you here.
So you humble yourself.

700
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
You humble yourself!

701
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,400
Give me the fucking gun, John!
Jesus Christ!

702
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,800
Give it to me.

703
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,100
Is it loaded?
No.

704
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,200
Where'd you get it?

705
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,600
From Jimmy.
Jimmy? Has Jimmy been here?

706
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,300
No.
What does Jimmy know about this?

707
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,900
Nothing.
- Don't say that, John.

708
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,600
I'm not.
What are you saying?

709
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,800
Nothing.

710
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,900
Clementine, get in the chair,
will you?

711
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,800
Come on, come on.

712
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,200
You are going to answer
every question I ask you to.

713
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,300
Don't look at John.

714
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,300
Look at me.

715
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,500
When you left the hotel this morning,
where did you go?

716
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,800
We went shopping at the mall.

717
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,700
After that?

718
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,900
We went to my house.
- Why?

719
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,900
Because I wanted
to get some clothes.

720
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,000
I told you to buy clothes.
I wanted to go get something!

721
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,600
All right. After that, what?

722
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
Syd, just ask me.

723
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,500
We had sex.
- Then what?

724
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,900
I know you're trying to
figure this whole thing out...

725
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,800
but what happened this morning
doesn't matter.

726
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,500
I'II judge that.

727
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,600
Fine. Then just ask me
what happened.

728
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,600
I would like to understand
how you go from being...

729
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,700
in the bar at the Sand Dunes
with that guy...

730
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,400
to being in here.

731
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Where did this thing go wrong?

732
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,900
Because he thought that he was smart
and I was stupid...

733
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,800
and I'm not stupid.

734
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,500
Well, this is a pretty stupid
situation, isn't it?

735
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,300
We'll see how fucking stupid I am
when we get my money, won't we?

736
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,100
You know the first thing they should
have taught you at hooker school?

737
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,500
You get the money up front.
- Fuck you.

738
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,100
Syd, don't talk to her like that.
I'm having a conversation.

739
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,600
Don't talk to her like that.
- Shut the fuck up.

740
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,700
I'm warning you, Syd!
Don't fucking talk to her like that!

741
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,600
She's my wife!

742
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,600
We got married this afternoon.

743
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,900
You bitch.
You're fucking dead!

744
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,300
Right?

745
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,500
I am glad to see you are having
a wonderful honeymoon.

746
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Syd, where are you going?

747
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,500
- Don't leave, please.
- I can't get involved in this.

748
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
You don't have to be involved.
Just don't leave.

749
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,400
If I stay here, I am involved.

750
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,600
If I stay here, I am part of it.
Do you get that?

751
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,500
Let's just go back inside.

752
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,500
You got a guy unconscious in there.

753
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,400
A guy that you kidnapped
and are holding for ransom.

754
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,800
Do you realize
how fucking serious this is?

755
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,000
Look, John...

756
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,700
if you want to leave here...

757
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,700
if you want me to help you get
as far away from here as possible...

758
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,900
then you just get in your car
and go.

759
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,100
Yeah? Let's do that, John.

760
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,700
Let's just get in the car and go.

761
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,700
Where am I gonna go?

762
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,700
Away. Anywhere. Away!

763
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,200
How could you let her go and do
a thing like this, John?

764
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
You've got money.
This is not good.

765
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,200
We were at the bar.
I fucking turn around.

766
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,700
She's gone. I didn't know.

767
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,800
What do you think?
I didn't know.

768
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,000
Did you really get married?
Did you?

769
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah.

770
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,900
She said "yes." I didn't want her
to say "no" later on.

771
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,800
I'd been seeing her for two months.

772
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,900
I never had the guts to say anything.

773
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,000
I saw her in my bed this morning,
it was like a sign from heaven.

774
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,200
You know?

775
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,900
I know this is fucked up.

776
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,700
I'm not stupid.
I know I fucked up, okay?

777
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,600
She's got some problems, I know,
but I really love her.

778
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,900
What am I gonna do?
I love her, Syd.

779
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,700
Okay.

780
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,600
Everything is gonna be fine.
Everything is gonna work out.

781
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,700
You'll see. Okay?

782
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,200
Come on. Let's go.

783
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,800
All right.

784
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,200
Come on. We're gonna go.
We're gonna leave.

785
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,600
Syd thinks we should leave, so...

786
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,100
get your purse, Clem,
and put your coat on.

787
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
Why is he doing that?

788
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,900
- Getting rid of your fingerprints.
This guy saw us.

789
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,300
Maybe he'll wake up
and he won't remember.

790
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,100
If he doesn't remember when he wakes up,
then why are we leaving?

791
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,600
If he does, the cops are gonna come
and they're gonna check.

792
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,300
I'm not going anywhere.

793
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,000
We don't have a choice.

794
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,700
John, I'm gonna tell you something
right now!

795
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,100
This man owes me.
He fucked me and he's gonna pay me!

796
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,200
Don't be crazy, all right?

797
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,100
Don't be crazy, honey.

798
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,100
I mean, this is the only thing
that we can do, okay?

799
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,100
The only chance we have
right now...

800
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,500
is if we leave.

801
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,800
I tell you that you can go,
but I'm not.

802
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,300
You wanna get caught?
You wanna go to jail?

803
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,400
I want my money.

804
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,700
Look at me, please.

805
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,500
Let's just listen to Sydney.

806
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,500
Syd knows. He knows.

807
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,900
I won't tell them about you... if that's
what you're thinking... if I get caught.

808
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,000
Jesus Christ, Clem.

809
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,300
That's not why.

810
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,700
What do you want me to say?
What do I have to say? I love you!

811
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,000
You want to stay here...

812
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,900
with this fucking idiot?

813
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,400
You want to be separated
from our marriage, from me?

814
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,400
I don't care.

815
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,600
Well, fuck you then!

816
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,700
You stupid fuckin' whore!

817
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,300
Fuck you, John!

818
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,700
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.

819
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,100
- Oh, God.
- Jesus Christ, John. Stop it.

820
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,700
My darling Clementine,
listen to me, will you?

821
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,300
Are you listening?

822
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,700
If you stay here,
you will be caught.

823
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,900
We're talking about kidnapping,
extortion...

824
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,200
other things-
I don't know what.

825
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,200
But not good things, honey.

826
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,800
Okay, honey?

827
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,400
Clementine, look at me, will you?
Come on. Look at me.

828
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,700
Do you love John?

829
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,800
He slapped my face.

830
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,200
Do you love him?

831
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,300
Yes.

832
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,300
You've got that.

833
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,800
You love him, and he loves you.

834
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,100
And you're not gonna spoil it
on this bullshit.

835
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,000
All right.

836
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,800
Okay. Where'd you get the handcuffs?

837
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,300
They're mine.
Give me the key.

838
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,800
What for?
I have to unlock him.

839
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,600
- Did you hit him with the gun?
- Yeah.

840
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,100
All right, let's get out of here.
Come on, Clementine.

841
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,300
Hey, don't forget your cigarettes
and your lighter.

842
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Let's go.

843
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
Who's that, John?
Who's calling?

844
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,300
I don't know.

845
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,300
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I don't know, okay?

846
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,900
- Who knows you're here?
Maybe the guy's wife.

847
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,800
I don't know, Syd.
It's the front desk.

848
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,400
Don't fuck with me.

849
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:01,100
Syd, I'm not fucking with you.
It's the front desk. I don't know.

850
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Jimmy knows we're here.

851
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,500
Jimmy knows we're here,
but it doesn't matter. Let's just go.

852
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
Let's go.

853
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,700
Right. Let's go.

854
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,900
Syd, I'm sorry about Jimmy.

855
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,100
We'll talk about it later.
Get your car, follow me to Clementine's.

856
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
She's coming with me.

857
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,200
Now tell me the man checked
into the motel, yes?

858
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,400
Yes.

859
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,600
Did anybody see you?
The man behind the counter?

860
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,600
What about the bar at the Sand Dunes?
- It was packed full of people.

861
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,500
The guy had a specific friend
maybe sitting at the bar?

862
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,300
Right over there.

863
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,100
Syd, I'm on the street.

864
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,000
You okay?

865
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,700
I'm really scared.

866
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
I know.

867
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,300
You be strong now.

868
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,800
Take good care of John.

869
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,100
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed!

870
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,100
I'm so embarrassed.
Oh, my God.

871
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,600
I feel like I might piss my pants.

872
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,700
I have two cats.

873
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,800
I remember.

874
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,100
Will you feed them while I'm gone?
- Sure.

875
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,900
Okay.

876
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,200
The yellow key is
for the top lock, okay?

877
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,100
The red one is for the bottom one,
but you can't put it all the way in...

878
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,300
or else it won't open
when you turn it, okay?

879
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,400
And just one can
and put it in the bowl.

880
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,300
And water.

881
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,100
There's something...

882
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,300
for you.

883
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,200
It's our wedding.
We had it taped. We thought

884
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,900
That's nice. Thank you.

885
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,900
I don't know.
God, I don't know why I did this.

886
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,000
I'm so stupid.

887
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,900
- It's okay.
Fuck.

888
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,200
Everything's gonna be all right.

889
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,600
I'm ready.

890
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:21,800
All right, you just got married,
you're on your honeymoon.

891
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,800
What about my job?

892
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,500
I'II talk to the casino,
tell them you've fallen in love...

893
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,400
that you've eloped and run off
but you'll come back.

894
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,100
So you call me when you get there,
and we'll see where things are.

895
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,700
- You got money?
- Yeah.

896
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:41,600
I'II get you more as you need it as
much as I have, as much as you'll need.

897
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,200
Understand?
As much money as I have.

898
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,100
All right.
Where are you gonna go?

899
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,600
- I don't know.
- Why don't you go to

900
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,600
Oh, damn. I don't know.

901
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,700
- Vegas?
Jesus Christ, don't go to Vegas!

902
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,600
Go to

903
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,300
What about Niagara Falls?
Niagara Falls. That's fine.

904
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,800
No, not Niagara Falls.

905
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,900
- Why not?
- I've been there before.

906
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,500
Jesus Christ, John!

907
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,500
Niagara Falls is like
a regular honeymoon place.

908
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,700
Yeah, but I've been there.

909
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,000
- Go to Niagara Falls.
Okay.

910
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,300
Hey, give me a hug, will ya?

911
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,700
- I'll see you soon.
Okay.

912
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,400
It's gonna be all right, John.

913
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,900
Hey, John, look at me.

914
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,400
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

915
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:45,600
John, this is fine.

916
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,800
Okay.

917
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,300
Take good care of Clementine.
I will.

918
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,500
And drive the speed limit.
Yeah.

919
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,100
You tired?

920
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Not really.

921
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,900
If you want to
get it annulled or-

922
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,000
Do you?

923
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,500
I won't fuck up again, John.

924
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,500
I really won't.
I promise you.

925
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,400
If you know of nothing legal or moral
to forbid your union in marriage...

926
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,100
and you wish to take its vows
and assume its obligations...

927
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:23,000
please face each other
and join your hands.

928
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:26,700
Will you, John, have this woman,
Clementine, to be your wedded wife...

929
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,500
and solemnly promise you will fulfill
your obligations as her husband...

930
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,600
to protect her, honor her...

931
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,300
- love her and cherish her?
- I do.

932
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:39,600
Will you, Clementine, have this man,
John, to be your wedded husband...

933
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:43,900
and promise you will be unto him
a tender, loving and true wife...

934
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:48,000
through sunshine and shadow alike
and be faithful so long as you live?

935
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,900
I do.

936
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,600
You may say your vows
with a kiss.

937
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,900
I'd like to introduce
Mr. And Mrs. John Finnegan.

938
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,900
- Okay.
Bless you.

939
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,700
Thanks very much.
Thanks a lot.

940
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Man, could you please
not smoke in here?

941
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,400
Seriously, could you please
not smoke in here?

942
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,400
Smoke smell gets in the upholstery,
fucks up the resale value like crazy.

943
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,800
What do you want from me?
- To put that cigarette out.

944
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,800
I'm not gonna put
the cigarette out.

945
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,000
All right.

946
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,500
Can I have one then?

947
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,600
So you got my note?

948
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,600
What am I saying?
You just guessed I was out here.

949
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,900
Of course you got my note.

950
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,700
What do you want?
- Nothing.

951
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,000
Do you have something
to say to me?

952
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,100
That was a really fucked-up
situation back there.

953
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,100
You took care of it.

954
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,700
So John and Clementine are safe?
Yes?

955
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,200
- You were there.
- Just for a minute.

956
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,200
Do you know that guy?
- "Guy"?

957
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:27,000
Oh, the guy that fucked Clementine.
Hell, no.

958
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,600
I saw him today, though.

959
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,200
You saw him?

960
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,100
In the casino this morning.

961
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:38,100
He was walking around
like nothing happened.

962
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Maybe he didn't call the cops.
He didn't.

963
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,800
You're so sure.
- I was here all night and all day.

964
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:49,300
If they were here, I would've seen them.
The motel's right across the street.

965
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,800
This guy's just trying to avoid
a personal embarrassment.

966
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,200
What about his wife?

967
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,600
Well, he may have
some explaining to do there.

968
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,100
So you don't think
she called the cops?

969
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,400
Look, if they'd been here,
I'd have seen them.

970
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,700
- This guy see you?
- He was knocked out when I got there.

971
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,800
You gave John a gun.
He was scared.

972
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,700
He thought he might need it.

973
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:26,500
It wasn't loaded.
I wouldn't give John a loaded weapon.

974
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,400
You still got my gun?

975
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,500
- I threw it away.
Oh, damn.

976
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,800
I loved that gun.

977
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,700
Why do you want to talk to me?

978
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,700
That's all right you threw my gun away.
I have others, you know.

979
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:46,900
I was there with John and Clementine,
and you were there too.

980
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,300
You want something now?

981
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:52,400
I didn't call you here to say
I know about this situation...

982
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,000
and I'm gonna squawk unless
I get a piece of the pie.

983
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,200
John's a friend.
Clementine, she's a doll.

984
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,400
And you, you're a classic.
You're an old-timer.

985
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,800
I got some respectability for that.

986
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,000
What is there to get anyway?

987
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yeah.

988
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Yeah.

989
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,900
So now, what then?

990
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,900
So John and Clementine
are on their way to safety...

991
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,800
in Niagara Falls.

992
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,300
So everything's all right, huh?

993
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,800
When did you talk to them?

994
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
Last night.

995
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,900
This motel thing's got nothing
to do with nothing anymore.

996
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,200
Shit. Thankfully, that's done.
That's over.

997
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,500
I didn't mention it
in my note, but...

998
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,600
you should be aware that...

999
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,200
I know some things
about Atlantic City.

1000
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,800
I'm from back East originally.
You didn't know that.

1001
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,000
I know some things
about Atlantic City.

1002
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,200
Where are you going?

1003
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,300
Hey, I said something to you.
Don't walk away from me.

1004
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,700
I heard the story about Atlantic City.
What?

1005
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,000
Tough guy, huh? You can tell me?
You can tell me what?

1006
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:48,200
I haven't told John,
but I know about Atlantic City.

1007
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,900
You shot his father in the face.

1008
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,600
Shit.

1009
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,200
Turn it off.
Don't.

1010
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,100
Turn the car off, man,
or I'll shoot you.

1011
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,800
I swear to God I will shoot you
in the foot and let it bleed.

1012
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,900
Turn it off!

1013
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,600
John doesn't know you killed
his father, but I will tell him.

1014
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,400
I will tell John. I'm threatening
you with the words, understand?

1015
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,000
Yes.
You want me to do it?

1016
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,700
- I want $10,000 to keep quiet.
I don't have it.

1017
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,300
Bullshit! Yes, you do.
I don't have it.

1018
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,100
I will go to Niagara Falls
and tell him.

1019
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,600
- Please don't!
Ten thousand dollars.

1020
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,700
- I'II get it.
- Yes, you will.

1021
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,400
- When?
- I want it now!

1022
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
- I can't now. It's impossible.
Bullshit!

1023
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,000
- Right now it just isn't possible.
- Are you telling me no?

1024
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,800
Is that what you're saying to me?

1025
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:04,200
You idiot, you don't know me.
I'll put bullets in you for it.

1026
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,400
I'll get it tomorrow.
No, you can't get it tomorrow.

1027
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,100
You have to get it now.
- Please don't point the gun.

1028
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,900
I want the money now!

1029
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,800
Jimmy, just don't point
the gun, please.

1030
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,100
Call me a tough guy?

1031
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
- Jesus Christ!
- I am a tough guy!

1032
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,100
This gun in your face
is real tough!

1033
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,900
Look. Six thousand dollars.
That's what I have.

1034
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,900
- I'll give you all that I have.
That's what you'II give me.

1035
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,800
- When?
- Don't do this to me.

1036
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,900
Where's the money?

1037
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:29,800
It's in the bank.
I have it.

1038
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,500
Come on. Sit over here.
Sit in this glass. It's yours.

1039
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,300
Sit on the sofa.

1040
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,000
You got a cigarette?

1041
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,300
You want some coffee?

1042
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,000
Anything?

1043
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,700
We're gonna be here 'til John calls
or the bank opens in the morning.

1044
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,600
You understand?
Mm-hmm.

1045
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,200
Now, you got to understand
that...

1046
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,400
this is not easy for me.

1047
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,800
John's a friend.

1048
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,300
You're his friend.

1049
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:20,300
What I mean
What I believe...

1050
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,400
is that you killed his father...

1051
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,700
like the stories I heard go.

1052
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,100
Now, if somebody
killed my father...

1053
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,500
I would feel the need
to do something.

1054
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,500
The stories I heard...
you know, stories get around-

1055
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,200
is that you used to be a hardass.

1056
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,300
You were a hard-ass
and you took his dad out, Sydney.

1057
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,400
So you think what?

1058
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,800
You can just walk
through this life...

1059
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:55,200
without being punished for it?

1060
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,800
Shit, man.

1061
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,100
I know all those guys you know.

1062
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,400
Floyd Gondoli, Jimmy Gator,
Mumbles O'Malley.

1063
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,900
They like to sit around in Clifton's
and talk, talk, talk.

1064
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,200
They love to tell stories.

1065
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,400
You can sit there and look at me
sideways all you want.

1066
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,500
You probably think I'm some kind
of asshole or something...

1067
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,500
but I'm not a killer...

1068
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
like you.

1069
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
You walk around like you're
Mr. Cool, Mr. Wisdom...

1070
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,700
but you're not.

1071
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,200
You're just some old hood.

1072
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,700
The other night in the bar,
you asking me a question...

1073
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,500
like do I do parking lot security?

1074
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,500
Well, the answer is no!

1075
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,800
I'm trusted security
inside the casino.

1076
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:50,800
I'm trusted with security,
and I don't fuck it up.

1077
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,700
Good that you have such a sturdy
sense of responsibility.

1078
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,400
Don't! Don't!

1079
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,100
Don't fuckin' do that!
You understand?

1080
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,500
I can see right through that shit!

1081
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,000
You look at me as some idiot, huh?

1082
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,100
I know you do.

1083
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,800
I know you.

1084
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,200
You old guys, you old hoods...

1085
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:19,300
you think you're
so fuckin' above it...

1086
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,300
so high and mighty.

1087
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,000
What am I to you?

1088
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,900
Some loser?

1089
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,600
Not with a gun in my hand.

1090
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,300
Not with the facts I know.

1091
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,100
Bottom line, Sydney.

1092
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,800
No matter how hard you try...

1093
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,400
you're not his father.

1094
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,100
I have the money here.

1095
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,900
I have the $6,000 here.

1096
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,600
Not in the bank. I have it here.

1097
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,300
I knew that. I knew you did.

1098
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,500
I have the money to give you
right now, in this moment.

1099
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,400
I will give you all that I have.

1100
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,700
Maybe before you were gonna kill me.
Maybe. I don't know.

1101
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,600
I know John...

1102
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,000
and I love him
like he was my own child.

1103
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,500
But I can tell you this
I don't want to die.

1104
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,800
I killed his father.

1105
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:34,400
I can tell you what it was.
This is not an excuse.

1106
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,000
I'm not begging for clemency.

1107
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,500
All that matters

1108
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,000
I do not wish to sacrifice my life
for John's well-being.

1109
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
But I will sacrifice this money
for mine.

1110
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,500
Because you have asked me.

1111
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,100
Because after this,
I will have done all I can...

1112
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,500
for John and for myself.

1113
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:57,500
I'm gonna ask you with all the heart
and sincerity that I have.

1114
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,600
Please do not put a bullet in me...

1115
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,000
and please don't tell John
what I've done.

1116
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,500
I trust that once
I give you this money...

1117
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,600
you and I will take
separate paths...

1118
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,700
and that this negotiation
will settle everything.

1119
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,200
That is my hope.

1120
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,500
I don't want to die.

1121
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,700
No, man. Not here.

1122
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,700
Hello.

1123
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,800
You there? It's John.

1124
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
Wait. Hold... Shit.

1125
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,000
Hold on.

1126
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,400
Hello? How's that?

1127
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,700
We're in Rock Island, IIlinois.

1128
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,800
We should be there tomorrow
morning, afternoon sometime.

1129
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,200
How's everything back there?

1130
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,300
Yeah? There's no problems,
nothing?

Everything's fine.

How's Clementine?

1134
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,100
She's good.

1135
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,100
She's good.
She sends her love.

1136
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,200
Yeah, I will.

1137
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,900
I really love her, Syd.

1138
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,900
I mean, I know the whole thing
and everything...

1139
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:28,500
but I really do.

1140
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,700
I know.

1141
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,600
I'll be here for a while.

1142
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,500
All right.

1143
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,900
This phone's gonna run out
of change any second...

1144
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:48,700
so I'm just gonna say
so long now.

1145
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,300
I'll call you when we get there.

1146
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,200
You know?

1147
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,700
Thanks for everything, Syd.

1148
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,200
There's something
I need to tell you.

1149
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:08,600
It's something you need to know.
It's important.

1150
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,100
I need to tell you.

1151
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,500
I love you, John.
I love you like you were my own son.

Thank you, Syd.

Jump on this horse.
This horse is going to ride away.

Is everybody ready?
Got your money down?

1158

That's what I'm talking about.
Stay on this horse.

1159
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,100
He's going the distance.

1160
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,700
Are you sleepin'?

1161
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,400
You gotta keep me up.

All right.
Let's go for it.

Be there! Eighter! No.

1169

Hard eight.

Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.

1172
