1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:02,555
Well, I guess that's how y'all do it
in California, huh?

2
00:00:02,664 --> 00:00:05,827
You just rock on with no consideration
for other people's plans, right?

3
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,425
All right, Martin,
stop being such a tightwad.

4
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:10,094
We all gonna chip in for the boat.

5
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:13,231
I'm not gonna chip in
for no goddamn boat.

6
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,832
- You gotta hear this one. You tell him.
- No, you. All right.

7
00:00:15,944 --> 00:00:18,378
Earlier today we were walking on
the beach, having our morning coffee,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,107
and we got to talking about last night.

9
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,945
Anyhow, Buzz was just saying how
much fun it was getting to know you.

10
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:24,916
- It's really been a pleasure.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,214
By the way, for his birthday this year,

12
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:29,552
we're gonna get Boo
a license plate that says "Byoo"!

13
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:30,715
Can you imagine that?
Christmas morning,

14
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,588
he's gonna open it up,
it's gonna say "Byoo"!

15
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,059
- No numbers. "Byoo"!
- "Byoo"!

16
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:35,959
That's great. He'll love that.
He'll love that.

17
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,055
But that's a big secret.
Mum's the word, okay?

18
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,633
Who am I gonna tell?

19
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,929
- Good to see you.
- Take it easy.

20
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,369
Eddie, what do you have there?
It looks like you're eating for two.

21
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:46,940
Oh, no, no. Yeah. No, no. I just...

22
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:52,002
I just wanted to load up on some carbs
this morning, so...

23
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:55,549
And eggs, too. Eggs and carbs,
and, you know, full-on...

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,015
Hey, here's something to do.

25
00:00:57,118 --> 00:01:01,214
There's a double-decker bus running
tours out to a town called Miraflores.

26
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,187
It's the basil capital of Mexico.

27
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,383
Let me see that.

28
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:06,050
- Did you say "bagel capital"?
- No.

29
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,721
I've always wondered how they cultivate
and harvest basil. That'd be great.

30
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,891
- Me, too. Education. No, it's a herb.
- It's a herb. Italian herb.

31
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:13,990
She puts it on a lot of
the food she cooks.

32
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:15,091
Everything.

33
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:17,330
- Oh, everything. I love it. Pesto.
- It's delicious.

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,964
- Is it spicy?
- No, it's not spicy.

35
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:21,599
You can order a whole box of it.

36
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,402
Uncle Tito will take care
of everything. Okay.

37
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,744
Hey. Listen, Tito, I need you
to do me a big, big favor.

38
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,374
300 pesos.

39
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,577
You don't even know what it is yet.

40
00:01:31,686 --> 00:01:33,950
It is something nasty,
or you would be doing it yourself.

41
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:35,613
All right, fine.

42
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,464
Honey? Is that you?

43
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:55,072
Good. I'll open the door,
and you slide it in.

44
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:11,655
Thank you.

45
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:16,456
Thanks. Okay. A little bit of salsa.

46
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:17,553
Are you okay?

47
00:02:45,894 --> 00:02:47,293
But he keeps nipping at me.

48
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:28,527
Lime!

49
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,936
Oh, my God.

50
00:03:32,473 --> 00:03:33,440
Good.

51
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:35,934
Hello?

52
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:42,907
Hey, Mac! Listen, man,
I owe you, buddy. This place is like...

53
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,775
This is like my favorite place ever!

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,649
I told you you'd love it.

55
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,315
<i>And the people, the people down here!</i>

56
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:53,255
Oh, my God, I know. Aren't they great?

57
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,261
I'm seriously thinking
I should sell the store

58
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,625
and open up a place down here.

59
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,358
I mean, wouldn't that be incredible?

60
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,528
So, how's Lila?

61
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:03,331
- Oh, I'm sorry, your name's Joachim?
- Who?

62
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:04,700
Your wife. Lila.

63
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:10,874
She's not so good.
She got a little sunburned, so...

64
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:13,976
I've been hanging out
with this other girl.

65
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:15,140
Yeah.

66
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:18,177
Wait. What, are you serious?

67
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,817
Divorce lawyer?
What the hell are you talking about?

68
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,589
Do you get a buzz off it?

69
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:36,665
I'm telling you, the second we
got married it's like a switch flipped.

70
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:38,136
She's a nightmare, Mac.

71
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,935
Yeah, well, bitches be crazy, man.
You know that.

72
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,509
Tammy's always flipping switches.

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,634
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:45,804
You're always talking about
how happy you are with her.

75
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,939
Look, you wanna know the secret
to a happy marriage? Do what I do.

76
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,213
Plaster on a fake smile,
plow through the next half-century,

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,585
sit back, relax and wait
for the sweet embrace of death.

78
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,885
- Hey. Wow!
- What about my hips?

79
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,484
- And my butt?
- Great. I love it. Looks great.

80
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:01,960
Where is it?

81
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:06,924
- Come on back!
- Yes! I'm coming, Alfons!

82
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:10,436
So, this other girl. It doesn't bother her
that you're a newlywed?

83
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:14,440
No. I mean, I haven't exactly made it
clear to her yet, but I'm going to.

84
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,305
I just have to find
the right moment, you know?

85
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,469
Eddie. Eddie!

86
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:18,704
Hold on a second.

87
00:05:18,813 --> 00:05:21,543
Eddie! Come on, there are sea lions
in the ocean!

88
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,412
Really? Okay, hang on!

89
00:05:23,518 --> 00:05:27,249
She found sea lions now, come on!
Isn't that amazing? I gotta go!

90
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:31,223
Don't! Eddie, Eddie! Come home!
Come home! Come home, Eddie!

91
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,318
Wow.

92
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:37,387
<i>Ashes to ashes, funk to funky</i>

93
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:41,298
<i>We know Major Tom's a junkie</i>

94
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:44,462
<i>Strung out in heaven's high</i>

95
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:48,736
<i>Hitting an all-time low</i>

96
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:52,002
Wow, what a great day.

97
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,274
I had so much fun.

98
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:57,814
Here are your Mexican <i>sombreros. </i>

99
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,948
Look, the gang's back.

100
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:03,546
Basil sniffers.

101
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,815
Okay, let's hurry up.

102
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:07,258
We're supposed to meet everybody
on the veranda in 15 minutes, right?

103
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:09,330
Right, right. Okay, good.

104
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:15,964
Hey, Dad.

105
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,263
There's the guy from San Francisco
whose wife was murdered.

106
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,466
- Where?
- The guy right there.

107
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:24,340
Yeah, some crazy guy
hacked her up with an ice pick.

108
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:28,811
They caught the dude, though.
Some guy named Ronald.

109
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:31,148
Hey, baby!

110
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:34,851
Eddie Bear's home!
And boy, do I got a story for you.

111
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:37,220
Well, I hope so,
seeing that you've been gone all day.

112
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:40,419
Honey. Guess what happened?
I go downstairs to get your breakfast.

113
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:42,496
Who do I run into out of the clear blue?

114
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,326
- Who?
- Yvon Chouinard!

115
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:45,421
Who?

116
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,001
Yvon Chouinard,
big cheese at Patagonia.

117
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:49,364
- And?
- And?

118
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,734
Come on, honey,
Patagonia's like my biggest supplier.

119
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,363
I carry their entire line. You know that.

120
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:56,034
So, Yvon and his buddies
are going out golfing. Water?

121
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:57,372
- No.
- They ask me if I want to go.

122
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:00,140
So, what am I gonna do?
Say no? No. Right?

123
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,545
But you didn't bring your clubs.

124
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:03,446
I demoed a set! TaylorMade!

125
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:06,782
Sweet, too!
Added like 30 extra yards to my drives!

126
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:09,548
- Who were the buddies?
- Just a couple of guys.

127
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:13,616
This guy Lenny from Akron, insurance
guy. Kind of a stiff, but good golfer.

128
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,821
And the local Patagonia rep.

129
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,657
What was his name?

130
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,200
His name was Six-toe.

131
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,270
- Six-toe?
- Yeah, Six-toe.

132
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:26,306
Amputee.
Lost four toes scaling up Everest.

133
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,840
Did it without oxygen.
One of those guys.

134
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:30,911
By the way, amazingly, he showed me.
Retained the outer toes,

135
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:32,639
lost the middle stuff
but kept the balance points,

136
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:33,736
which are all you need.

137
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,748
In fact, he says
it gives him a better swing

138
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:37,077
because he swings
right through the ball,

139
00:07:37,185 --> 00:07:39,551
less resistance. Fascinating guy.

140
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,314
Eddie, since when has golf
taken seven hours?

141
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,984
Yeah, well, we got behind
a Korean couple, so...

142
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,788
But I'll tell you, it actually worked
to my advantage,

143
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:49,522
because we got to talk shop,

144
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,291
and if things pan out
the way I think they might,

145
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,391
we could be talking about some
really sweet credit terms for the store.

146
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:57,369
Why didn't you call me?
I've been worried sick about you.

147
00:07:57,472 --> 00:07:58,734
Honey, I did!

148
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,003
You get a mile outside of this place, it's
like trying to get reception on the moon!

149
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:04,737
What are you doing?
Are you going somewhere?

150
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:08,577
Lila, I just told you, I'm taking them
out to dinner in five minutes.

151
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:10,514
When did you say that?

152
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:14,083
Okay. First of all, these people...
Let me explain something to you.

153
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:17,624
These people, okay, they're primed.
This opportunity... Do you understand?

154
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:20,353
This is the head of an incredibly
important outerwear company.

155
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:21,689
International, okay?

156
00:08:21,796 --> 00:08:24,629
They have taken the bait, and now
I just gotta gaff'em, get'em in the boat

157
00:08:24,732 --> 00:08:27,223
and club'em to death. Kill time, honey.

158
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:28,859
Kill time. I can't let the air out.

159
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,131
Then all the momentum I built up all day
just evaporates.

160
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,433
By the way, shouldn't take too long,

161
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,441
because they started dropping back
the shots about two hours ago.

162
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:39,604
So... Very interested
in anything anybody has to say.

163
00:08:39,714 --> 00:08:41,341
So, you know, it's gonna be good.

164
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:44,941
All right. Well, hang on a sec.
Let me put on some makeup.

165
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,519
You're coming?

166
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,450
Of course I'm coming.

167
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,553
Yes! Good! Sweet!

168
00:08:51,726 --> 00:08:56,288
I'll just call down and tell them
to make room for one more on the skiff.

169
00:08:58,466 --> 00:08:59,899
On the skiff?

170
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:04,632
We're going out on this little 12-foot
Zodiac, inflatable job, twilight cruise.

171
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:06,707
No, Eddie, I can't go on a boat.

172
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,741
Oh, crap. That's right.

173
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,401
You sure?

174
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,480
Because really, honey, we're only going
a couple miles out past the breakwater.

175
00:09:13,581 --> 00:09:17,108
Right to where the continental shelf
drops off? It's supposed to be amazing.

176
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:21,245
The guy said it's where they filmed
that movie, <i>The Perfect Storm?</i>

177
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,018
Honey, I'm sorry, I feel really bad,
but there's no way I'd last out there.

178
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:30,059
You know what? Screw it. Screw it!

179
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:31,927
What am I doing?
I'm on my honeymoon!

180
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,227
Thank you for getting my head straight.

181
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:37,464
- I'm gonna call and cancel. Right now.
- What about the credit terms?

182
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:42,035
All right. You know what? Fine. You win.
We do it your way.

183
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:46,045
I'll go, finish the deal quickly, come
back, take you out for a late dinner.

184
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:48,172
That sound good? All right?

185
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,271
- Okay.
- Good.

186
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:52,409
Also, there's some important stuff
I wanna talk to you about.

187
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,182
Oh, yeah? Like, good stuff or bad stuff?

188
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,623
Like, well, you know,
at first you might flinch,

189
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:02,184
but then, I think, in the long run,
great stuff.

190
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,562
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

191
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,062
- Oh, honey?
- Yeah?

192
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,069
I'm sorry I swatted you away
this morning.

193
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:12,537
I didn't mean to hit you so hard.

194
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,598
Swatted me away?

195
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:17,541
You know, when you were
sitting outside the bathroom door

196
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:21,775
after you dropped off the food,
and you put my hand on your schlong?

197
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:25,949
You just surprised me, you know?
And I wasn't feeling so well.

198
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:29,082
But I promise
I'll make it up to you tonight.

199
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,316
Süper.

200
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:39,091
- Hey there, Tito.
- Hey, <i>Señor</i> Eddie.

201
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,224
How's it going, man?

202
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:41,961
- I'm okay.
- Yeah? Sure?

203
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,537
'Cause you look like you got
a little hitch in your giddyup.

204
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,267
Oh, that. No, it is a long story.
I will not bore you with it.

205
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,469
No, no, no. You bore me. Bore me.
Please. I got all the time in the world.

206
00:10:50,578 --> 00:10:52,102
I'd love to hear. What happened?

207
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:54,909
Okay. After I dropped the food off
at your room this morning,

208
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:58,110
I placed my penis in your wife's hand
and she smacked it away.

209
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,483
She nailed me pretty good, too.

210
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,947
Are you for real?

211
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:07,520
What are you doing? You don't just...
You crossed a serious line there.

212
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:11,325
That's not acceptable.
You don't do that. Come on.

213
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:16,961
Screw off! You're joking, right?
You had me.

214
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:18,470
- No.
- That's good!

215
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:22,269
No, I'm not joking. That's outrageous!
That's not acceptable behavior.

216
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:26,472
You don't just go and take your penis
and put it in my wife's hand.

217
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,814
Well, when you put it that way...

218
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,818
Wow, I'm sorry. I feel really bad, okay?

219
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:35,616
What were you thinking?

220
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:36,815
It's just that, well...

221
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:40,416
You come down here and you try
to bribe me with your porno tapes,

222
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:44,259
and then I see you running around
with other women on your honeymoon,

223
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:48,699
and I just figured that,
"Anything goes with this guy, hey?"

224
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,300
All right, fine.

225
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:57,774
I am sorry
for the misunderstanding, <i>señor!</i>

226
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,616
- Hey!
- Hey!

227
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,916
Wow. You look beautiful.

228
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:14,187
Thanks.

229
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,463
- So, you gonna walk me over?
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, listen.

230
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:22,693
I gotta tell you something.

231
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,936
And it's something I should have said
before, but I didn't, and...

232
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,906
I know about your wife.

233
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,970
You do?

234
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,904
How?

235
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:38,110
Beryl and everybody overheard some
people talking about it on the bus.

236
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,779
They were talking about it on the bus?

237
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:42,583
So it's true, then?

238
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:47,883
Yeah, but it's really important
for you to know that it is over.

239
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,024
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.
It's just...

240
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,598
You know,
at first it didn't even occur to me

241
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:53,223
because, you know,
when I first met you...

242
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:57,998
And then... I don't know, I didn't realize
I was gonna like you so much.

243
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:02,105
And I didn't wanna freak you out, so...

244
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:04,374
You wouldn't have freaked me out.

245
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:06,878
Really? So you're not mad?

246
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:08,403
No.

247
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,311
I'm sad.

248
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:14,047
That must have been horrible.

249
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:19,317
It was. It is. I mean, it sucks.

250
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:24,425
You're like the coolest person
on the planet.

251
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,460
Really.

252
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:31,735
No, I mean,
I wasn't expecting this reaction.

253
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,766
- So your whole family knows?
- Yeah.

254
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:40,009
I can't imagine they're taking it
as well as you are.

255
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:41,809
Of course they are.

256
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,674
- They just wanna support you.
- Even Martin?

257
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,913
Boo instructed everybody
not to even bring it up.

258
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:51,585
Dynamite!

259
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,322
The burros.

260
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:00,400
You go to the top of a mountain and
they leave you there with a pack of...

261
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,093
No, all the way up
to the top of the mountain,

262
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,534
and you can camp out there overnight.

263
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:05,229
- By starlight, you make a fire...
- We should do that.

264
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:06,601
- Totally. Totally in.
- I'm serious.

265
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,732
- Anytime.
- We could do it the day after tomorrow.

266
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:11,971
That would be... Okay, I have some
things that I have to move around.

267
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,741
It will be a bit of a headache,
but I can make it happen.

268
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:15,838
Buzz.

269
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:19,146
Am I the only one who's still
a little bothered by this guy?

270
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,515
I believe you are.

271
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:23,146
All right.
Well, let me ask you this, okay?

272
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:25,623
This dude's supposed to be
down here in mourning.

273
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,557
What's he doing
canoodling with Miranda?

274
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:29,288
- And the goat was dead?
- No, no.

275
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:32,229
- Really?
- The goat got back up.

276
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:36,633
Everybody mourns in their own way.
Why don't you cut him some slack?

277
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:37,965
He likes her and she likes him.

278
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:40,040
And I don't think
they're breaking any rules, all right?

279
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,767
I don't trust him.

280
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,009
Hey.

281
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:27,047
- Hi.
- Hi.

282
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,313
How you doing?

283
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:31,220
Honey, I'm sorry
for ruining our honeymoon.

284
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:33,653
I'm such a sucky wife.

285
00:15:33,761 --> 00:15:35,160
No, honey, you're not.

286
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:39,528
You're great.
You're an amazing, beautiful person.

287
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:43,629
However, I do think we should talk.

288
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:47,202
Hold on. I have something for you.

289
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:54,276
I love that. Thank you.

290
00:15:55,849 --> 00:15:58,977
So anyway, I've been thinking...

291
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,815
Honey, turn it over.

292
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:13,025
Did you make this?

293
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,291
Before we left.

294
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:16,961
You made this?

295
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,972
- You sewed this yourself?
- Yeah.

296
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:21,840
And the hearts?

297
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,466
Your heart and my heart,

298
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:24,771
together

299
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:27,040
forever.

300
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:32,275
So, honey, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

301
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:38,884
I want to talk to you
about nothing right now.

302
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:43,327
I want you to get some rest
and we'll talk in the morning, okay?

303
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:46,288
Give me a kiss.

304
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,558
Okay.

305
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,033
Eddie Bear, I love you.

306
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:55,239
I love, love, love, love, love...

307
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:57,839
Love, love, love.

308
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,813
- Okay.
- Okay.

309
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:06,084
So, what's this important stuff
you wanted to talk to me about?

310
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,517
Yeah, okay.

311
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:08,986
Oh, my God!

312
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,614
This guac is fucking awesome!

313
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,886
Is it? That's good. Good.

314
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:15,985
Your hand, Eddie.

315
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,862
Look, I'm just gonna
lay this out there, all right?

316
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:25,496
I have not been a good husband.
I've been bad.

317
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:30,866
I am so glad to hear you say that, Eddie.

318
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:33,208
I mean, I thought I was losing my mind.

319
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,042
It's like the moment we got married,

320
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,915
a switch went off
and you became this loony bird.

321
00:17:39,053 --> 00:17:40,213
Yes! Yes, you're right!

322
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,721
I did turn into... I've been a loony bird,
and it's not you, it's me.

323
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:45,485
This conversation
is all about my deficiencies,

324
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:49,551
because as a wife you've been spot-on.
You've been incredible.

325
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:52,154
You've been doing everything
a wife should do,

326
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,702
and any man would be happy
to have a wife like you,

327
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:58,397
and kudos to you for putting up with me

328
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:01,235
and all of my junk.

329
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:02,638
Thank you.

330
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,774
But the point is, honey, you shouldn't
have to put up with your husband.

331
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:11,584
You deserve so much better.
You understand what I'm saying?

332
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:14,210
Yeah, you're apologizing.
That's very sweet.

333
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,482
No. No, I'm not... I'm not...

334
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:20,626
Oh, God, that frigging stuff is hot.

335
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:22,194
Honey, look...

336
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,026
In life, sometimes...

337
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:27,566
Sometimes we make choices,

338
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:32,128
and in retrospect, we realize
the choice wasn't the right choice.

339
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,601
Not a bad choice, not a good choice,

340
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:40,772
just not the correct choice
for the people who are involved.

341
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,846
What are you getting at, Eddie?

342
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:45,209
Lila,

343
00:18:46,453 --> 00:18:49,718
we're not gonna be happy together
in San Francisco.

344
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:57,086
Rotterdam! That's where you gotta be.
It hit me!

345
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:59,097
That's where your destiny is.

346
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,894
Cleaning up the bogs,

347
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:02,935
and getting the environment
right over there.

348
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:04,094
That's what you should be doing,

349
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:08,572
not hanging out in San Francisco
with me, some sporting-goods schmo...

350
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:10,006
Oh, my God!

351
00:19:13,347 --> 00:19:16,111
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

352
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:17,950
I'm saying...

353
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,708
Lila?

354
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,755
This is gonna be a good thing, Lila.

355
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,256
Lila, it's better. It's for the...

356
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:31,926
Lila, you got a little piece of tri-tip
coming out here.

357
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:39,697
This is so for the best. Do you hear me?

358
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:41,433
Can I call my mom?

359
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:44,978
Yes, of course!
You wanna call her, go ahead, call her.

360
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,341
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mom, it's me.

361
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,414
No, no, I'm okay. It's just...

362
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:56,914
Something's happened.

363
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,321
Something huge.

364
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:01,223
Eddie's moving to Rotterdam with me.

365
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:03,791
No, no, wait! No, Lila, no.

366
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:06,730
He doesn't wanna be
a sporting-goods schmo anymore!

367
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,733
Hold on, he wants to tell you himself.

368
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,700
I didn't want... Hello?

369
00:20:10,804 --> 00:20:11,793
<i>Hey, Eddie! You having fun?</i>

370
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:13,304
Yeah, yeah, we're having a ball.

371
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,068
<i>And I hear you're moving to Germany?</i>

372
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:16,301
No, no.

373
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,776
See, Lila got a little bit
ahead of herself on that one,

374
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:23,339
and I haven't actually gotten through
the entire plan with her, but she...

375
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:25,775
You know what? I gotta go.

376
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,448
I gotta say goodbye, okay?

377
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,545
- Okay. Yes.
- <i>Love you! Bye!</i>

378
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:32,651
- Hey!
- Isn't he the greatest?

379
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,124
What's that?

380
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:38,791
I know. I know.

381
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,094
- How you guys doing?
- Not too good, actually.

382
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,828
Beryl and Boo are set
to renew their vows on the terrace

383
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,301
and we can't find Miranda anywhere.

384
00:20:44,404 --> 00:20:45,462
Have you seen her?

385
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:47,369
Hang on. Honey, who's Miranda?

386
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:50,307
Miranda, honey, is their cousin.
Their cousin.

387
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,379
You know what? Excuse me
for one second. Come here.

388
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:58,007
Sorry, Mom. Yeah, no. I don't know.
Just some guys.

389
00:20:58,118 --> 00:21:01,554
Guys! Guys! What are you doing?
You're killing me here.

390
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,579
What is this? What's going on?

391
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,624
Look, Martin, I know you're upset
about this whole thing

392
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:06,715
with Cal, Miranda and me.

393
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:09,796
But there'll be a time and a place
we can talk about it, but not now.

394
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:11,761
I'm about to tell her.

395
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:13,230
Who is that?

396
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,200
It's my wife!

397
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:17,895
Wife?

398
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:21,708
Guys, what are you, like, snorting
peyote? Come on, it's me. It's Eddie.

399
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:24,368
- But your wife was murdered.
- What?

400
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,136
Those twins.

401
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:31,877
They said that your wife was murdered
by a maniac with an ice pick.

402
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:34,014
No, no, no, no, no.

403
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:35,952
Look, you guys, all you have to know

404
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:37,751
is that from the second
I fell in love with Miranda,

405
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:39,792
I have not once cheated on her
with my wife, okay?

406
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,417
And I'm not saying that
to toot my own horn, it's just...

407
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:43,291
- I really haven't...
- You sick little prick!

408
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,728
- Martin! Martin!
- Come here.

409
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:47,766
- No, stop!
- Here, take this.

410
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:51,703
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:53,067
Get off me!

412
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:56,108
You gotta get yourself
right with God, buddy!

413
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,775
- He is not worth it!
- Get off me! Get off!

414
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,308
What is going on?

415
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:04,945
Eddie, who was that?

416
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,346
I have absolutely no idea.

417
00:22:07,454 --> 00:22:09,888
How's your... How's your...

418
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,355
What do you mean, you have no idea?

419
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,517
They called you Eddie.
You knew their cousin!

420
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:16,596
No, I know. I mean, I know who
they were, they're the Patagonia guys.

421
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:20,098
I just didn't understand
why they were so...

422
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,395
You know, they get so...
Acting like that.

423
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:23,628
Eddie, are you okay?

424
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:25,329
No! I'm not okay!

425
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:28,867
Look, Lila, we're not okay. It's over!

426
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,499
No!

427
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,843
Could you please go away?

428
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:36,415
- What?
- We're over!

429
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:38,416
- What do you mean?
- Stop!

430
00:22:38,518 --> 00:22:41,351
- What's over?
- Hang on a sec.

431
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:44,515
Here! Here you go. Fifty.
Fifty Americano. Please stop, okay?

432
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:47,627
Can you... No! No, stop!

433
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:51,391
Will you shut up?
We're trying to have lunch here!

434
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:54,990
Would you stop? I'm paying
a lot of money to stay at this hotel!

435
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:57,127
I'm on my honeymoon.
We just want to have a nice quiet lunch!

436
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:58,499
Eddie, Eddie. It's okay.
They're not bothering me.

437
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,663
No! It's not okay!

438
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:02,765
We're newlyweds! We just wanna have
a quiet time together!

439
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:06,209
How can we have any good memories
if you guys keep...

440
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,914
Eddie, Eddie.
It's okay, I am having good...

441
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:13,717
Eddie, please sit down!

442
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:22,622
Wow, I was starting to wonder
where all that passion had gone.

443
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:27,527
Lila, I'm sorry,
but you and I are finished.

444
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:32,829
What are you talking about, Eddie?
What about our Rotterdam plans?

445
00:23:36,843 --> 00:23:39,073
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

446
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:42,213
Eddie!
You're acting like a loony bird again!

447
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,585
- Hey.
- Hey.

448
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:50,048
Oh, my God!
What happened to your nose?

449
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:52,856
- Martin stuck a pepper up it.
- What?

450
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,927
Look, there's been
a massive misunderstanding.

451
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,620
I don't mean to be rude, Eddie,
but can this wait?

452
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,719
No!

453
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,765
I'm gonna be late
for Beryl and Boo's ceremony.

454
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:02,232
Look, my wife was never murdered.

455
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:04,627
- What?
- Yeah, my wife, she never died.

456
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:08,401
In fact, I never actually said that,
it was just those stupid twins, they...

457
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:11,170
What are you saying?
You're not a widower?

458
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,212
- No...
- No, he's married!

459
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:15,976
Martin just told me.

460
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:19,318
He's been staying here with his wife
all week!

461
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:22,578
What is she talking about?

462
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:27,118
It's true, I'm...
But it's over, Miranda. I mean, it's...

463
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:28,216
Get away from me.

464
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:29,851
Miranda, it's okay.
Will you listen to me, please?

465
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,692
Get away from me. Leave me alone!

466
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:33,288
Miranda!

467
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:36,801
Hang on!

468
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,132
Eddie!

469
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:50,541
Shit!

470
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:04,089
- Eddie!
- I was trying to tell you before.

471
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:06,825
- Leave me alone! Get away from me!
- Miranda!

472
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:09,493
Eddie! What the hell is going on?

473
00:25:09,603 --> 00:25:12,629
Lila, I was trying to tell you before,
and I...

474
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:15,868
Did I cut my back on the rocks?

475
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:18,533
Oh, my God!

476
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,346
Man-o'- war!

477
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:23,143
Get it off! Get it off!

478
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:37,755
Come on, do something.

479
00:25:37,864 --> 00:25:38,888
I'm not doing anything.
This is what he gets.

480
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:46,803
- It's okay! I know what to do.
- What are you doing?

481
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:53,009
Get off of me! No! No!

482
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:55,038
Oh, my gosh!

483
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:56,410
I know what I'm doing!

484
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:58,746
- No!
- Eddie!

485
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:02,751
- Burning! Burning!
- It's okay!

486
00:26:02,856 --> 00:26:04,983
It's okay. It's okay.

487
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,657
I know, honey. Isn't that nice?

488
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,488
Sick!

489
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:16,963
Oh, no! It's okay, I'm his wife.

490
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,096
- We're on our honeymoon!
- Honeymoon?

491
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:22,868
Miranda, it's not what it seems.

492
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:26,842
No. Wait, Miranda!

493
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:29,672
Miranda!

494
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,826
I think it was
a confluence of events, you know?

495
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:46,024
With my dad busting my balls
about my dating life,

496
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:48,699
then going to Jodi's wedding.

497
00:26:48,802 --> 00:26:53,034
Why did I even go to Jodi's wedding,
you know? Just to torture myself?

498
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,670
Mac's all up in my grill about being
married. It's just...

499
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,737
I don't know, I jumped,
you know, I jumped.

500
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:04,749
I felt the heat and I jumped, and it was
like two days, three days early.

501
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,580
And I'll tell you something.

502
00:27:06,686 --> 00:27:11,350
I should've just gone with my dad to
Vegas and double-teamed those girls.

503
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,619
That would've been
the decent thing to do.

504
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:15,092
<i>Señor</i> Eddie!

505
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:21,864
Hey, there he is! <i>Señor</i> Tito!
My Tito-Bandito!

506
00:27:21,968 --> 00:27:23,833
Eddie, what are you doing?

507
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:27,703
I'm just hanging with my brother,
my brother Manuel.

508
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:29,775
Eddie, people are looking for you.

509
00:27:29,876 --> 00:27:32,811
Your father keeps calling, and then Mac
is trying to track you down.

510
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:36,905
And what am I supposed to tell
the American girl, the... Miranda?

511
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:39,042
- What do I tell her?
- Miranda?

512
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:40,380
- Miranda?
- Yes!

513
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:43,718
- What?
- Her family flew home, but she didn't.

514
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:46,792
And she has been everywhere
searching for you.

515
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:48,287
She has?

516
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,357
Screw off! I'm joking, man!

517
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:55,466
That chick ran for the hills, huh?

518
00:27:57,337 --> 00:28:00,431
You should've seen your face!
You were so happy!

519
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,735
For a moment, you were like...

520
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,342
I can't believe I got you again!

521
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:11,350
The funny man!

522
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,453
That's cool man, that's cool.
Don't worry about me.

523
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:17,853
Seriously, are you here for a reason?

524
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,083
Huh? What's the deal?

525
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:22,093
What, you want me to... You want
to tell me to, like, go back and get Lila?

526
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,663
Or go back to the States?
It's not gonna happen!

527
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:29,599
Look at you. Listen to you.
You are sounding <i>loco!</i>

528
00:28:29,703 --> 00:28:31,295
- Oh, I'm <i>loco?</i>
- Yes.

529
00:28:31,404 --> 00:28:32,598
No, you're <i>loco!</i>

530
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:36,233
Lila burned my wallet, she burned
my clothes, she burned my passport.

531
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:38,173
Okay? Even if I wanted
to go back, I couldn't!

532
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:41,679
I can't get papers
for like a month or something.

533
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:46,516
But you know what? I don't need papers
to hang with this guy,

534
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,052
'cause he doesn't want papers.

535
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:50,645
He just wants friendship, don't you?

536
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,089
And we're gonna stay here,

537
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:55,127
we're gonna keep talking it out
and talking it out,

538
00:28:55,228 --> 00:28:57,628
until it feels right up in my head.
Right, Manny?

539
00:28:57,731 --> 00:29:00,291
Even if it takes forever. Am I right?

540
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:03,565
Listen, you little <i>gringo</i> pussy,

541
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:09,233
you've been ear-fucking me for
two straight weeks about all this shit!

542
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,310
You wanna fix what you did?

543
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:13,470
Stop talking about it, just do it!

544
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,980
Get off your ass and do it!

545
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,910
Manuel is right, <i>Señor</i> Eddie.

546
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:26,014
You are going to have to go back and
fix this yourself, okay? Now, come on.

547
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:27,286
- Get up!
- Can't.

548
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,793
You can do it, come on! Listen.

549
00:29:29,896 --> 00:29:34,526
I have connections. You know, people
that can sneak you back into California.

550
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:37,095
You're not joking?

551
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:39,467
No, I promise. I'm not kidding this time.

552
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:42,006
- Okay, good. Good, good.
- Yes!

553
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:45,703
But I don't wanna go to California.
I wanna go to Mississippi.

554
00:29:55,522 --> 00:29:57,217
It's cool! It's cool, guys!

555
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:59,917
I'm an American. I just lost my passport.

556
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:29,849
America!

557
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:44,796
Stop right there!

558
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:46,396
I'm an American!

559
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,849
- Come on, grab his hand!
- You can do it!

560
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:37,688
Come on, buddy!

561
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:41,355
Come on! Grab it!

562
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:11,054
I'm going on the record here, Eddie.
I think this is a bad, bad idea.

563
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:20,158
Look, Pop, I appreciate your coming
down here and helping me out.

564
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,996
This is just something
that I have to do, okay?

565
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:25,229
I still don't understand
what happened with you and Lila.

566
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:27,306
She was such a sweet kid.

567
00:32:28,174 --> 00:32:31,143
Dad, I love Miranda, okay?

568
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:33,743
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

569
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,212
All right, Eddie. Just be careful, okay?

570
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:39,843
Remember, this is the Bible Belt.
These people have guns.

571
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,011
This is it, right here! Stop! Stop!

572
00:32:48,828 --> 00:32:51,854
Don't you think we should clean you up
or give you a shave or something?

573
00:32:51,965 --> 00:32:53,728
No. Look. I've been working on
this speech for over a month.

574
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,664
I just want to go in and do it.

575
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:57,258
Knock'em dead!

576
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:17,085
Seven pitches in a row over 90 miles
an hour? That boy hums that ball!

577
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:21,517
Byoo! Look what the cat dragged in!

578
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,256
I know, don't ask. Is Miranda around?

579
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,959
- You must be out of your mind.
- Well, no, I'm not.

580
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,063
Oh, my God! Why am I not surprised
that this moron's standing out here?

581
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:36,641
It's all right.
Look, I don't want any trouble, Martin.

582
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:39,041
Oh, you don't want any trouble?
You're about to get some trouble, boy!

583
00:33:39,145 --> 00:33:41,136
You better get off my stoop!
You piece of shit!

584
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:43,477
That is a refreshingly honest response.

585
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,882
And let me just drop some of that
back on you,

586
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:50,854
and tell you I made
a huge mistake, okay? Guilty. Boom.

587
00:33:50,957 --> 00:33:53,357
I stepped in it, big-time.

588
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:54,721
And I admit it, okay?

589
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,920
I jumped into a marriage
way too quickly.

590
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,089
I only knew my wife for a couple months
before we got married, okay?

591
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,530
So that's the back story.

592
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:05,832
And how long did you know Miranda
before you decided she was the one?

593
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,932
Two days, and I hear that.

594
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,771
Let me just say to you,
"That's my point."

595
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:13,038
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake again, okay?

596
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:15,808
You can rest assured,
I have got my act together.

597
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:17,576
And once my annulment is finalized,

598
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,015
I really believe that Miranda
and I should just go slow.

599
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:22,349
I mean, you know, date for a while.

600
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:24,889
Move in together for like a year, at least.

601
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:28,859
See what it feels like,
then go from there, okay? No promises.

602
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,225
- Really?
- I wanna do everything right this time.

603
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,027
There ain't gonna be a "this time,"
Eddie. The popcorn has popped.

604
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:38,126
Miranda and Cal got married
two weeks ago Saturday.

605
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:39,295
What?

606
00:34:39,672 --> 00:34:42,072
What're you talking about?

607
00:34:42,175 --> 00:34:44,643
She has finally come to her senses.

608
00:34:45,044 --> 00:34:46,011
I don't believe you.

609
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:47,443
- Oh, you better believe it.
- Eddie...

610
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,811
- I don't believe you.
- Eddie...

611
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,213
It's true.

612
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,444
They got married?

613
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:00,985
Well, can I...
At least, can I talk to her in person...

614
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:02,823
- No, you cannot, all right?
- Martin! Martin! Calm down!

615
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,521
You will stay the hell away
from Miranda, okay?

616
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,120
I'm gonna put my fist through your face!

617
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:08,166
I'll put both of my fists
through your face!

618
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:11,202
I'm calm! I'm calm! I'm being calm.
You're holding me too tight!

619
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:13,101
Stop it. Eddie...

620
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:14,264
- Take it easy, boy.
- I'm fine.

621
00:35:14,373 --> 00:35:18,537
Now, look, we ask you to respect
Miranda and Cal's privacy.

622
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:22,139
Give those kids a chance to be happy.

623
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:26,409
If you care about Miranda,
that's what you'll do.

624
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:32,656
Okay, Beryl.

625
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:36,755
I will.

626
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:50,532
Miranda!

627
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,982
It's okay!

628
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:02,054
It's me. It's just Eddie.

629
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:04,522
Are you crazy?

630
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:07,148
This is crazy!

631
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:09,216
Hi!

632
00:36:09,328 --> 00:36:12,263
- What the hell are you doing here?
- It's okay, it's okay.

633
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:15,027
Beryl told me you got married.
I just wanted to talk to you.

634
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,534
This is my husband sleeping
right next to me. Do you see that?

635
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:18,604
Yes, I do.

636
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:20,535
This is not the time or the place
to do this!

637
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,734
Please, please. Look, I'll keep it quiet.
I'll be cool. Just hear me out.

638
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:26,903
No! I am not going to hear you out!
This is insane!

639
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:29,811
I'm begging you! You don't know
what I've been through to get here.

640
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,884
Please, just hear me out.

641
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:35,651
You got one minute. Go.

642
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:39,288
Okay, look. First of all, I'm so sorry
I didn't tell you I was married.

643
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:43,021
See, I tried to tell you a couple of times,
but we kept on getting interrupted.

644
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:45,620
And then there was this sort of
classic misunderstanding

645
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,722
about my wife being murdered.

646
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,993
Anyway, the point is...

647
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:51,695
No! The point is,
whether you tried to tell me or not,

648
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:54,398
you tried to pick me up
on your honeymoon!

649
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:55,701
Do you know how creepy that is?

650
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:59,437
Yes, I do. I do. It's repulsive,
and I owe you a massive apology.

651
00:36:59,545 --> 00:37:02,446
But, on the other hand,
I'm glad it happened.

652
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:20,454
Look, it's not my fault the Lord works
in mysterious ways.

653
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:24,161
And so, yeah, I screwed up, okay?
I got married a week too early.

654
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,397
But you know what?
I wouldn't change any of it.

655
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:27,938
I don't regret marrying Lila

656
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,871
because if I hadn't,
then I wouldn't have gone to Cabo,

657
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:33,912
and I wouldn't have met you, and
I wouldn't have fallen in love with you,

658
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:36,504
and I will never apologize for that.

659
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:38,611
Not ever.

660
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:41,845
God damn it, Eddie.

661
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:43,182
I know.

662
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:49,021
Cal, it's fine.

663
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,595
Martin! Martin, put the bat down.

664
00:37:51,697 --> 00:37:54,791
Just shush, all right?
This ain't about you, it's about him!

665
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,958
What?

666
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,400
Who the hell is that guy?

667
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:01,530
This the psychopath who's trying
to steal your woman, man!

668
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:04,235
I knew you wouldn't stay away from her,
you son of a bitch!

669
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:07,369
I can't help it.
The heart wants what it wants.

670
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,372
Eddie, you've gotta get out of here!

671
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:11,677
Not until you give me an answer.

672
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:13,684
No! There ain't gonna be no answer!

673
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:17,220
Damn you, Martin!
Damn, that hurts! Shit!

674
00:38:17,323 --> 00:38:18,756
You... Martin, that hurts!

675
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:22,487
You wanna throw down, tough guy?
I will mess your shit up! Come on.

676
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,927
I don't want any trouble here.
Why don't you just back up, all right?

677
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:26,862
Well, trouble's found you, pussydick!

678
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:28,058
Dad! It's okay.

679
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:32,627
Look, Miranda, just tell me,
do you feel the same way, or not?

680
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,441
We can figure everything else out.

681
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:44,545
No, I don't, Eddie.

682
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:49,218
We had a connection in Mexico,
and that's all it was.

683
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:56,318
I love Cal, and everything that happened
in Cabo made me realize that.

684
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,427
I'm sorry.

685
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:01,824
That's the deal.

686
00:39:02,935 --> 00:39:06,336
Come on, kid, let's get out of here.
Come on, come on.

687
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,703
Come on.
Bitches be crazy, you know that.

688
00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:13,806
Come on.

689
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:17,916
Yeah, take care, Grandpa.

690
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,978
Come on, let's go.

691
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:21,744
Wow.

692
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:27,887
Hey, Dad?

693
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,026
Take a look.

694
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:33,222
If she's watching,
it means I still have a shot.

695
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:38,161
Your goose is cooked, Eddie.

696
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:04,619
Come on, man. You can't leave me now.

697
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,096
I finally straightened Tammy out.

698
00:40:07,466 --> 00:40:08,831
What does that mean?

699
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:11,402
It means I stood up to her.
I told her that from now on,

700
00:40:11,504 --> 00:40:13,938
Thursday through Sunday,
it's gonna be bros before hos.

701
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,269
I said, "I's needs my's alone time."

702
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,674
Really? You said that? Just like that?
Putting your hand up, like...

703
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:20,871
Like, half that, yeah.

704
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,743
And she bought that?

705
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:29,682
Honey, I'm conversing
with Edward right now.

706
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:31,484
I'll speak to you later.

707
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,784
Goodbye.

708
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:36,826
- Wow. Impressive.
- Yeah, see?

709
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:39,159
That's how it's gonna be from now on.
Please don't go.

710
00:40:39,265 --> 00:40:40,459
Mac, we've been through this before.

711
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:42,431
There's no reason for me
to be here, okay?

712
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:46,801
Lila got the store in the divorce.
My dad's off in Vegas all the time.

713
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:49,340
I haven't really met anybody
in the last six months.

714
00:40:49,442 --> 00:40:51,410
That's because you're still
hung up on that Miranda chick.

715
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,570
No, I'm not! I'm over her. I moved on.

716
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,443
In fact, I'm starting to think
there's a lot of good

717
00:40:56,549 --> 00:40:57,641
that came out of that experience.

718
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,717
- Oh, really?
- Yeah!

719
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:01,981
Like, you got to sit around
for six months in your panties,

720
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,419
growing that funky beard.
That was awesome.

721
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:06,218
Yeah, which is why I need to change.

722
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:08,384
I can't just sit around
waiting for life to happen to me.

723
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:09,825
I need to follow my instincts,

724
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:13,160
and right now my instincts
are telling me that I...

725
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,292
Mac, get your ass
in the fucking car right now!

726
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:19,371
You got it, sweetie. Hi.

727
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:21,167
Eddie! Think about what I said.

728
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,865
Bros before hos!

729
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:25,706
How you doing, Eddie? You sad?

730
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:28,010
- No.
- Good.

731
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:29,978
Good. Okay.

732
00:41:31,317 --> 00:41:32,944
Okay. Bye, Lester.

733
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:51,970
Now, for another $150,
I can give you the Uncle Tito special.

734
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:54,801
A guided tour to the island's best reef!

735
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:57,808
- $150?
- That's a little steep, isn't it?

736
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,140
Or you can find it yourself.
You guys are pretty big.

737
00:42:00,246 --> 00:42:03,079
I don't think you're gonna have
a problem fending off the sharks.

738
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:06,345
Tito! Don't scare these people.
There's no sharks.

739
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:08,886
There's sand sharks,
but they don't have any teeth.

740
00:42:08,988 --> 00:42:12,719
You see that attitude right there?
You have no business sense.

741
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:14,258
Hey, Manuelito! Do me a favor.

742
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,227
Help Tito give these folks
some snorkel gear, all right?

743
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:18,819
Throw in the fins for free.

744
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:21,798
- Oh, hey. Thanks, Eddie.
- Thanks again, Eddie.

745
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:27,305
How much for a skimboard?

746
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,678
Hey! Hi!

747
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:38,472
Hi.

748
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:41,886
What are you doing here?

749
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:46,421
Down here with the family.
It's that time of year again.

750
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:50,655
Beryl and Boo are renewing their vows
on the beach this afternoon, so...

751
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:51,787
Wow!

752
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,397
And, to be honest,
I had heard a rumor that

753
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,593
you'd opened a business down here.

754
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,897
Oh, yeah? How'd you hear that?

755
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:02,601
I got the e-vite for your grand opening.

756
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:08,035
Oh, right.
Yeah, I had a group e-mail list that I...

757
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:11,806
I can't believe you really moved here.

758
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:13,111
Yeah, I did it.

759
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:16,915
I became one of those
perma-vacationers,

760
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:18,353
like we talked about.

761
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:20,391
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah.

762
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:21,857
Suits you.

763
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:25,991
You look beautiful.

764
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:28,559
Thanks.

765
00:43:29,635 --> 00:43:32,604
So, you down here with Cal
and the crew and...

766
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:36,769
Cal and I split up.

767
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:39,405
Split up.

768
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:45,116
He's a great guy, but we probably
should've never gotten married.

769
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:48,216
I'm sorry.

770
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:53,685
I guess now I know what you
went through on your honeymoon.

771
00:43:54,793 --> 00:43:57,091
It's not easy being married when

772
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:00,997
you're in love with someone else.

773
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:07,168
He's in the car,
and I am dying for you to meet him!

774
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,700
He's...

775
00:44:10,476 --> 00:44:12,410
Really? He's in the car?

776
00:44:13,012 --> 00:44:15,446
No! No.

777
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:21,279
Funny.

778
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,787
Got me. That was... That's good.

779
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:24,878
- Very funny.
- Thank you.

780
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:27,754
- So, you are single. You're single?
- I am.

781
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:33,398
I'm actually staying at the hotel, if you

782
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:36,698
wanna grab a drink or something.

783
00:44:38,737 --> 00:44:40,364
I would love that.

784
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:44,135
How about tonight, 7:00?

785
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,808
7:00, I could do that. Yeah.
I could do that.

786
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:48,971
- Cool.
- Great.

787
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:50,309
Miranda!

788
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,484
Come on, we're gonna miss
the ceremony!

789
00:44:53,585 --> 00:44:55,849
- I'm coming!
- Hey, Martin!

790
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:57,444
Hello, asshole!

791
00:44:58,123 --> 00:44:59,954
Great to see you, too!

792
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:04,493
So, I'll see you tonight.

793
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:06,655
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

794
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:13,263
Eddie?

795
00:45:14,573 --> 00:45:15,801
Who was that?

796
00:45:15,908 --> 00:45:20,675
Oh, hey! Yeah, it's unbelievable.
That was Gretchen Construbias.

797
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:21,768
Who?

798
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,314
Gretchen Construbias,
the CEO of Da Huey?

799
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:28,079
Da Huey Water Wear Sports.
They're, like, my biggest supplier. Yeah.

800
00:45:28,187 --> 00:45:29,620
Yeah, anyway, she's in town
for one night.

801
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:33,089
She wants to get together and have
drinks at 7:00 to discuss credit terms.

802
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,659
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

803
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,024
Oh, but, honey, it's our first anniversary.

804
00:45:37,129 --> 00:45:40,565
I know, I know.
But, Consuela, I'll be back by 9:00, so...

805
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:43,294
- Oh, okay. So we have a late dinner?
- Okay.

806
00:45:43,402 --> 00:45:45,267
Yes, perfect.
Late dinner, and that'll be good,

807
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,100
because there's some stuff
that I think we should discuss.

808
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:50,300
Oh. Good stuff or bad stuff?

809
00:45:50,776 --> 00:45:54,234
Well, I think at first you might flinch,

810
00:45:54,346 --> 00:45:56,712
but in the long run, great stuff.

811
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,746
I love you, Eddie.

812
00:46:02,654 --> 00:46:04,815
Love, love, love, love, love.

813
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:09,919
Fuck me.

814
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,534
Cock me! Cock me!

815
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:09,440
Yes, yes!

816
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,304
Finally!

817
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,968
Yes, you're doing it!
