1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,640
Swords and staves.

2
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,440
Tough road you got this year.

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,560
Judgement... Death...

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
..and Mr Devil.

5
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,840
I'm glad it's your birthday reading
and not mine.

6
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,000
Now here's your card, Fool. See?

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,440
- That's where I got your nickname.
- Don't remind me!

8
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
Here you go. 13 today.

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,760
The golden-haired birthday boy is
settin' off on life's big adventure.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,080
I ain't no golden-haired nobody!
All I'm goin' on to is seventh grade.

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,560
Well, you're the Fool, and you
can't escape that. That ain't bad.

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,880
- No?
- No. Ain't the stupid kind of fool.

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,440
The ignorant kind,
cos you're just startin' out.

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,760
That's better, I guess.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,560
Ah, but look here.
Already he's got a problem, see?

16
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,360
One step in front - the drop-off.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,600
- What about the dog?
- That's Fool's companion.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,800
See his spirit barking?

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,800
"Fool! Don't go marching
over that cliff, now. "

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,720
"Do the smart thing. The high thing. "

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,280
So what Fool gonna do if he ain't
gonna go off the cliff? Fly?

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,640
He gonna do what he have to, Fool.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,320
Turn around and walk the other way,
right through the fire of the sun.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,400
He'll get burned up if he do that.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,880
Just the boy part get burned up.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,520
The rest come out the other side a man.

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,360
And no one calls him "Fool" again.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,000
Just try to sleep, Mama.
There's nothing you can do.

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
- Sh.

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
Sh.

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,600
Just rest, Mom.

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
Oh.

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,120
I don't know what to do with this, Ruby.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,160
I didn't think the landlord would do this.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,120
Not now.

36
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,720
- Fool, you shouldn't be here.
- Fool, go back to reading your book.

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,640
- What's wrong?
- Nothing you can do. Go on.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Who are you?

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,200
Leroy. A friend of Ruby's.

40
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,280
You the little brother she call Fool?

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,600
My real name's Poindexter,
but Ruby's hung up on them tarot cards.

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,040
Why Mama cryin'?

43
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,360
Y'all been evicted. You gotta
be out tomorrow at midnight.

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,400
I guess Ruby didn't see
that one in the cards.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
But why?

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,920
You're three days late
with your payment.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,400
The fine print in the lease says
you gotta pay triple or else get out.

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,720
Your mama and Ruby ain't got triple.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,720
Well, don't the landlord know that...
that Mama's sick,...

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,280
-.. or Ruby got babies?
- Yeah, sure. He knows. He don't care.

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,800
He wants to tear down the building.
You're the last family in it.

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,440
You got some money you can kick in?

53
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,720
I know where you can earn some.

54
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
You game?

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,120
One last family in the Lenox Avenue
building, then it's clear to tear down.

56
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,640
We build a nice neat condominium,
we get clean people in there.

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,400
Lots of nice wood for my fireplace,
lots of nice...

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,960
- Money.
- And money.

59
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,120
For me.

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,120
Mama, what happens to the people
when you make them leave their home?

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
I don't believe I was speaking to you.

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Speak when spoken to,
that's what good girls do.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,920
- You getting them out soon?
- By tomorrow midnight.

64
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
Damn buckshot.

65
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,720
Hey, Fool. I hear
you're gettin' evicted, man.

66
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,800
Your ass will be out on
the street like the rest of us!

67
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,400
Hey, come back here!

68
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,520
Hi, Fool.

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,440
He don't need that kind
of opportunity. He's a good kid.

70
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,640
He'd do better than the rest of you.
Out of seven, three's already dead.

71
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,360
Then there's you, baby,
turnin' tricks on the strip.

72
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,680
Willy's a crack addict,
and what's the other one's name, in jail?

73
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,920
- Washington. And he didn't do nothin'.
- He tried to put food on the damn table.

74
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
That's what I'm tryin'
to teach the boy to do.

75
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,520
- He wants to be a doctor.
- You can't even afford to pay rent!

76
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,640
How are you gonna afford
to send him to medical school?

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,280
- It ain't right anyway.
- Oh, that right?

78
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,640
Your mama got a cancer in her
she can't afford to have taken out.

79
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,360
Leroy!

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,600
A thing any doctor could
take out just like that.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But you ain't got no money! And you
ain't gonna have no money unless...

82
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,240
Ow! You little snot!

83
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,440
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

84
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,800
You listen up, you little punk. Listen up!

85
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,840
Now, this is the big one,
and somebody deserve to be robbed,...

86
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,880
..somebody who don't care about families
or the neighborhood.

87
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
He just wanna bring the wreckin' ball in
so he can line his pockets.

88
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,000
Who you talkin' about?

89
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,040
The landlord, that's who.

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
- The landlord of this building?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,760
I found the treasure map last night
in the liquor store, me and Spenser.

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,760
A letter addressed to the owner,
along with the name of his company.

93
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,680
- So?
- So the name of the company...

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,920
..is the same as the name
on your eviction notice.

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,120
Same guy who owns the liquor store
owns half the buildings in the ghetto.

96
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,160
I know where your landlord lives.

97
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,480
No.

98
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,200
Leave him alone. I heard things about him.

99
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,600
- Bad things.
- You heard about the gold?

100
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,680
This is from the company that wants to
buy the coins the landlord collected.

101
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,880
- Gold coins.
- You wanna be stupid, Leroy,...

102
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,880
-.. you don't need Fool for that.
- We got a plan for him, baby.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,680
Foolproof.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,080
Or you want your family
eatin' beans out in the street?

105
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,960
One day I'm gonna buy you
a Cadillac for each foot, Mama.

106
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,520
And you're gonna skate
around town lookin' so bad.

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,080
Just take care of the kids, Dexter.

108
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,200
You the man of the house now.

109
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm tryin', Mama.

110
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm tryin'.

111
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,520
You didn't lick this, did you?

112
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,440
No, ma'am.

113
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,720
Stand up.

114
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,040
I hope this fits. I worked all day.

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,440
Turn around. Stand still.

116
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,480
- Do you love your mother?
- Yes, ma'am.

117
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,120
"Yes, ma'am" what?

118
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,360
Yes, ma'am, I love you, Mother.

119
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,680
Good girl.

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,720
Where's your fork?

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,240
- Fork?
- I gave you a fork with this.

122
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,320
Where is your fork?

123
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,320
Well, it must have fallen... somewhere.

124
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
- On the floor, maybe.
- You don't know?

125
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,000
No, I'm sure it's on the floor.
I mean, I know I dropped it.

126
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,560
You know the punishment
for losing silverware.

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm sure it's right here.

128
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,440
I knew it was there.

129
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,760
Some niggers robbed the store.

130
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,560
Again? May they burn in hell.

131
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm very tense from this.

132
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,680
- You have one of your headaches?
- Ooh.

133
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm very, very tense about this.

134
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,680
Alice has been bad.

135
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
She's been feeding that thing
between the walls again.

136
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,280
- No...

137
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Remember not to bruise her face.

138
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Bad girls... burn in hell.

139
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,600
There.

140
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,520
- Jesus. It goes on forever.
- No bars on the windows.

141
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,080
No car in the driveway.
Maybe we lucked out. Where's Fool?

142
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,680
He's goin' in. Takin' it cool.

143
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,840
May I help you?

144
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,920
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'd like to show
you some of these cookies we're selling.

145
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,160
I'm sorry. We watch what we eat
very carefully here.

146
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,160
I know it's a bother,
but so is... cerebral palsy.

147
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,000
- And if we don't do all we can...
- I'm sorry.

148
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, do you have, like,
a bathroom I could use?

149
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,640
They leave us out here all day
without anywhere to take a leak.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,280
- Sorry. Run along.
- That's all right.

151
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,840
No. Run along.

152
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,600
That's OK.

153
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,360
Heavy wire screens on the back windows.

154
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,080
- They been hit before, you think?
- No, probably just the neighborhood.

155
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,480
- How are the screens held on?
- Padlocks on the outside.

156
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,800
Padlocks on the outside?
Jeez. What else?

157
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,040
- Any alarms?
- I don't know. She wouldn't let me in.

158
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,720
- I told you to tell her you gotta piss.
- She wasn't buyin' that.

159
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
- I wanna take a look.
- Don't be stupid, Spenser.

160
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,080
The kid told us all there was to see.

161
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,000
- We go in Sunday as planned.
- What if they got an alarm to the police?

162
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm not going in Sunday
without checking out the security.

163
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Just look at the doors... the basement,
maybe the connector boxes.

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,080
How the hell are you gonna get in? She
wouldn't even let him up on the porch.

165
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,320
You send a boy to do a man's job,
that's what you get.

166
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,200
Anyway, if you thought the Bear Scout
disguise was good, watch this.

167
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,000
- Help you?
- Gas company, ma'am.

168
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,520
Got an emergency. Got an emergency.
I need to check your meter.

169
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,000
You passed it on your way up the drive.

170
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh, that one we've already got. There's
one inside the house I need to check.

171
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,240
There's none in the house.
I'm quite sure of that.

172
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,360
You're probably not even aware of it,
ma'am, but it's on the list.

173
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,960
We got a leak on the block,
and it could be very dangerous.

174
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,440
Identification?

175
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,560
We do have a legal right to come in,
even if we do have to call the police.

176
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,160
Not that we ever have.

177
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,960
It's just there have been
a lot of robberies lately.

178
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,200
The neighborhood's changing.
It has us all a bit on edge.

179
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,320
I completely understand.

180
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,240
Better this little bother than
a chance of danger, though, right?

181
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
I don't know how he got past
that woman. She's got x-ray eyeballs.

182
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,560
Spenser's as slippery as a snake.

183
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,320
- I think he's up to somethin'.
- Somethin' like what?

184
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Like grabbin' that coin collection
for himself and cuttin' me out.

185
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,880
Cuttin' us out. Spenser mess with you,
he gotta deal with me, too.

186
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,440
You somethin', Fool.

187
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,920
- She leave him alone? You're kiddin'.
- There has to be someone else in there.

188
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
Old folks, kids or something.

189
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,000
Maybe Spenser should stick
his ugly head out and give us a signal.

190
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,120
Maybe he lookin' around a little bit,
to make sure it's safe.

191
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,400
Maybe the president is gonna
make me Secretary of Pussy.

192
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,840
Now, he's probably in there
hiding the best for himself.

193
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,120
Come on. We're goin' in.

194
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
Spenser said we gotta
stay out here, Leroy.

195
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,840
So he can get
all the good shit for himself?

196
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,720
Why not throw your mom out in
the street along with Ruby and the kids?

197
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,080
See?

198
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,760
They in Fort Knox or what?

199
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,800
Listen, Leroy. This breakin'
and enterin' might not be so smart.

200
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
I mean, it's the first day
of my 13th birthday.

201
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
- Could be unlucky.
- 13th birthday is unlucky anyway.

202
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,280
Too old to get tit, too young to get ass.
You're fucked either way.

203
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,520
Lord, now look at this.

204
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,160
The mother of all doors.

205
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,800
They ain't messin' around.

206
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,640
Spenser.

207
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
Spenser!

208
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Uh, so, Leroy,...

209
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,560
..you think I got what it takes
to be a doctor?

210
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,120
Doctor of burglary, maybe.

211
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,400
You're lucky
I'm teachin' you a trade, kid.

212
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,720
Ain't no door stands up to Leroy.

213
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
I done busted this house's cherry.

214
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,280
It's opened right up now.

215
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
Get off him!

216
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,040
Leroy!

217
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,080
Hey, fuzzball!
Your mother sleeps with cats!

218
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,920
Run, Fool!

219
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,760
That's one mean motherfucker.
You see that?

220
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,400
- He came at me like an airplane.
- I saw him all right.

221
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,160
He gone?

222
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,640
He's waitin' right there.

223
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Been trained to wait there, probably.

224
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,720
He'll stay out there,
and we stay right in here.

225
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
This place is weird.

226
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,240
"See no evil,
hear no evil, speak no evil. "

227
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,560
Every cabinet has a lock on it.

228
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
Why do you think they do that?

229
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,000
Somebody need a bath, bad.

230
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,360
Nice to see the rich folks got rats too.

231
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Listen, Leroy, let's just
get outta here. Out the front.

232
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,480
First we find out what's up
with good old Spenser.

233
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,160
Man, the hell with Spenser.
Let's get outta here.

234
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,560
The hell with those gold coins too, huh?

235
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,040
Maybe you're too stupid for this
kinda work, or maybe too chickenshit.

236
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,840
Oh, there's that bastard now.

237
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,480
He's upstairs.

238
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,920
We'll surprise him. Come on.

239
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,040
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin'.

240
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,200
I don't think
we should go up there, Leroy.

241
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Oh, that's fine, girlfriend.

242
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,960
I tell you what. You stay down here,
and you keep an eye out.

243
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
You think you can do that?

244
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,120
Yeah, I can do that.

245
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Man, there's enough room
for ten families in here.

246
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,280
Spenser!
Spenser, are you up here?

247
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,840
Spenser!

248
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Spenser, you back in there?

249
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,160
I ain't stupid.

250
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,000
"Or maybe you're just
too chickenshit for this kinda work. "

251
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
- Fool.

252
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,600
Spenser?

253
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,880
Spenser?

254
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,680
How can you say that of me?
I've never been unfaithful to you.

255
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,240
I'm not talking
about another woman, John.

256
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,640
- What's that supposed to mean?
- connect the dots, John.

257
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,720
Everyone else has. Ever since Paris.
Ever since Cybill killed herself

258
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,800
Cybill's death
was a sailing accident.

259
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,320
- That's what I am - a survivor.
- Tiffany!

260
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,800
I'm sorry, John. Sorry for the both of us.
Sorry for the child that... we never had.

261
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,240
- And never will!
- Tiffany, don't get...

262
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,560
Now the anti-aircraft battery!
They're firing.

263
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
- Where?
- I think it's the barracks.

264
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,480
They're over by the barracks.

265
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,000
We can hear the staccato firing, and now
here it comes. Baghdad is lighting up!

266
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,280
Tracers flaring up like... like
angry hornets from every rooftop now.

267
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,400
We cannot see the bombers, but the fire
of their munitions is shaking the city.

268
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,320
It's shaking our hotel. Oh, look! See it?

269
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,760
There! Right over there,
flying just over the rooftops.

270
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,000
Spenser, you back in there?

271
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
No!

272
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,400
Spenser!

273
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,400
You can't do that,
you miserable stinkin' thing!

274
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Come on, Spense.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

275
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,640
Man... this ain't right.

276
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,400
Who are you?

277
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,280
Leroy, we gotta get outta this place!

278
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,880
Hello? Miss?

279
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,200
Leroy. Leroy!

280
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,960
Leroy?

281
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,560
- Leroy?
- Jesus!

282
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,400
- You scared the shit outta me.
- I thought you were dead!

283
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,440
- You was just layin' there.
- A man ain't dead...

284
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
..just cos he's layin' on the floor.

285
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
I was listenin'. Something's in there.

286
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,280
As a matter of fact, why don't you
crawl in there and see what it is?

287
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,000
Turkey-brain! Are you hittin' on me
like I'm here to save your ass?

288
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,280
You're gonna stick your dumb head
in there and lose it, like Spenser!

289
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,760
- What kinda shit you talkin'?
- I'm talkin' we gotta get outta here.

290
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,360
The x-ray lady's back.
She's out back right now by the van.

291
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,840
She got a man with her
the size of Detroit!

292
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,680
Damn. You seen Spenser?

293
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,640
- I seen Spenser all right.
- He find anything?

294
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,720
Somethin' found him. He's dead, Leroy.

295
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,040
I think scared to death.

296
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,520
- You sure?
- You thought he was white before?

297
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,120
You should see that sucker now!

298
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,640
There is somebody in there.
The door's been pried.

299
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,480
- I told you there'd be another one.
- Out the front.

300
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,320
Wah!

301
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,320
Oh, shit!

302
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
Oh, my hand!

303
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,600
Pry it open at the bottom,
enough so Prince can get in.

304
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,680
- Come on, Fool!
- Agh! What are you doin'?

305
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,840
Stay here in the open
so the fuckin' dog can see you.

306
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,600
You think I'm crazy? He's got teeth
he ain't even used yet!

307
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,920
Do like I say,
or I'm gonna take your head off.

308
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,360
I'm gonna nail that sucker, don't worry.

309
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,120
- I'm worryin'.

310
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Kill him!

311
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,800
Uh-oh.

312
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,520
- Where'd he go?

313
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,640
Shit!

314
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,800
- Leroy!
- What the hell are you doin', Fool?!

315
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,720
Come on!

316
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,840
I'm gonna take your fuckin' head off!

317
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I heard him yell!
I heard him go down!

318
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,200
- I told you, don't mess with me.
- Man, that saved your body.

319
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,640
- Are these people crazy or what?
- You ask 'em!

320
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,200
Get in there, Daddy!
Get in there and get 'em!

321
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,120
Make it safe for Mommy!

322
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,800
Ow! Damn!

323
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,920
Little doggy baby! Someone is in here.

324
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,400
The people under the stairs
got the so-called gasman.

325
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,760
- The other one must be upstairs.
- Princey... Daddy'll get him.

326
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,920
That's a big-caliber automatic.
Did you ever see the holes they tear?

327
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,280
- We can hide under the bed.
- I ain't goin' in there, man.

328
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
No room. Find your own.

329
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,720
Aha!

330
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,600
Run, Fool!

331
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,960
Fool... Yee-ha!

332
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,120
Got him!

333
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,560
Oh, Daddy!

334
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,600
- See that? He came at me like a bull.
- Just like a bull!

335
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,160
A big one!

336
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,720
- Did you hear what he called me?
- He called you a fool.

337
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,440
He's the fool!

338
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,440
The only good fool's a dead one.

339
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,080
- Upstairs might be a mess.
- I don't want a mess. I better go look.

340
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,760
We might have to mop up a little.

341
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,920
Thought I heard something. Stay there.

342
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,360
Get back in the cellar, you little bastard.

343
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,080
You little animal shit!
I get the dog up here, you'll be sorry.

344
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,320
My... my name is Fool.

345
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,880
- What's yours?
- Alice.

346
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,960
Don't be scared. You...
you never seen a brother before?

347
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,760
- I never had a brother.
- No, I mean a black dude.

348
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,800
There's black folks
in the neighborhood.

349
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,160
Neighborhood?

350
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,400
The neighborhood.

351
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
You know, outside?

352
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,680
Well, that's outside, not in here.

353
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,440
So you get outside, don't you?

354
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,480
- Are... are you sayin' never?
- Can't get out. No one ever has.

355
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,120
Well... well, I'm gonna get out.

356
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,840
I'm a whole other thing.

357
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
People have tried.

358
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,320
You... you mean
the... the people in the cellar?

359
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,240
Who are they?

360
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,200
Mommy and Daddy looked a long time
to find the perfect boy child.

361
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,880
But each one they found turned out bad.

362
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,520
Some saw things
they weren't supposed to.

363
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,520
Others heard too much,
others talked back.

364
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,560
Daddy cut out the bad parts
and put the boys in the cellar,...

365
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,840
..one by one.

366
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,760
When they get flashlights
and food of some kind,...

367
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,240
..they're happy in their own way.

368
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,640
Yeah, right.

369
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
What about you?

370
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,160
How come they haven't
put you in the cellar?

371
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,800
I do not see, or hear, or speak evil.

372
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,200
It's the only way.

373
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,320
- What is that?
- What?

374
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,320
- That yellin'. What is that?
- Well, that's Roach.

375
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,120
- Roach?
- That's who Daddy's hunting.

376
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,840
See, Daddy hates Roach cos he got
out of the cellar and into the walls.

377
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,600
And Daddy can't find him.

378
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,480
- There must be another way out.
- Further into the house. Here.

379
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,000
Father's too big to follow,
and he's afraid of what's in there.

380
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,720
- I don't want in, I want out.
- Sometimes in is out.

381
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,000
Forget it.

382
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,720
I hear ya! I hear ya!

383
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,960
Yes.

384
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,720
- OK, I'll get in there.

385
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,360
I'm gonna get ya!

386
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,560
- Yes!

387
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I've got something for my Princey. Yes!

388
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,920
Come on. Come on. Come on.

389
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,360
Good appetite.

390
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,840
Healthy Prince... a secure home.

391
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,880
Stay.

392
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,880
The vehicle registration matches
that of a van used in a 211 last night.

393
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,000
Daddy. Police out back.

394
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,800
Damn.

395
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,480
Hey, police! Police!

396
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,280
Police! Police!

397
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,480
Hello. What can I do for you, gentlemen?

398
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,800
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Is this your van?

399
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,080
Goodness, no. It was just standing here
when we got back from shopping.

400
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,000
- Did you see anybody around?
- Trouble?

401
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,320
Well, as a matter of fact
we did see a couple of men -

402
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,280
one black, one white -

403
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,840
walking away as we approached.

404
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,120
We thought they were
service people of some sort.

405
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,040
- They were working on your door.
- No harm done.

406
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,800
- We'll check the house.
- Just checked it.

407
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,640
Even looked under the beds.
Clean as a whistle.

408
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,040
Well, let's recon the neighborhood.

409
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,360
- Do you get a lot of this?
- It's as if we're the prisoners,...

410
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,480
-.. and the criminals roam free.
- I know what you mean.

411
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,480
You're lucky. This van was used
in a liquor-store robbery last night.

412
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,680
- Oh, goodness.
- Liquor store?

413
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,160
I'd advise you to stay inside,
keep your doors locked for a while.

414
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,880
You can count on it.

415
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,840
Hope you catch 'em.

416
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,040
- Catch 'em in hell.
- Oh, my God.

417
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,000
- What?
- There's not just the two.

418
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,360
There's a boy.

419
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,880
He's in there right now...

420
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,280
..with our little angel!

421
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,800
God! What are they feedin' you?

422
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,080
What is it, boy?

423
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,600
You come in here
and I'm gonna kick your ass!

424
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,200
Gonna kill you!

425
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,480
Kill.

426
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,960
Kill them!

427
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,680
Is this your place?

428
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,240
- What hit you?
- The damn Bear Trooper.

429
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,080
But Prince is after him.
He'll kill him before he gets to Alice.

430
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,800
Let's do somethin'!

431
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,840
Do you hear something?

432
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,960
The boy's gotten to Alice.

433
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,960
Thanks.

434
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,960
He doesn't talk much, does he?

435
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,840
His... his tongue's cut out.

436
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,280
Oh, man!

437
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,720
My mother caught him trying to
call for help one day, and...

438
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,240
-.. Daddy had to teach him...
- Speak no evil, right?

439
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,520
Your father's one sick mother,
you know that?

440
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,640
Actually, your mother's
one sick mother, too.

441
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,760
Sh!

442
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,800
You're speaking evil. They'd kill you
if they heard a word you just said.

443
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,920
Roach. Roach is my friend.

444
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,000
Roach?

445
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,280
I'm Poindexter. Everybody calls me Fool.

446
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,000
Fool?

447
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,840
We sure got the names, huh?

448
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,360
Is this Leroy?

449
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,680
You did this? Why do you make these?

450
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,880
To hold the souls
of burglars when they died.

451
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,040
Or salesmen, workmen...
other people who saw too much.

452
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,800
There she is!

453
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,880
You viper in my bosom!

454
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,840
- You little Judas!
- What do I do with him, Mommy?

455
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,960
It is time to clean house!

456
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,480
Total spring-cleaning.

457
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,760
OK, let's move it!
Pull, you little piece of shit!

458
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,960
No, wait a minute!

459
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:30,120
I am sick and tired of your attitude!
You will do your chore now!

460
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,560
Clean it up, for God's sake!

461
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,480
What is a mother to do?

462
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,320
Lazy brat sits in her room
all day, sewing dolls!

463
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,360
Children misbehaving in the basement!

464
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,440
And one in the walls,...

465
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,600
..doing his business God knows where!

466
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,360
You kids'll be the death of me!

467
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,560
The death of me.

468
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,960
I keep 'em real hungry.

469
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,320
I ask a simple thing -

470
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,440
just clean up that awful man's blood -
and what do you do?

471
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,480
You get it all over your nice,
clean dress I worked so hard to make!

472
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,640
Now get in that tub and scrub yourself!

473
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,800
No!

474
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,360
Don't wanna get in, huh?
Well, let me help you!

475
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,400
You scrub yourself!

476
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,120
You scrub yourself! It's hot!

477
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,640
The fires of hell are hotter!

478
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,400
No! Don't put me in there!

479
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,800
No! No!

480
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,160
No!

481
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,520
Where's the Bear Trooper?

482
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,560
Dead meat.

483
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,120
I could've killed him, but I let
the people under the stairs do it.

484
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,560
Leave me alone!

485
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,560
Get away from me!

486
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,400
Roach.

487
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,920
It's right there, Roach.

488
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,680
I told you to keep quiet down there!
You're drivin' me nuts!

489
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,080
Pull it!

490
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,440
Guard 'em, Prince. Guard 'em.

491
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,960
Noisy bastards.

492
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,280
If I have to come down there,
you're gonna be sorry.

493
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,080
Roach, you're shot.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

494
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,120
The coin collection.

495
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,000
Leroy was right.

496
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,840
Thanks, Roach.

497
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,040
Alice is up there?

498
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,640
Roach!

499
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,400
Roach...

500
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,280
Get outta here! Go!

501
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,880
What did he do to you?
I told you never to talk to anybody!

502
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,320
You hear me? Come here! You answer me!

503
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,640
Did you tell him anything?

504
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,640
If you did, you know what I'll do.

505
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,440
I killed your skinny friend in the walls.
Now what do you think of that?

506
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,280
Oh, I got him good.
And the black one, too.

507
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,440
Shut the fuck up!

508
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,800
What the hell's wrong with him?

509
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,760
- He said he killed you.
- He exaggerated.

510
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,720
Come on!

511
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,960
Stay!

512
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,920
Move. If he finds us,
he'll shoot through the walls.

513
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,720
- My dress is stuck on something.
- Oh, great

514
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,360
Uh-oh. You gotta keep goin', Alice.
Come on.

515
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,720
Burn in hell for gettin' free,
and burn in hell for showin' the way!

516
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,880
Who turned on the heat?

517
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,960
Burn! Burn!

518
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,400
Burn in hell!

519
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,040
Burn!

520
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,800
Alice, he's comin' closer.
We gotta get outta here.

521
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,000
- Which way?
- Only Roach knew the way.

522
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,320
So we'll explore.

523
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,520
Gonna find you!

524
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,000
- I gotta sneeze.
- Gonna kill ya!

525
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,320
Sh! If he can't hear us, he can't shoot us.

526
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,240
- We gotta be careful.
- Real careful.

527
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,120
- Do you think you got him?
- We'll soon find out. Come on.

528
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,680
Come on. Kill. Kill. Kill.

529
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,440
Kill! Kill 'em, Prince. Kill 'em!

530
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,080
Kill 'em!

531
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,560
Sh! I just heard something.

532
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,880
Come on!

533
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,320
I'm not runnin' anymore.

534
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,640
Come on!

535
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,960
Alice!

536
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,520
Alice, get back!

537
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,640
Get away from the wall!
Get away from the wall!

538
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,440
Got ya.

539
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,160
Got ya!

540
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,600
Jesus.

541
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,800
I got him! I got him!

542
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,600
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I got him, I got him!

543
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,000
I got him, I got him, I got him!
I got him, I got him!

544
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,640
I got him, I got him, I got him!

545
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,080
Prove it.

546
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,840
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

547
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,800
There's light up there. Come on.

548
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,480
I know you're in there,
you little piece of shit.

549
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,960
- Oh, no!

550
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,240
Oh, shit.

551
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,240
You killed Prince!

552
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,280
Look. You can see
the lights of the ghetto from here.

553
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,520
I never thought
smog could smell so good.

554
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,920
- Help!
- Sh!

555
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,360
- We might have to climb down.
- There's nothing to hold on to.

556
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,320
It's just a straight drop off the roof.

557
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,520
- Wait a minute.
- What?

558
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,960
The water in the garden.
I think it's right under this window.

559
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,120
If we take a jump off the edge,
we might be able to hit it.

560
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,880
- I don't know how deep it is.
- I hear 'em!

561
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,360
- Alice, come on. We gotta jump!
- I can't! I'm afraid.

562
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,720
You upstairs, Alice?

563
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,560
- Alice!
- What's out there?

564
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,480
There he is!

565
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,080
What were you doin' with him? Come here.

566
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,240
Alice! Alice!

567
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,920
No! No! No! No!

568
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,400
Damn it.

569
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,320
I'll be back, Alice! Hang on!

570
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,280
Bastard!

571
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,800
Never shoot your gun outside!

572
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,560
- He got away.
- Come back inside.

573
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,280
Damn it.

574
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,160
Bad boy! Go on.

575
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,160
Go to your room and get into your suit.

576
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,920
If these had come from anybody else,
I'd make you take 'em straight back.

577
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,760
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

578
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,520
Well, figurin' the rarity of these,...

579
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,040
..you do have enough
to pay your rent for a while.

580
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,800
Say, to the year 2OOO.

581
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:52,040
- And Mama's operation?
- And your mama's operation.

582
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,000
Keep hold of these till tomorrow.

583
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,800
I'm gonna order
an ambulance for your mama.

584
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,680
Tomorrow we'll take those to
a good coin dealer, and we'll dll be smilin'.

585
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,400
Meanwhile, you be careful.

586
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,200
That brother-sister act you messed with
are evil, plain and simple.

587
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,120
Wait a minute. Brother and sister?

588
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,920
Brother and sister. Tail end of
the craziest family you ever heard of.

589
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,520
Every generation more insane
than the one before.

590
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,760
Started out as a family
runnin' a funeral home,...

591
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,760
..sellin' cheap coffins for expensive prices.

592
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,120
Then they got their fingers
into real estate,...

593
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,360
..started makin' a lot of money
takin' over people's homes.

594
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,880
The more money they got,
the greedier they got.

595
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,160
The greedier they got,
the crazier they got.

596
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,440
All sorts of rumors about
what's gone on in that place.

597
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,240
Never proved it because
the police didn't take it serious.

598
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,720
But believe me, when I was a kid,
none of us ever walked past that house.

599
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,840
You OK, Fool?

600
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:08,720
I was just tellin' Mama that
I did somethin' wrong. Real wrong.

601
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,800
And now I gotta do somethin' right.

602
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,160
I done the tarot cards on you again.

603
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:18,280
They come up real scary. Don't go
messin' with them people again.

604
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,680
Somebody has to.
And maybe that means me.

605
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,360
Anyway, I made a promise to Alice.
And I'm gonna keep it.

606
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,640
- 14th Precinct.
- Hello. Police?

607
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,120
Yes.

608
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,280
I'd like to report a case of child abuse.

609
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,960
- All right. When did this happen?
- Right now.

610
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,760
- Is this real or what?
- Bogus. The place is clean.

611
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,760
The people don't even have kids.
They have coffee, though.

612
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,240
I'm gonna go upstairs
and look around.

613
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,720
- More coffee?
- No, thank you. I've had plenty.

614
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:40,160
I'm so sorry you all had to come out
at such an hour for such a silly thing.

615
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,040
But, you know, it's better
there are a few false calls...

616
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,480
..if we can prevent
just one child from being abused.

617
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,040
- Mm-hm. Absolutely right.
- Cream and sugar?

618
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,920
Nice furniture. You didn't get that stuff
at Price Club, that's for sure.

619
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,880
- It's been in the family for years.
- Yeah?

620
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,000
Used to be the house
was used for, uh... business.

621
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,160
- No kidding?
- Sergeant?

622
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,680
There's something you might wanna see.

623
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,800
- What?
- Take a look.

624
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,360
- I thought you said you had no kids.
- Alice left us a long time ago.

625
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,280
The Lord saw fit to come and take her.

626
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,920
Never touched the room since.

627
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,920
We're foolish, I suppose, but...
in a sense, she still lives here.

628
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,080
- And always will.
- My apologies.

629
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,160
It must be very painful for you.

630
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,240
I'm sorry about this.
This should have never happened.

631
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,960
No need to apologize.
We wanna be helpful.

632
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,400
- Good night, sir.
- Thanks for the refreshments.

633
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,200
You're welcome.

634
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:30,440
I don't wanna see
another cop or cookie in my life!

635
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,440
I don't know which one makes me sicker.

636
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,920
May they burn in hell.

637
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,880
Forever and ever in hell.

638
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,280
- The shelf worked.
- Yup.

639
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,360
Always does. Simple works best.

640
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,640
Gotta get a new dog tomorrow.

641
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,720
A good big one.

642
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,680
I was worried. The police left
the back door open for so long.

643
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,080
- So?
- I couldn't watch it all the time.

644
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,640
- Think any of 'em got out?
- Nah. They were pretty out of it.

645
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,680
- What'd you use?
- Horse tranquilizers.

646
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,480
Tomorrow I'm gonna look
for the Bear Trooper.

647
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,960
- Where would you look?
- The ghetto.

648
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,680
I'll find him. And I'll kill him.

649
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,680
- Night, Mama.
- Night, Daddy.

650
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,760
- Say your prayers like a good boy.
- Oh! I forgot.

651
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,600
Now I lay me down to sleep,...

652
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,880
Now I lay me down to sleep,...

653
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,960
.. I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

654
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,200
If I should kill before I wake,...

655
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,840
.. I pray the Lord my soul to take.

656
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,760
.. I pray the Lord my soul to take.

657
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,000
Ah! You miserable little shit!

658
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,840
Shut up!

659
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,360
You hurt my baby!

660
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Get him! Get him!

661
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,600
- Get him! Get him!

662
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,240
"Downstairs door. "

663
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,840
- Did you get him?
- He's fast, damn it!

664
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,920
Open the kitchen.

665
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,760
Oh, shit!

666
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,520
What happened? Did he get out?

667
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,720
Oh! Burn in hell.

668
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,480
Burn in hell.

669
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,840
What about Alice?
What'll we do with her?

670
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,640
Let her hang up there all night.

671
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:54,560
- She's terrified of the attic.
- I know. It serves her right.

672
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,440
- Alice!
- Fool?

673
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,560
Are you OK?

674
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,040
Can you get any more of these bricks out?

675
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,600
- I can't. They've got me stuck.
- How?

676
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,920
I'm tied to a bolt in the chimney.

677
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,880
This one?

678
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,920
Yes.

679
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

680
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,040
Let's see if we can get
some more of these bricks out.

681
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,880
Sh! Get down!

682
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,960
Let me down, please.

683
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:26,040
Daddy! Come down from there
and help me to bed!

684
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,840
Daddy!

685
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,880
I said now!

686
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,960
He's gone. Fool?

687
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,040
Fool?

688
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,160
Meet me at the window.
You know the one.

689
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:53,400
OK.

690
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,640
- You find him, bring him back to me.
- I will!

691
01:14:57,080 --> 01:15:00,000
I'll take him under the stairs
and do him like the others.

692
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,040
- Only it won't be his ears I cut off.
- His balls!

693
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,320
Here, hold this.

694
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,840
Listen, Alice. They're not your real parents.

695
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,240
They're not even husband and wife.

696
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,160
They stole you, like they did
Roach and all the others.

697
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,080
They're a bunch of
rotten baby snatchers.

698
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,520
- You're just saying that.
- My grandfather Booker told me.

699
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,360
He wouldn't lie to me.

700
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,440
What do we do now?

701
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,480
Feel up to a little jump?

702
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,560
The problem is, first thing he did
when you escaped was drain it...

703
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,560
..and put broken glass and rocks
in the bottom.

704
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,240
That's a problem.

705
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,200
The way we came up before
he's got fixed now.

706
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,440
Look.

707
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,680
- This place is one big bomb.
- He's got 'em all over the house.

708
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,080
- Think you could climb the roof?
- What's up there?

709
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,680
The only way out.

710
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,480
- How dare he come into our home?
- He came back to get Alice!

711
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,440
- You should have let me kill her.
- You stay away from Alice!

712
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,800
- She did it with him, I know it.
- Not my little girl!

713
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,200
She's a whore!

714
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,120
What is that?

715
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,120
Oh, God!

716
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,160
- That hurts so bad!

717
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,440
See him?

718
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,480
I can't see shit!

719
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,440
Let me see the brick.

720
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,880
Hold it. I think I hear somethin'.

721
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,640
Bombs away.

722
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,360
- No!

723
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,960
- Argh!

724
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,000
I guess it was one of those smart bricks.

725
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,240
You bastard!

726
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Come on. You can do it.
Just brace yourself on the side.

727
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,040
This is it. Hang on.

728
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,800
The gun!

729
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,160
Ca-ca!

730
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,640
- Hold it. Do you know where we are?
- Uh-uh.

731
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,960
There's the living room.
Get out the back door.

732
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,400
- Fool, come with me.
- I'm not finished with them yet.

733
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,240
- Fool...
- Go!

734
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,520
I'm gonna get the shotgun,
set those kids free.

735
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,440
I... I will get them.

736
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,000
Sh!

737
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,080
Hold it right there!

738
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,520
Where is that little bastard? Tell me!

739
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,840
- Tell me!
- I... I won't tell you.

740
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,760
We will get him out of our house!

741
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,560
He's filthy! He's bad. He's awful!

742
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,760
Go to hell!

743
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,000
Eldon!

744
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,680
Oh, God! He's turned
my little girl against me!

745
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,040
I told you. Those two...

746
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,360
Then she can burn in hell.

747
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,760
Both of them.

748
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,720
She doesn't have a key. She's still in here!

749
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,920
- She's in the cellar.
- No way.

750
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,800
Then he is.

751
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,760
You know a prayer?

752
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,680
You say it.

753
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,880
Shoot her if you see her.

754
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,960
Come here!

755
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,960
See your friends?

756
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,760
- Get him?
- Oh, yeah.

757
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,560
Sh! It may be the police again. Hold on.

758
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,200
My name is Ruby. I represent the
Association of People Unjustly Evicted,...

759
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,320
-.. Exploited and Generally Fucked Over.
- What?

760
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,200
You and your brother are
landlords of over 5O buildings...

761
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,280
..which you allow
to deteriorate into hellholes...

762
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,120
..while you guys get rich
charging ridiculous rents!

763
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:24,160
Then you evict anyone when they can't
pay so you can tear down their homes.

764
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,760
- Ain't that about right?
- None of your goddamn business!

765
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,040
Kill the little bugger!

766
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,200
Kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

767
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,520
- What the hell is going on?!
- He's loose again! Damn it!

768
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,720
- Police! Open up!

769
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,640
Sh!

770
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,160
Police! We have reports of gunfire!

771
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,320
If you do not open this door,
we'll break it down!

772
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,800
- Get off my property!
- Just want to finish sayin' our piece.

773
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,360
Not only are you bad landlords
but, ten times worse,...

774
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,840
..you've stolen children from
our community for your own sick needs.

775
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,680
There's no community here.

776
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,800
All I see are a couple of n...

777
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,840
Ruby! We're right here.

778
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,240
We busted your ass, bitch!

779
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,160
What are you gonna do? Shoot us all?

780
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,960
- You'll do!
- No!

781
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,160
Damn! You knocked that bitch cold!

782
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:52,560
Look at her!
What they doin' to her in there?

783
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,680
Oh, shit.

784
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,280
I know you're in here.

785
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,400
You're not gettin' out.

786
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,280
Nobody gets out.

787
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,120
Nobody.

788
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,800
Fool!

789
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,160
Fool? That you?

790
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,080
Listen. There's a way out for you guys,
if you can get past the man.

791
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,760
The door to the outside cellar
got left open.

792
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,640
There you can get outside.
To the sun, to the birds.

793
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,320
To the women.

794
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,120
You wanna give me something?

795
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,680
A burglar alarm? No problem.
I've studied with the best.

796
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,600
I can use these wires to bridge it.

797
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,680
No wonder there's no money in the ghetto.

798
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,840
Fool?

799
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,560
Fool! Fool!

800
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,200
Uh-oh. Your mama's gone.

801
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,040
Oh, shit. Where did that crazy heifer go?

802
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,200
You guys see where she went?
Don't let her get away, you hear?

803
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,440
Wait a minute! Let us help you!

804
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,800
Please! Open the door!

805
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,920
We wanna help you!

806
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,520
System remote override.
All doors locked.

807
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,920
You know I wouldn't
let you get away that easy.

808
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,080
I see you.

809
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,440
And I see you, dearie.

810
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,560
You get back in there! Get back in there!

811
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,400
Don't you touch me!

812
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,440
Don't you touch me! No!

813
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,960
You hurt your mother.

814
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:39,520
You're not my mother.

815
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:42,960
You never were.

816
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,400
Then burn in hell!

817
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,280
Mommy!

818
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:25,360
I know what you're doin'.
You're countin' that money.

819
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:32,160
You're lettin' it roll through your fingers.
I've done it myself... a thousand times.

820
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,560
And I'll do it again.

821
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,200
But you won't!

822
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,400
Hey!

823
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,760
You shoot me and you die too, man.

824
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,600
And you better believe it.

825
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,160
Don't be crazy, now. There's enough
dynamite there to blow you sky-high.

826
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,680
Not the best place
to store it, in my opinion.

827
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,560
But there it was. Just put the gun down.

828
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,480
Put the gun down.

829
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,960
I don't wanna kill you, but I will,
cos I don't like you much anyway.

830
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:34,040
I'm tired of fuckin' around,
so either put the gun down now,...

831
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:37,840
..or kiss your ass goodbye, boy.

832
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,360
Oh, shit!

833
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,040
All right!

834
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,920
Fool?

835
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,280
Fool, are you OK?

836
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,680
I feel like a million dollars.

837
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,960
