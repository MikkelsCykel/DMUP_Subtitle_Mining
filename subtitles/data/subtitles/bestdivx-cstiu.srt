-Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
-Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,362
-10, 11, 12, 13!
-10, 11, 12, 13!

3
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,776
I love you, guys.

4
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,838
You're doing so good, Bella.

5
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,439
Bring your hands up through first,
and open.

6
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,544
How am I gonna learn if you're not here?

7
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,816
Just do what I did.
You can learn from the videos.

8
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,187
You learned from Mom.

9
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,523
The tapes help. Trust me.

10
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,902
Dad, I'm leaving.

11
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,243
She's going to
the American Ballet Academy.

12
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,574
I'm gonna miss you so much.

13
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,054
Me, too. I love you.

14
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,553
I love you, too.

15
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,824
Excuse me, which floor is the audition on?

16
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,098
Following pointe auditions,
we'll continue with adagio,

17
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,226
then we'll pair you for the pas de deux.

18
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,033
I'm gonna need you into two lines.
Boys in one, girls in the other,

19
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:10,872
starting with the tallest to the shortest
and remember who you're paired with.

20
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,578
At best, I can take six girls and six boys.

21
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,878
The final decisions
will be posted this afternoon.

22
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:24,753
We have very limited space
for a very limited number of students.

23
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:31,461
As you know, this is the finest
academy in the country. We value talent,

24
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,729
-discipline, respect...
-And a love of dance.

25
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,338
Also a good thing.

26
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:42,431
And on a very good day,
we even value Cooper Nielson.

27
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,410
Pease welcome one of our
esteemed judges and instructors.

28
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,037
You have 15 minutes to warm up.

29
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,984
A love of dance.
I was moved nearly to tears.

30
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,352
Hey, we're creating artists, not robots.

31
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,687
And besides, I'm here to bring some life
back in this place. Remember?

32
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,751
You're here because your company
ran out of funding and you needed the job.

33
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,990
Hey, it's a give and take situation.

34
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,160
So, nothing's changed, huh?
I give and you take and take and take.

35
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:49,438
First position. Demi-plie.

36
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,443
Tendu front.

37
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,571
Demi-plie. Tendu back.

38
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:58,208
Demi-plie. Tendu. Stay on your standing leg,
don't hang on the bar.

39
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,252
-Miss...
-Von Stroh.

40
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,651
-Richard's daughter?
-Yes, sir.

41
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,218
Nice port de bras. Watch your alignment.

42
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,229
-Miss?
-Parker. Kate Parker.

43
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,197
Billy's daughter.

44
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,798
Now the other side.

45
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,440
Classy.

46
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,504
-Kate Parker? How you doing?
-Good.

47
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,878
All right, you're gonna be dancing
here with Mr. Webb.

48
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,006
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

49
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,610
Okay, sorry. Let's stop.
One more time from the top.

50
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,620
Ready?

51
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,355
And five, six, seven, eight...

52
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,668
That is perfection.

53
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,765
Look at those legs.

54
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,835
One of the best dancers, I hear.

55
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,607
Really? What else you know about her?

56
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,474
Her?

57
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,782
Look at him.

58
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,787
Hey, nice form.

59
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,331
"Nice form"?

60
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,094
-What is she thinking?
-She's already a whale.

61
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,364
We have one last spot to fill for a girl.
Here are the top contenders.

62
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,538
Suzanne Von Stroh, Kate Parker, Lily Green.

63
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,206
I just don't think that Green
has the feet or the body.

64
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,750
Agreed. I vote to lose Parker, too.

65
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,252
-I disagree.
-Suzanne Von Stroh has perfect form.

66
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,386
Perfectly boring.

67
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,654
She's a classic prima ballerina.
I see a lot of potential there.

68
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,092
Yeah, potential funding.

69
00:09:57,163 --> 00:10:00,428
Well, unless we figure out a way
to turn this whole thing into a reality show,

70
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,161
academies need funding.
You should know that better than anyone.

71
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,137
The Parker girl's got something, Jonathan.
She's got passion.

72
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,034
-She's too raw.
-She'll refine her skills in the classroom.

73
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,305
She had plenty of time to refine her skills.

74
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,281
And she's going to need a scholarship.

75
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:22,586
Look, Suzanne has excellent technique
and she might be a superior dancer,

76
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,820
but how many Suzannes do we have here?

77
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,322
What'll she bring to the table?

78
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,488
How about Sleeping Beauty?
How about Swan Lake?

79
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,861
How about Giselle?

80
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:37,528
How about Twyla Tharp?
Bob Fosse? Jerome Robbins?

81
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,771
Can't we do something
that's from the last 50 years?

82
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,120
Tommy.

83
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,771
Excuse me, sorry.

84
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,445
Yes!

85
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,808
Hey, Bell.

86
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:06,187
Yep. Nailed it. Just like you said I would.

87
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,297
I'd like an application.

88
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,637
We're filled up for the semester.

89
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,576
We require at least one year
of formal training.

90
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,744
-I just need a chance to...
-I need a current resume,

91
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,873
three references and a DVD reel

92
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,444
including an adagio, pirouette exercises
and a classic variation.

93
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:10,012
You. Run towards me, take off on the left,
right leg in arabesque.

94
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,762
Well done. Suzanne, right?

95
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,033
Suzanne Von Stroh.

96
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,037
Okay. Listen up.

97
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,374
Dancing is not only about
focus, precision and perfection.

98
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,871
Dancing is about connections.

99
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,316
Connecting with your audience,
connecting with your partners.

100
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,752
So, over the next several classes,

101
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,588
you'll be dancing with different partners
until we find the right match,

102
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,627
one that has connection.

103
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,391
Not only a physical connection,
but also an emotional one.

104
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,159
All right? Okay, let's go. Pair off.

105
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,541
-Hi.
-Hey, what's up?

106
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,641
Mr. Nielson. I'm Kate Parker.

107
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,916
-I auditioned for you the other day.
-I remember.

108
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,185
I was hoping I could speak with you
about my audition.

109
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,751
Miss Parker, this is the best school
in the country.

110
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,657
-We're extremely selective.
-I know.

111
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,791
There are other schools.

112
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,962
But I've been dreaming of studying here
since I was a kid.

113
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,096
-I understand that.
-I'll work harder than anyone else.

114
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,040
I mean, if there's something I did
or something I screwed up, I'll fix it.

115
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,736
Miss Parker, I'm sorry.

116
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:45,383
I really am. To be honest with you,
I think you've got a lot of talent.

117
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,915
But there's nothing I can do.

118
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,457
Miss Parker. Tell me something.

119
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,690
Why do you think
you didn't get into this place?

120
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,236
Was it because you're not as good
as the other girls that auditioned?

121
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,068
Apparently I'm not.

122
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,309
If you really believe that,

123
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,608
then maybe you should go back
to wherever it is you came from.

124
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,450
Tough first day?

125
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,619
Oh, crap.

126
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,131
The Foundry?

127
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,224
I doubt it's your scene.

128
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,201
A girl like you.

129
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,635
A girl like me?

130
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,467
It's just different than this place. That's all.

131
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,537
-It's loud and sweaty.
-And that's your scene?

132
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,209
Yeah.

133
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,182
What's that look for?

134
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,594
Sorry I bugged you. I'll see you at class.

135
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,641
Where's my car?

136
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,032
Hey.

137
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,130
Hey!

138
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,732
I think you guys have got my car.
It's a '88 Jimmy.

139
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,172
-Michigan plates, right?
-Yeah.

140
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:59,148
-Three hundred bucks. Cash only.
-Three hundred bucks?

141
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,918
-You're kidding, right?
-Do I look like Eddie Murphy to you?

142
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:13,491
-Can I have a beer? Thank you very much.
-Here you go, Tommy.

143
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:19,690
Hey.

144
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,091
Hey.

145
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,466
-I'm Kate, by the way.
-I'm Tommy.

146
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,303
Let me guess. Cosmo.

147
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,037
Vodka tonic?

148
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,345
A ballerina who drinks beer?

149
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,518
That's awesome.
Can I get another one, please?

150
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,783
Sure.

151
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,316
Cheers!

152
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,384
-Wanna grab a seat?
-Yeah.

153
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,761
-This place is pretty dope, huh?
-It's not really my scene, remember?

154
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,937
Is that your girlfriend?

155
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,772
Lexi? No.

156
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,006
She's dating my buddy Sal.
He owns this place.

157
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,273
She seems to be
pretty interested in you right now.

158
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,513
I think they're just sizing you up.

159
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,645
See what you're all about.

160
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,813
Maybe I should show them.

161
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,223
Hey!

162
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,461
-Dance?
-Yeah!

163
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,087
You know her?

164
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,563
Apparently not.

165
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,525
-That was pretty sick.
-Thanks.

166
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,964
I don't think there are too many girls
at the Academy that can do that.

167
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,796
Yeah, well...

168
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,276
-Maybe that's why I didn't get in.
-For real?

169
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,744
I don't know what brought you here,
but I'm glad you came.

170
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,307
Kate, my buddy Sal.

171
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,387
So, where did you learn
how to dance like that?

172
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:07,585
I could use some of that energy
around here. Can you start tomorrow?

173
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,321
Seriously? Doing what?

174
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,891
We're a new club. You do it all.

175
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,956
-You in?
-Yeah, I'm in.

176
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,365
All right.

177
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,667
Be here at 6:00.

178
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:31,107
One, two, three, on her leg. Five, six,

179
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,309
seven, eight. Nice and sharp.

180
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,756
Two, three, four. Okay. Okay.

181
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,157
Allison. Switch with Suzanne.

182
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:45,589
-One more time from the top.
-Hey there.

183
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,861
Let's hustle. Six. Ready.

184
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,334
Seven, eight, and a one,

185
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,531
two, three.

186
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,840
-The second lift was really good.
-It was pretty good, huh?

187
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:05,014
Hey. You two get comfortable.
I'm gonna pair you together this semester.

188
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,711
-Nice.
-Tommy, come with me.

189
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,253
See you.

190
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,153
Why don't you try your solo for me?

191
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,351
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah? Give it a shot.

192
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,511
Okay. Stop. Stop. Not bad.

193
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:39,281
You know what?
Maybe it'll help if you just take a look at it.

194
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,477
Okay.

195
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,085
And.

196
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,506
Wow!

197
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,011
I can tell you one thing for sure,
it doesn't get any easier.

198
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,919
-No, man. That was amazing.
-All right. Thanks.

199
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,627
I know you haven't been dancing
as long as the other guys. That's fine.

200
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,356
I'm willing to put in the work.

201
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,057
-I know you are.
-Okay.

202
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:03,157
But to get to the top,
you're gonna have to find something

203
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,226
that you may not be able
to learn in the classroom.

204
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:09,763
-Like what?
-Like passion. Fire.

205
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,435
Fire?

206
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,407
You wanna be a guy
that brings the crowd to its feet.

207
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,845
Yes, I do.

208
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,411
How do I do that, exactly?

209
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,351
Look outside the box.

210
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:28,722
Find that special someone
or something that gets you excited,

211
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:32,763
-that truly inspires you.
-Like Suzanne?

212
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,601
Hey, if Suzanne's it, great.

213
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,965
She's a good dancer,
which is why I paired you together.

214
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,096
But?

215
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,640
But if she's not, get creative.

216
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,674
That's what an artist does.

217
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:53,841
And when you find it, make it your own.
All right?

218
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,261
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

219
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,199
-Hey.
-Hey.

220
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,972
Do you want something?

221
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,808
Actually, I've got a favor to ask you.

222
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,274
You got me a job and now I owe you favors?

223
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,475
No.

224
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,419
I've seen you move
and I was hoping for some help.

225
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,753
You've seen me move?
What kind of help do you need?

226
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,325
I need help with pas de deux.

227
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,326
-Pas de deux?
-Yeah. Couples dancing.

228
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:44,266
I know what pas de deux is. I'm not dumb.

229
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,430
Okay, well, I suck at it and I need some help.

230
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,237
-Well, that's why you're at the ABA.
-Yeah, I know.

231
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,906
They'll give me steps,
but they can't give me what I really need.

232
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,275
And what do you really need?

233
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,084
-Fire.
-What?

234
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,355
My instructor told me to find fire.

235
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:09,689
What? And I look like two sticks
you can rub together?

236
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,023
Kind of.

237
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,997
-Good luck with that one.
-Forget I asked.

238
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,072
Hey, Tommy. If you still need my help,
I need some extra cash.

239
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,838
-Okay. Where?
-What about here?

240
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:07,812
-It's got to be off campus.
-I have keys to the club.

241
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,714
I don't know about the club either.

242
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,622
Well, that's about all I got.

243
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,362
No wait, hold up. The club will work.

244
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,158
-Hey.
-Hey.

245
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,395
-What's up?
-Not much. Just trying to warm up.

246
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,974
-Are you all stretched? And ready to go?
-Yeah. Good to go.

247
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,111
Liar. Okay.

248
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,742
Let's see what you got.

249
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,584
Wait, wait, wait.
Keep your hands here, on my waist.

250
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,292
Almost. Let's try that again.

251
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:55,122
Better. How did you get into this anyway?
You don't really strike me as a dancer.

252
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,092
They taught us ballet at hockey camp.

253
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,502
Helps strengthen our ankles
and work on balance.

254
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,734
So, you're a hockey player.

255
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,574
-All-State, two years in a row.
-And now you're a ballerina.

256
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:11,775
-It's "ballerano."
-Okay, let's try a lift.

257
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,284
One, two, three.

258
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:18,822
Yeah. So, after my third concussion,
I figured I'd try something else.

259
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,949
And badminton never came up?

260
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,959
An instructor pulled me aside
and promised me

261
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:26,155
hot girls wrapping their legs and arms
around me.

262
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,595
Look, if that's what you're here for,
go find somebody else.

263
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,928
-I'm not here to screw around.
-Okay, I'm glad we settled that.

264
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,977
And what about you?
You don't seem like the typical ballerina.

265
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,378
I don't puke after every meal

266
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,611
and have a giant stick up my ass,
if that's what you mean.

267
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,981
But full of grace.

268
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,750
-That was better.
-A little.

269
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,336
Okay, we have got to get serious here.

270
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,575
Dancing is about trust. And connecting.

271
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:24,773
Okay. We can connect any way you want.

272
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,752
Calm down. Let's try some different music.

273
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,346
You've got to get out of your head.

274
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,755
Stop thinking and just try to feel it.

275
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,365
All right.

276
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,460
Close your eyes.

277
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,620
-Hey, Sal.
-What's up, guys?

278
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:23,462
Just thought you might want to grab a beer
or shoot the shit.

279
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,942
It's perfect.

280
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,403
Thank you. That's all for today. Nice work.

281
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,933
Tommy. Suzanne.

282
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,309
I don't know what you've been doing,
but you look good.

283
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,782
-Really good.
-Thank you.

284
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,251
I think I'm gonna talk to Jonathan
about the two of you.

285
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,619
See if he can recommend you
to Monica Strauss for The Glass Slipper,

286
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,555
Great. Thanks.

287
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,792
-Yes!
-That's awesome.

288
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,295
What's The Glass Slipper?

289
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,959
Tommy, Monica Strauss is the cutting edge
ballet producer right now.

290
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,627
And she's an ABA alum.

291
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,933
She's doing The Glass Slipper
for Broadway.

292
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:13,033
It's kind of a reinvention of Cinderella,
This is huge. Oh my God!

293
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,306
We've got to celebrate.
I'll take us to China Grill and we can have...

294
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,938
I haven't had Chinese food in forever and...

295
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,711
Actually, I can't. I already have plans.

296
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,309
Well.

297
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,612
Aren't you the busy one?

298
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,023
Can I get a rain check?

299
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,559
Definitely.

300
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,824
Hey, what's up?

301
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,158
We should go out tonight.
Find out where Tommy's going.

302
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,805
This place is pretty nice.

303
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,280
Whatever! I watched that game.
You didn't even play.

304
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,053
-Tommy.
-Suzanne. Hi.

305
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,217
Hi.

306
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,685
What are you guys doing here?

307
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,160
We make it downtown every once in a while.

308
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,966
So, how about some drinks?

309
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,368
Drinks. Yeah, definitely. Come on.

310
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,005
So, what can I get you guys?

311
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,841
-I'll have a Cosmo.
-Make that two.

312
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,381
Vodka tonic.

313
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,874
Should have guessed.

314
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,547
Can I get two Cosmos
and a vodka tonic, please?

315
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,986
You got it.

316
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,185
Who's that? Your fan club?

317
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,794
She looks familiar.

318
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:46,896
No way.

319
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,797
Hey.

320
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,403
You were at the ABA auditions, weren't you?

321
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:59,813
I haven't seen you in class, though.
I guess it wasn't a good fit, huh?

322
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:04,077
Well, at least you have this to fall back on.

323
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,380
Here's your drinks, ladies.

324
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,387
-Here you go.
-Cheers!

325
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,688
Thanks, Tommy.

326
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,559
What are you doing?

327
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,389
Dance with me.

328
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,172
That's awesome. See you later.

329
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,764
Oh, no, no, no.

330
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,823
Can I help?

331
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,100
Don't you have curfew?

332
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,762
You're such a rebel.

333
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,272
You want to grab dinner tomorrow night?

334
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,480
I'm working.

335
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,339
Okay, lunch.

336
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:56,779
-Working.
-Okay, now you're just lying.

337
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,754
This place doesn't even open till 8:00.

338
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,259
Actually, I got another gig.
A catering job with Lexi.

339
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,623
Okay, well, when's your next night off?

340
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,424
Everybody takes a night off.

341
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,138
Cooper says I'm improving.

342
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,732
-You are.
-Thanks to you.

343
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,735
Now I just have to convince them
I'm good enough

344
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,870
to be recommended to Monica Strauss.

345
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:23,936
What?

346
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,948
You know all The Glass Slipper
posters around town?

347
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,246
Monica's casting that show.

348
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,359
I think you need to lower your shoulders
and lift your chest.

349
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,623
-Really?
-Yeah.

350
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,694
Try it like that.

351
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,828
One compliment and now you're the expert?

352
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:50,431
Last I checked,
neither of us fell into that category.

353
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,470
Yeah, but you hired me. I didn't hire you.

354
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,240
Maybe you should.

355
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,548
All right, Baryshnikov.
Let's get back to reality.

356
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,245
I'll show you Baryshnikov. Come on.

357
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,119
You did it again.

358
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,616
Did what?

359
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,391
If you're gonna audition for next semester,
you could use a little extra practice.

360
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,665
I think once was enough. Again.

361
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,899
-Are you kidding me?
-Again.

362
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,674
One rejection and you're gonna quit?

363
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,711
I've had plenty more than one,
thank you very much.

364
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,581
Okay, but you realize
that's what this business is about.

365
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,451
Rejection after rejection after rejection.

366
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,185
Thanks for the tip.

367
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,183
You're welcome.

368
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:48,923
If you don't have thick skin
and serious drive, you can just give up now.

369
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,966
Serious drive?

370
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,639
You woke up one morning
and decided to be a dancer

371
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,903
and six months later,
you're at the best school in the country.

372
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:05,246
You have no idea what it's like
to work your entire life for something,

373
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,285
and then have no control
over whether you get it or not.

374
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,513
What are you talking about?

375
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,719
Do you know how long I played hockey?

376
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,088
Do you know how many times I got
smashed into the boards,

377
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,252
hoping some scout might find me?

378
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,558
Yeah. And you walked away.

379
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,724
I didn't walk away. I made a choice.

380
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,667
I didn't let somebody else make it for me.

381
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,669
What do you care, anyway?

382
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,867
Because you're good. You're so good.

383
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,607
You know,

384
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,645
I thought I was good.

385
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:48,185
I was so sure I just had that
thing that everyone always talks about.

386
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,894
So I packed my bags, came to New York
and I gave it everything I had.

387
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,228
And guess what?

388
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,666
No one else sees it.

389
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,705
My father didn't see it.

390
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,149
Jonathan Reeves doesn't see it.

391
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:17,387
If no one else sees it,

392
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:23,117
you got to think, maybe it's just not there.

393
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,267
Hey.

394
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,663
Why don't you take tonight off?

395
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,831
What?

396
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,440
We can get by without you for a night.

397
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,000
You work too hard.

398
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,808
I work too hard? What kind of crap is that?

399
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,939
Hey.

400
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,116
I just thought you could use a night off.

401
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,812
-Sal, if there's something I did or some...
-Kate!

402
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,014
Put down the glass

403
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,989
and come back tomorrow.

404
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,823
-Fine.
-All right.

405
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,892
Hey.

406
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,032
Hey.

407
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,472
So, are you free for dinner?

408
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,313
What did you tell Sal?

409
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:23,044
I told him an ambush was my only hope
of taking you out.

410
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,950
Can I at least go home and change first?

411
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,927
-Yeah. Of course. Come on.
-Okay.

412
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,739
-Reservation for two under Anderson.
-Right this way.

413
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,342
So, what are you gonna get?

414
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,414
Fettuccine's pretty banging.

415
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,487
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?

416
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:07,230
Yeah, actually. I have a little sister who's 13.

417
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,428
Is she as cute as you?

418
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,202
She's way cuter than me.

419
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,605
That's hard to believe.

420
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,775
What about you? Do you have any siblings?

421
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,504
Yeah. I have a little brother.

422
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:25,412
-Really? Does he dance?
-No. He's a hockey player.

423
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,941
Do you want him to dance?

424
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:31,220
Not really.

425
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,482
Why?

426
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,582
I don't know. It was kind of difficult for me,

427
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:39,993
turning from a hockey player
to a ballet dancer who wears tights.

428
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:44,423
Yeah, but that's what you love.
I mean, if you really love it,

429
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,436
you shouldn't care what other people think.

430
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:48,732
You're right.

431
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,068
I bet your hockey friends
loved it when you started dancing.

432
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,703
-I don't know.
-Come on, all those big macho guys.

433
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,441
They'd give you crap if you did
anything in tights.

434
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,176
I guess I'm lucky.

435
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,216
Have they ever seen you perform?

436
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,344
No.

437
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,990
Well, they should. I mean, you're really...

438
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,419
I'm really what?

439
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,009
-You're all right.
-All right?

440
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,376
-You're not so bad yourself.
-Really?

441
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,217
Yeah, you know,
for a girl with no formal training.

442
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,313
Hey!

443
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,518
It's okay. You've got something better.

444
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,687
-What's that?
-Fire.

445
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,890
Not that again.

446
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:50,695
Yeah, you know,
like two sticks I wanna rub together.

447
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,995
Shut up.

448
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,461
What are you doing? Tommy?

449
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,037
Just close your eyes.

450
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,475
Close your eyes!

451
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,956
-That looks good.
-It does, huh?

452
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,459
-Are you gonna give me some?
-No.

453
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,435
Is that your sister?

454
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,937
-Yeah, it's Bella.
-She must miss you.

455
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,343
I miss her.

456
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,006
I bet she's proud of you.

457
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,278
I haven't really done
anything to be proud of.

458
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,987
What do you mean?

459
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,090
Well, I mean, all I wanted to do
by coming out here was

460
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,155
to show her she could do
anything she wants.

461
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,966
And I couldn't do it.

462
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,496
Just trying is all she needs to see.

463
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,406
Look, I got to get back to the dorm.

464
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,779
Hey, Bell, it's me.

465
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,981
How are you?

466
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,178
I miss you, too.

467
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:47,665
-Hey.
-Hey.

468
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,871
It's nice weather, huh?

469
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,930
It's freezing.

470
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,203
-Let's get some lunch.
-Okay.

471
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,575
So I was thinking.

472
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,108
You were right.

473
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,642
I do need some help.

474
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,050
So, does this mean you're reapplying?

475
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,679
That's awesome.

476
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,525
Seven, eight. And a one, and a two,

477
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:13,290
and a three, four, five, six,

478
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,799
seven, eight, lift. One, two.

479
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:22,635
Stay on your foot.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

480
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:26,036
-What is this? Payback?
-I'm just getting started.

481
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,909
Other side. Six, seven, eight.

482
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,917
And a one, two, three, four, five, six...

483
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,992
All right, let's begin.

484
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,794
-Okay.
-First position.

485
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,624
Demi-plie.

486
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,428
And grand plie.

487
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,464
And straighten. You've got to
straighten the back of your legs.

488
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,404
They are straight.

489
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:58,964
Try it again.

490
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,172
Hey.

491
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:29,832
Oh, shit!

492
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,039
Prepare. Seven, eight.

493
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:41,982
And one, two, three.
Keep reaching with the toes.

494
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:43,843
Good.

495
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,879
Six, reach, seven, eight and one,

496
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,619
and lift.

497
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,695
Tommy, take your place, please. Quickly.

498
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:04,800
Let's go again, from the top.

499
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:09,004
Seven and eight and one,

500
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,775
two, three. Nice.

501
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,011
Tommy and Suzanne,
you're a second behind.

502
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,483
And reach.

503
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,317
Nice. And lift.

504
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,686
Oh, fuck.

505
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,819
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

506
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,452
Rest.

507
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,857
What happened?

508
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,028
I don't know. My arm slipped and...

509
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,731
Just make sure that
you keep your center strong.

510
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,002
Okay, people, one more time
from the top. Quickly.

511
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:45,773
And seven and eight. And reach, two, three.

512
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,313
Sorry again.
I guess my arm wasn't positioned properly.

513
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,719
Your arm? Give me a break, Tommy.

514
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:56,288
-Excuse me?
-Do I look stupid to you?

515
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,721
-Suzanne, my arm slipped. It happens.
-It's hardly the problem.

516
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,491
There's a reason we have curfew.

517
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,657
-What are you talking...
-This is my career, okay?

518
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,725
So I don't give a shit what you're doing
until all hours of the night,

519
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,363
until it affects my chances
of getting what I want.

520
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,168
-This has nothing to do with you and me.
-It doesn't?

521
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,230
No.

522
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,901
We are partners, for better or worse.

523
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,741
So you screw up,
then you make me look bad.

524
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,840
And I will not let you blow my shot
for some late night partying.

525
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,055
What's up, ladies?

526
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,222
Tommy, Mr. Reeves would like
to see you in his office.

527
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,856
Mr. Anderson.

528
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,569
How are classes going?

529
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,665
Pretty good, sir. Thank you.

530
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:23,270
Cooper tells me you and Suzanne Von Stroh
are working very well together.

531
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,444
That's good to hear.

532
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,575
That is very good for you.

533
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,279
What do you mean?

534
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:37,254
Suzanne Von Stroh's family
is extremely powerful.

535
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,120
Her father singlehandedly supports
a substantial portion of this academy.

536
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:43,256
Really?

537
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,234
And she enjoys
dancing with you very much.

538
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,770
-That's mutual.
-Good.

539
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,773
Because I think the two of you
could go very far together.

540
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,468
Thank you.

541
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,034
You're welcome. So don't blow it.

542
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,642
Sir?

543
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,945
Which part of "don't blow it"
didn't you understand?

544
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:10,481
Tommy, I want to see you succeed here.

545
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,893
But you got to stay focused.
No distractions.

546
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,864
I understand.

547
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,026
Good.

548
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,173
Thank you. Next, please.

549
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,347
That's Monica Strauss.

550
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,690
Tommy Anderson and Suzanne Von Stroh.

551
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,807
-You were really strong in there.
-Thanks.

552
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:04,146
Hey, listen.
My father's hosting a function tomorrow

553
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,478
and a lot of his friends
from the arts community will be there.

554
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:08,449
Cool. Have a good time.

555
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:12,318
Actually, I was hoping
you might wanna come.

556
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,853
Tomorrow... I don't know if I can.

557
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,121
Monica Strauss will be there.

558
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:22,653
I'm sorry.
I let it slip that you've been coming in late,

559
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:27,692
but you have a lot of potential
and I just don't want to see you blow it.

560
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,030
Let me make it up to you.

561
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,131
-You don't have to...
-Tommy,

562
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,768
you know how hard this business is.
I'm just...

563
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:37,836
I'm giving you an opportunity
to make it easier.

564
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,882
Besides, it'll be fun.

565
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:45,583
-What time does it start?
-My daddy's driver will pick us up at 6:00.

566
00:58:56,966 --> 00:59:00,424
I wish we could just go back to bed
and sleep all day.

567
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,929
I can't. I told Lexi I'd cover for her.

568
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,036
Plus, you have that school thing, anyway.

569
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,975
Yeah. I know.

570
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,276
They weren't lying.
That place owns you 24/7.

571
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,156
What's this thing for, anyway?

572
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,523
Just another rich guy
trying to impress his friends.

573
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,496
-Daddy.
-Darling.

574
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,868
This is Thomas Anderson.
He's my partner at the Academy.

575
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,999
Tommy, please. Nice to meet you, sir.
Thank you for having me.

576
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,201
Thank you, young man.

577
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,712
Suzanne tells me she couldn't have asked
for a better partner.

578
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,078
I feel the same way, sir.

579
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,962
-Hello.
-Monica.

580
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,260
Tommy and Suzanne are quite the pair.

581
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,302
Very promising. Perhaps they'll show you
what they've been doing.

582
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,666
I insist.

583
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,803
Of course, Daddy. I'll be right back.

584
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,179
So, are you a hockey fan?

585
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

586
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,957
it is my pleasure to introduce
my lovely daughter Suzanne

587
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,392
and her escort, Thomas Anderson.

588
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,057
They'll be dancing
Tchaikovsky's Black Swan Pas de Deux,

589
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,944
-What are you...
-It's okay. Just come on.

590
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,121
Tommy...

591
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,170
-Kate, stop.
-Something for school?

592
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,208
-Look, it's not what you think.
-What would I be thinking?

593
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,903
She's my dance partner.
Her family's well-connected.

594
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,242
She wanted me to come
so I could meet some important people.

595
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,679
-So you're using her.
-No.

596
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,807
Just like you've been using me.

597
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,115
Jesus, Kate, I'm not using you.

598
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:15,454
So, what? I'm dress rehearsal

599
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:18,153
-and she's opening night?
-Kate, please.

600
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,590
Save it, Tommy.

601
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:33,831
Hey.

602
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,043
-You okay?
-Yeah.

603
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,648
What's up with the crowd tonight?
We're dying here.

604
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:47,252
Sometimes you're on, sometimes not.

605
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,989
We're definitely not.

606
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:55,661
Hey. Remember that first night

607
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,757
when you came in
and got the crowd moving?

608
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,933
-Yeah.
-Would it kill you to do it again?

609
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,671
-It might.
-You can handle it. You're tough.

610
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,424
-What?
-That's what!

611
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:43,194
You really know
how to work a crowd. Cooper.

612
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,536
-We met before.
-I know who you are.

613
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:51,504
I'd like to see some of that energy
back at the Academy.

614
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,640
-I hear you're reapplying.
-Who told you that?

615
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,311
I have my sources. I think you should.

616
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,585
We'll see.

617
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,256
So. How are you with a partner?

618
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,893
I can hold my own.

619
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,293
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

620
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:09,561
Come on.

621
01:07:16,132 --> 01:07:18,066
Is that all you've got?

622
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,009
I'll speak to you outside.

623
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,357
You were right. The girl can get down.

624
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,424
Yeah.

625
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:28,493
Thanks for the heads-up.
Well worth the trip.

626
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,606
-What the hell was that?
-Dancing.

627
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,610
There's nothing going on
between me and Suzanne.

628
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,775
She kissed me in front of a roomful
of people, what could I have done?

629
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,876
So I guess now we're even.

630
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,614
Kate, why are you doing this?
We have something.

631
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,859
-Ready?
-Yeah.

632
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,563
Damn, you were hot in there,
and I see a lot of dance.

633
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,539
You really think so?

634
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:09,305
Of course, it might be those beautiful eyes.
Or that smile.

635
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:14,448
But yeah. It's also your dancing.
Tommy was right about you.

636
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,345
Tommy?

637
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,981
Yeah. He asked me to come down here
and check you out.

638
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:24,491
I'll be sure to thank him tomorrow.

639
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:28,320
You know,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

640
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:31,195
Sure it is.
I mean, if you're worried about this

641
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,293
-affecting your audition or something...
-No.

642
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,395
Look, it's just not right.

643
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,602
Okay.

644
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:48,379
I guess I'll see you tomorrow
at the audition, then.

645
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,495
Congratulations.

646
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,258
The four of you are here today
because Monica would like each of you

647
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:39,233
to audition tomorrow for The Glass Slipper,

648
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,173
There's absolutely no guarantee
that any of you will be hired.

649
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,108
However, you will have a private audition
before the open call.

650
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:52,580
And Cooper and I will make every free
moment we have until then available to you.

651
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:56,448
Make sure you get there
with plenty of time to warm up.

652
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,622
Right now, I've got to go and run
next semester's Academy auditions.

653
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:00,646
Right now, I've got to go and run
next semester's Academy auditions.

654
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:09,053
All right. All right, line up for lunges, ladies.
Come on, let's go.

655
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:14,500
-Looks like your friend's a no-show.
-Yeah. Looks like it.

656
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,631
-That's such a pretty scarf.
-Thank you.

657
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,833
So, you're friends with Monica, right?

658
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:23,275
I guess she didn't want it that bad after all.

659
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:24,676
-You ready?
-Yeah.

660
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:25,771
Hi.

661
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:28,844
-What was that all about?
-Nothing.

662
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,646
So, we should rehearse
for the auditions tomorrow.

663
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,777
-Does that sound good?
-Definitely.

664
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:33,788
Nice. And I was thinking
maybe we could go to dinner,

665
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:35,289
'cause you know, you gave me a rain check.

666
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,019
-Do you remember that?
-Yeah.

667
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:40,459
I know I said Chinese food,
but I really don't want Chinese food,

668
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:44,124
because it makes me bloated, but maybe
we should do the cafe across the street

669
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,362
from the Academy on 64th.
They have the best thin-crust pizza.

670
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,234
-I'll catch up with you in a minute.
-Okay. Well...

671
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,338
What about our rehearsal, Tommy?

672
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,744
Is your name Bella?

673
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:04,544
Yeah.

674
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,519
Are you looking for your sister?

675
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,016
-She dances here.
-Is her name Kate Parker?

676
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,194
Yeah.

677
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,858
I'm Tommy. I'm good friends with her.

678
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:21,027
We practice a lot together.

679
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:24,537
Is she here?

680
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:31,044
I don't think she has class today,
but I can help you find her.

681
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,822
What are you doing here?

682
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:19,188
She showed up at the Academy.
I told her you didn't have class today.

683
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,592
Thank you.

684
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,994
You should have called.
How did you get here?

685
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:27,399
-The bus. I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

686
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:33,032
Hey, do you want to check out
my new apartment?

687
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:39,345
Look, about the other night
with me and Cooper.

688
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,406
It's none of my business.

689
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,379
-Nothing happened.
-Nothing.

690
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,049
You don't believe me, do you?

691
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,952
No, I believe you.

692
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:55,656
Look, you should go in there.
She's been dying to see you.

693
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,727
Tommy.

694
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:04,335
I just wanted her to believe it could happen.

695
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:06,840
Yeah, but you got to believe it.

696
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:17,380
-So, do you dance here?
-Yeah, every night.

697
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,856
And there's really good music
and lots of lights and people and... Yeah.

698
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,033
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

699
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,139
Hey, does she have ID?

700
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,543
That's my sister, Bella.

701
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,242
Do I have to hire her, too?

702
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,080
It's just for the night
and then we're gonna go back home.

703
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,983
-Home?
-Detroit.

704
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,921
Has this got something to do
with that crap with Tommy?

705
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,090
It's about a lot of things.

706
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:26,318
-What's going on?
-We're leaving.

707
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,985
But I just got here.
And you said I could come stay with you.

708
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:32,549
Bella, please.

709
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:36,859
Let me just watch one class.
I promise I'll be quiet.

710
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,365
-I just want to see.
-You can't.

711
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,231
-Why not?
-Because I'm not taking classes.

712
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,343
I didn't get into the Academy.

713
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,417
I auditioned.

714
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:01,217
But I didn't get in.

715
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:06,094
Look, there's a bus to Detroit in two hours.

716
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:10,427
We're gonna be on it and I'm gonna
get my old job back and that'll be that.

717
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,933
Two hours? Tommy said you were gonna...

718
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:16,903
Look, Bella, I don't wanna hear it, okay?
Just pack your stuff.

719
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,042
-Cab's here.
-Do you have your shoes?

720
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,636
-Yep.
-Good boy.

721
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:29,976
-Where'd you get that?
-Tommy gave it to me.

722
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,479
He says it's an open call
and that you should go.

723
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,279
-Yeah, well, he's wrong.
-But you'd be perfect.

724
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,320
-No, I wouldn't.
-Why not?

725
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:47,122
Bell, do you have any idea how many people
are auditioning for this thing?

726
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,520
You're so good.

727
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,129
Back home in the parking lot, I'm good.

728
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,635
But this is just so different.

729
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:04,239
Would you stop looking at me like that?

730
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:16,089
Do you really think I can do this?

731
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:23,797
Excuse me, I'm here for the open call.

732
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,958
-Back of the line.
-Thank you.

733
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:57,031
-We're gonna miss our bus.
-There's another one tomorrow.

734
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,431
Well, look at you, smarty pants.

735
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,064
Tommy!

736
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:06,635
-Hey.
-Hey.

737
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:09,472
-What are you doing?
-Come on, come here.

738
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,273
Kate, Tommy's here.

739
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,739
Hey.

740
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:16,441
Hey.

741
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,285
You changed your mind?

742
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,393
-All right. Well, kill it.
-I will.

743
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,299
-See you later.
-See you.

744
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,774
Next 20. Girls only.

745
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,808
This is it.

746
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,285
I'm with her.

747
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:16,266
Thank you all for coming,

748
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:19,677
At present, we're looking to cast
Cinderella and her stepsisters,

749
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:23,548
My associate Nick Hoffman
will take you through the routines,

750
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,953
Hello, ladies. Follow me from the top.

751
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:32,460
Glissade, jete, glissade, jete, tombe,
coupe, pas de bourree, brise.

752
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,655
Got that? Here we go. Seven and...

753
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:41,498
Glissade, jete, glissade, jete, tombe,
coupe, pas de bourree, brise.

754
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,663
Let's go again. From fifth.

755
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:48,167
Glissade, jete...
Turn out that supporting leg.

756
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:51,371
Let's try it again. Six, seven and...

757
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:57,043
Glissade, jete, glissade, jete, tombe,
coupe, pas de bourree, brise.

758
01:20:57,786 --> 01:21:02,814
Good. Let's see it all together.
From the top, five, six, seven and...

759
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:08,329
Glissade, jete, glissade, jete, tombe,
coupe, pas de bourree, brise.

760
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,125
Good, switch lines.

761
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,598
Five, six, seven and...

762
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:20,403
Glissade... Come on, jump higher.
Come on! Up! Up! Good.

763
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:30,751
343, 91, 752, 288,
could you please step forward,

764
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:39,989
We see potential in each of you and would
like to see you back here this afternoon,

765
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,086
Don't forget to bring
a current picture and resume,

766
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:44,757
And plenty of energy. You'll need it.

767
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,309
39, flawless technique.

768
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:16,755
Number 39, Miss von Stroh,
please step forward,

769
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:25,802
It's nice to see you,
your resume is extremely impressive,

770
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:27,205
Thank you.

771
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,073
you've been taking dance class
since you were 3 years old,

772
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:33,444
My father saw potential,
so he put me in classes right away.

773
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:36,882
-And it shows, Thank you, Miss von Stroh,
-Thank you.

774
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,282
752, what's your name, please?

775
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,489
Kate. Kate Parker.

776
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:53,056
We seem to be missing your resume,
Miss Parker,

777
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,534
It's because I don't have one.

778
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:56,934
I'm sorry?

779
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,203
I don't have one.

780
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,339
I mean, I could give you
a separate sheet of paper

781
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,853
with my name and measurements on it,
but I figure you already have that.

782
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,286
What about your schooling? your teachers?

783
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:19,827
I haven't had any worth mentioning
since I was 1 2.

784
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:24,591
I just taped productions off TV
and mimicked what I saw.

785
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:31,537
I have one of you dancing Giselle,

786
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:36,209
And why is it
you never took formal classes?

787
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:40,578
My dad figured his money
was better spent on lottery tickets.

788
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:45,109
And that's why you started with the tapes,

789
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:47,416
You do what you got to do, you know?

790
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,885
-yeah, We do know,
-Thank you, Miss Parker, That's admirable,

791
01:23:56,598 --> 01:24:02,901
Okay, we need 825, 752, 758, 39,,,

792
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:12,176
Harris will be dancing
the pas de deux with Allison,

793
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,597
Thank you,

794
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:08,629
Thomas,

795
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,134
-Or is it Tommy?
-It's Tommy. Thank you.

796
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:16,104
I'd like to see you
with Suzanne von Stroh, please,

797
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,571
Let's see what they do.

798
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:46,977
We did it.

799
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,550
Hey. Kate.

800
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:54,721
I just wanted to tell you I really thought
that I deserved this part, but you are just...

801
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:56,620
-Suzanne.
-No, it's okay.

802
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,717
But you earned it.
You were beautiful. Good job.

803
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,855
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

804
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:07,027
Bella.

805
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:09,862
-Good job, man.
-Thanks, bro.

806
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:13,771
-What did you think?
-You were so good. I love the ending.

807
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,709
-Do you want to take my flowers?
-Yeah. They're so pretty.

808
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:22,739
-Mr. Reeves.
-You were excellent. Both of you.

809
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:24,751
Thank you, sir.

810
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:26,446
-Tommy.
-Hey, man.

811
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:30,282
I remember you auditioned for me,
Miss Parker.

812
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:32,451
I did. Last semester.

813
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,793
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
We could have learned a lot from each other.

814
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:38,263
Thank you, Mr. Reeves.

815
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:41,665
Next time someone like me tells you
you're not what they're looking for,

816
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:44,933
remember this moment.
'Cause whatever you had to do

817
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:50,342
to get through that and end up here
is exactly what it takes

818
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:53,044
to be great.

819
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,708
You should be very proud of yourself.

820
01:30:57,251 --> 01:31:00,220
I'd better go give your dad a call
and tell him he's already won the lottery.

821
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:05,683
-Good night.
-Bye.

822
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,123
I'm so proud of you.

823
01:31:09,123 --> 01:31:19,123
