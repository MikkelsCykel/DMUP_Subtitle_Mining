1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,300
- Shanghai's a mess, don't go there
- My mother's sick, I must

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,117
Mitsuko, please wait here

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,197
Do you have any rooms?

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,111
Of course, please come in

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,819
They have a room, come on

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,658
No Japanese allowed here!

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,997
She's my wife.
Please give us a room

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,331
- Isn't that Chen Zhen?
- Yes, of Jingwu Mun

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,472
He's a lecher and a traitor

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,119
You'd better leave! You're ruining
my business, please go!

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,078
Chen Zhen, we'd better go

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
GRAVE OF HUO YUEN-JIA

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,200
- What's wrong?
- A mouse!

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,793
A mouse! In there!

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,188
A mouse?

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,511
- Where is it?
- It was over there, honestly!

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,878
Well, it's gone now

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,271
You should expect to find mice here

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,633
But this one was horrible,
it really upset me

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,033
They were here first,
it's probably us who upset them

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,389
I suppose you're right

22
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,749
I feel bad,
making you live in a place like this

23
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,633
It's a wonderful place

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,229
The view is lovely,
it's much better than any hotel

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,352
I wish I could take you
to a place where nobody knows us

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,477
And give up Jingwu Mun?

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,357
Jingwu Mun has given me up

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,029
It was a heavy burden.
I feel much happier

29
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,117
That's not like you

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,635
Why?

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,429
You're lying to yourself.
You feel empty without Jingwu Mun

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,477
You can't live without it!

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,991
Chen Zhen's lying to himself.
Mitsuko knows him better than that

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,079
Do you?

35
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,598
Tea, Uncle Nong

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,574
Thank you.
Have you eaten yet?

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,513
I've lost my appetite

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,117
Ting isn't home yet?

39
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,310
It can't be easy from him.
He's never lost a fight before

40
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,428
And what's worse,
he lost to Chen Zhen

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,471
He's a man of his word.
He'll never act as Head Master

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,157
If he doesn't, who will?

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,990
No outsider can run Jingwu Mun

44
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,271
If Ting resigns,
who will inherit the school?

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,469
Who's been teaching the others?

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,478
Cheung and Biu

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,671
If we were challenged now,
what would happen?

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,951
I got a letter from my mother.
She says Jingwu Mun offended the...

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,191
...Japanese and I should go back home

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,589
And? Are you leaving?

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,189
I don't know what to do

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,075
Well, it's still British territory

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,952
The Japs have to behave

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,837
You Chinese,
always stuffing yourselves...

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,070
...like pigs

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,031
What is it?

57
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,071
I want to see your Head Master

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,558
Who are you to summon him?
Speak to me instead

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,390
The Head Master of our clan,
Master Funakoshi,

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,312
is challenging your Head Master

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,350
What shall we do?

62
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,518
- We must find Master Ting
- Or Chen Zhen

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,029
Let a traitor fight a Japanese?

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,790
- Stop saying that, do you hear?
- He is a traitor, isn't he?

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,600
Stop it.
Arguing won't solve the problem

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,638
You, go and find Master Ting

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,917
Uncle Gun

68
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,879
Cheung

69
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,232
- Where is Master Ting?
- How would I know?

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,032
What is it?

71
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,229
Stop acting! How's my son?

72
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,310
We'll talk about it later

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,989
You promised to release my son
if I poisoned Huo

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,910
It's not that easy

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,713
Your son's a convicted murderer.
They can't just let him go

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,952
But you promised me!

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,998
I promised nothing,
the Japanese did

78
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,429
His wife says that...

79
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,148
...my son was killed in jail long ago

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,829
It's too late to regret it now,
anyway

81
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,350
Besides, you did get $1000.
You had no qualms...

82
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,397
...about taking the money

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,309
And as the Japanese promised
to release your son,

84
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,397
you can relax

85
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,118
You said the drug wouldn't kill him

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,149
Had I known, I'd have chosen
to let my son die instead

87
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,633
Help!

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,720
Uncle Gun has killed himself!

89
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,992
Help me, quick!

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,679
We must take him down, quickly!

91
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,910
We found this under his bed

92
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,189
What is it?

93
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,353
It's crocodile jerky,
brought in by a friend of Ting

94
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,839
It's a drug, a cure for asthma

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,155
Hey!

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,791
Listen!
Only Master Huo ate it

97
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,628
So we can assume that Gun
used it to administer the poison...

98
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,517
...and committed suicide
out of remorse

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,749
The deed's been done.
Let's keep this to ourselves

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,633
It could damage
Jingwu Mun's reputation

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,793
Your school is already doomed

102
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,998
Chen Zhen left, Ting's disappeared

103
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,589
I'd say you should put your school
in order quickly

104
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,152
To think it's come to this

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,199
Master Huo's memory
deserves better

106
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,830
Captain, what are we to do now?

107
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,110
You're on duty today.
Why ask me?

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,789
Couldn't you help me, captain?

109
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,395
Take the stuff for analysis

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,035
Please help me find Ting

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,998
I will, don't worry

112
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,911
Are you looking for someone, miss?

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,953
May I ask if Master Nong is here?

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,750
Yes, he's in.
Please follow us

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,508
Uncle,
this lady's looking for you

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,675
Who are you, miss?

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,838
Ting is staying with me
and won't leave

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,029
- You are the only person he'll listen to
- Where do you live?

119
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,670
- The Dizzy Star
- The brothel?

120
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,311
How long have you known Ting?

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,029
Two years

122
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,750
He must've spent a fortune on you

123
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,389
It isn't like that

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,789
Don't take it wrong.
Ting isn't as bad as you think

125
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,110
He cares deeply about
the good of Jingwu Mun

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,192
He even hopes to honour his
father by enhancing its name

127
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,388
He really does

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,471
You must help him!

129
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,550
Help Master!

130
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,674
Let go of me, I want to fight!

131
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,999
Let me fight!

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,629
Master

133
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,390
Sing, Biu, let's go home

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,830
Why have you all come here?
Is anything wrong at Jingwu Mun?

135
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,399
The Nijiguchi have challenged us.
I came to discuss it with you

136
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,239
What about Chen Zhen?

137
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,229
Letting Chen Zhen fight will
damage our name

138
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,392
You are the Head Master

139
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,791
Forget him!
Let's go back

140
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,915
Wait!

141
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,519
I'm coming with you

142
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,188
Are you up to it?

143
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,708
Even if I lose, I won't let anyone
look down on Jingwu Mun

144
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,673
Wait, hold on

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,629
What about this lady?

146
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,508
Are you going to leave her here?

147
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,679
Have you no shame?

148
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,731
- Sing, find the madam
- Yes

149
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,231
I want you to release this lady

150
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,791
Xian-hong,
won't you miss your lovely clothes?

151
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,838
I'm so grateful
you let me dress like you

152
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,319
This one's too small.
We'll get your size tomorrow

153
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,589
I've checked it out

154
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,514
Funakoshi is the top warrior
of the Black Dragon Clan

155
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,931
But he's getting old,
so don't worry

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,530
Uncle Nong, Ting...

157
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,833
She looks really nice

158
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,948
From now on we'll use
your real name, So-Ian, alright?

159
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,232
I wish you'd treated Mitsuko
the same way

160
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,509
It's not the same.
She's Japanese

161
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,849
Ting, it's only ten days to
the challenge. You must train hard

162
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,473
- Thanks. Come on, Biu
- Coming!

163
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,597
You really care for Ting

164
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,309
I treat them all the same

165
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,471
Is Ting the best in Kung Fu?

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,475
Yes

167
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,079
And Chen Zhen?

168
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,270
He's good too.
They're about the same

169
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,439
Are you alright?

170
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,432
- Are you feeling OK?
- I'm fine

171
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,953
Let's get on with it

172
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,109
What's wrong with him?
His heart isn't in it

173
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,357
Master Funakoshi, I've challenged
Jingwu Mun on your behalf

174
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,974
Let's be clear about one thing:

175
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,470
Whatever Funakoshi does
and whoever he challenges...

176
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,719
...is not the military's business

177
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,719
Let me remind you that
the Black Dragon Clan in China...

178
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,469
...is financed and supported
by the military

179
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,313
It makes no difference

180
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,113
Feel free to withdraw your support

181
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,431
I wonder whether your chairman
would agree with you

182
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,518
Don't use Mr. Oshima
to put pressure on me

183
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,951
I'm a martial arts master

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,318
Not a politician

185
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,953
- Up so early?
- Good morning

186
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,599
Uncle!

187
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,070
Hello, Uncle!

188
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,392
Mitsuko, why did you choose
to live out here?

189
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,298
I should've hired a horse

190
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,595
Did my father send you?

191
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,677
I haven't seen your father for ages

192
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,031
So why did you come?

193
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,839
Because of him

194
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,719
Chen Zhen?

195
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,073
Are you two married?

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,628
No...

197
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,639
But you're living together?

198
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,669
Married or not, neither the Chinese
nor the Japanese will accept us

199
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,191
It's lucky you're not married

200
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,679
If he dies...
you won't be a widow

201
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,628
What did you say?

202
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,911
If you die, I promise
to return your ashes to Japan

203
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,796
Young man...
You're very confident

204
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,751
You're going to fight?
Why didn't you tell me?

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,594
Men don't need to tell
women everything

206
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,156
Come on, Chen Zhen

207
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,599
How do you prepare
your most powerful attack?

208
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,190
I focus all my body's energy
on one point and then strike

209
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,433
Yes, that was very powerful

210
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,670
But I've rarely seen a stone fight back.
Your opponents are moving human beings

211
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,600
Theories are easy.
Shall we try action?

212
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,992
What is the most powerful defence?

213
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,469
Attack!

214
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,433
Why waste time on defence
when you can attack?

215
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,710
Attack as fast as possible

216
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,868
So that's the Huo secret:

217
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,190
simply attack?

218
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,993
Don't you know the basic rule?

219
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,832
Attack alone is wasted energy,

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,053
defence alone cannot strike back.
One is useless without the other

221
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,577
What kind of master are you?

222
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,372
Your teacher failed to
teach you another rule:

223
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,869
Anger is the fighter's
greatest failing

224
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,430
That's how you lose your advantage,
young man

225
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,193
My master didn't talk so much.
Ready to fight?

226
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,989
Stop!

227
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,716
Wait!

228
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,957
At my age, I need to warm up

229
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,875
- What fist is this?
- Don't ask. If it wins, it's a good one

230
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,553
Are your eyes alright?

231
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,633
I'm fine

232
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,238
I won't take advantage

233
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,149
Enough!

234
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,189
Are you alright?

235
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,793
It must be a great burden
to be young and so talented

236
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,829
You have a young man's energy

237
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,873
You Chinese have a saying:

238
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,510
"All fists fear the strength
of youth"

239
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,716
It makes a lot of sense

240
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,990
But I've lost!

241
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,069
I adapted myself to your style

242
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,949
Chinese martial arts put
the emphasis on personal fitness,

243
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,036
not on winning the fight

244
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,634
Actually, I was taken aback
by your performance

245
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,991
The goal is to defeat the opponent

246
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,993
Listen, the best way...

247
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,991
...to beat your opponent...

248
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,198
...is to use a gun

249
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,799
The aim of martial arts

250
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,151
is to teach you to maximise your energy

251
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,630
And to achieve that, you must be...

252
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,520
...at one with life and the universe

253
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,752
I must be off.
Take care

254
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,678
You're ending the fight?

255
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,594
Fights are for animals

256
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,919
Our match ended in a draw

257
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,455
But I can't vouch
for all Japanese warriors

258
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,630
Some are far more powerful than me

259
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,952
Aren't you the best in Japan,
Uncle?

260
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,629
To say Master Funakoshi's
the best is to speak of his wisdom,

261
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,676
not his killing skills

262
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,858
Master Huo Yuen, you've won

263
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,889
I didn't expect you to
have such a good disciple

264
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
The best Nijiguchi warrior,

265
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,992
the one they call Fujita Gou,
the Killing Machine, is waiting

266
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,310
Take care, young man

267
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,313
Check!
I've won!

268
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,390
You've improved your skills
in Chinese chess

269
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,872
Too bad one can't control life
as easily...

270
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,713
...as pieces on a board.

271
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,031
Sun Yat Sen was a loyal friend

272
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,630
of the Black Dragon Clan.
But our society has changed

273
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,308
Just like the military

274
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,750
Both want to conquer China

275
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,557
Conquer China?

276
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,450
Those idiots in the military
are dreaming

277
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,596
But they're not

278
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,870
The Japanese army in China
is almost as big

279
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,350
as the entire country's force

280
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,191
Then Japan's like a strong ant

281
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,558
Determined to consume
a sleeping elephant

282
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,032
As long as the elephant is asleep,
the ant has some advantage

283
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,513
But once the elephant awakens,

284
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,199
the ant doesn't have a chance in hell

285
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,992
True, but I think

286
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,471
that the elephant is still asleep

287
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,119
And there's more than
one ant ogling it

288
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,158
But it will wake up!

289
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,352
No doubt.
Too bad that most Japanese

290
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,318
wouldn't agree with you

291
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,915
For the past decades...

292
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,350
...Japan has benefited greatly
from winning wars

293
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,271
There are too many people who see

294
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,631
Japan's future as a great empire

295
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,470
People like General Fujita

296
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,433
If this is true...

297
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,397
...then war is unavoidable!

298
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,996
Chen, you're back!

299
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,450
How are you?

300
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,838
- Can I see Chen Zhen?
- He's out...

301
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,999
Please sit down

302
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,508
Some tea, perhaps?

303
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,430
Thank you

304
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,309
So you can speak Chinese now?

305
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,875
Yes, a little

306
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,112
You speak very well

307
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,752
Chen, Mr. Huo's here to see you

308
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,148
What have you been doing
with yourself?

309
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,671
I got a job in the village

310
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,828
- So you've abandoned Jingwu Mun?
- That's irrelevant

311
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,113
I may not live in Jingwu Mun,

312
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,909
but I can still be of use to you

313
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,678
Jingwu Mun needs you to come back

314
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,750
Even Xian-hong is there with me

315
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,833
The one from The Dizzy Star?

316
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,238
You must meet her

317
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,849
Congratulations!

318
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,453
You can bring Mitsuko with you

319
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,351
They may have accepted Xian-hong,
but never Mitsuko

320
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,593
She's Japanese

321
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,752
She's done so much for you.
She's a nice girl

322
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,272
What would outsiders think?

323
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,552
If she stays in Jingwu Mun,
its reputation will suffer

324
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,717
I can't be so selfish

325
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,789
I've learned a new fist

326
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,693
- What is it?
- Let me show you

327
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,956
- It's like the Huo Fist
- Yes

328
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,270
It's the Huo Minchung Fist

329
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,851
The Master said
only a Huo could learn it

330
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,153
The Minchung Fist is only
one of many altered by my father

331
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,870
Chen, promise me

332
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,192
I fight at Nijiguchi tomorrow.
If anything happens to me,

333
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,473
Swear you'll teach this
style to the others

334
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,909
Forgive me,
but I've decided to go home

335
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,236
Some things in life...

336
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,478
...are more important than love

337
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,851
With me out of the way,
you will achieve far more

338
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,319
When the Japanese forces

339
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,054
leave China and return to Japan,
I'll be waiting for you in Kyoto

340
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,039
I want only Lun with me

341
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,916
Ting, I'm worried

342
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,918
Shouldn't you take more people?

343
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,831
The Japanese will think we're afraid
if there're too many of us

344
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,909
Right

345
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,429
Wait for me here

346
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,792
Xiao-wei,
please look after So-Ian

347
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,916
Let's go

348
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,629
Ting

349
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,830
I speak Japanese.
May I go with you?

350
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,070
Let's go

351
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,071
They're together,
now nothing can go wrong!

352
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,830
General, Master Funakoshi
left Shanghai early this morning

353
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,791
That stubborn old fool!

354
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,099
By refusing to cooperate,
he's become an enemy of the army

355
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,192
- Notify Tokyo
- Yes, sir!

356
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,716
Should we cancel the match
between Nijiguchi and Jingwu Mun?

357
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,993
No, we don't need
to rely on the Black Dragon

358
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,029
I'll take care of this match myself

359
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,195
Yes, sir!

360
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,270
Great! You're both here

361
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,411
Master Huo, I've good news for you.
I've found your father's murderer

362
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,269
Enter!

363
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,232
Your man here has been bribed

364
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,519
He poisoned the food that
killed your father

365
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,193
He's a traitor

366
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,993
Don't get excited.
Take the body out!

367
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,710
Let no one in till I say so

368
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,477
Fall out!

369
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,700
SICK MAN OF ASIA

370
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,509
If you lose, you get this sign which

371
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,557
I've written especially for you

372
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,715
Catch!

373
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,916
- Can you walk?
- Yes

374
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,229
Stop!

375
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,629
Halt!

376
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,977
General Fujita has been killed

377
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,957
Don't move or I shoot!

378
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,559
Don't move!

379
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,554
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine

380
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,470
You have jurisdiction on British territory
only. You have no authority here

381
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,832
We're not here as policemen.
We're Chinese

382
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,610
We demand you hand Chen Zhen
and Ting over to us

383
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,149
What? You think you can
just walk out of here?

384
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,793
Let's see who hits the floor first

385
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,909
Stop!

386
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,471
Both sides, hold your fire!

387
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,952
I believe we can settle this matter
without a bloodbath

388
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,672
This man doesn't deserve to have

389
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,958
any more lives sacrificed for him

390
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,668
- Lieutenant!
- Yes, sir!

391
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,192
Take your patrol and retreat

392
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,469
But...

393
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,518
I'm the highest authority here

394
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,874
- Are you disobeying my order?
- No, sir!

395
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,590
Attention! Fall out!

396
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,519
Captain Jie

397
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,191
A Japanese General has been killed

398
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,938
I must inform my government
of the murderer's identity

399
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,919
Or the military will never rest
until it's satisfied

400
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,714
So, me escaping

401
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,679
would be their excuse to start a war

402
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,192
Right. I'll sacrifice myself

403
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,791
Good man, you're a true hero!

404
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,989
- Open up!
- Let us in!

405
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Move Back!
There's nothing to see here!

406
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,000
Chen Zhen is dead!

407
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,500
By order
of Shanghai Municipal court

408
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,500
As of 28th October 1927,
Jingwu Mun will be closed down

409
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,094
Why do the British always let
the Japanese dictate everything?

410
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,593
They're in it together.
They join forces...

411
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,479
...to oppress us

412
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,600
All they do is oppress us!

413
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,790
Chen Zhen was a true hero

414
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,996
He thrashed all the Japanese
in the Nijiguchi School

415
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,955
It was fantastic!

416
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,916
Too bad he died so young

417
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,892
- What's wrong Uncle?
- Nothing, nothing. Let's keep talking...

418
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,831
It's hard to believe
Cheung was the traitor

419
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,099
At least in death,
he acted as Chen Zhen's corpse

420
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,239
- Chen Zhen, where to now?
- Which province has Japan taken?

421
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,431
- Tungshan
- Tungshan then!

422
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:40,355
Jingwu Mun did not vanish afterwards

423
00:47:40,455 --> 00:47:43,591
Besides within the Chinese provinces,

424
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:47,500
Jingwu Mun even expanded to the Nang Yeung area
