1
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,105
Excuse me, but aren't you Sarah Morton?

2
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,684
It is you. I recognize you.

3
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:39,247
Look, I'm reading your latest novel.

4
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,520
I love it.

5
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,927
I'm a big fan of Inspector
Dorwell. I've read all your books-

6
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,092
You must have mistaken
me with someone else.

7
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,035
I'm not the person you
think I am. Excuse me.

8
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,889
Excuse me. Good morning.
What would you like?

9
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,896
Whiskey, please. Ice?

10
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:18,955
Yes.

11
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,063
Yeah! And after that
in all the directories.

12
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:30,871
And we will renew, most definitely,
that shouldn't be a problem.

13
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,174
Just a minute. Hello,
Sarah. How are you?

14
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,409
Could be better. Is John in?
Yes, but he's in a meeting.

15
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,643
Who with?

16
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,346
Terry Long. Who?

17
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,292
Yeah. I'm in the process of drawing up the
contract now and it should be with you shortly.

18
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,627
Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.

19
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,031
Now, you're on what's called "a roll. "

20
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:59,366
You must keep the momentum good, take
a short holiday, but nothing to long...

21
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,406
Sarah!

22
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,807
Um, let me introduce you. Sarah Morton,
Terry Long. Terry Long, Sarah Morton.

23
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,247
I'm so pleased to meet you. My mother adores
you. She's read all your Dorwell books.

24
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:14,878
Right. Well, Terry, always a pleasure.

25
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,718
We'll speak very soon. And
congratulations again on that award.

26
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,384
I'm sure it's the first
of many. Oh, geez, John.

27
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,621
Very nice to have met you.

28
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:26,756
And do hurry. My mother's impatiently awaiting
the arrival of the newest Inspector Dorwell book.

29
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,266
So what award did that little shit get?

30
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,340
The Manchester Book Critics.

31
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:38,741
Hardly the Booker Prize, I know,
but it's not bad for a first novel.

32
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,212
The "little shit," as
you call him, has talent.

33
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,409
I just hope he sells.

34
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,612
I trust you taught him your favorite
motto. And what motto's that?

35
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,679
You know damn well. You
drilled it into me 20 years ago.

36
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,488
"Awards are like hemorrhoids. sooner
or later every asshole gets one. "

37
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,222
Did I say that?

38
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,299
My God, you're jealous, aren't you?

39
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,403
You don't look after me anymore.

40
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,665
Just because I give a little
fled things, some encouragement,

41
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,041
does not mean that
I am neglecting you...

42
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:15,480
Besides, you've never had any problems
finding inspiration for the Dorwell-Series...

43
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,075
You write with such remarkable
ease I wonder you need me at all.

44
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,850
Okay, Sarah, what's the matter?

45
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,787
Can't be money. You're rolling in it.

46
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,961
It's incredible. The only thing you
can find to talk about to me is money.

47
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,729
I don't give a damn about money...

48
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,070
or success!

49
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,407
- I just want to find
- - An inspiring plot.

50
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,209
No. You don't understand.

51
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,241
It's
- It's got nothing to do with inspiration.

52
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,777
I'm
- I'm fed up with murders...

53
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,120
and investigations.

54
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,559
Why don't you confound your critics and
write something completely different?

55
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,722
Put Dorwell on the shelf, as it were.

56
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:09,461
You didn't like the last one, did you? I knew
it! And you haven't had the balls to tell me.

57
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,630
That's simply not true. You know very well I've
loved the Dorwell series right from the beginning.

58
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,073
As well you might... considering
the money they make you.

59
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,181
Do you like France?

60
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,959
I like frogs' legs.

61
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,495
So what?

62
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,827
My house.

63
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,063
Why don't you go there for a
while, hmm? Breathe some fresh air.

64
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,106
It's free, it's out of season, the
weather's glorious. There's a swimming pool.

65
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,471
Would you come and visit me?

66
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,205
Well. I have got my daughter.

67
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,646
But maybe I'll come for a weekend.

68
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,996
- Are you Marcel?
- Yes.

69
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,075
Hello, I'm Sarah Morton.

70
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,201
[French:] - How was
your trip? - Very nice.

71
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,246
- May I carry this?
- It's on wheels.

72
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,248
- I'll take the small one.
- Thank you.

73
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,307
My car is just outside.

74
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,376
Okay.

75
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,105
The bedrooms and bath are upstairs,

76
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,974
the kitchen's on the left.

77
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,014
[French:] I'll let
you take a look around.

78
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,642
I turned on the hot water and gas.

79
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,753
If you need anything,
you've got my number?

80
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:27,020
- Yes, John gave it to me.
- Good.

81
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,993
To go to the village,

82
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,053
you can take the
footpath I showed you...

83
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,998
or use the moped in the garage.

84
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,399
The keys are in the ignition.

85
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,494
Thank you, Marcel. Good-bye.

86
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,903
Good-bye, Madame. Enjoy your rest.

87
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,805
Bonjour. Bonjour.

88
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,276
What can I get for you?

89
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,075
- Um - -
An aperitif?

90
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,139
No.

91
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,015
[French:] Uh, maybe something lighter?

92
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,986
How about a panache?

93
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,390
No. Just a cup of tea.

94
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,927
Very well.

95
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,191
[ Woman On TV Speaking French: ] In
Marseilles bus service is drastically reduced.

96
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,254
but the Metro is running at 75%.

97
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,993
It's the second strike in two weeks...

98
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,433
and passengers are growing weary -

99
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,742
Hello? Hello, Father. It's me.

100
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:21,081
Are you all right? Yes,
I've arrived safely.

101
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,486
How is the house? The house is lovely.

102
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,218
The weather? The weather's gorgeous.

103
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,423
How is the weather in
London? Doesn't stop raining.

104
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,328
Are you all right? Yes, I'm okay.

105
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,197
Have you met anyone? No,
I haven't seen anyone.

106
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,499
You shouldn't stay by
yourself. Try to get out.

107
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,766
Father. Yeah -

108
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,469
Look, Father, if there's a problem
of any kind, ask Mrs. smith for help.

109
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,876
All right? I don't need anyone's help.

110
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,279
Yes. You take care now.

111
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,544
You too. All right. Bye-bye.

112
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,779
Good-bye.

113
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,987
Hello? Sarah!

114
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,285
John, how are you? I'm very well.

115
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,121
I should be asking you that question.

116
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,754
So, tell me, how's everything going,
darling? Did Marcel come and fetch you?

117
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,766
Yes, but listen. I have just one thing
to say to you, and that's thank you.

118
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,668
You were right, as usual. Your
house is a little piece of paradise.

119
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,400
And I've already begun
working. Hmm? So soon?

120
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,875
Yes. The idea kept running through
my mind while I was on the train.

121
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,312
You know, one of those stupid things that
just latch on and won't let go. Really?

122
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,613
I don't know where it's heading, but
- so, what's Dorwell up to now?

123
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,153
Well, I'm not ready to talk
about it right now. All right.

124
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:20,089
But I think it might be quite funny.
Anyway, I'm going to wait until I'm sure.

125
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,185
Well, that's marvelous.
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

126
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,492
Have you been out and about yet?

127
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,091
No. I'm just enjoying the
peace and quiet here. Good.

128
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:32,568
Yeah. so, when are
you thinking of coming?

129
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,903
Um, I don't know.

130
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,671
I'm not sure. It
- It depends on the work, you know.

131
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:43,943
Um, look, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I've got another call coming through.

132
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,919
Now, you take care, and call me when you're
ready to read me something, all right?

133
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,421
Right. Fine.

134
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,550
Good-bye, John.

135
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,621
[French:] You scared me!

136
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,998
Who are you? What are
you doing in my house?

137
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,833
Your house? This is my house!

138
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,066
I should be asking you.

139
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,108
Are you English? That's correct.

140
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,015
I'm Sarah Morton. I'm a writer. And my
publisher, John Bosload, is letting me this house.

141
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,851
Ah. so you're Daddy's latest conquest.

142
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,158
You're his daughter?

143
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,059
So what? Didn't he warn you?

144
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,498
No, he didn't tell me you'd be coming.

145
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,966
I'm not surprised. Is he here?

146
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,765
No. I'm here on my own.
and I'm here to work.

147
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,806
Maybe he'll come and visit.

148
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,967
I'm glad he's not here.

149
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,905
Are you going to be staying long?

150
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,542
I don't know. I don't
have much work these days.

151
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,779
So, which bedroom did you take?

152
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,913
The one upstairs overlooking
the pool. Of course.

153
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:08,949
That's the best one.
Well, I'm gonna unpack.

154
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,787
Sorry.

155
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,943
Hello. Leave your name, number
and any message you might have...

156
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,138
and I'll get right back to you.

157
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,671
Bastard! You could have told me your
daughter was coming to your bloody house.

158
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,809
How do you expect me to work now?

159
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,615
It's Sarah. Good-bye.

160
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,389
I couldn't get through to
London. Is there anything to eat?

161
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,225
Yes. Go and look for it in the kitchen.

162
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,994
Personally, I'm gonna go back to bed.
I have to work early in the morning.

163
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:53,299
Fine. Good night. Sarah, right?

164
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,532
Right.

165
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,608
I'm Julie.

166
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,161
You're not too hot

167
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,231
Sorry. I woke you up.

168
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,757
No. I was just dozing.

169
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,304
You must be working too hard.

170
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:24,432
You should have a swim in the pool.
The water's cold. It'll wake you up.

171
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:28,000
Well, thank you for your advice, but
I absolutely loathe swimming pools.

172
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,906
Yeah, I know what you mean.

173
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,349
I prefer the sea too.

174
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,150
The ocean. The crashing waves.

175
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:43,058
The feeling of danger. That you could
lose footing at any time and be swept away.

176
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,119
Pools are boring.

177
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,165
There's no excitement, no -

178
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,360
no feeling of infinity.

179
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,527
It's just a big bathtub.

180
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,935
It's more like a cesspool
of living bacteria.

181
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:59,272
Oh, that? No, it's just
a bit of dirt and leaves.

182
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:06,606
So. what are you
writing? A romance novel?

183
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,984
God, no. I write crime fiction.

184
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:14,185
Oh, yeah! That's how he makes his money.

185
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,628
And that's how he can afford to buy a beautiful
house in France for his daughter to enjoy.

186
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,234
What about you? Are
your books selling well?

187
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,741
- I can't complain.
- What is this one about?

188
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,276
Murders and a police investigation.

189
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:37,542
In the Luberon with
rich English tourists.

190
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,277
Listen, if you don't
mind, I do have work to do.

191
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,615
Okay. I leave you alone, Miss Marple.

192
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,952
I need to make some phone calls anyway.

193
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,235
[Julie speaking French
] He was at the macumba?

194
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,204
No way!

195
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,274
With Jean-Pierre?

196
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,441
Yeah, right.

197
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:10,845
What a pervert!

198
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,375
You're gross!

199
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,212
He came back?

200
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,751
I don't know.

201
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,298
Going shopping? No, I'm going
to have lunch in the village.

202
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,393
Ah, good idea.

203
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:37,236
By the way, I spoke to Marcel.
He's coming very soon for the pool.

204
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,110
[Julie speaking French:] His English
bitch has a broomstick up her butt.

205
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,485
[French:] - May I have
the bill? Please. - Yes.

206
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:04,555
Hello? Don't worry about it.

207
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,792
I'm not going to bother her.
Anyway, it's a big house.

208
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,127
Did you ring mom?

209
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,732
I'm telling you, she's
still waiting, so hurry up.

210
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,909
Yes, C’est ca. Ciao.

211
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,006
It's your publisher.

212
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,879
John? Hello? John?

213
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,881
He hung up.

214
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,629
Hello? Hello, this is Sarah Morton.
Could I speak to John, please?

215
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,105
He's gone out. Oh. Really?

216
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,302
Well, could you ask him to call
me back in France? Okay then.

217
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,869
Yes, thank you. Good-bye.

218
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:00,910
He scolded me. He told
me not to bother you.

219
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,647
He said I should leave you
alone so you could work.

220
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,482
Listen, Julie. I'm going
to be frank with you.

221
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,391
I need peace and quiet to concentrate.

222
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,395
And since we share
the same living space,

223
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:17,093
I must ask you just to go about your business
without getting in the way of mine, hmm?

224
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,898
I mean, this house is certainly big enough
for the two of us. so, please make an effort.

225
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,701
I was only trying to be
polite and make friends.

226
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,471
But if you prefer I don't
- I don't prefer anything!

227
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,537
I just want to work on my book in peace.

228
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,609
Fine. That's too bad, though, because
I just bought loads of nice food.

229
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,282
I guess I have to eat
my foie gras all alone.

230
00:34:52,781 --> 00:34:54,715
Ca va?

231
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:58,116
[French:] - We're almost
there. - I'm wasted.

232
00:34:58,187 --> 00:34:59,586
Are you okay?

233
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,782
- Where are we?
- my house.

234
00:35:01,824 --> 00:35:03,815
You live here?

235
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,850
Yeah, I swear!

236
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:18,706
[French:] Can't you turn the music up?

237
00:35:18,774 --> 00:35:21,208
No, the old bag's sleeping upstairs.

238
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:23,267
Oh.

239
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,174
Good morning.

240
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:07,214
Bonjour.

241
00:37:07,282 --> 00:37:09,773
[French:] I made some
coffee, if you like.

242
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,611
Oui.

243
00:37:18,994 --> 00:37:21,087
I hope we weren't too loud?

244
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:26,496
I don't speak French. I
can't understand a word.

245
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:28,559
Pardon.

246
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:43,415
[French Continues:] Get up!

247
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,125
I've got to get to work.

248
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,928
Just a quickie.

249
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:02,801
I'd love to, but I've really got to go.

250
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,805
And there's that woman.

251
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,638
- You saw her?
- Yeah, she's outside.

252
00:38:07,709 --> 00:38:09,904
- She's a foreigner?
- Yes.

253
00:38:09,978 --> 00:38:13,004
- English.
- Not bad looking.

254
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:15,242
So fuck her, if you like old maids!

255
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:17,911
I was just kidding.

256
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,829
[Julie, French Continues:]
Want me to drive you?

257
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:34,960
It's not far. see you later.

258
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:38,769
Thanks. It was nice.

259
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,604
- Call me sometime.
- No problem.

260
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:43,406
Ciao!

261
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,763
[French:] - Is everything
all right? - Yes.

262
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:19,741
Are you from around here?

263
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,648
Yes, Lacoste. Have you been there?

264
00:39:22,718 --> 00:39:26,745
- No.
- The Marquis de Sade's castle is there.

265
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,188
Oh, right.

266
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:32,124
I've heard about it.

267
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:35,060
It's practically in ruins now, isn't it?

268
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,065
You can say that again.

269
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:42,832
But there's a nice panoramic
view of the Luberon.

270
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:45,134
It's beautiful.

271
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:49,400
I'll let you finish.

272
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:06,565
[French:] Oh, it's you.

273
00:43:06,641 --> 00:43:08,836
Your bedroom's not big enough for you?

274
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,404
Yes, it is, but he snores like
a pig. I couldn't get to sleep.

275
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:16,382
Expecting another one?

276
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:18,681
Bonjour.

277
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:21,085
[French:] I've come for
the pool. Julie called.

278
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:23,784
- Hi, Marcel.
- Hello.

279
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,292
- How are you?
- Not bad.

280
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:29,592
- You're back already?
- I was sick of work.

281
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:31,689
I felt like a rest.

282
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,735
This is Sarah, a friend of my father's.

283
00:43:34,803 --> 00:43:36,703
Yes, we've met.

284
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:39,296
Are you cleaning the pool today?

285
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:41,501
Isn't that what you wanted,Julie?

286
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:45,307
Sarah wants to swim, but
it's too dirty for her.

287
00:43:59,894 --> 00:44:02,021
Bonjour.

288
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,190
[French Continues:] -
Where's the girl? - What girl?

289
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,259
I forget her name. The little blonde.

290
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:13,165
Julie, maybe?

291
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:17,306
That's it. Julie, right.

292
00:44:18,813 --> 00:44:22,442
Check out in the backyard by the pool.

293
00:44:22,517 --> 00:44:24,508
I believe she's getting some air.

294
00:44:26,888 --> 00:44:28,549
Thanks, Madame.

295
00:44:42,003 --> 00:44:44,597
[French:] Bernard, this is Marcel.

296
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:48,870
- He's my dad.
- Stop joking.

297
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:54,512
Come on, Marcel!

298
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,073
Going out? Yes. Do I have
to ask for your permission?

299
00:47:10,151 --> 00:47:13,678
Well, it would be nice if you didn't
make any noise when you came home.

300
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:16,553
Yes, mother. I pity your mother.

301
00:47:16,658 --> 00:47:18,626
You pity her? Why?

302
00:47:18,693 --> 00:47:23,323
Well, I imagine having a daughter who comes home with a
different man every night must be difficult for a mother.

303
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:27,026
Well, you imagine wrong. You know what?

304
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,695
You're just a frustrated
English woman...

305
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,672
who writes about dirty
things but never does them.

306
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,140
You can shove your
uptight morals up your ass.
