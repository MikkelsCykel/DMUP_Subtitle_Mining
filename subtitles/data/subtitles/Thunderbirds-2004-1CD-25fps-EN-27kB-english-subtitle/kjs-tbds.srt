I hope you aren't going anywhere special
over spring break, Alan.

You're not a Thunderbird yet.

it would be a d...di...very bad.

I know, I know.

They're gonna be on TV. Let's go!

- In Russia, at an oil rig fire.

at your service.

Alan, your father's been unexpectedly detained.
He's asked me to pick you up.

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,150
- Is that all right?
- Beats the bus!

- Definitely.
- Fantastic.

92

Now, will any of these gorgeous
young things be joining you?

Just Fermat.

94
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,118
Quite right.

95
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,516
Lady Penelope,
are you on a mission for my father?

96
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,269
Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent,
so please try to be discreet.

97
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,833
Here we are.

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,190
- Hi, Parker.
- Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.

99
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,355
Hi, Nosy.

100
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,154
Less of that, or I shall be obliged
to deliver the Parker Haymaker.

101
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,475
OK, bring it on, big guy.

102
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,394
- Try not to run over any children, Parker.
- Very good, milady.

103
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,511
Come on, Parker, chop chop!

104
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,871
(Alan) All right!
(Fermat) Whoa!

105
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,353
Yes!

106
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,552
Yeah!

107
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,872
Oh, look, Parker.
Pink is the new black this season.

108
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,799
- I'm very glad to hear it, milady.
- And hemlines are going up.

109
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,751
That is good news, milady.

110
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,759
- And England won the football last night.
- Yes! Eng-er-land!

111
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,712
Calm down, Parker.

112
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,990
Yes, milady.

113
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,031
Sorry, milady.

114
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,156
Come on, baby. Out you jump.

115
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,836
Wait till your father hears about this,

116
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,030
panhead!

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,951
Aliens!

118
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,957
Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!

119
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,273
OK, lock it up.

120
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,270
Let's go. Let's move it.

121
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,954
We need some help over here.

122
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,909
Mission complete.
Thunderbird 1, we are good to go.

123
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,188
FAB.

124
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,396
'Tracking device activated.'

125
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,751
Ah, the chariot of the gods!

126
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,192
Having dallied with the mortals,
they return to Olympus.

127
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,390
And so I follow.

128
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,633
Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy lsland.

129
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,839
And radar indicates we have some company.

130
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,989
Now, that's showing off.

131
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,351
I wish that was me.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,118
Flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh...sh...
Anything you want to tell me?

133
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,154
Brains, a build-up of vibration, followed by
illumination of the number 5 engine outlight.

134
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,159
OK, Mr Tracy, I'll ch...ch...
study the flight data and guidance processor.

135
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,395
- Dad!
- Alan!

136
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,513
- Dinner's ready. Come and get it.
- It smells delicious. I am starved.

137
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,358
I saw the mission on TV.
It looked dangerous.

138
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,995
Saving lives is a dangerous business.
But it's what we do.

139
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,600
Was the fire causing thermal updraughts?

140
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,473
Enough shop talk.
I want to hear about school.

141
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,317
School's boring.

142
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,070
Maybe I could be home-educated now.
That way, I could sit in on missions.

143
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,350
- What do you think?
- No short cuts, Alan.

144
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,870
No school, no rockets.
Why aren't you wearing your retainer?

145
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,879
So the wind is blowing 60 knots,
right up my keister.

146
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,751
Did you readjust the flaps?

147
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,758
Of course! It's not my first day in a Thunderbird.

148
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,030
- Keep up!
- Don't you have homework?

149
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,878
Unless he's blown up this school,
like the last one!

150
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,629
- Keep Alan away from the ships.
- That's enough. Pass the salad.

151
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,639
- I haven't seen that much fire since Fiji.
- That was lstanbul.

152
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,150
- lstanbul was the earthquake.
- Nothing compares to Argentina.

153
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,555
Dad, I'm not really hungry.

154
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,876
- Come on, Fermat. Let's go.
- But...

155
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,115
I'm not done!

156
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,151
- Come on.
- OK.

157
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,149
Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?

158
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,509
- By the pool.
- Of course.

159
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,028
(Thunderbirds theme ringtone)

160
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,149
Parker.

161
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,113
- We're not supposed to go in there.
- You worry too much.

162
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,469
Where'd you get the access code?

163
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,354
Fermat, my friend,
what you don't know can't hurt you.

164
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,039
I'll be right there.

165
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,390
- The fire at the rig was no accident.
- Any suspects?

166
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,796
- Not yet.
- Thanks for bringing Alan home.

167
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,991
My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.

168
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,556
- Tintin!
- Hey, Mr Tracy.

169
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,431
- Hello, Tintin.
- Lady Penelope.

170
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,552
- Did you know Alan's home?
- Alan's back?

171
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,956
I mean, oh, Alan's back!

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,275
Hey, Dad.

173
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,629
When are those two going to get along?

174
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,750
When Tintin decides to.

175
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,598
Girls are always ahead of boys
at that sort of thing.

176
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,598
- What sort of thing?
- Romance.

177
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,838
- Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming.
- No, you wouldn't.

178
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,156
- Have a safe flight home, Penny.
- Thanks, Jeff.

179
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,153
OK, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.

180
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,033
Right. Hydraulic systems

181
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,839
- are green.
- Commence main engine sequence.

182
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,836
FAB, Alan.

183
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,076
Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.

184
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,111
No way, Alan!

185
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,193
- Wrong switch!
- 'Warning. Engine sequence: breach.

186
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,235
'Warning. Engine sequence: breach.'

187
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,269
(Beeping)

188
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,394
- Could this day get any worse?
- 'Alan, my office. Now.'

189
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,151
It just did.

190
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,352
- I can't believe it.
- We're so busted.

191
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,718
- Look at this.
- What is it?

192
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,790
Looks like some sort of...

193
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,593
gallium-electrolyte compound.

194
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,311
Gotta get out of here.

195
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,793
Dad, I know I shouldn't have been in the ship, but...

196
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,118
- You're damn right you shouldn't!
- But I had it under control.

197
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,632
Under control? Do you have any idea
of the importance of secrecy in our operation?

198
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,831
You fired up
without the anti-detection shield.

199
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,758
You put everyone in danger
when you act selfishly.

200
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,713
You want to be part of the team,
you play by the rules. Understand?

201
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,309
- Do you?
- Yeah, I understand.

202
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,069
You don't want me to be a Thunderbird.
You don't want me to do anything.

203
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,634
You won't even listen to me!

204
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,434
I've heard enough.
You're grounded for the rest of spring break.

205
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,189
- But, Dad!
- Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up.

206
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,071
Then let me.

207
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,717
Please!

208
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,751
(Bleeping)

209
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,595
Hey, John. I was just about to turn in.
What can I do for you?

210
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,916
'l could use a pizza.
You know a place that delivers?'

211
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,593
'30 minutes or it's free, right?
Anything else on your mind?'

212
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,316
Got a forest fire in Vladivostok,
a typhoon heading for Singapore.

213
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,909
- What's happening on Planet Tracy?
- Alan's home for spring break.

214
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,918
Yeah. I thought I could see a storm brewing.

215
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,475
- 'Teenagers!'
- We've all been there.

216
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,829
Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died.

217
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,919
Thanks, John.
Keep an eye on that typhoon for us.

218
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,954
- 'I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need help.'
- FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.

219
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,911
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, son.

220
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,191
There's something I'd like to sh...sh...
Here, take a look.

221
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,836
- The neural-net control system?
- It's great to have you back.

222
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,391
I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be
this w...w...fun.

223
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,356
Watch this.

224
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,675
And that tiny phone lifts up...

225
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,718
Perfect.

226
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,951
Dad?

227
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,158
- N...n... Almost perfect.
- There's something I want to talk to you about.

228
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,954
Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right.

229
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,120
Are you having problems
with a g...g...whoo...female?

230
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,993
N-no! No!

231
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,279
Alan and I found a gallium compound
on the nose cone of Thunderbird 1.

232
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,073
We should check that out strai...
immediately.

233
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,315
That'd be g...g...swell!

234
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,831
The island is in sight.

235
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,077
- Transom, I need you.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,356
Sir, our cloaking device
has evaded their detection systems.

237
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,428
We have a positive visual from
the tracking solution on Thunderbird 1.

238
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,948
- Mullion?
- Sir?

239
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,516
Sir, armed and ready.
Shall I target the main structure?

240
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,757
Why would I want to destroy
what will soon be mine?

241
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,033
A tenet of Eastern martial arts is to use
your opponent's strength against him.

242
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,679
This is ridiculous.

243
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,395
It will be impossible to force
the Thunderbirds to leave their island.

244
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,991
On the other hand,
it requires no effort at all to let them go.

245
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,199
The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue.
All we need do is give them the victim.

246
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,629
- Commence targeting.
- Straightaway, sir.

247
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,391
Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked.

248
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,476
Fire.

249
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,715
(Alarm beeping)

250
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,557
- 'Red Alert.'
- What the...?

251
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,670
'lmpact imminent.'

252
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,633
Thunderbird 5 to Tracy lsland.
Mayday! Mayday!

253
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,437
'Red alert!

254
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,231
'Red alert!

255
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,110
'Red alert!'

256
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,998
Switching to Command and Control Centre.

257
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,519
How bad, Brains?

258
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,074
Thunderbird 5, major damage sustained.

259
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,634
Possible m...m... Possible strike by m...

260
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,591
- Meteor?
- Yeah.

261
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,990
Thunderbirds are go.

262
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,111
- Check retros.
- Go.

263
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,597
'Guidance systems: green.'

264
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,475
'Go to maximum thrust.'

265
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,756
There goes the cavalry.

266
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,631
But who will rescue the rescuers?

267
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,189
Alan! Tintin!

268
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,396
Thunderbird 5 has been hit!

269
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,479
- Thunderbird 5 has been hit!
- OK, OK, OK, don't panic. Don't panic.

270
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,317
(Bubbling)

271
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,356
On the other hand...

272
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,913
Run!

273
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,195
- We made land.
- Cut them off.

274
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,277
Activating communications blackout.

275
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,074
'Warning. Intruder alert.
Communications failure.'

276
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,429
What the he...devil is going on?

277
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,118
'Warning. Intruder alert.'

278
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,038
- Mr Tracy, do you copy?
- 'lntruder alert.'

279
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,230
Thunderbird 3, please respond.

280
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,469
How'd they find the island? Was it what I did
in Thunderbird 1? Did I ruin everything?

281
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,149
No. That compound we found
could have a transmitting capability.

282
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,988
- We have to do something.
- My dad's in the control room.

283
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,033
- How do we get there now?
- The vents.

284
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,509
Let's go! We have to get a message to my dad.

285
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,598
I'm losing all power. Repeat, I'm losing all power.

286
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,631
Hold on, John. We're coming in.

287
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,517
- 'Gordon, prepare for docking.'
- 'You got it, Dad.'

288
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,314
Reverse main thrusters on my mark.
Three, two, one...

289
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,114
- Easy. Watch the roll.
- Roll index angle minus two degrees.

290
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,151
'lnitiate docking sequence.'

291
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,753
- We're locked on.
- 'Docking sequence complete.'

292
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,394
- Tunnel hatch secured.
- Let's move!

293
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,793
- 'Airlock pressure equalised.'
- We're in. Let's go!

294
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,550
John!

295
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,955
Scott, tackle that fire.

296
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,276
- Am I glad to see you guys!
- Easy, you're hurt.

297
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,269
Virgil, take care of your brother.
Gordon, give me a damage assessment.

298
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,392
Come on, hurry!

299
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,431
(Electronic whining)

300
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,920
One-inch steel plate,
with sequential titanium locking mechanism.

301
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,997
- (Bones click)
- I love a challenge.

302
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,431
Watch out for the guards.

303
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,511
Get in, get in.

304
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,639
- (Whistles nervously)
- (Muffled banging)

305
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,993
Who-o-o-o...?

306
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,429
- What's going on?
- So, this is Mount Olympus.

307
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,399
And these are the Thunderbirds.
I should have guessed.

308
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,639
Jeff Tracy, the billionaire ex-astronaut.
Of course.

309
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,879
Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident?
Avalanche, wasn't it? How tragic.

310
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,559
- Just keep going straight ahead.
- OK.

311
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,358
Professor Hackenbacker?

312
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,269
We met at last year's international conference
on nanotechnology.

313
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,110
I thought your thesis on neutrinos
was extremely...

314
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,434
stimulating.

315
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,835
Transom, concentrate!

316
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,871
Sorry, sir.

317
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,510
The command control switch is here.
Fingerprint recognition system.

318
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,918
Professor. Please.
Activate the control switch.

319
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,713
N-n-n-n...

320
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,352
You must be kidding.

321
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,119
We share an interest
in the science of the mind.

322
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,720
The difference is, I was born with my powers.

323
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,832
I tell you, you've barely touched the surface.

324
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,676
Even the strongest minds can be broken.
We can break yours.

325
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,156
Fu... Fu... No way!

326
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,395
Activate the control switch, Prof!

327
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,596
Like a puppet on a string!

328
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,200
(The Hood laughing evilly)

329
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,869
'Activating Command and Control.

330
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,431
'Activating Command and Control.'

331
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,316
- We have control.
- Get up.

332
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,670
Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal.

333
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,354
(Buzzing)

334
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,315
- We got a warning light on our EPS system.
- Attempt manual override.

335
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,351
No, that's negative!

336
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,393
- That's it.
- OK, this one.

337
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,556
Back to Thunderbird 3 now.

338
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,229
- John, we gotta move.
- The locking mechanism's jammed.

339
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,034
'Attention, Thunderbird 5.
I have taken over your facilities.

340
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,992
'You no longer control your operational systems.'

341
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,358
(Alan) They've taken over.

342
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,439
- Warm them up, Transom.
- lncreasing temperature to maximum.

343
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,318
Who's the bald freak?

344
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,430
You?

345
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,713
Dad!

346
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,190
They've got my dad.

347
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,438
OK, you have our attention.
Who are you? What do you want?

348
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,996
How rude of me. You can call me The Hood.

349
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,589
Now, listen, Mr Tracy.
We won't be negotiating.

350
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,714
I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob banks,
starting with the Bank of London.

351
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,514
The money system will be in chaos
and the Thunderbirds held responsible.

352
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,353
- You'll never succeed!
- Why the Thunderbirds?

353
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,960
- An eye for an eye.
- 'An eye for an eye?'

354
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,233
Perhaps you've forgotten me, but you remember
saving my brother, Kyrano?

355
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,871
'I'm sorry, Mr Tracy. I thought he was dead.'

356
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,794
- Take them away.
- Yes, sir.

357
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,312
That makes The Hood my uncle?

358
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,555
Every family has a black sh...sh...

359
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,916
(Resounding sneeze)

360
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,709
This room's murder with my allergies.

361
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,350
You left me to die that day.

362
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,191
You may have broken my body but you've no idea
how powerful my mind has become.

363
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,997
Now you will suffer, as I suffered,
waiting for a rescue that will never come.

364
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,191
'Wait!'

365
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,718
- Scott, status report.
- CO2 levels are rising.

366
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,832
Wire the oxygen scrubber to the batteries.
Clean the air.

367
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,793
- How long will that give us?
- About four hours.

368
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,830
(Gasping)

369
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,156
(Muffled sneezing)

370
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,758
Someone's there.

371
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,235
- (Fermat gasping)
- Come on.

372
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,349
Aaargh!

373
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,554
Aaaargh!

374
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,990
- Run, run!
- No, jump. We can get through to the silos.

375
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,073
Apparently, the island is not
as secure as you thought.

376
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,633
Children!

377
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,193
Did you find any children?

378
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,119
Here they are.
Thunderbird 2 silo, in the loading arm.

379
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,838
Seal them in.

380
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,071
Hold on!

381
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,990
The doors! You guys, let's go!

382
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,155
Go! Go!

383
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,313
This way.

384
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,077
- No!
- They've got us trapped. What now?

385
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,432
If we can get to the Thunderbird 1 silo,
we can escape through the service tunnel.

386
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,471
But we need a plan, Alan.

387
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,911
- I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.
- 'Elevator, active.'

388
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,080
- Get the goons with the Firefly!
- Alan! It's only to be used in an emergency.

389
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,833
- I guess this qualifies.
- Yeah.

390
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,794
Here they come.

391
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,071
- Fermat, can you drive this thing?
- Uh, no.

392
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,993
- Hey, watch it!
- I took microbiology, not driver's ed.

393
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,995
- Set the pressure to maximum.
- Got it.

394
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,997
Retreat!

395
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,512
Let's move it.

396
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,837
That's it.

397
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,835
Time to thunderize.

398
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,429
Yes!

399
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,319
Come on, let's go!

400
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,794
Get 'em!

401
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,718
- Where's Fermat?
- Fermat!

402
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,035
- Coming!
- Hurry up.

403
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,789
- What were you doing back there, Fermat?
- I had an idea.

404
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,992
Try and keep up, OK? I'll open the tunnel.
We gotta keep moving.

405
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,079
- 'Access denied.'
- Go back. Yell when you see them coming.

406
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,111
'Access denied.'

407
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,232
Alan.

408
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,789
You can run if you want.

409
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,757
Were you surprised to hear
what your father did to me?

410
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,435
It is frightening when we realise
our parents aren't perfect.

411
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,315
But perhaps you already suspected that
about your father.

412
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,150
Why did he build these magnificent machines?
Do you suppose it was guilt?

413
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,555
Because he let your mother die.

414
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,395
Open the door, Alan.

415
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,276
Open...the...door.

416
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,715
We can't go this way.

417
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,832
He's there.

418
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,119
No! What are we going to do, Alan?

419
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,395
I don't know. I'm thinking, OK?

420
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,397
Keep backing up. I've got an idea.

421
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,472
- That's your idea?
- It's not me you're angry at, Alan.

422
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,750
It's not you I'm aiming at.

423
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,678
Get them!

424
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,996
Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1.

425
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,235
And set to broil!

426
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,271
(Screaming)

427
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,353
(Screaming)

428
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,632
- No sign of them.
- The little brats went up like firecrackers.

429
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,318
Pop, pop, pop!

430
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,553
Don't give him the satisfaction, Professor.

431
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,435
This is taking too long. Pick out the equipment
you need and load it into Thunderbird 2.

432
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,471
- No more delays.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,751
(Coughing and spluttering)

434
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,277
- Can you warn us next time you do that?
- Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.

435
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,834
I could have drowned.

436
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,351
- You mean you can't swim?
- I repeat, I could have drowned.

437
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,551
I said I was sorry, Fermat.
Just put this behind us, OK?

438
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,909
We gotta watch each other's backs.

439
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,757
- Nice drawers.
- Thank you.

440
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,994
Boo!

441
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,439
No, Tintin, stay there.

442
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,597
You're worse than girls.
Hurry up and get dressed.

443
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,790
Those are nice drawers!

444
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,990
(Fermat) Data from Tracy lsland is sent
to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right?

445
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,239
There's a miniscule possibility that
if we reach the satellite station, we could...

446
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,032
- Blow it up!
- No,

447
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,231
hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5.

448
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,754
Good thinking, Fermat. Let's do it.

449
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,711
Here's the plan. We're here.

450
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,230
We go along the shore
to the access road, here.

451
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,399
Then up to the transmitter. What do you think?

452
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,151
Good. Except that we're here, not there,
and the transmitter is there, not here.

453
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,873
We have to go through the jungle.

454
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,195
But that's f...f...off limits.

455
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,278
- It's gonna be dangerous.
- I'm in.

456
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,591
We gotta get up there fast!

457
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,871
Our folks are in trouble
and if The Hood gets off the island...

458
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,831
He's not going anywhere.

459
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,476
The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2.
He can't take off without it.

460
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,991
- How'd you get this?
- Alan, what you don't know can't hurt you.

461
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,316
(Car phone bleeping)

462
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,276
- 'Parker?'
- Milady?

463
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,470
'We have an emergency.'

464
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,318
- What a charming fellow.
- (Knocking on door)

465
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,351
Come in.

466
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,711
Have a look at this, Parker.

467
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,911
He, and this woman, poor girl,

468
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,555
both work for this man, known as The Hood.

469
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,276
- Sounds like an alias, milady.
- Quite right, Parker.

470
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,231
Real name: Trangh Belagant.

471
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,273
Assumed dead when
his illegal diamond mine collapsed in Malaya.

472
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,872
Oh, perfect, Parker.

473
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,037
The Thunderbirds rescued
over 500 mine workers,

474
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,071
including Mr Belagant's brother.

475
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,908
Milady, that's Mr Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.

476
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,791
How's my schedule, Parker?

477
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,196
You have clay pigeon shooting
with Lord Marlborough,

478
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,198
a benefit gala for the lnstitute of the Blind,

479
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,630
and there's a typhoon
bearing down on Singapore.

480
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,955
- I suppose that's urgent.
- Yes, milady.

481
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,278
A bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires
and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta.

482
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,198
- The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
- No, milady.

483
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,596
The media is awash in speculation
vis-a-vis their whereabouts.

484
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,437
'Over to Lisa Lowe.'

485
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,998
Disaster after disaster around the world today
and still no sign of the Thunderbirds.

486
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,555
Typhoon Jago hit Singapore just one hour ago

487
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,354
and thousands have been left homeless
by a volcano in Jakarta.

488
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,392
'Only the Thunderbirds have the machines...'

489
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,991
- It's time to send the emergency signal.
- I fear you're not wrong, milady.

490
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,679
'Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.'

491
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,597
(Beeping)

492
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,631
(Beeping)

493
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,912
I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood
was inside my head back there.

494
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,871
What do you mean, Alan?

495
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,675
Maybe he can read minds
or control minds or something.

496
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,393
Don't be silly, Alan.
Everything can be explained by science.

497
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,149
I'm just figuring out his weakness.
Everybody has an Achilles heel.

498
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,668
My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel.

499
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,757
It's got a blister the size of a basketball.

500
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,791
Tintin!

501
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,470
- Can we...s...s...
- Stop? No.

502
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,272
OK.

503
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,355
No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.

504
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,551
- Any word?
- Nothing, milady.

505
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,832
Right. Tell Lord Marlborough
that I've broken my shooting arm.

506
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,236
Send the lnstitute for the Blind
a dozen guide dogs.

507
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,158
- And bring the car around.
- Yes, milady.

508
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,033
The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble.

509
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,072
And I don't like that. Let's go, Parker.

510
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,272
- Ready. We'll use this to get into the vaults.
- Subtle, as usual, Mullion.

511
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,756
I didn't realise we'd be getting points for style.
We're robbing banks, remember.

512
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,951
Don't worry. You'll get your money.

513
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,390
Transom, initiate pre-flight diagnostics.

514
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,319
(Machinery whirring)

515
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,592
- What's going on?
- 'Guidance processor error.'

516
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,950
- It's the guidance processor.
- What's wrong with it?

517
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,349
- There isn't one.
- Aaargh!

518
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,868
Clever Alan.

519
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,388
It's the children. They have it.

520
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,718
No way. They're dead.
No one could live through something like that.

521
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,115
I did.

522
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,112
Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need.

523
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,472
Make sure you get the guidance processor
before you lose your temper.

524
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,240
Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?

525
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,272
Blossoming? What's that supposed to mean?

526
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,471
Come on, Alan. You've a crush on her.

527
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,954
You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's...

528
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,877
She's not that bad, I guess.

529
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,480
OK, guys, take five.

530
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,556
Five isn't going to do it!

531
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,311
- Guys?
- (Puffing and panting)

532
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,953
Don't move.

533
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,516
- What is it?
- Scorpion.

534
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,111
- Is that dangerous?
- 0.025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.

535
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,434
So, "dangerous" is an understatement.

536
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,350
Watch out!

537
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,949
- Tintin, what was that?
- Let's go.

538
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,152
Hey! She has the same powers
as her uncle, The Hood.

539
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,033
- You think?
- Must run in the family.

540
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,868
- Did you do that?
- Just drop it, OK?

541
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,992
Still think everything
can be explained by science?

542
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,031
Not girls!

543
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,470
- Scott? Gordon? You all right?
- We're OK.

544
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,796
- The heat exchanger has blown.
- You don't say!

545
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,469
Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.

546
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,076
- How are you doing?
- This is very delicate equipment.

547
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,310
Which is now...broken.

548
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,351
Can you fix it?

549
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,756
Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with.

550
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,631
We're in the middle of nowhere.

551
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,877
Where are you going to find something like that?

552
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,554
What?

553
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,471
Aaaaargh!

554
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,316
Ow!

555
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,351
Perfect.

556
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,999
- Gee, I never figured you for a crybaby.
- I'm gonna kill you.

557
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,430
- What did he say?
- I think it was some sort of apology.

558
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,157
I got it, yes! You're the man, Fermat!

559
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,031
OK...

560
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,037
First, we have to establish contact
with Thunderbird 5.

561
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,839
- 'Dad?'
- It's Alan!

562
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,158
- Alan, where are you?
- 'I'm at the satellite relay station.'

563
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,112
Fermat's gonna hack in
to give control back to you.

564
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,277
- 'We're standing by.'
- We're almost there.

565
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,473
(Gasps) Goodness me, Professor.
You're so good-looking without your glasses on.

566
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,957
I think you may find
that's another thing we have in common.

567
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,911
Pretty?

568
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,191
- (Alarm sounding)
- 'Unauthorised transmission!'

569
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,438
That's not fair.
Just when things were starting to sizzle.

570
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,154
'Unauthorised transmission!'

571
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,716
A burst of transmission
from the island satellite station. Should I jam it?

572
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,637
And give Mullion the coordinates.

573
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,070
'Take the main track southeast,
then head up Satellite Hill.'

574
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,796
They're onto us! We're being jammed!

575
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,717
- Can you finish?
- I'll try.

576
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,069
- 'Alan, what's happening?'
- Hang in there.

577
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,436
It won't work.
The signal's too weak for data transmission.

578
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,235
'Dad, they're jamming the signal.
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.'

579
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,748
That's a negative! It's too dangerous.

580
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:05,113
Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady
Penelope at the rendezvous point. Got that?

581
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,991
- Dad!
- We're losing you.

582
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,393
'Dad!'

583
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,435
- No!
- Useless!

584
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,597
It is now.

585
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,837
I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us.

586
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,235
No, it's OK. I'm fine.

587
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,431
You don't have to be such a tough guy.

588
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,596
I worry about my dad too.

589
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,791
I'd do anything
to be with my parents right now.

590
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,229
But The Hood knows we're alive now.

591
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,953
We have to go.

592
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,198
- Even worse, they know exactly...
- (Tyres screeching)

593
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,837
..where we are!

594
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,151
Come on!

595
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,119
Aaaaargh!

596
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,354
Aaaargh!

597
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,948
- Great. More water.
- Tintin, can you slow 'em down?

598
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,833
- I'd be delighted.
- Do it. Meet us at the junk yard.

599
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,199
Come on, Fermat.

600
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,911
This'll get us out of here.

601
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,192
There! Come on!

602
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,038
(Buzzing)

603
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,556
Straight ahead.

604
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,948
Aaaargh!

605
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,236
- It's gonna make this thing hard to control.
- No problem.

606
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,670
You really must be careful
not to exceed four bars of pressure...

607
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,712
- I said no problem.
- Guys, we've got to get out of here.

608
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,557
- What is this?
- A hoversled.

609
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,989
Our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea.

610
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,759
Let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said.

611
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,873
Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get caught.
I say we do something.

612
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,956
Now! Right, Fermat?

613
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,949
Actually, I agree with Tintin.
I don't think this is s...s...safe.

614
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,993
You don't think anything is s...s...safe.

615
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,118
Just because I s...s...stutter
doesn't mean that I'm wrong.

616
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,472
If we're a team,
we should make decisions as a team.

617
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,159
Do you want to sit here and take a vote?
Or do you want to get out of here?

618
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,270
Cos I'm going.

619
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,356
You can be a real jerk sometimes.

620
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,715
(Shrieking)

621
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,592
Go!

622
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,635
Go!

623
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,593
Help!

624
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,558
Oh, no!

625
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,191
Come on! Faster!

626
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,473
Alan! You're going too fast!

627
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,192
I need more speed to get above the trees.
Hang on!

628
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,838
Ugh!

629
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,230
What did I tell you guys?

630
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,191
Oh, no...

631
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,151
(Fermat) What are you doing?

632
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,509
Oh, no! Not the fridge!

633
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,597
- Tintin!
- Son...

634
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,676
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine, Dad.

635
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,837
Cool off, kid!

636
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,871
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

637
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,593
Tracy lsland approaching, milady.
Switching to aqua mode.

638
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,230
- lsn't life fun, sometimes?
- Rib-tickling, milady.

639
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,559
What is it?

640
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,276
We have an unidentified craft
approaching the island at high speed.

641
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,351
Lady P.

642
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,556
Phew! Somebody roll down a window.
It's getting hot in here.

643
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,160
Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere
in 37 minutes.

644
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,953
- Oxygen's out in 30, so we won't feel it.
- Stop it!

645
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,309
Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.

646
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,909
No, it's not. We've got people
on the ground working for us.

647
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,951
Alan? He's just a kid.

648
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,355
He's a Tracy.

649
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,074
- This doesn't look good, Parker.
- No, milady.

650
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,636
That bougainvillea is parched, and someone
should do something about that hammock.

651
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,558
Whom do we have here? Mullion...

652
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,631
I must warn you that I know judo,
krai magna and tae kwon do.

653
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,716
And I know Parker.

654
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,751
Milady.

655
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,388
Aaaargh!

656
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,591
- You've broken my nose.
- That was my intention.

657
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,119
Oooh!

658
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,917
One tries so hard in life to sort things out
on an intellectual-slash-conversational level.

659
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,032
But sometimes it's just not possible.

660
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,678
Ow!

661
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,478
Aaaargh!

662
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,759
Oof!

663
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,873
- Shall I bring the car round, milady?
- Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.

664
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,593
Excuse me, milady.

665
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,109
Ah, Lady Penelope!

666
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,153
- He has his palace. Why not his princess?
- Flattery will get you nowhere.

667
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,674
Ow!

668
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,995
Have you any idea what a manicure costs?

669
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,516
- Boo!
- Ha!

670
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,471
Coming through, milady.

671
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,708
Eeow!

672
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,911
Duck, milady!

673
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,711
He's weak. Using his power makes him weak.

674
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,032
Aaaaargh!

675
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,717
You're formidable.
More than a match for most men.

676
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,591
That's not saying much, then, is it?

677
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,511
Aaaargh!

678
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,839
- I suggest you let us pass.
- Don't try your parlour games on me.

679
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,714
You've committed a serious crime.
And in about...

680
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,910
four seconds,
I'm going to get quite cross with you.

681
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,512
How are you, Alan?

682
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,913
Ow!

683
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,794
I hope you don't think
I'm going to chase you.

684
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,432
Ow!

685
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,952
- Ow!
- You can make it stop, Alan.

686
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,117
- Ow!
- You have something that belongs to me.

687
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,517
Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't the first time
my head's been pulverised.

688
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,949
And it's never done any real harm before.

689
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,834
- Ow!
- Stop! Stop! I'll give it to you.

690
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,313
Fetch!

691
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,039
You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give you that.

692
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:34,471
- Put them with the others.
- You're coming with me.

693
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,274
Put me down! This outfit is couture.

694
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,114
Don't go to sleep. John, look at me.

695
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,151
Keep your eyes open.

696
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,478
- You need to cool off, lady.
- Lady Penelope!

697
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,671
Big oaf!

698
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,957
Right, that's quite enough losing for one day.

699
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,916
So, how does it feel to be right all the time?

700
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,669
Not bad, actually.

701
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,355
I'm so sorry, Fermat.

702
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,313
We make quite a pair.
It's hard for me to talk.

703
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,555
It's hard for you to listen.

704
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,597
Parker, I have an idea.

705
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,478
Excellent, milady.

706
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:02,550
- Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?
- I can't think. I'm too cold.

707

'Guidance processor installed.'

708

- Under an hour.

'Thunderbird 2 preparing for takeoff.'

713
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,669
We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting away.

714
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,678
- In position, milady.
- Here we go.

Good shot, milady.

717
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,232
Come on, Parker.
Let's give the bad guys a thrashing!

720
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,638
This seems to be a six-lever mortise, milady.

721
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,309
- Sometimes your chequered past comes in handy.
- Thank you, milady.

722
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,909
I shall need a piece of wire
to access the mechanism.

723

(Wire twanging)

724
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,269
Will this suffice, Parker?

725
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,709
Most certainly, milady.

726
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,435
- I didn't actually need it, anyway.
- Of course not, milady.

727
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,119
- Quick!
- Everyone get to the control room.

Hat.

729
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,668
Get in there quick, Fermat, and save my family.

- London.
- He's got the Mole on board.

756

Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad.
We'll never get there in time.

757
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,391
Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy everything
the Thunderbirds stand for.

778
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,911
- Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation.
- FAB.

779
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,116
Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London.

780
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,550
I know The Hood's weakness.
I can stop him if we're in time.

781
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,194
Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust.

782
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,351
(All) Whoaaaa!

783
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,951
'Gordon, heat 'em up.'

784
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,833
(Screaming)

785
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:01,478
We're getting reports of an incident in London
involving the Thunderbirds. Lisa, are you there?

786
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,030
Chuck, Thunderbird 2
has made an impromptu landing,

787
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,594
causing total panic in Central London.

788
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,359
There has been no emergency call,

789
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,552
so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2
would be active here at all.

790
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,471
Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading
some kind of machine.

791
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:22,511
Set a course for the vault.

792
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,476
If we continue on our present course,
we'll sever the monorail's supports.

793
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,158
Shall I correct our position?

794
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,875
- Stay on course.
- But we'll cause a major disaster.

795
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,799
No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.

796
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,911
- Let's get her down, boys.
- lnitiate landing, Fermat.

797
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,080
'Three-point landing sequence: initiated.'

798
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,829
Retros at 75, flaps to 1 6.

799
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,154
FAB.

800
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,192
'Danger. Landing sequence: error.'

801
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,076
- You're going too fast.
- Thanks.

802
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,152
Retros to 90.

803
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,879
Textbook, boys.

804
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,717
Activating electromagnetic pulse
to disable the bank's security systems.

805
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,512
ETA, one minute.

806
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,234
- Parker, meet me at the Bank of London.
- 'Yes, milady.'

807
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,756
Ride it out, boys!

808
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,996
- The Hood's getting away.
- What are we gonna do, Alan?

809
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,669
We're the Thunderbirds.
Our duty is to save those people.

810
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,318
Brains, we're going into the accident zone.

811
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,270
'FAB, Thunderbird 2, and good luck.'

812
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,630
Brains, the monorail is down.
Repeat, the monorail is down.

813
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,357
I'm going underwater in Thunderbird 4.
You have the bridge.

814
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:58,188
- Me? Fly alone?
- The Thunderbirds need you right now.

815
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,435
I need you.

816
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,438
FAB, Alan.

817
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,278
'Manual control.'

818
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,918
- Brains, what's the situation?
- 'The Hood has caused a disaster.'

819
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,589
The mono...
one-track railway is in the Thames.

820
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,676
- Thunderbird 1?
- On the ground.

821
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,951
- Our kids are in Thunderbird 2.
- FAB. We're right behind 'em.

822
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,273
- Look at all this gold!
- Stay focused. Nine more banks to go.

823
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,957
Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4
in three...two...one...

824
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,072
Thunderbird 4 is go.

825
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,117
I can see the monorail.

826
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,033
Mummy!

827
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,511
Don't panic, guys.

828
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,158
'Extending magnetic claw.'

829
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,634
Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place.

830
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,798
- Can you get a line on that stanchion?
- I can't get a fix on the target.

831
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,992
- I might hit the passengers.
- I'll go and fix it myself.

832
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,155
- Swim?
- Get me as close as you can.

833
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,511
How are we doing on that line?

834
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,071
Just look out your window.

835
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,271
Come on, Tintin, come on!

836
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,671
Come on.

837
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,310
Come on, Tintin. You can do this.

838
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,391
Opening the airlock.

839
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,834
'Contact magnets: activated.'

840
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,396
- OK, Fermat, we need a lift.
- 'FAB, Alan.'

841
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,512
Commencing reverse thrust.

842
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,430
- That was amazing, Tintin.
- Thank you.

843
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,109
- 'Nice job, Fermat.'
- Nothing to it, really.

844
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,915
Easy does it.

845
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,398
There they are!

846
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,434
(Cheering)

847
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,309
- Glad you could join us.
- Don't get cocky after one mission.

848
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,114
We still have a dangerous situation.
Close down this accident scene.

849
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,628
Tintin, get Fermat. Meet us at Thunderbird 1.

850
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,593
Alan, you come with me.
We got to get to the Bank of London fast.

851
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,835
- Lady Penelope went after The Hood.
- She may need help.

852
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,633
Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds.

853
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,229
Lady Penelope. What an unpleasant surprise.

854
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,870
Don't be rude.

855
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,516
I can't tell you
what a pleasure it would be to pull this trigger.

856
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,630
- Now, don't move!
- Mullion.

857
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,678
- That's not cricket.
- I'm sorry.

858
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,439
The only part of sport I ever liked was winning.

859
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,994
How ghastly.

860
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:04,033
Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said,
about you leaving him to die.

861
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,713
- He was lying, right?
- No.

862
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,718
See, you can't save everyone, Alan.

863
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,752
It doesn't matter how hard you try
or how brave you are.

864
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,954
It doesn't matter if it's someone you love,
someone you'd give your life to save.

865
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,678
You just can't save everyone.

866
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,795
What was Mom like?

867
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,191
She was a lot like you.

868
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,316
Come on, we've got a job to do.

869
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,393
- Finish her off, Mullion.
- Shame on you.

870
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,114
I always despise a man
who delegates the important jobs.

871
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,911
Oh, dream on, sad act.

872
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,520
(Chuckles)

873
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,238
- Good timing, Parker. Come with us.
- My pleasure, Mr Tracy.

874
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,831
The Thunderbirds.

875
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,871
They're here.

876
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,479
Kill them all.

877
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,472
Alan, stay with Parker.
I'm gonna find Lady Penelope.

878
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,875
But what about The Hood?

879
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,795
Look out, Parker!

880
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,434
Master Tracy!

881
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,517
- Look out, Parker!
- That's enough of that.

882
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,915
Don't move.

883
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,755
- Go on, then.
- No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.

884
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,791
Allow me.

885
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,999
I've been waiting
to get my hands on you brats.

886
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:49,033
And I've been waiting to get my hands on you.

887
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,955
Aaaargh!

888
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,470
- Now, that was a punch.
- Parker, can we wrap this up?

889
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,193
What did you have in mind,
Master Hackenbacker?

890
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:08,631
Strategically speaking, the best odds
of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.

891
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,636
I concur.

892
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,111
- Penny!
- Jeff, no!

893
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,470
Did you save them all this time, Jeff?

894
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,033
- Or did you leave someone behind?
- I didn't make you what you are.

895
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,355
It's not me you have to convince.

896
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,635
- Leave my son out...
- Dad!

897
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,879
Dad! Dad!

898
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,358
I'm disappointed in you, Alan.

899
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,598
- I thought we were kindred spirits.
- Well, we're not.

900
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,030
- I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
- You certainly are.

901
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,679
Alan!

902
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,791
Come here, you little minx!

903
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,592
Ow!

904
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,759
Bye-bye.

905
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,992
Alan, stay back.

906
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,318
You want so desperately
to walk in Daddy's footsteps.

907
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,829
- Let him go.
- Did you really think you could challenge me?

908
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:45,031
- Let him go, please.
- Let him go.

909
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,750
Please. Let him go.

910
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,154
Alan! Are you all right?

911
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,395
Alan, get out. Run!

912
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,713
He's getting weaker. He can't last much longer.

913
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,751
Neither can you!

914
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,996
Alan, no!

915
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,436
Look out!

916
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,277
Alan!

917
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,798
I'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff.

918
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,755
Aaaargh!

919
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,156
Goodbye, Alan!

920
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,714
Aaaaaargh!

921
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,716
Stop!

922
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,314
Oh!

923
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,955
Leave me, Alan.

924
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,589
Leave me to die.

925
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,831
Like your father did.

926
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,070
I don't want to save your life.

927
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,476
But it's what we do.

928
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,995
See you soon, Jeff.

929
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,999
Now, that was definitely showing off.

930
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,189
- Hey, Scott.
- Get him!

931
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,911
- What does he put in these margaritas?
- It's a Tracy secret.

932
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,995
That's my boy!

933
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,755
One more week
and you'll be swimming like a f...f...f...

934
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,588
D...d...d... Sha...sha...sha...
Aquatic creature.

935
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,837
- Good job, Fermat.
- So, what do you think?

936
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,950
He's getting there.

937
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,911
Whoa, Tintin!

938
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,191
You're just really, um, blossoming.

939
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:52,357
Eugh! Did you say "blossoming"?

940
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,789
(Triangle ringing)

941
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,798
Gather round. I have an announcement to make.

942
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:04,188
Tonight is a special night. We're all together
because of three very special people.

943
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,471
Fermat, Tintin, Alan.

944
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,916
The world needs Thunderbirds
and the Thunderbirds need you.

945
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,633
- Mr Tracy!
- Thank you, sir.

946
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:30,475
Congratulations, Alan.
No short cuts. You earned it.

947
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,636
You all did.

948
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:37,515
I'm not an emotional man,
but sometimes even the toughest nut must crack.

949
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,120
- Way to go, sprout!
- That's my boy, Alan!

950
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,434
(Thunderbirds ringtone)

951
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,720
Yes, Madam President. I see.
Of course, straightaway.

952
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,035
Boys.

953
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,957
Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.

954
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,958
Of course it does. And quite right too.

955
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,078
Thunderbirds are go!

956
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,877
Fast as you can, Parker.

957
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,911
Certainly, milady.
