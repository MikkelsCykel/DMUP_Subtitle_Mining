00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,398
If

166
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,280
I don't like this house

167
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:45,664
Shit

168
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:49,117
I thought that it was in the bed

169
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,680
Because this open one my window, Max?

170
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,955
That they don't hear you the other ones to say my name.

171
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:04,667
Forgive me.
but sometimes one listens thing that he/she doesn't want

172
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,980
Vamonos. a the bed

173
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:33,464
Damned it is!
I broke the unfortunate one the insulin

174
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:35,086
Calm down.

175
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,582
It was in the trunk of the car,
I believe that he/she is stopped above

176
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:38,793
He didn't make it on purpose

177
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,350
Relax you friend.
when it is the next dose?

178
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:44,353
In the mornings... Right now, give me
the keys should see a pharmacy here.

179
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,193
There is one in the town but they don't know you,
he/she will bring us problems.

180
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,272
Then I will go to Portsmith.! Give me the keys!

181
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,959
Not we have time.
I have to meet with Jones at 5pm o'clock.

182
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,959
I told them that a single vehicle was bad idea.

183
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,803
The bad only idea was bringing to you.

184
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,709
Cuidado. calmate

185
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,559
Max accompanies him to Portsmith.

186
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:03,358
Do you have receta. todo what you need?

187
00:22:03,393 --> 00:22:03,929
If

188
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,991
This bien. vallase.

189
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:12,561
Come here damned!

190
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:13,202
No

191
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:20,130
He/she saw our faces

192
00:22:21,024 --> 00:22:22,804
Allow me to think a moment

193
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,036
Max, you assured the door
when you dressed him last night?

194
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:26,523
That she said?

195
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,915
That you made? him hablastes or something?

196
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,209
I swear that the tranque

197
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:38,819
Are you better than that. do you know that this means?

198
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:42,025
Perhaps he/she knows our names

199
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,687
A little bit más. OK there, stay there

200
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:41,499
OK well. are you hungry?

201
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:43,660
We have to return

202
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:47,155
Sidney won't believe that we take a long time
so little time

203
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:50,376
We go to drain even of hours to cover

204
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,475
OK

205
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:58,384
[Because they sowed wind,
and vortex will reap]

206
00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:06,019
If?

207
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:26,321
Boy you these behaving bad

208
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,708
Am I in problems?

209
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,107
Not the se. todo depends on you

210
00:24:31,589 --> 00:24:36,946
You believe that you can forget of
our faces, voices, names?

211
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:39,947
Because?

212
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,014
Because.

213
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:46,656
I go you to make a story

214
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,620
Some years behind I made a bank work.

215
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:55,921
everything went well
until the cashier worked the alarm

216
00:24:56,432 --> 00:25:05,514
And I noticed him/her that he/she doesn't play it...
But anyway he/she made it

217
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:12,123
My partner was forced to shoot him/her
in the head

218
00:25:12,536 --> 00:25:17,522
The bullet crossed him/her the head.
Bang, there you have it

219
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,867
Anybody likes informers

220
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:27,804
Pretty. that is?

221
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,959
The cashier's necklace.
it broke and the drops were watered in the floor

222
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:35,672
As it is that that knows?

223
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:39,020
Me you many things

224
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:43,877
And me you that your partner that I kill her was not

225
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:46,590
And that was what you counted to the police,

226
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:51,691
he/she has told the same story so many times
that now until your you believe it

227
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,005
And me you another thing

228
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,192
That what you know is?

229
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:04,758
You that this about to a heart attack

230
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,742
These being about getting scared?

231
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:26,651
That bad that the car not this.

232
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:33,687
I held

233
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:38,541
That was the plan, a car.
less complications

234
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:42,846
It seems that you will die Sidney here

235
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:47,747
In this cabin. in the disgusting floor

236
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:53,059
Sidney

237
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,066
Sidney

238
00:27:02,236 --> 00:27:07,077
I sit down it I mistook of I number

239
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:12,764
The boys arrived soon

240
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,304
No. we cannot leave them
to know where we are

241
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:37,269
Max is Sidney.
their heart, I sit down it a lot of Max

242
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:43,567
David this in the room. taenia fear to be alone

243
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:47,200
I sit down it for Mr. Braverman

244
00:27:55,818 --> 00:28:00,963
There are many spiders,
I thought that in the winter they hid.

245
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:03,293
Where the nest will be?

246
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,572
The land this very hard one to bury him

247
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:10,717
We go him to leave here even of days
then we take it with us.

248
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:36,130
The portion is bigger

249
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,445
This boy is bad luck

250
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,677
That we make now?

251
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:44,981
We have two options.
we leave it in the highway

252
00:28:45,304 --> 00:28:48,258
Then all this was for anything
and do we return to the poverty? For anything!

253
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,263
Or I speak with Jones and I finish the work

254
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,978
I assure that all this well and that he/she will pay us

255
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:57,799
If. and the portions are but big

256
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,075
Vince swears that if it was other.

257
00:29:03,482 --> 00:29:05,354
The part of Sidney is for the niece of the one.

258
00:29:06,671 --> 00:29:08,157
OK bien. ni way

259
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:09,892
Then you spoke with jones.

260
00:29:10,236 --> 00:29:14,245
Espera. pensé that this was for voting,
I choose us to allow it to go.

261
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,122
I have bad premonition with all this

262
00:29:16,345 --> 00:29:17,027
Max?

263
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,250
He/she takes this... for protection

264
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:38,985
That?. the goblins?

265
00:30:03,354 --> 00:30:04,900

269
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:30,321
A heart attack

270
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:33,469
That unfortunate.?does the boy continue I live?

271
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:35,044
Of course

272
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,993
I have a picture just in case the mother
he/she wants tests

273
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,548
That carajo? I go to have to take out him/her another

274
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:46,822

If an encrypted telephone
and an expert in electronic.

of Boston tomorrow to the half-day.

281
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:11,644

Without rakes. when this in the station

Then we have anything

Not necessarily.

291
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:38,318

292

00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:19,388
She said my name

329
00:34:21,173 --> 00:34:22,160
That this happening?

330
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:23,768
She said my name

331
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,202
Because you made that?

332
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:28,795

That these making?

334
00:34:34,016 --> 00:34:35,281
We lost them

335
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:37,678
Could they rake the call?

336
00:34:40,691 --> 00:34:41,768
No

337
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:44,646
I set it that you had to listen that

338
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:45,780
David this alive one?

339
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:48,345
It could not combine the voice, neither the location

340
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:49,884
This dead one?

341
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:51,065
Did they kill him?

342
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:53,291
Non sabemos. no has idea

That they want to make hour?

344

345
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:03,714
OK... that is everything

346
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:04,995
Don't play it

347
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:11,291
This well

348
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:12,791

00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:15,604
That these making Max?

350
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,594
Something that should have made a while ago.

351
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:21,861
And he/she stops to use my name.
or you want to be a dead boy

352
00:35:21,896 --> 00:35:23,620
Will I be first the?

00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,344
Taken care Max!

354
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:44,114
That carajo that was?

355
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:46,944
Did they see that?

356
00:35:58,564 --> 00:35:59,150
Max?

357
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,294
Not you can sleep?

358
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:48,310
Nightmares

359
00:36:49,463 --> 00:36:50,624
Do I accompany you?

360
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,838
Non thank you. I go out for while

361

363
00:37:45,078 --> 00:37:46,045

Who let you leave?

367
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:17,998
Nobody

368
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:19,857
Where this Max?

369
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:22,168
He/she left to speak with Jones

370
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:25,242
I am happy that he/she stays a day

371
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,288
Where this Roxane?

372
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:30,367
Because?

373
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:37,104
Escúchame. después of that of last night

374
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,511
You are not able to me matar. no this in you

375
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:51,151
Do you want to play?

376
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:12,203
Good morning love

377
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:21,705
Because he/she is not your girlfriend?
It seems that he likes you

378
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:23,098
And like it is that you know those things?

379
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:30,272
Last night I heard it through the walls praying

380
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:34,946
He/she was asking for forgiveness to god

381
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:40,490
For a secret. a secret that neither Max knows it

382
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:42,974
That I secrete?

383
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:53,965
"The body of a 17 year-old girl was
found in an abandoned" automobile

384
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:06,009
My God!

00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:10,340
Not return to make that

386
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:13,341
Did you hear that?

387
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,495
No

388
00:41:20,861 --> 00:41:22,111
Perhaps it is anything

389
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:27,939
That princess happens?

390
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:33,968
It is Sidney. podía to save him/her the life

391
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:37,766
Espera. no was your blame

392
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:41,234
Not it was your blame

393

Thank You Vince

394
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,055
At some time you have missed?

395
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,497
No

396
00:41:47,978 --> 00:41:48,997
I sometimes miss you

397
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:52,168
Cretin

398
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,033
You swore that you didn't go to say anything

399
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,016
A treatment is a treatment

400
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,340
But your these keeping secrets

401
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,590
Which secrets?

402
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:04,748
That of our bebe. yo you what you have made

403
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:06,269
As? I didn't say it to anybody

404
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:09,488
Si. pero had said it to me

405
00:42:12,232 --> 00:42:13,674
Vince was an error

406
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:19,382
This well.
alone I want to be once again with you.

407
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:23,678
Roxy. if Max discovers what you have made

408
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:28,186
Do you believe he/she would see you like a good mother?

409
00:42:45,406 --> 00:42:46,463
Our secret

410
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,339
Our secret

411
00:43:20,756 --> 00:43:22,178
The call was a disaster

412
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:25,708
Him you. we had problems with the boy

413
00:43:25,743 --> 00:43:28,757
I didn't request you a complete report

414
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:33,138
Obviously we don't go him to make today

415
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:35,362
Some reason for which travels 5 hours?

416
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:39,790
If you could provide the test of life
we would not be in this problem

417
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:42,859
Do you see that that this in front?

418
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:48,535
Do you see the square?
That was inspired by the death

419
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:50,097
And that he/she has to see that

420
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:55,665
He/she has to see everything.
hour there is alone an option, kill the boy

421
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,857
The plan went to kidnap the boy not to kill him

422
00:43:57,892 --> 00:43:59,819
The call was not well.
we will call another time

423
00:44:00,498 --> 00:44:03,465
The mother pagará. cualquier mother would pay

424
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:07,774
Not we have finished,
until you pay me, you understand.

425
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:11,011
No. entiéndeme to my Max,

426
00:44:11,012 --> 00:44:12,712

427
00:44:12,764 --> 00:44:15,071
Taenias that conciente of that possibility to be

428
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:17,378
I won't kill anybody
and less one 8 year-old boy

429
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,168
Obviously you don't know with the one who these trying

430
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:25,182
Jones looks I care a carajo who you are.
I don't go him to make

431
00:44:26,494 --> 00:44:28,604
Better I cut him/her the ear and he/she sent it to the mother.

432
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,359
That is less effective of that than you think

433
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:35,671
It returns the telephone and we will be
tomorrow for it finishes time in your restaurant

434
00:45:31,537 --> 00:45:32,563
Which the treatment is Jones?

435
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:35,870
Jones? Not I am Jones, not you of what you speak

436
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:37,618
And that carajo this is?

437
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:49,878
Not I am Jones. no I know any Jones

438
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:51,390
Then who my name is?

439
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:55,533
Somebody pays myself to take and to bring the telephone

440
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:00,113
Describe me the one that paid you

441
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:10,964
Because you made it?

442
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:32,205
Do you remind yourself?

443
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:38,159
That mono. regrésemela

444
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:40,958
I leave it to give to Max when he/she tells him/her

445
00:49:40,993 --> 00:49:42,300
Do tell him/her that?

446
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:43,607
Of you and Roxane

447

451
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:16,008
Where we go?

452

Do you see the trees?

455
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,473
I don't like this game

456
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,189
That you will cry?

457
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,042
I thought that he/she went him to need

458
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:52,673
No

459
00:50:57,312 --> 00:50:58,394
Do you have something more than to say?

460
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,291
Please you don't kill me

461

00:55:47,022 --> 00:55:48,692
Didn't you feel a little happy?

496
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:51,865
Happy?

497
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:55,444
You believe that what I pass Vince
does he/she make me happy?

498
00:55:56,511 --> 00:55:58,130
I see it in your eyes

499
00:55:59,763 --> 00:56:02,559
You that the eyes are the soul windows

500
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:23,793
David!

501
00:56:25,043 --> 00:56:26,609
Allow us even of minutes

502
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:28,109
Not there is problem Max

503
00:56:36,048 --> 00:56:37,188
Apologize that it was not

504
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:39,722
Not see Jones tomorrow

505
00:56:40,247 --> 00:56:41,462
I have to look for the money

506
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:44,908
No. cada time that you leave raisin something bad

507
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:46,812
We go to return to David tonight

508
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,704
Rox needs the money

509
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:52,579
That is what passes with "all we win",
your friends are dead

510
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:56,547
Not you what we have but me insomnia
and I hear things at night

511
00:56:56,748 --> 00:57:05,888
Calm my love. you look at me, almost we achieve it

512
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:13,099
Where this your ring?

513
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:17,689
I am cleaning it

514
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:24,674
Something walks not well here

515
00:57:25,656 --> 00:57:27,242
We leave tomorrow I promise it

516
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:58,801
Are you looking for this?

517
01:00:02,384 --> 01:00:04,209
Because it was your ring in the bed of Vince,
Rox?

518
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:05,910
Your non entiendes. te will explain

519
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:07,411
He made me

520
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,341
Did he/she make that?

521
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:12,661
Max.
you were not for 3 years and non taenia to anybody

522
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:15,557
And I made an error. Vince left it to say

523
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:20,401
Max

524
01:00:29,962 --> 01:00:30,947
Can I go with you max?

525
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,242
Max please allows to explain to me

526
01:00:39,663 --> 01:00:40,214
My love where you go?

527
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:41,186
To the meeting

528
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:42,088
At this hour?

529
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:42,883
I will arrive early

530
01:00:43,103 --> 01:00:44,546
You cannot leave me alone

531
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,424
Does Roxane know that you will kill me?

532
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:26,504
Curse

533
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:44,572
Mrs. he/she doesn't move

534
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:47,153
Are how many?

535
01:02:49,357 --> 01:02:50,320
I asked you a question

536
01:02:50,873 --> 01:02:51,944
I am alone

537
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:55,262
Shake hands me

538
01:03:00,886 --> 01:03:02,389
Mr. official you found me

539
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:05,358
I thought that they won't be

540
01:03:06,024 --> 01:03:07,151
Everything goes David to be well

541
01:03:08,127 --> 01:03:10,214
Sabes. la life is as a story

542
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:14,385
There is a beginning a mean and an end

543
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:22,105
The history is here Mister official

544
01:03:25,342 --> 01:03:26,764
Do you want to know like he/she finishes?

545
01:03:47,844 --> 01:03:49,750
[Police suspects that the boy this dead]

546
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:01,301
Because he/she has not told him/her of the cadavers
in the basement?

547
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:03,114
Not invent

548
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:05,877
Not there is he/she swims there below

549
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:09,131
To who you believe him/her?

550
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,523
Neither an it happened more

551
01:04:45,917 --> 01:04:46,561
Open the door

552
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:49,088
You go to be contained by a lot of time

553
01:04:53,259 --> 01:04:54,151
Mrs. he/she opens the door!

554
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:57,721
Better than you make something Roxane

555
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:00,322
In prison one cannot have a he/she drinks.

556
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:01,947
It is your oportunidad. abre finishes the door!

557
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:03,481
Last opportunity!

558
01:05:39,797 --> 01:05:41,069
Take away from mí. yo that man it kills

559
01:05:41,797 --> 01:05:43,206
Roxane didn't have remedy

560
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:44,900
Not he/she wanted him to die.

561
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:46,129
Of course that not

562
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:55,283
He/she left

563
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,074
I have had that all my life

564
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:08,060
That you are David?

565
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:10,762
I am an angel

566
01:06:15,397 --> 01:06:18,570
The voices in your dreams. that tell you?

567
01:06:20,617 --> 01:06:23,116
They tell me that they kill Max but me.

568
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:26,459
Their soul Roxane. he/she leaves to the hell

569
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,337
No. the hell doesn't exist

570
01:06:30,759 --> 01:06:34,574
It is something that the parents use to scare
to their children.

571
01:06:35,388 --> 01:06:37,651
The hell doesn't exist

572
01:06:37,902 --> 01:06:39,495
This sure one

573
01:06:41,792 --> 01:06:43,293
I sighted it Roxane

574
01:06:44,431 --> 01:06:46,652
The evil ones in eternal condemnation

575
01:06:50,404 --> 01:06:52,822
God will punish Max to be evil

576
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,527
Max is not evil

577
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:57,283
Still no. pero their intention is to kill me

578
01:06:57,831 --> 01:06:59,263
The murder of an angel

579
01:06:59,298 --> 01:07:00,488
Not never.

580
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:08,121
Eternal condemnation Roxane

581
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:11,602
Please David will make any thing

582
01:07:12,803 --> 01:07:14,399
Would you kill for the one?

583
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:16,645
To save him/her the soul?

584
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:21,832
Would you kill him to the one for the one?

585
01:07:40,274 --> 01:07:45,008
While you decide you help me with the fire
I am very small to play with matches.

586
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,410
Sam. aléjate of there

587
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:25,001
Our business this arriving at their end

588
01:08:26,093 --> 01:08:27,470
You that me these watching over

589
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,768
I will no longer play this game

590
01:08:30,185 --> 01:08:37,299
He/she looks. this is a treatment of businesses and you go her to
to fulfill a shot in the head

591
01:08:37,334 --> 01:08:38,869
That is not the business that I did

592
01:08:40,706 --> 01:08:45,691
As you dare to hang.
have you had 4 bad days with David, Max?

593
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:49,580
And that of the 8 my years?

594
01:08:55,918 --> 01:08:57,292
Are you Jones?

595
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:02,343
Is it enough for an initial payment, don't you believe?

596
01:09:02,841 --> 01:09:04,818
Not I will kill a boy

597
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,796
That is the last that is

598
01:09:07,216 --> 01:09:09,082
Do you believe that it is human?

599
01:09:17,348 --> 01:09:24,020
We have something in common your and me.
we have allowed to enter a wolf to our home

600
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:27,361
When I adopt it the he/she gave me the life
that I wanted

601
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:30,762
But he/she doesn't have neither he/she devises of what the one is
able to make

602
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:33,300
Or in the different ways in that
it can control you.

603
01:09:33,301 --> 01:09:35,101
I will give everything to come undone of the one

604
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:40,082
He is put in the head and he/she murmurs
bad thoughts

605
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:43,783
and he/she paints visions of those that you won't be able to escape.

606
01:09:43,858 --> 01:09:45,518
Their force this growing Max.

607
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:51,419
and I don't have idea that he/she goes to make in one year,
one week or right now

608
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,020
and he/she doesn't leave to stop

609
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:55,515
until we all are dead.

610
01:09:55,997 --> 01:10:00,602
Who him this taking care now?
It killed their father and it killed their nanny

611
01:10:00,603 --> 01:10:03,003
don't you believe that the maté to her?

612
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:09,232
Listen to me you the ruego. mátelo please

613
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:12,658
You chose the mistaken man

614
01:10:12,984 --> 01:10:14,221
Not please.

615
01:10:24,896 --> 01:10:25,951
Apologize

616
01:10:34,454 --> 01:10:36,547
Apologize

617
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:47,215
Do you hear it Roxane?

618
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:50,483
I hear that love

619
01:11:52,115 --> 01:11:53,850
The bad man comes closer

620
01:12:23,046 --> 01:12:24,031
Rox?

621
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:28,983
Rox!

622
01:12:30,486 --> 01:12:31,751
That you go him/her to make to David?

623
01:12:33,658 --> 01:12:34,567
Anything

624
01:12:38,173 --> 01:12:42,365
Max. dime that you forgive me

625
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:44,835
Of course I forgive you

626
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:05,992
Hide David!

627
01:13:41,795 --> 01:13:42,928
Loose the rifle Roxane

628
01:13:42,963 --> 01:13:45,024
We can leave of here and to forget everything

629
01:14:00,214 --> 01:14:00,970
Your

630
01:14:58,975 --> 01:14:59,695
David!

631
01:14:59,932 --> 01:15:00,723
No!

632
01:15:06,264 --> 01:15:06,732
Max!

633
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:09,630
Allow it to go max!

634
01:15:57,003 --> 01:15:58,137
David comes toward me!

635
01:15:58,606 --> 01:15:59,475
Salt of here Rox!

636
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:39,767
Good I throw Max

637
01:16:50,603 --> 01:16:52,041
My God Rox

638
01:16:57,192 --> 01:16:58,077
Rox cannot leave me

639
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,196
Don't listen to it

640
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:02,093
Rox forgives me

641
01:17:08,006 --> 01:17:08,711
Rox!

642
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,693
OH not!

643
01:17:13,718 --> 01:17:14,445
Rox!

644
01:17:24,804 --> 01:17:26,040
Not not not

645
01:17:27,867 --> 01:17:29,600
I am beginning now

646
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:34,931
Poor Roxane thought that I was an angel

647
01:17:35,891 --> 01:17:37,217
Not you can kill an angel

648
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:41,187
A demon if

649
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,341
Ah... a demon is a fallen angel

650
01:17:44,795 --> 01:17:46,809
As you you will fall Max

651
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:49,671
Because you are so sad murderer?

652
01:17:49,672 --> 01:17:54,672
These in the winning team,
without commandments, without blame.

653
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,205
They sent me for those that are desperate

654
01:18:03,919 --> 01:18:05,544
I come to them when they are weak

655
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:08,108
When they don't have hopes

656
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,780
When those that love the it rejects

657
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:22,644
I go where them
and I whisper to the hearing and I convince them.

658
01:18:27,988 --> 01:18:29,286
Because David?

659
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:32,166
Because all this?

660
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:34,118
Fishing souls Max

661
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:35,551
It is it I make

662
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:37,392

664

You are as weak as the other ones

665
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,441
So put on the gun in the head

666
01:18:51,341 --> 01:18:52,150
Make it

667
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:55,395
Or you will hear me every day of your life

668
01:19:07,094 --> 01:19:08,666

674
01:21:55,005 --> 01:21:55,934
