1
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:24,040
What are you reading?

2
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,678
"The Overcoat" by Gogol.

3
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,780
- Gogol?
- Yes.

4
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:02,245
- Been out of this world?
- Yes. I went to Delhi once.

5
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,515
Every year I visit my
grandfather in Jamshedpur.

6
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,752
No, no, no. Not this world.

7
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,222
I mean England, America.

8
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,424
I was in England for two years.

9
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:16,726
It was like a dream.

10
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:19,763
The sparkling King Street!

11
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,498
Nobody speak in Urdu.

12
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,401
Have you ever thought of going abroad?

13
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,237
- No.
- You should.

14
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,506
You are young. You are free.

15
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:40,250
You will never regret it.

16
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:43,620
My grandfather always says
that it's what books are for.

17
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,923
You travel without moving an inch.

18
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,227
Good.

19
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:04,937
Hurry! Go and prepare yourself.

20
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,673
There is someone waiting to see you.

21
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,290
Watch and learn, Rini.

22
00:06:36,202 --> 00:06:37,637
She is fond of cooking

23
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:39,372
...and she can knit well.

24
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,342
She made a cardigan for me in one week.

25
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:47,814
She is the children's favorite Auntie.

26
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:16,042
She has been learning
classical music since childhood.

27
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,549
Here she is.

28
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:48,975
My son has been living abroad

29
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:50,276
for the last two years.

30
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:54,681
He's in New York. He has done his Ph.D.

31
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,289
Our daughter's best subject is English.

32
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:08,328
Won't you recite something for us?

33
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:20,974
I wandered lonely as a cloud

34
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:24,844
that floats on high
over waves and hills.

35
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,780
When all at once I saw a cloud

36
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:30,450
a host to golden daffodils.

37
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:36,022
This is my father's favorite poem.

38
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:38,124
Poetry was the love of my father.

39
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,693
Oh, sit down please.

40
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:45,665
My child,

41
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:48,334
have you ever flown in a plane?

42
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:53,573
will you be able to go
half way across the world,

43
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,075
live in a cold city

44
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,878
<i>with freezing winters,</i>

45
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,882
leaving your friends
and family far behind?

46
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,253
Won't you become lonely?

47
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:14,160
Won't he be there?

48
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:30,910
Come to me.

49
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:34,280
Your life is about to change.

50
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,283
Embrace the new, don't forget the old...

51
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:41,254
and your new life... enjoy it fully!

52
00:09:58,738 --> 00:09:59,839
Let me see her.

53
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,244
Are you there?

54
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,895
<i>It's freezing cold outside.</i>

55
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,308
You are going out?

56
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:18,778
I have to be away for
three weeks. I have to.

57
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,852
How are you feeling?

58
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:31,024
It will take you 7 hours to recover.

59
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,761
After all, you have just flown...
half way around the world.

60
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:38,364
Go lie down. I will bring you tea.

61
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,767
Go.

62
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,369
It is the American way.

63
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:45,939
Go.

64
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,206
Go, go.

65
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:49,776
I can't.

66
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:52,178
Okay then, sit and watch.

67
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:56,349
Here we get gas 24 hours a day.

68
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,720
This is how you turn it on.

69
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,139
Hot and cold water too.

70
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:07,510
There are two taps,
red one and blue one.

71
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:09,912
Don't confuse between the
two. You will get burned.

72
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:12,481
And you will bring water
straight from the tap.

73
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:13,983
No need to boil it.

74
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,652
And the washing machine
is there, down the street.

75
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,154
I will show you when I come home.

76
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:25,194
Now

77
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,704
Once you are settled, I will
take you to my department

78
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,206
and introduce you to
my office over here.

79
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:38,975
You won't believe it.

80
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:43,546
Our rickshaw drivers dress
better than the professors here.

81
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:08,231
I am very happy

82
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:11,100
and everything here is wonderful.

83
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,470
The plane journey was
long but enjoyable

84
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:16,439
and I am feeling fine.

85
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,140
How is Rini?

86
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,910
The house is very nice.

87
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:23,312
Big, with lots of windows.

88
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,484
Do you know, over here they
get has all day and all night?

89
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,358
all these have shrunk.

90
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,293
Who asked you to wash my clothes?

91
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,495
Why didn't you just
wait till I came back?

92
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:41,996
Here one dollar is 8 rupees.

93
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,533
And we don't have so
much money to buy...

94
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,334
Where are you going?

95
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:54,610
Ashima?

96
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,681
Open the door, Ashima.

97
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,159
I am sorry, Ashima.

98
00:16:11,227 --> 00:16:12,628
It is my fault.

99
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:15,932
Your intention was good but it
was my mistake not to tell you.

100
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,100
Ashima, please, open the door.

101
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,369
My Ashima.

102
00:16:21,037 --> 00:16:24,507
<i>My Ashima, crazy Ashima,
open the door, Ashima.</i>

103
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,076
Oh my dear, open the door.

104
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:29,378
Please.

105
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:32,682
<i>Crazy girl.</i>

106
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:42,941
Don't smile.

107
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,146
Come on, smile now.

108
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:50,516
Smile please.

109
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:05,697
Take 1 or 3 train.

110
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:06,898
From here...

111
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,668
all the way to...

112
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,770
Fulton Street.

113
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:14,206
Get out of the station, ask anybody...

114
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:17,209
Where is the Fulton fish market?

115
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,649
And if I get lost?

116
00:17:24,683 --> 00:17:27,553
You think I'd let you get lost?

117
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,818
What happened?

118
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:14,526
Come.

119
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:18,464
Come to me.

120
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:19,591
Do you have a longer frock?

121
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,093
What was that?

122
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:23,128
I mean... till here?

123
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,798
You hide those gorgeous legs!

124
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,201
Lets hide them under the covers here.

125
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:34,139
Time of contractions.

126
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,836
Rana! Hey Rana!

127
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:31,797
all there.

128
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,632
I have already checked.

129
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:40,539
His eyes are black as a blackberry.

130
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:44,476
Black as his hair.

131
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:51,917
How are you feeling? Was it alright?

132
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:11,036
His cute voice is the
first miracle of my life.

133
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:14,006
You are the second one.

134
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,756
Mrs. Ganguly? I am Mr. Wilcox.

135
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:34,259
What do you want to name the baby?

136
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:37,296
My husband is going to name him.

137
00:22:37,763 --> 00:22:39,031
He's asking about the baby's name.

138
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,435
We are waiting for my
wife's grandmother to choose.

139
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:45,237
will she be here soon?

140
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:49,441
She is in India. She is
more than 85 years old.

141
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:50,975
But there is no hurry.

142
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:53,946
Some of my cousins, you know, were
not named till they were 6 years old.

143
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,648
Until then, they were
called by their 'that' number.

144
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:58,784
- 'That' means?
- Pet names.

145
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:01,620
We all have two names.
One pet name: Daduna.

146
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,756
One good name: Haroona.

147
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:05,491
Unfortunately in this country,

148
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:07,593
a baby cannot be released
from a hospital without

149
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:10,262
a birth certificate and a birth
certificate requires a name.

150
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:13,599
How about... Baby Boy Ganguly?

151
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,034
Baby One?

152
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:20,272
Till the letter arrives.
Afterwards, will you change it?

153
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:22,506
In fact, what we should do?

154
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,544
I wouldn't. Too much
red tape. Expensive too.

155
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:27,946
Sleep on it.

156
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:31,784
Baby Boy Ganguly?

157
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:45,030
What do you say?

158
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:47,032
We could call him Gogol.

159
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:52,404
Till the letter arrives.
Later we could change it.

160
00:23:57,743 --> 00:24:00,646
We would not be here
but for Gogol's blessings.

161
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:05,184
Hold still. Hold still!

162
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,885
Don't move!

163
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:11,256
One... two... three... say cheese!

164
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:18,564
Uncle! Auntie! Look, Gogol!

165
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:24,903
- Did this just come in?
- Yes!

166
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:32,711
How beautiful!

167
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:39,885
Rana, look, Ashima's son! Gogol!

168
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:43,655
Lady-killer!

169
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:53,799
I want to go home.

170
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:58,504
I don't want to raise Gogol
in this lonely country.

171
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:07,513
This is the land of opportunity, Ashima.

172
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:11,817
He can become whatever he
wants, study whatever he desires.

173
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:14,520
Here the options are limitless.

174
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,522
Don't you want to give him that?

175
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:30,769
Thank you.

176
00:25:31,537 --> 00:25:32,671
You're welcome.

177
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,512
Come, come.

178
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,227
Don't go so far that I cannot see you!

179
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:57,396
He is too little.

180
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:19,017
Welcome to Suburbia. It's a
beautiful house. Congratulations.

181
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:22,221
Everything is bought in the yard sale.

182
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:25,190
Ashima does not like it but I say
what is wrong with it, you know.

183
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:28,794
Even my chairman, who
lives in a huge mansion,

184
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:31,263
wears a trouser bought for 50 cents.

185
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,107
Gogol.

186
00:26:43,742 --> 00:26:44,943
Where are you?

187
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,414
Hey Gugli!

188
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,388
He is probably feeling
left out because of

189
00:26:56,423 --> 00:26:58,490
his sister Sonia's ceremony.

190
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,893
Is he going to be Gogol in school?

191
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:02,895
No. We have decided on a good name.

192
00:27:03,395 --> 00:27:05,030
Finally! What is it?

193
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:06,966
- Nikhel!
- No!

194
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:14,373
Gogol!

195
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,643
Hey Gogol.

196
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:19,411
He's here!

197
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,881
Missing your sister's ceremony, eh?

198
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,051
I found him!

199
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:39,064
What will your baby girl’s future be?

200
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,934
Her future will soon be revealed.

201
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,940
Hey Sonia!

202
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,542
Pick up the pan.

203
00:27:55,514 --> 00:27:57,549
American girl! Must be weak!

204
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:16,135
So, how did you like your
first day in big school?

205
00:28:16,735 --> 00:28:18,337
Great!

206
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:20,773
And what is this?

207
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:27,646
"Due to your son's preference,

208
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,849
he will be known as Gogol in school",

209
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:34,019
Mrs. Lacidus Princeton.

210
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:42,928
And what about your parents' preference?

211
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,802
In this country, the children decide.

212
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,505
He wants to keep Gogol and
not Nikhel as his good name.

213
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,442
Fine. No big deal.

214
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:02,615
If he prefers the name Jimmy,
there's nothing we can do.

215
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:05,784
As long as our kid is happy, you know.

216
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:17,496
It's so late.

217
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,501
Hello? Hello?

218
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,406
Hello? Ashuda?

219
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,142
Can you hear me, Ashoka?

220
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,646
I have terrible news.

221
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:35,514
What?

222
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,184
I can't tell my sister.

223
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:42,721
Don't... don't worry. I will...

224
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:49,628
He told you something
you are not telling me?

225
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,440
Yesterday, Rini and your
father were playing on his bed.

226
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,109
He died of heart attack.

227
00:30:23,762 --> 00:30:25,564
Be calm, Ashima.

228
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:29,068
At least he went peacefully.

229
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:19,652
Come on or we'll miss
the plane. Come on.

230
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:31,997
I can't go.

231
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:35,534
I can't bare to see them in mourning.

232
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,903
You can't be this way.

233
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:43,575
Think of your mother.
Think of your son.

234
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,579
They need you to be strong.

235
00:32:19,244 --> 00:32:22,481
Not your ordinary guy.
You can write Gogol.

236
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:24,650
Gogol is your namesake.

237
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,153
Today, he is respected
as one of Russia's

238
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,923
most brilliant writers
but in his own lifetime,

239
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:32,623
he was understood by no one.

240
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:36,795
Mr. Gogol himself might say
that he was an eccentric genius.

241
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,797
Gargle, way to go!

242
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:42,968
Mr. Ecks, Dean, I'll
see you both after class.

243
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,970
Thank you. Out! Come on, out!

244
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:50,909
Thank you, gentlemen.

245
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:56,682
Gogol was reputed to be a hypochondriac.

246
00:32:56,949 --> 00:32:59,652
He was deeply paranoid, frustrated,

247
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:01,587
friendless, he never married,

248
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:03,489
and he fathered no children.

249
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:05,991
Towards the end of his life,

250
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:09,695
he proceeded to commit
slow suicide by starvation.

251
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:14,967
Did you guys know all the stuff
about him when you named me?

252
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,903
That he was paranoid,
suicidal, friendless, depressed?

253
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:22,074
You forgot to mention
that he was also a genius.

254
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,746
I don't understand why you guys
named me after someone so strange.

255
00:33:28,147 --> 00:33:29,715
Don't talk back to your father.

256
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:31,917
And don't call us guys.

257
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,854
When I close my eyes
and listen to you both,

258
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:38,090
I feel like I've given
birth to strangers.

259
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,495
Just because you are graduating does
not mean you can behave like this, Gogol.

260
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:56,507
So, I am two inches away from her.

261
00:33:57,108 --> 00:33:59,043
Her luscious lips part.

262
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:01,512
And just as I am about to kiss her,

263
00:34:02,046 --> 00:34:04,816
she looks at me and she says,

264
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:07,118
"What's your name?"

265
00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:12,056
Gogol Ganguly. End of seduction 101!

266
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:17,028
Jane loves your name. Gogol Gangu Lolly!

267
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,698
Don't you even go there, man.

268
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:24,202
Of all the freaking Russian
writers in the universe,

269
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:30,041
why'd they have to go
and choose the weirdest?

270
00:34:30,575 --> 00:34:32,543
What the hell is wrong
with Leo or Antwerp?

271
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:35,813
You know, I just want
to sit them down and be like,

272
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:38,850
Gogol is your favorite
author, don't mind...

273
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:41,751
- ... shit!
- What?

274
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:44,122
I have to think! Oh shit!

275
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,229
Good bye, Air India!

276
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:01,805
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

277
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:03,641
They have been here for two hours!

278
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,646
- This is our son, Gogol.
- Sorry I'm late.

279
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:13,484
Mr. and Mrs. Majunda. They just
moved in to New York from London.

280
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:28,566
They are of the same age also.

281
00:35:30,101 --> 00:35:31,636
Oh I am sure.

282
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:33,703
Hi.

283
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:35,205
Hi.

284
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,941
What're you reading?

285
00:35:36,974 --> 00:35:38,076
Mo Jou Priestess.

286
00:35:38,676 --> 00:35:39,777
In French.

287
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:42,080
You want to go watch some TV?

288
00:35:44,582 --> 00:35:46,150
I detest American television.

289
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:49,687
Gogol, come here.

290
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:53,091
Come, my boy, eat something. Eat

291
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,529
Why are your eyes so red?

292
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:07,605
Ashima, give me some chilies.

293
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:20,718
Mosi, I promise you there are no
evil eyes in the Unites States of America.

294
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:22,820
That is what you think.

295
00:36:23,254 --> 00:36:24,922
You be careful where you are going.

296
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,091
- What is the name?
- Hale.

297
00:36:28,993 --> 00:36:33,264
There'll be plenty of girls in this
Hale place who would want to trap you.

298
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:36,601
Have as much fun as you want.

299
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:40,938
But... marry a Bengali!

300
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:15,707
- How do you feel now?
- Yeah, I am good.

301
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:18,209
- Thank you.
- Good.

302
00:37:20,878 --> 00:37:21,979
Listen.

303
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,251
I have never given any presents
apart from what your mother buys but

304
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:30,722
for your graduation I
have something special.

305
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,030
Thanks, father.

306
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,970
I ordered this just for
you from the book store.

307
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:07,757
I hope you like it.

308
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:09,759
Very nice.

309
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:30,748
You know, I feel a
special kinship with Gogol

310
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:32,717
more than with any other writer.

311
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,853
You know why?

312
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:39,490
Yes. Gogol is your favorite
author. I know, Baba.

313
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:42,927
No, apart from that.

314
00:38:44,028 --> 00:38:47,732
He spent most of his adult
life outside his homeland.

315
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,102
- Like me.
- Right.

316
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:55,639
But...

317
00:38:57,775 --> 00:39:00,912
there... there is another reason.

318
00:39:09,721 --> 00:39:11,789
- Hello?
- Hmm?

319
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:14,459
What's the other reason?

320
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,231
No other reason.

321
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:32,143
Okay. Good night.

322
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:34,445
Good night, Baba.

323
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,855
We all came out of Gogol's Overcoat.

324
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,525
One day you will understand it.

325
00:39:49,193 --> 00:39:50,995
Your attention please.

326
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:55,299
India Airlines announces the departure
of its flight IT-408 to Calcutta

327
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:03,007
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of
the Indian Airlines and the captain,

328
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:04,876
we hope you enjoy your flight.

329
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:06,204
Take off the luggage.

330
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:08,272
- Gogol!
- Hi, Dadi Ma!

331
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:14,212
<i>Take her size!</i>

332
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:26,124
Go buy two pairs of slippers from Bata.

333
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:29,627
Please take your present.

334
00:41:43,741 --> 00:41:45,810
For you, mother-in-law.
A sweet for a sweet.

335
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:02,927
What's wrong with you?

336
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:05,129
I want to go home!

337
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,700
I have something else
to cheer you up with.

338
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,003
Here.

339
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:17,542
The calendar says that there
are only... 89 days left to go.

340
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:23,548
What is wrong with you? What
are you? Hot or hot here?

341
00:42:23,948 --> 00:42:25,950
- Have some ancient air conditioning.
- Go away!

342
00:42:46,003 --> 00:42:47,103
You are going out?

343
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:49,272
Jogging!

344
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,709
- Jogging?
- Running. On the street.

345
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,344
I'm training.

346
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,246
- Training?
- Yes.

347
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:59,016
Don't worry, Dadi Ma. I won't go far.

348
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:05,456
Quick. follow the young master.

349
00:43:05,523 --> 00:43:08,192
He's gone running on the
streets. Keep an eye on him!

350
00:43:08,226 --> 00:43:09,092
Can you do that?

351
00:43:09,093 --> 00:43:10,928
I can do anything. I know English.

352
00:43:46,964 --> 00:43:48,566
Why have you been following me?

353
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:23,935
There is something I always
wanted to ask you but...

354
00:44:24,302 --> 00:44:26,270
never had the courage.

355
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:29,540
all these years ago, why did you...

356
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,609
say yes to me?

357
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,712
You were the best of the lot.

358
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,886
At that time, the
widower with 4 children

359
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:44,689
and then compromise with one.

360
00:44:48,092 --> 00:44:50,762
I also liked your shoes.

361
00:44:53,264 --> 00:44:55,199
Oh, okay.

362
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:03,941
You want me to say... I love you?

363
00:45:05,276 --> 00:45:06,878
Like the America?

364
00:45:11,282 --> 00:45:12,517
Yes.

365
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:14,352
Yes.

366
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:31,269
I am soaking, Sonia. You actually
look better than after I shoot you.

367
00:45:31,736 --> 00:45:32,836
Shut up!

368
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:38,109
Why don't you get in, my American
sahib? Sonia can sit on my lap.

369
00:45:39,143 --> 00:45:41,279
Being pulled by another human
being is for feudal lords.

370
00:45:41,312 --> 00:45:44,082
I don't want to be part
of anything like that.

371
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:48,619
Ma!

372
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:53,758
Get ready, we are going tomorrow.

373
00:45:55,727 --> 00:45:57,729
We have gone to the
Garden a hundred times.

374
00:45:57,895 --> 00:46:00,064
To Agra, to see the Taj Mahal.

375
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:02,166
Are you serious? You're not kidding?

376
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:05,269
- That's awesome, Ma!
- Oh good!

377
00:46:05,303 --> 00:46:07,438
It's a wonder of the world.

378
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:33,031
We should have had taken a plane.

379
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:35,500
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

380
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,535
What is fine?

381
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:27,178
I've always wanted
to come here with you.

382
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:38,690
<i>Just imagine how much Shah
Jahan must have loved Mumtaz.</i>

383
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:41,059
To make this for her.

384
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,029
Other husbands also
love their wives, Ashima.

385
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:49,567
Only we cannot afford
to build Taj Mahal.

386
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:54,604
Hey, guess what.

387
00:48:55,573 --> 00:48:56,908
I really want to major in architecture.

388
00:48:57,508 --> 00:48:58,643
What about engineering?

389
00:48:59,077 --> 00:49:01,479
Come on, Baba.
Architecture has everything.

390
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:03,815
It's got engineering,
drawing, aesthetics.

391
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,518
Our family Shah Jahan!

392
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:27,038
Let's go, Sonia.

393
00:50:06,511 --> 00:50:07,612
Look!

394
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:09,013
Gangrene!

395
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:12,650
What the...!

396
00:50:16,754 --> 00:50:18,656
I am going to catch the
racist punk who did that!

397
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,710
So, I have been thinking
a lot about my name.

398
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:45,550
Gogol's fine. I might
have got used to it.

399
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:49,821
But too much of Gogol in a resume
or credit card after that!

400
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:53,124
What are you trying to say?

401
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,128
I'd like to change my
name back to my good name.

402
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:03,534
What is done is done. Now
Gogol has become your good name.

403
00:51:03,735 --> 00:51:04,836
It's too complicated
now. You're too old.

404
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:08,706
Anyways, you have
only yourself to blame.

405
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,709
Oh yeah! My fault that
I was four years old?

406
00:51:12,043 --> 00:51:13,144
That's right, Kaalu.

407
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,583
Everything is possible in America.

408
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:21,052
Do as you wish.

409
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,273
I'm home.

410
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,643
- Hi Nick.
- Hello.

411
00:52:18,976 --> 00:52:20,244
Hi dear. How're you doing?

412
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:22,914
- Have you got it?
- Yes.

413
00:52:29,754 --> 00:52:32,090
- Congratulations!
- Thank you, Daddy.

414
00:52:35,293 --> 00:52:38,629
Thank you all so much for
coming. This means so much to me.

415
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:41,032
Drinks! To celebrate!

416
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:49,640
- Hey.
Hi.

417
00:53:01,185 --> 00:53:03,821
- You like it?
- Yeah, its beautiful!

418
00:53:07,258 --> 00:53:10,194
Oh, I want you to meet
the young Indian architect

419
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,061
who has so captured Max's heart.

420
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:16,067
This is Pam Bridge, my dear college
friend, and this is Nikool Ganguly.

421
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:17,435
How do you do?

422
00:53:18,836 --> 00:53:20,938
It's very nice to meet you.

423
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:22,172
You're always welcome.

424
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:24,742
How big were you when
you moved to America?

425
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:26,778
I was actually born in
New York. I am from here.

426
00:53:27,045 --> 00:53:31,749
I once had a girlfriend who went
to India. Came back thin as a rail.

427
00:53:31,783 --> 00:53:32,884
Sure.

428
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,558
Do your parents want you
to marry a nice Indian girl?

429
00:53:42,026 --> 00:53:43,594
I don't care what they want.

430
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,733
This is what I want.

431
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:12,724
Sally gave them to me before
anybody could check them out.

432
00:54:17,495 --> 00:54:20,965
What perks I get from
my wife the librarian!

433
00:54:24,168 --> 00:54:25,636
What are you? Blind?

434
00:54:32,744 --> 00:54:34,912
You have to learn to drive faster.

435
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:37,181
Don't talk to me. I
will have an accident.

436
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:41,486
If you keep on driving like
this, you will have an accident.

437
00:54:53,561 --> 00:54:54,996
Everything is fine, Ma.

438
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:58,133
- Ma, why did you call me?
- Hey Hon.

439
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,701
You are not at your apartment.

440
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,570
You are never at your apartment, Gogol.

441
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:06,007
In the middle of the night I have
called, and you are not there.

442
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:09,177
I am, Ma. I need my sleep.
I turned off the phone.

443
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,481
- Gogol, are you there?
Yeah, yeah, I am here.

444
00:55:14,716 --> 00:55:16,251
I want you to come home next Saturday.

445
00:55:16,985 --> 00:55:18,987
Then you can come with us
to the airport the next day.

446
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:21,923
Papa is going to teach
in Ohio for six months.

447
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:23,258
Do you remember or not?

448
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:24,559
Yeah I remember, Mom.

449
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:26,227
But what's the big deal?
He's only going to Cleveland.

450
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:27,896
Sonia is not coming home?

451
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,864
Sonia is in California, Gogol.

452
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:33,735
Mom, I can't come home on this weekend.

453
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,037
I am going on a vacation
with my girlfriend.

454
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:38,106
Her parents have come with us to stay.

455
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:42,877
Mom?

456
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:53,877
