00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,550
Oh my dear, I'm so lonely

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,634
Hurry back, hurry back

4
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,915
Oh my love, hurry back, I'm yours

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,356
Return to me

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,235
For my heart wants you only

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,198
Hurry home, hurry home

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,071
Won't you please hurry home
to my heart?

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,069
My darlin'

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,674
If I hurt you I'm sorry

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,679
Forgive me

12
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,474
And please say you are mine

13
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,794
Return to me

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,389
Please come back, bella mia

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,840
Hurry back, hurry home

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,556
To my arms, to my lips, to my heart

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,238
Shame we've got to put roofs on 'em.

18
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,636
All right, Bill, I'm goin' home.
See you, buddy.

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,199
Solo tu, solo tu,
solo tu, solo tu, mio cuor

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,235
- See you, Big Mike.
- Hey, Bob. Have fun tonight.

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,676
As always!

22
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,793
So this is what I'm gonna say -
I'm gonna get up on the podium

23
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,869
and I'm gonna say,
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,197
"Tonight I'm speaking on behalf
of my friend Sydney..."

25
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,154
And, um... Sydney, I'm really nervous.

26
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,635
- But do you care?
- Liz?

27
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,756
I knew I'd find you here.

28
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Sydney, how you doin', brother?

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,315
I need your signature here
so I can change the polar bear's diet.

30
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,473
It's already five. I'll check the calf.
Just go home and get ready, OK?

31
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,912
Thanks. Bob's picking up my dress, I have
stockings, I have to take Mel for a run.

32
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,508
My hair, make-up... God, I'm so nervous!

33
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,158
You'll be fine. At the worst you forget your
speech and we don't get any donations.

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,397
- Don't even say that.
- Just kiddin'.

35
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,116
Oh, look at him, Charlie.
We'd go nuts in a place this small.

36
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,118
I know. But we're workin' on it.

37
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,035
Wish me luck, Sydney.

38
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,190
He only does that with you.

39
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,549
- Who are you bringing tonight?
- Haven't decided. Still got two hours.

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,554
Don't shake.

41
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,511
No, no, no, don't!

42
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,712
Oh, wet dog.
Come on, let's do it. Wet doggie!

43
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,998
Good boy! You hungry? Let's eat.

44
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,438
Let's go, Mel. She'll be home any minute.

45
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,032
Come on. Come on and eat. Let's eat.

46
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,796
Ooh, this looks good!

47
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,275
Go get some dinner. Come on, come on!

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,671
Dinner! Come on!

49
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,474
All right, she'll be home in a minute.

50
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,519
- Hi, my baby!
- Hey, babe.

51
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,553
Hey, honey! It's pouring out.

52
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,031
- Did you get my dress?
- Yeah, picked it up from the cleaners.

53
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,157
We're on schedule.

54
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,556
Mel, I'm so nervous.

55
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,874
I took Mel out.

56
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,312
In your tux?
Honey, your pants are soaked.

57
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,437
- Tell Mel to eat.
- Mel, eat!

58
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,950
You are cute!

59
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,271
Spend all day with an ape,
what do you expect?

60
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,230
Under our care at Lincoln Park Zoo

61
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,354
Sydney has regained his strength
and maintained excellent health.

62
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,517
Over the years Sydney has become
a part of the family.

63
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,392
Here he is with my husband.

64
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,590
My husband's the one on the right.

65
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,588
With the generous donations
we've received tonight,

66
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,078
along with continued
fund-raising, hint hint,

67
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,309
I hope - we hope - to expand
the gorilla habitat to triple its size.

68
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,117
Thank you all for your tremendous
support, and enjoy the evening.

69
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,236
Elizabeth Rueland.
Thank you, Dr Rueland.

70
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,590
Let's hear it for the doctor.

71
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,635
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Mr Joey Gian!

72
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,398
Good evening.

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,958
Speaking of animals, the band and I
have worked up something special.

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,036
So let's get this party started.

75
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,314
In the village, the peaceful village,
the lion sleeps tonight

76
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,355
In the village, the quiet village,
the lion sleeps tonight

77
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,075
Wimoweh, wimoweh,
wimoweh, wimoweh

78
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,073
"What do you expect most
from a relationship?"

79
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,830
"A) Companionship,
B) Sex or C) Respect?"

80
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,238
I'd go with B, but let's put C so we get
a higher score. What do you think?

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,112
I think...

82
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,111
What do you need? Is it your neck?
I'll move the pillow.

83
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,360
Your back? I can raise you up.

84
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,391
Rosebud.

85
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,588
Very funny. You almost gave me
a heart attack - excuse the expression.

86
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,550
Meg, you can go home.

87
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,399
To what? My cable's out.

88
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,193
Joe and the kids.

89
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,799
They're OK.

90
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,515
It's good for him to be with them when
they're comin' down from the sugar.

91
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,349
He usually fuels them up
and then they detox on my shift.

92
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,948
Well, you've seen it!

93
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,433
Promise me
you'll take care of my grandpa.

94
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,551
What's got you talkin' like that?

95
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,590
I may never get a heart. You know?

96
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,510
I know you'll get one. I know.

97
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,636
You'll be able to do things you were
never able to. Concentrate on that.

98
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,479
Think about it, Grace.
Picture ridin' a bike.

99
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,511
Yeah, ridin' a bike.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,834
That's what you need to think about.
Travelling, painting in Europe

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,919
and dating handsome men!
It's got to happen to one of us.

102
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,508
I'm getting a new heart, not a new ass.

103
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,677
Bob!

104
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,234
Bob... excuse me... Bob Rueland!

105
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,188
Mr Bennington. I didn't see you
or I would have stopped and said hello.

106
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,471
- Elizabeth's speech was wonderful.
- I'll go tell her that.

107
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,559
I suppose she told you about
our sizeable donation?

108
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,191
- My... Mrs...
- Mrs Bennington?

109
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,114
My wife gave, you know...
strictly anonymously.

110
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,999
Of course. Very generous.
I'll let Elizabeth know.

111
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,911
We also gave a chunk to the rainforest.
And before I knew it, I was on a safari!

112
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,516
Can you imagine me on safari, Bob?

113
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,274
No, I cannot.

114
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,870
I was. Me and the missus,
hackin' through the bush.

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,710
- Charlie?
- Hey, Bob! Mr Bennington!

116
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,037
Charlie, did you hear about
my sizeable donation?

117
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,958
The anonymous one. Yes, I have.

118
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,473
- She loves this song.
- Apparently.

119
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,389
- We don't want keep you, so...
- Stay, I'm going to put on more lipstick.

120
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,192
Is that possible?

121
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,554
- I'll go with you.
- To the ladies' room?

122
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,549
You got big news for Mr B, don't you?
Mr B, Charlie's got big news for you.

123
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,750
- What news?
- What are you...?

124
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,873
Because of that donation, they'll hang
a picture of you in the monkey house.

125
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,677
- I'm touched.
- It's an honour.

126
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,430
It's not official - I have to run it by
a couple of guys. I can do that right now.

127
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,791
You two have a lot to discuss.
So why don't you just stay and...?

128
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,629
Listen, Charlie,
would you ever consider

129
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,638
- a mural, maybe?
- A mural.

130
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,749
We love it there. My mother's family
is from Tuscany so it's like going home.

131
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,072
That's so sweet.

132
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,671
You must come out some time. Our place
is at the edge of a magnificent vineyard.

133
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,156
Everything's at the edge of a vineyard.
It's Tuscany.

134
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,673
- Mrs Rueland.
- Hey, stranger.

135
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,633
Honey, you remember Celia and Tony.

136
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,593
We were telling Elizabeth
about our place in Italy.

137
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,510
- We meant to go on our honeymoon.
- Sydney wouldn't have stood the flight.

138
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,359
I promise you we'll go to Italy - eventually.

139
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,233
That's big.
If that's a promise, I'll take that.

140
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,399
- Where are you vacationing this year?
- We're going to a water theme park.

141
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,752
That'll be nice.

142
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,950
It's a joke, Celia.

143
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,798
I promised my wife that we'd dance
tonight, Tony, so if you'll excuse us...

144
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,388
- Certainly.
- It was wonderful to see you both.

145
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,794
Good night.

146
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,712
It's a little crowded out here right now.
Let's wait for the next song.

147
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,115
So really... how was I?

148
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,116
You were perfect. With the backlighting
you could see right through your dress.

149
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,795
No, you were wonderful. Really.
I'm so proud of you.

150
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,278
Don't be too proud. Poor Sydney's
still stuck in that small space.

151
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,632
Tell you what. If you promise you'll take
time off for a trip to Italy with me

152
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,675
I promise to build Sydney a new home,
with or without the rest of the funding.

153
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,519
Deal.

154
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,471
Come on. You can stand on my feet.

155
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,910
Return to me

156
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,915
Oh my dear, I'm so lonely

157
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,635
Hurry home, hurry home

158
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,278
Won't you please hurry
home to my heart

159
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,436
My darling

160
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,432
If I hurt you I'm sorry

161
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,878
Forgive me

162
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,196
And please say you're mine

163
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
Return to me

164
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,993
We got a female, 34, car accident.
Hit on the right side.

165
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,078
Head trauma, unconscious
at the scene, never regained.

166
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,637
Get Westfall into scrub.

167
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,352
- Name?
- Any allergies?

168
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,959
Sir? Her name.

169
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,077
- Sir?
- Eli-Elizabeth Rueland.

170
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,714
Sorry, sir. You can't go in.

171
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,751
You're going to have to wait here.

172
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,916
We're going to try to help her.

173
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,990
Return to me

174
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,353
Cara mia, ti amo

175
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,478
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu

176
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,471
Mi' amor

177
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,993
- Andiamo. Get that while it's hot.
- I got it, Marty.

178
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,955
- Aah, sure I'll get it myself.
- Suit yourself, baby.

179
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,393
Where's Sophie?

180
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,798
She got a perm today. Her scalp is
still burning. She went home early.

181
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,469
Oh, of course she did. Why did I ask?

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,594
Will you go find yourself a gondola?

183
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,033
Pick up.

184
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,268
Now then, Nancy darlin'...

185
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,679
It looks massive but you'll get through it.

186
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,949
Thank you.

187
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,275
Marty, how is Gracie doing?

188
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,916
Oh, fine, you know.
We... we're all waiting.

189
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,350
- Are you still keeping up the rosary?
- Every night.

190
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,189
- Give her our love.
- Oh, I will, of course. Of course I will.

191
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,192
I can do that.
Where are the three chicken Vesuvios?

192
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,791
- Already served them, Marty.
- Thank you very much. Grazie.

193
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,038
Oh, you've got it, haven't you?

194
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,675
You have? Thanks be to God
and all the saints in heaven!

195
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,711
Let me talk to her.

196
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,434
I'll be right over. Here's Angelo now.

197
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,949
Call everybody up now!

198
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,911
You got a heart, huh?

199
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,115
What, like an hour into it?

200
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,995
Someone will come out
and tell you intermittently. Excuse me.

201
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,473
He's here.

202
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,160
- You're here.
- Isn't she beautiful?

203
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,674
Grandpa, thank you for
always taking care of me.

204
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,678
And if I don't come out...

205
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,869
I love you so much.

206
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,675
You've got to come out.
If those tulips you planted come up

207
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,998
and see only me standin' there,
they'll go back into the ground again.

208
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,592
Thanks. Give me a kiss.

209
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,278
OK, folks.

210
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,999
- Here we go.
- Pray, Grandpa.

211
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,911
We'll take good care of her.

212
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,474
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

213
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,356
I got to walk Mel.

214
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,795
I left the hospital a few hours ago.
I came by and took him to the park.

215
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,512
OK.

216
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,312
Thanks.

217
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,228
- I'm gonna stay.
- No.

218
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,917
I'll pick your parents up
from the airport in the morning.

219
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,393
Thanks.

220
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,956
OK.

221
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,192
If you need anything, you call me.
I'll be here in two minutes.

222
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,753
Thank you, Charlie.

223
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,554
She's not coming home, Mel.

224
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,155
Blessed Michael the Archangel,
who protects in battle,

225
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,590
and this is the greatest
battle of our lives...

226
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,919
My wife never thought much of you
but you were always my favourite saint.

227
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,679
Cos you're a battler,
you're a fighter. Well,

228
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,439
fight for us now, Michael. Fight for us.

229
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,632
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

230
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,593
Adam Martin Dayton, what is that?

231
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,039
Cherry pop.

232
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,628
- Sophie, did you give him wine?
- Angelo...

233
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,955
Angelo, what are you doin' to me?

234
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,196
- It's... tranquilliser.
- Great(!)

235
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,709
So sue me.
Now they're drunk and disorderly.

236
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,354
Is that funny, Dad?

237
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,392
Stop it right now, both of you. Joe!

238
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,600
- Joe...
- What?

239
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,474
Help me out. Take the kids
to your mom's. It's one in the morning.

240
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,309
- Here, Emmett. Nourish yourself.
- Thank you.

241
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,793
Could I have milk?

242
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,196
Tyler, I want all your brothers up here.

243
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,311
I'll only buy more.

244
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,113
- Let's go.
- I wanna stay and see the new heart.

245
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,674
You'll see it when it comes home.
Come on.

246
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,150
No stopping anywhere.
You come straight back here.

247
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,555
- I'll stop at a lap-dancing bar.
- That's funny(!)

248
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,514
- Where's Marty?
- Dad, where's Marty?

249
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,437
In the chapel, honey.

250
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,476
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

251
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,670
Want me to shuffle for you?

252
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,069
- Want to ante a quarter?
- Yes. I do.

253
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,078
This guy you're talkin' about,
he can't sing at all.

254
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,557
- How come he's got such a big band?
- To drown him out.

255
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,750
Wally, stay out of this.

256
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,440
How many famous
Polish singers are there?

257
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,516
I got two words for you: Bobby Vinton.

258
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,757
Bobby Vinton?!
Bobby Vinton, Bobby Vinton!

259
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,069
Well, what have you got?
The Irish Rovers?

260
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,676
I got three words for you.

261
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,395
Mr Bing Crosby.

262
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,556
He made a lovely priest.

263
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,636
But he beat the hell out of his kids.

264
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,196
Doesn't mean he couldn't sing.
Sinatra beat up everybody.

265
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,118
Frank did not.
His people did, he did not.

266
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,719
Look at Dean Martin.

267
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,515
The guy never hit anybody.

268
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,594
What about Jerry?
But he was askin' for it.

269
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,713
The point is: we got Frank,
we got Dean, we got Perry Como,

270
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,796
Vic Damone, Bobby Darin,

271
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,713
Mario Lanza, Luciano Pavarotti,

272
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,116
we got Beniamino Gigli,
we got the composers!

273
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,749
Verdi, Leoncavallo!

274
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,917
- Millions.
- That's right. A dynasty.

275
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,113
- I'm not bragging, but...
- You're not?

276
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,113
You're not bragging?

277
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,031
Christ, he goes on for a half hour.

278
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,393
Oh, come on.

279
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,752
- I'll take you to the doctor in my Caddy.
- No thanks, I'll take my bike.

280
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,838
- Let him take you. Suppose it rains?
- Then I'll get wet.

281
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,518
Then you'll be sick.

282
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,552
Gracie, settle this:
best male singer, dead?

283
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,635
Dean Martin.

284
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,273
- Frank!
- Bing.

285
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,356
Bobby Vinton!

286
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,199
Now, go straight to your appointment,
then you go to meet Megan.

287
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,039
If your plans change, telephone me.

288
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,709
I may stop off at the Pussycat Club.
One of their strippers quit.

289
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,435
Don't say strippers.
God's listening to you.

290
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,869
It's been over a year.
You can hardly see it.

291
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,754
Nice try, Angelo.
I just don't like all the questions.

292
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,872
Tell everybody you're
the luckiest girl in the world.

293
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,194
I know, Grandpa.

294
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,396
You're beautiful - and no one's
going to notice your chest.

295
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,758
Thanks a lot(!)

296
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,429
- I'll see you later.
- Bye, Grace!

297
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,516
Ride on the sidewalk, now.

298
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,153
Leave her alone.

299
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,316
Stop in at the church as you go by.

300
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,318
She's thanked God enough already.

301
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,150
You're going to be
a long while in purgatory.

302
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,350
Really? Well, I'll be with friends.

303
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,070
God's listening to that.

304
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,759
All right, guys...

305
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,953
Now, out of respect we gotta give
honourable mention to Sammy Davis Jr.

306
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,117
He only had one eye, so...
what else can I tell ya?

307
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,994
- He was Irish, you know.
- Are you blind? He was Jewish.

308
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,554
Whatever. Somethin' didn't fit.

309
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,151
This is hard for him.

310
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,989
Everyone he's ever loved has died.
I'm all he has, he's all I have.

311
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,712
- Morning, Grace.
- Hey, Alice.

312
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,594
Everything's looking very good.
How are you feeling?

313
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,508
- Good. Happy. Of course I'm happy.
- Good.

314
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,757
- What else am I gonna be?
- Well, we all have our days.

315
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,391
Add those to your morning meds.

316
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,351
98.6.

317
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,271
I don't feel like I should have "days".

318
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,310
I should be happy
just to be alive - and I am.

319
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,074
I'm alive cos someone else is dead.

320
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,995
I should just shut up and be happy, right?

321
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,395
Mm-hm.

322
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,150
You can get dressed. See you next month.
Say hi to your grandfather.

323
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,430
He's a great listener(!)

324
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,400
- What, honey?
- Nothing.

325
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,316
Tom, what the hell is goin' on?

326
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,795
- It's not my department.
- Whose is it?

327
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,117
- My guys worked 18 hours.
- At time and a half. I'm cryin' for ya(!)

328
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,913
- You got the best guys here.
- I don't give a shit.

329
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,312
I got to take a break.

330
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,190
You're on Wabash at 3 o'clock -
new beams goin' in.

331
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,796
Keep up.

332
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,513
- Mail it, Grace. You'll feel better.
- I know. I want to.

333
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,677
Every time I go to do it, I... I can't.

334
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,837
I don't know why not. It's anonymous.

335
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,318
It says you're grateful. I'd want to get
it if I lost someone I loved. Wouldn't you?

336
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,557
Yeah, but... it just seems so strange.

337
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,273
Sending a thank-you note for a heart.

338
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,712
It seems so...

339
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,115
..not enough.

340
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,708
- Won't you feel worse not sending it?
- Yeah. I mean, I always have it.

341
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,356
And it's been a year, so drop it in
and move on. I'm sure they have.

342
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,676
Yeah.

343
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,948
Let it go.

344
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,835
Everybody clap for Auntie Grace.
She just mailed a very important letter.

345
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,589
- Mom, look at the cool truck!
- Yeah. Oh, look at that.

346
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,190
- Look at their arms.
- Yeah. Wow!

347
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,390
OK, come on - gorillas.

348
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,475
Karson, your pants are falling down.

349
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,956
These are Adam's. He has your pants on.

350
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,230
That's all right. Come on, Laura.

351
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,432
Laura, stay in front of Mommy
all the time while we're here.

352
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,995
Aunt Grace, are you OK?

353
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,552
Yeah. Whatever it was, it didn't hurt.

354
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,269
Let's try it.
See if we can get him to come over.

355
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,875
- "H"...
- Here he comes!

356
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,117
Look, Mom, he likes us.

357
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,915
- Doesn't he remind you of Daddy?
- He looks bigger than Daddy.

358
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,549
- Do you see?
- That's kinda sweet.

359
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,794
Bob, don't go in there.
I just talked to 'em!

360
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,270
OK, guys, here's the deal.

361
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,313
My wife wanted this building up
years ago, so we're way behind schedule.

362
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,433
First of all, you:
artificial trees are not planted.

363
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,189
I'm asking for an additional 50 feet
to build aroundthe existing oaks.

364
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,108
And I will leave plenty of room
for your godforsaken souvenir shop.

365
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,075
If you don't approve, I'm taking my men
and it's over. I don't need the work

366
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,830
and I'm certainly not here for the money.
I'm here because of my wife.

367
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,678
Have you got it?

368
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,837
Good.

369
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,836
Thanks for yellin' and screamin'.
Now I gotta go in and clean everything up.

370
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,794
You want to get a drink?
Somethin' to shake this off?

371
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,718
- Come on! Let's go get a beer.
- Thanks, Charlie. No.

372
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,913
Well, if not tonight, Friday night.
Because I got somebody for you.

373
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,359
Charlie, no.

374
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,439
She's got a great body:
attorney, great body, intelligent...

375
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,076
You gotta start goin' out! She loves
animals - her cat was a patient of mine.

376
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,077
I'm a dog person.

377
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,431
I'm just trying to help you.

378
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,639
- Dan, you got 'em!
- It's the first time I'm wearing 'em.

379
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,910
- You look good.
- Feelin' good.

380
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,474
- Need some help?
- I think I'll be OK.

381
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,158
Look at you!

382
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,238
- Where are you goin'?
- I don't know.

383
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,631
Thanks. I took Mel out.

384
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,115
Put the mail next to the phone.
On the pile.

385
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,993
Thanks, buddy. See you later.

386
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,478
Come on, Mel.

387
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,876
Any calls?

388
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,391
You have no messages.

389
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,033
Wanna eat?

390
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,756
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr Rueland.

391
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,239
Hey, Mel!

392
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,154
- There you go.
- Thanks. See you tomorrow night.

393
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,069
- Yeah.
- Bye. Bye, Mel!

394
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,796
Come on. In the kitchen.

395
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,512
I got you some rice.

396
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,119
Here we go.

397
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,118
You're gonna eat in here today.

398
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,678
Good.

399
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,749
Come on. Come on.

400
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,676
I'm not doin' this any more.
We're goin' back to eatin' in the kitchen.

401
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,191
Goddammit, Mel, come on back here and
eat in the kitchen like a normal person!

402
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,231
Good boy, good boy. Come on, let's go.

403
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,756
To the kitchen. Let's go.
That's it. Follow me.

404
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,275
There's a good boy.

405
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,830
Good boy. You made it halfway.

406
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,310
You gotta snap out of it, buddy.

407
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,678
Charlie, it's Bob.

408
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,991
I'm gonna go out with you
on Friday, all right?

409
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,270
Yeah, you heard me.

410
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,518
Where?

411
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,869
O'Reilly's?

412
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,829
O'Reilly's Italian restaurant?

413
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,119
OK.

414
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,671
Where is that?

415
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,316
Ah, Marie

416
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,596
Ah, Marie!

417
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,438
Big finish, Grandpa!

418
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,993
I'm still trying to get them
to play "Danny Boy".

419
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,756
All right, I got a chicken Vesuvio and
a corned beef and cabbage - no butter.

420
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,598
All right, darlin'.

421
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,870
Now... don't eat that.

422
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,113
Oh, my God!

423
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,116
Save it for the Italians.
I know you love me.

424
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,353
Can we afford it?

425
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,393
Angelo says a true artist
must paint in the Pissa Navona.

426
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,317
Piazza Navona!

427
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,912
- You know, I... I could go over with you.
- Sure, yeah.

428
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,631
- Marty, let her go alone.
- Or... you wouldn't have to go at all...

429
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,235
- She'll be fine.
- I'm gonna go.

430
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,035
She's never before been on an aeroplane
and Rome is far away.

431
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,438
- She'll be fine. You paid for the ticket.
- We'll discuss it later on.

432
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,712
- Ange. Two more, hon.
- Sophie, he gave her the ticket!

433
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,115
You couldn't wait till I was here?

434
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,710
She had the same look on her face then
as she has now. Show her.

435
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,958
I miss everything!

436
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,312
Well, the customers out there
are missing you, so...

437
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,192
Can I at least look at it?

438
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,912
Here, look.

439
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,238
Don't touch it!

440
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,069
- Look how much it cost.
- It's so beautiful!

441
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,034
- You deserve it, sweetie.
- She does indeed.

442
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,596
- Oh, well. All right, let's go.
- Thank you.

443
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,438
All right, back to work.

444
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,477
Thank you, Grandpa.

445
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,632
Angelo, thank you!

446
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,796
How did you talk him into it?

447
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,718
My goodness! I'm so proud of him.

448
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,116
He loves you so much,
he's like an Italian mamma!

449
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,437
I can't wait to tell Megan.
She's gonna flip out.

450
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,233
I got another surprise for you.

451
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,952
- He is here.
- Who's he?

452
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,159
The guy I was telling you about.
He's at the bar, waitin' to meet you.

453
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,592
- Oh, Angelo...
- Don't worry. I told him everything.

454
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,235
- I told him you had your chest worked on.
- What?!

455
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,794
- Angelo, he's gonna think I had a...
- What?

456
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,114
Whatever.

457
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,394
It doesn't matter. He's a terrific guy.
In fact, he had a transplant too.

458
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,715
Coraggio - go on.

459
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,472
My doctors -
they say it's a solid transplant.

460
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,836
Look how natural it looks.
Go ahead, give it a tug.

461
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,158
- No, that's OK.
- Oh, come on, give her a tug!

462
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,999
Good evening, sir.

463
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,913
- Are you staying or leaving or what?
- I'm staying.

464
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,556
Thank you very much.

465
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,668
Bob!

466
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,352
My man, Bobby!

467
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,072
This is Marsha.

468
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,794
- Come on!
- I have bacon fat on my hands.

469
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,074
It's OK. I can wash it, shower in it, swim.
Come on, give it a good pull!

470
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,634
- I don't want to hurt you.
- It's OK! I'm fine.

471
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,716
- OK.
- Ow, ow!

472
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,998
- You picked a soft spot.
- Sorry.

473
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,078
Gracie, mind the four-top
over there, will you?

474
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,508
Yeah, I will.

475
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,710
OK, well, it was really nice to meet you.

476
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,559
- Good luck... with your hair.
- Thank you.

477
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,476
Hey, Patrick. Wanna grab on
with two hands and run for the door?

478
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,718
- No, Ralph. I don't touch men.
- It's women's hair.

479
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,276
And then I said, "It's Squeaker, my kitty!"

480
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,709
Everyone was laughing! Ah-ha-ha! Oh!

481
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,559
That's when I met Charlie.
He was the only vet open.

482
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,116
- Funny story.
- Where are the menus? What's going on?

483
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,549
Squeaker won't let
another vet touch him.

484
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,389
Yeah, well, I better not hear about
anybody else touching your squeaker.

485
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,475
I didn't mean to say that.

486
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,752
- I really like this place. It's nice.
- Oh, well, if you like this kind of place.

487
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,599
Everything here is good.
That's the beauty of it.

488
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,635
Oh my gosh, look at us, matchy green.
"Matchy matchy green squared!"

489
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,670
I'll take care of that.

490
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,828
Thank you very much.

491
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,712
Could you hang this up behind you?

492
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,831
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

493
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,509
So, Rob, Charlie tells me
you work at the zoo.

494
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,918
Wait a minute - he doesn't work there.
Bob is there building. Bob's a builder.

495
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,508
The new building on State Street? Bob's.

496
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,470
- You own it?
- No. No, I designed it.

497
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,158
Oh.

498
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,117
Good evening.

499
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,835
No, no, no. Do you have bottled water?

500
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,633
Sure. Anyone else?

501
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,274
- May I have a wine list?
- Sure.

502
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,709
Do we know each other?

503
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,959
I think so. Have you been in here before?

504
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,312
- I'd remember an Irish-Italian restaurant.
- Yeah, you would.

505
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,794
Oh, my God - blah, blah, blah. My water?

506
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,674
I don't want Swiss water.
I got sick on that once, remember?

507
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,837
Ach, that was awful. That was so bad.

508
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,635
As long as it's not Swiss or tap water.
Preferably French, no bubbles.

509
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,230
I want it cold - no ice, no glass,
just the bottle and a straw.

510
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,912
Do you want to write it down?
I don't want Swiss water...

511
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,433
I'm pretty sure I got it.

512
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,791
I'm sorry. Can I get a coffee?

513
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,469
- Sure.
- No straw.

514
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,751
- I hate when they don't write it down.
- It will be wrong.

515
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,518
Maybe she'll get it right.

516
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,074
It's not gonna happen.

517
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,952
Nope, not me.

518
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,479
- Not me.
- No.

519
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,190
I think your ass is ringing.

520
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,752
I usually don't bring it.

521
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,438
Rueland.

522
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,269
Mike! Excuse me, I gotta take this.

523
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,833
What do you think?

524
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,520
Patrick, can you gimme an Aquafina?

525
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,753
That's good, Mike. The welder can work
four days for us and one day at the zoo.

526
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,917
Either way they get paid
under the original contract.

527
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,553
Who else is on the clock?

528
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,200
Um... no, no, that sounds good.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

529
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,314
Hold on! Can you call me back in three
minutes and whatever I say, disregard it?

530
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,475
Thanks.

531
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,637
So the old man goes,
"How many times I gotta tell you,

532
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,115
I don't want no brown bananas?"

533
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,316
- Wine lists.
- That's a good one.

534
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,391
- I bet that's refreshing.
- Such a difference!

535
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,033
- Yes.
- There you go.

536
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,673
It's about time.

537
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,395
I'm doing a new food combination,
so I don't need something...

538
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,796
- Our specials are chicken Vesuvio...
- Please!

539
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,433
I'm around them all day.

540
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,631
I didn't mean to...

541
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,910
I'm a vet. You know?

542
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,273
And a corned beef and cabbage soufflé
and a spinach ravioli, my favourite.

543
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,119
- I'll have that.
- That sounds so fattening.

544
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,915
- Well, just order something else.
- Is every dish here cooked in oil?

545
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,793
No. Some we boil in Swiss water.

546
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,599
- We're gonna need another minute.
- OK.

547
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,029
- We should get that smartass fired.
- She's fine.

548
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,357
No, that is not fine. That was uncalled-for.

549
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,076
- Get out of the way, Patrick.
- We're getting compliments on the pasta.

550
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,670
Why wouldn't we?
Angelo's the best Italian chef in Chicago.

551
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,997
Angelo! Three more shepherd's pies,
if you please.

552
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,634
Oh, that's me. That's mine.

553
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,196
Rueland. Hey, Mike.

554
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,436
I'm just havin' dinner.

555
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,597
No. No, that's not a problem.

556
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,996
If I have to be there I have to be there.
See you in five minutes.

557
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,231
- Where?
- The Wabash building.

558
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,432
- They're working on a Friday night?
- Can you believe that?

559
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,915
- No.
- It's an emergency. I gotta be there.

560
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,793
- It was nice to meet you, Marla.
- Marsha.

561
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,717
- And Shari?
- Yeah, that's it.

562
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,833
I apologise, and... have fun.

563
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,198
Bye.

564
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,631
- Is everything OK?
- Oh, yeah. Fine. I just got called to work.

565
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,797
Oh, OK. Are your girlfriend
and friends staying?

566
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,835
God, that's not my girlfriend. It's not
even a friend. Not an acquaintance either.

567
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,713
Yes. They will be staying.

568
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,192
Oh. Hang on a second.

569
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:11,632
- Soph, what is that?
- Ravioli and a side cabbage for pickup.

570
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,514
Here you go, Mr... Atsuki.

571
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,554
It's... on the house.

572
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,512
Come back again.

573
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,432
Thank you.

574
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,071
Ticket, sir? Thank you, sir.

575
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,869
Buona sera, signorina, buona sera

576
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,788
It is time to say good night to Napoli

577
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,469
Though it's hard for me
to whisper buona sera

578
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,512
With that old moon above
and the Mediterranean sea

579
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,552
- What are you doin'?
- I got a call. I gotta go.

580
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,672
- You're already out. It's Friday night.
- I know.

581
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,872
Drink some wine. Enjoy the evening.

582
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,116
I can't. I gotta go to work. I'm sorry.

583
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
- Thank you.
- I know you're goin' home.

584
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,593
I'm not goin' home. I gotta go to work.

585
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,876
Yeah, yeah, right(!)

586
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,998
- Grace? Umbrella.
- Oh. Thanks.

587
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,150
Another set of keys. Oh...

588
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,751
I found this phone on the bar earlier.
Nice, huh?

589
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,669
Buona sera, signorina

590
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,237
Kiss me good night

591
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,549
Bob.

592
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,593
According to these plans...
are we only enclosing the one oak tree?

593
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,872
No, I got a newer set of plans in my office.
We'll work Saturdays.

594
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,629
- We are working Saturdays!
- I'll get the new set of plans.

595
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,151
I'll take this home. My kids love
colouring between the lines on these.

596
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,352
- Hey, Bob, could I see the new plans?
- Yeah. Sure. Right here.

597
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,640
- These'll be the last set, right?
- Yes.

598
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,079
Oh, yeah.

599
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,475
Did anybody call back about my phone?

600
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,750
Oh, yeah, the restaurant. They have it.

601
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,836
- Who called?
- The restaurant.

602
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,157
- No, I... who from the restaurant?
- I don't know. Some woman.

603
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,919
- Young or old?
- I don't know!

604
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,510
- I'll send one of the guys to go get it.
- No, I'll swing by there later.

605
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,512
That's cute.

606
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,438
Will you stop with the piano?

607
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,278
I'll go in the fall.

608
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,795
- Here's the baby pig pen.
- OK.

609
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,517
The mommy has ten baby bottles
coming out of her tummy.

610
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,437
That's cute.

611
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,152
Stop with the piano!

612
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,709
Megan!

613
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,196
- What? I'm not playing it.
- But you...

614
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,231
What else did you see at the zoo?

615
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,478
Then we went to see the gorillas
and mommy said it was you.

616
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,431
Oh, I did not! I did not!

617
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,317
- Did she take you to see the elephants?
- Watch it, Joe!

618
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,193
- Did you change him?
- Yeah, I'm gonna.

619
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,675
Get up and change him.
What have you been doing?

620
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,951
- I've been saving lives all day, honey.
- Very funny.

621
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,878
- I'll change him.
- No, Grace, I got it.

622
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,913
- Joe, get up and do it right now.
- I got it, Grace. I'll do it.

623
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,117
- Megan...
- What?!

624
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,073
I invited Rudy over. To meet Grace.

625
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,159
Father Rudy?

626
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,111
He's not a priest any more.

627
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,352
To me he always will be.
Joe, she'll meet someone on her own.

628
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,040
Where? She's here
on every one of her nights off.

629
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,875
- He's a nice guy.
- It doesn't matter!

630
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,719
It's not easy to dance
when no one's leading.

631
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,559
Now help me clean up the puzzle!

632
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,148
- Here's the barn. Barn's gone!
- What's goin' on?

633
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,717
Nothing. Joe invited somebody over -
like a blind date for you.

634
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,273
- What?!
- It's not a date.

635
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,437
He's comin' over for dinner, that's it.

636
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,551
- I gotta find my scarf.
- Better hurry!

637
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,148
- I already told him you've had work done.
- What?!

638
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,713
She's not a Buick.

639
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,549
He understands, he's OK with it.
He's a priest!

640
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,479
- A priest?
- Yup.

641
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,270
An ex-priest. What's the big deal?
He's never dated, you've never dated.

642
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,358
- Grace has dated.
- Who? Chooch Patucci?

643
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,675
- I never dated Chooch!
- That's a date?

644
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,473
You dated Chooch Patucci?!

645
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,556
Don't say that name in this house.

646
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,877
- It's all right, Megan.
- Do you hate priests, Aunt Grace?

647
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,595
- No, honey.
- Cos if you do you'll go straight to hell.

648
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,948
Your mouth!

649
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,596
- That's great, Joe. You taught him "hell".
- I did not. You picked it up from Mom.

650
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,951
- I never said "hell", you son of a bitch.
- Just back off.

651
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,200
Oh, shit! Father Rudy's here.

652
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,869
- Don't say "shit" in front of the priest.
- Shit! Shit!

653
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,118
Would everyone just calm down,
for the love of God and all that is holy?

654
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,071
Calm the hell down!

655
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,636
Stop playing that.

656
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,268
- Shut that thing off.
- No, no... Dad...!

657
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,278
Good night, Nurse!

658
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,194
For Christ's sake, he's just a man!

659
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,958
I'm not used to being without it yet, Joe.

660
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,119
Come on in.

661
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,430
- There she is.
- Oh, boy!

662
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,879
Dinner, I mean.

663
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,228
Hallelujah!

664
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,874
I'll call my friend and see where he's at.

665
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,429
Bobby!

666
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,479
Where you at?

667
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,359
You ran away last night,
you don't show up tonight...

668
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,790
I'm sorry, Charlie,
I'm just not feelin' up to it.

669
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,193
I don't know, maybe somethin' I ate.

670
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,189
I'm just going to... I'm gonna kick back,
take it easy, maybe go to bed early.

671
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,312
- What you doin'?
- Now? Watching the Cubs game.

672
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,352
- What's the score?
- The score? Oh, it's, uh...

673
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,111
Uh...

674
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,312
It's... the Cubs are losin'.

675
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,188
Mr Rueland?

676
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,835
Dan the man!

677
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,190
Bob the slob - just kidding.

678
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,993
Maybe you could clean up the place.

679
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,796
I don't think you could afford me.

680
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,238
How do I look?

681
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,709
Tall.

682
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,474
Tall.

683
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,392
Tall, yeah.

684
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,837
Thanks.

685
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,236
Oh, Megan, it was fine.
You know... He was a nice guy.

686
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,030
- Well, at least we had a few laughs.
- Yeah, we did.

687
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,676
Did you notice how he was afraid
to even let me lift a plate of potatoes?

688
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,360
No, I think he was just being polite.

689
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,759
Mm-hm.

690
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,994
No, but it's like as soon as they know,
they think of me as broken.

691
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,511
I think they see you as a kind, loving
woman that's beaten unbeatable odds.

692
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,154
- That's the way I see you.
- Urrgghh!

693
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,757
OK, Tyler, come on!

694
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,719
The right guy will know. Trust me.

695
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,719
Can't have Joe helping. The way he
describes your surgery'd scare anyone!

696
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,796
Tonight. They're asleep. We can do it!

697
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,069
What did he say?

698
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,795
He's saying he's sorry about tonight,
so please forgive him.

699
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,275
Left. Step up. Good boy.

700
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,748
Daddy!

701
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,836
- Goddammit!
- Oh, dear.

702
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,269
- Goddammit!
- Megan!

703
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,714
I'm right here. Take it easy.

704
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,990
- Dad, I want some water.
- You can't have water.

705
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,078
- He can have water.
- He'll wet the bed and who'll change it?

706
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,670
- I do, damn it.
- OK, potty mouth's gonna change it.

707
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,031
Come on, honey, get up there.
You're going to sleep - for ever!

708
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,676
- Stop, it'll be in their heads all night.
- I'll put something in their heads!

709
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,591
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to put Mom to bed too.

710
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,071
- Grandpa, you need some help?
- No darlin', not at all.

711
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,476
I'm blessed with work.

712
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,677
- Sweet dreams, Gracie Alana.
- Good night, Grandpa.

713
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,071
Best female singer.

714
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,200
- Dead or alive?
- Either.

715
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,275
- Ella Fitzgerald, easy.
- Now I can agree with that.

716
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,237
I agree.

717
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,079
- I still take Banks over Cobb.
- Don't be ridiculous.

718
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,998
You can't mix your dream team
from different eras.
