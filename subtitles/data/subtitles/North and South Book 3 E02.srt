1
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,704
Ma'am, we gonna rebuild a new school
at no cost to you.

2
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,676
No cost at all, ma'am.

3
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:41,619
Perhaps someplace else. They'll be back.

4
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:46,547
No, see, we done already decided.
We're gonna rebuild it right here.

5
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:50,589
A brand-new school
where children can learn in...

6
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,731
and we can be proud of,
right here on Mont Royal.

7
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,935
And them devils come back here...

8
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,205
we're waiting on them.

9
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,073
-That'd be right.
-Right.

10
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:12,481
lt might all be just a terrible mistake...

11
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,150
but this school is very welcome.

12
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:27,926
Mrs. Main.

13
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,927
There's a telegraph for you, ma'am.

14
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:40,339
lt's from George Hazard.

15
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,580
lt says that Constance...

16
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,654
has just been murdered by Elkanah Bent.

17
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,416
Madeline, please stop and reconsider.
Perhaps you didn't read it all.

18
00:04:56,495 --> 00:05:00,226
lt says that this happened on Friday.
The funeral is this morning.

19
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,664
You can't possibly....

20
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,497
Oh, God.

21
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,168
He left on Thursday.

22
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,435
He'll never forgive himself.

23
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,837
Damn Elkanah Bent.

24
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:17,212
-You know him?
-lndeed l do. He's a madman.

25
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:19,675
l think that he is capable of....

26
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:26,980
You're thinking he killed Orry, ain't you?

27
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:32,220
Yes, l think he did...

28
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,291
with Ashton.

29
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,570
-l must get to George.
-Miss Madeline?

30
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,968
-We in here, Titus.
-He needs me.

31
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:46,573
Madeline, please stop.

32
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:51,075
The message ends, ''Please don't come.''

33
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,041
And it's signed simply, ''George Hazard.''

34
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:58,621
Miss Madeline, the log float done arrived.

35
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:02,159
l never seen so many logs
in these parts before.

36
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:07,097
-lsaac says it's best you come.
-You have duties and responsibilities here.

37
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,196
We need you.

38
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:12,189
Dear George,
we're all so worried about you.

39
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:16,530
You must mingle more. There are so many
people here to thank for coming.

40
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,625
Not now.

41
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,469
lsabel, George is grieving.
The people will understand.

42
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,532
The most important men
to the future of America are all here.

43
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,510
lf you're going to join them
in the House of Representatives...

44
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,070
you should take advantage
of the situation.

45
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,749
She's really a very caring woman, George.

46
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,549
You see qualities in her
that elude me, brother.

47
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:45,920
You may be happy with your position
at the Freedmen's Bureau, but l'm not.

48
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:50,092
Sweetheart. Go comb your hair, darling.

49
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,934
l have plans for our future
and for our fortunes.

50
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,065
Secretary Stanton...

51
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:02,575
General Grant. Why, Senator Stevens.

52
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:06,944
-How very delightful of you all to come.
-Mrs. Hazard.

53
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:09,078
Stanley, good to see you.

54
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:11,452
Stanley, please allow me
to congratulate you...

55
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,787
on your fine work
with the Freedmen's Bureau.

56
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,488
The Republican Party is proud
of the progress of emancipation.

57
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,429
Stanley is capable of much greater things.

58
00:08:21,566 --> 00:08:24,091
Excuse me.
We must see to the other guests.

59
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,466
Mr. Jackson.

60
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:10,081
l try hard to guide
and improve your career...

61
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:12,139
and you make no effort.

62
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:14,885
l'm sad for George.

63
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,488
And l grieve Constance as well, lsabel.

64
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,152
She cared little enough for us, God knows.

65
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:25,993
-George is my brother.
-And would do very little to help you.

66
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:28,532
We must start
helping ourselves, Stanley...

67
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,935
-and to that end, l'm traveling south.
-South?

68
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,806
-Your war profits.
-All the Hazards profited from the war...

69
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:40,504
and thanks to me,
we have some funds in the South...

70
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:43,514
that can be invested
in some very cheap land.

71
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:47,610
-Your bureau can aid us.
-That is privileged information, lsabel.

72
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:51,884
-That land is for ex-slaves, not rich, white--
-Stanley, darling.

73
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:56,119
The ex-slaves can't buy up all of the South,
can they?

74
00:09:56,928 --> 00:09:59,624
Why don't we go upstairs and discuss it?

75
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:03,225
We haven't seen each other
in a very long time.

76
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,134
Good afternoon, Edwin.
Mr. Hazard sent for me.

77
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,805
The General is in the library, Mr. Ouinlan.
You're to go right in.

78
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:17,945
Good afternoon.

79
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,409
That lrishman is offensive.

80
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,416
Excellent foreman, though.

81
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,884
l'm placing Hazard lron
completely in your hands.

82
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:31,986
That's absurd.

83
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,293
All my correspondence
is to be transferred to you.

84
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:37,301
You're to handle Mrs. Main's accounts
with the Charleston Bank.

85
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:39,837
Anything she wants or needs,
see that she gets it.

86
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,634
You're to treat everything as your own.

87
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:45,233
-George, l'm just a foreman.
-l know you can do the job, Jack.

88
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,745
Besides, you're the only one
l can trust right now.

89
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,303
Surely your brother can be trusted?

90
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,850
lt's the vulture he's married to
that can't be trusted.

91
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,853
lf she makes a move on anything,
you let me know immediately.

92
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,650
l'm counting on you, Jack.

93
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,664
l can't make any decisions right now.

94
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:11,298
Food chokes me.

95
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:13,899
l can't sleep.

96
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,500
And when l do,
l wake and keep asking why.

97
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:21,310
Why wasn't l here?

98
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,845
l don't know what to do
with her things, Jack.

99
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:35,020
-Sir, the Pinkerton detective is here.
-Send him right in.

100
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,583
Agent Jupiter Smith.

101
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:41,388
-Gen. Hazard, sir.
-The war is over. ''Mister'' will suffice.

102
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:43,991
This is Jack Ouinlan, my associate.
Take a seat.

103
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:47,800
l've just come from the local police.
They suggest that you inform me...

104
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,397
of the particulars
of Mrs. Hazard's murder, sir.

105
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:53,205
Elkanah Bent is a brutal, vicious man.

106
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,843
He's a butcher of men, women,
and children alike.

107
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:59,281
And he takes great pleasure in it, too.

108
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,751
He and l were together at West Point...

109
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,947
along with General Orry Main,
late of the Confederate Army.

110
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,219
l have no doubt he killed Orry, too.

111
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:11,091
He knifed him down,
just like he did my Constance.

112
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,363
Did they tell you Bent came after me?

113
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,626
Spent weeks lying in wait
for me to return.

114
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,361
And what would his motives be, sir?

115
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,369
Orry and l got him dismissed
from West Point.

116
00:12:19,437 --> 00:12:22,463
He blames us
for ruining his military career.

117
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,934
He also swore a vendetta against Charlie.

118
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:30,038
-Charlie, sir?
-Charlie Main, Orry's cousin.

119
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,617
He served under Bent just before the war.

120
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:37,050
He's seeking revenge
against both of our families.

121
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,249
So then he may return
to try again for you, sir.

122
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:40,552
No, he won't.

123
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:46,090
Because before that can happen,
your organization's going to find him first.

124
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,655
And when you do, he is mine.

125
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:15,422
You think there's lndians tracking us?

126
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,189
He's got a nose for it.
He kind of feels them.

127
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,599
-ls that true?
-lt sure is.

128
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,427
Kind of feel them, huh?

129
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,830
Well, l don't see any tracking us.

130
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,336
When you see them,
it might be a mite too late.

131
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,003
Now, we're going to hole up soon.

132
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,946
We'll do a little work
on that jug of corn whiskey.

133
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,381
-Might be the last chance we get.
-Yeah.

134
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:43,751
-You are an optimistic cuss, ain't you?
-That's me.

135
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,358
Good night, Jimmy.

136
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,200
Well, are they out there?

137
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,170
Not tonight...

138
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,177
but they're there.

139
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,348
This is their land. They know we're here.

140
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,692
Give me the password and do the shake.

141
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,858
Wesley, have you lost your damn mind?

142
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,402
l've knowed you since both of us was kids.

143
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,372
l know, but you still got to give
the password and do the secret grip.

144
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,171
Damn. Liberty, Wesley.

145
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,919
-Evening, lsaac.
-Hey, now.

146
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,062
Good to see you.

147
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,591
Gentlemen.

148
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,436
Can l have your attention,
please, gentlemen?

149
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:10,900
l call this meeting...

150
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,433
of the Union League Club,
Ashley River District to order.

151
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:20,274
Now, Mr. Andrew Johnson
is our President...

152
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:23,086
since Mr. Lincoln was shot.

153
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,491
And Mr. Johnson
is a Southern-loving Democrat.

154
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,054
He'd like to see you cut right out
of your hard-earned rights...

155
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,859
political and land-wise.

156
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,892
He doesn't want to see you vote.

157
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,435
He has pardoned the very men...

158
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:42,701
who have oppressed us for so long a time.

159
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:45,534
But the Republicans, and that's all of us...

160
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:49,042
we want to see you rise up so high...

161
00:15:49,113 --> 00:15:51,809
you'll have to walk down steps
to reach heaven.

162
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,178
-Who are your friends?
-Republicans!

163
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,280
-And who's the enemy?
-Democrats!

164
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,019
Liberty, Lincoln, League!

165
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,210
Now, my friends...

166
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:23,272
there are still slaves...

167
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:27,250
because there are still those
who would be masters.

168
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:31,049
How many here
still work for their old masters?

169
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:32,178
Own up.

170
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,519
Stand up and own up now.

171
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,668
You get paid for your efforts?

172
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:47,837
We'll be paid. Miss Madeline promised.

173
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,903
-Besides, she give us more than pay.
-More than pay?

174
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,472
What's more important
than cash money for your labors?

175
00:16:55,546 --> 00:17:00,006
Don't you people know that the
Republicans delivered you from slavery?

176
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,687
What's more important
than cash money for your labors?

177
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:05,011
Pride.

178
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:07,819
We gots pride.

179
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,987
Well, sir, all l can say is--

180
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:14,589
We done heard everything you had to say,
Mr. Klawdell.

181
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,668
Now you going to listen to me.

182
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,068
Y'all sit down.

183
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:29,007
You can't see how it is down here...

184
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,371
because you're from up North.

185
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:35,148
But you best take a long, hard look
and listen.

186
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,981
What we do now...

187
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,190
what we gives...

188
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:47,125
we do and give 'cause we want to.

189
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,162
lt ain't like it was before the war.

190
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,663
lt's different now.

191
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,606
We's free now.

192
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,371
And free men choose.

193
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,082
What point is it in being free...

194
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:12,445
if you can't choose?

195
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,767
Hold on there. Hold up.

196
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,537
Now, l don't know about the rest of you,
but this man....

197
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,706
-Sir, what is your name?
-lsaac Kano.

198
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:42,342
What you say is true.

199
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,412
Y'all know we've come together
to choose delegates...

200
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,254
to the January convention
down in Charleston.

201
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:51,454
l, for one, think we've found
our first delegate here in Mr. Kano.

202
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,463
What say the rest of you?

203
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,611
What is that you're doing?

204
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,817
This is a sample of earth
l found at Mont Royal.

205
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,814
l'm taking it to the bank.

206
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,916
They'll have a survey done, and when
that's complete and a loan is secured...

207
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,688
we'll be rich once again.

208
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,089
But Madeline owns Mont Royal.

209
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:29,892
Madeline is living there,
but not for much longer.

210
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:36,262
She is not blood.
Mont Royal belongs in our family.

211
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,503
-Cooper--
-Don't sass me.

212
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,510
Don't ever sass me.

213
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,613
What are you becoming, Cooper?

214
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,016
Strong once again.

215
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,586
l'm sorry, Cooper.

216
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:56,119
Do you understand the potential value
of what you're holding in your hand?

217
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:57,451
Yes.

218
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,887
And l also understand that...

219
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:04,234
you have no legal claim as yet
to Mont Royal.

220
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:08,027
Cooper, l can't loan you money
on something that you don't own.

221
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,458
You're late, ma'am.

222
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,425
Champagne. How glorious.

223
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:36,791
-Did you hear me, Ashton?
-Yes, of course l heard you, Fen, dear.

224
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,359
l was only a tiny bit late.
No need for concern.

225
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,836
Champagne, please.

226
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:46,535
Thank you.

227
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:56,149
Oh, my!

228
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,321
My darling husband.

229
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,258
-Do you want me.... l can demonstrate it.
-Please.

230
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:12,926
lt's only the first model, you understand,
but there will be more in time.

231
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:16,834
These pianos will stand in every cathouse
and saloon all over the world...

232
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,843
and no one is going to be able
to resist her.

233
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,678
Just like me.

234
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,472
-That's why l named it so.
-Champagne for everyone.

235
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:31,749
To my remarkable genius of a husband
who is going to make me...

236
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:37,324
us all very rich.

237
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,285
To the Ashton piano.

238
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,103
How did you manage to buy that dress?

239
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:56,172
l put a little bit of money away
every now and then.

240
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,849
You save any more back,
you give it to me.

241
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,149
l'm not some slave, Fen.

242
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:08,188
No, you're a slut,
and you look every inch of it right now.

243
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,023
Not everybody thinks so.

244
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,626
So you know everybody?

245
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:20,702
l'm warning you.
lf you ever want to see Mont Royal again...

246
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:22,568
you cut back your spending.

247
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:26,543
lt took everything we had
to start this business up.

248
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,408
We're flat broke right now.

249
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,346
We are going to be very rich...

250
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:37,583
and l just wanted to be beautiful
for my husband.

251
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,922
We're not married yet.

252
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:46,061
You're hurting me.

253
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,693
-You scare me.
-l scare you?

254
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:53,362
-l saw you kill a man in cold blood.
-He was a disgusting pig and l hated--

255
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:56,167
That's not enough reason
to kill somebody.

256
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:01,802
You behave yourself,
or you'll never see your mansion again.

257
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,503
You don't know me.

258
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:07,950
l know you.
You are vicious and greedy and vain.

259
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:21,590
But you amuse me sometimes.

260
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:26,196
Let's go out for a fine dinner.
You can show that wicked dress off.

261
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:29,703
Come along.

262
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:32,532
lf you insist.

263
00:23:45,723 --> 00:23:48,590
-Can l help you?
-l certainly hope so, my friend.

264
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:52,322
l'm trying to locate
an old comrade of mine from the war.

265
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,327
-His name?
-Charles Main...

266
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:59,532
late of the Confederacy, but most recently
reported to this division.

267
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:02,931
l see you're admiring this.

268
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,869
lt's unusual, l know.

269
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,335
lt belonged to my dear, departed mother.

270
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:11,080
l'm afraid of losing it.

271
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:14,746
l'll see what l can discover
on your old comrade.

272
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,377
l appreciate it.

273
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:27,857
Excuse me, sir. l think l found it.

274
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,236
Your friend was here
under the name of Charles May.

275
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:37,331
He deserted,
but President Johnson pardoned him...

276
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:39,569
on the request of Brevet Brigadier Duncan.

277
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:41,235
Brigadier Duncan?

278
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,374
You have any more information?

279
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:47,881
Brigadier Duncan corresponds
with him still. You want the address?

280
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:49,783
l'd be indebted to you, sir.

281
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,290
Appreciate it.

282
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,694
-What did that man want?
-He was searching out a friend, sir.

283
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,763
l gave Brigadier Duncan's address
in St. Louis for further reference.

284
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,877
My God, Private,
l think you've made a grave mistake.

285
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:20,212
Run a message
to the Pinkerton Office in town.

286
00:25:34,632 --> 00:25:36,099
All aboard, please.

287
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,625
This for me?

288
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,964
-Thank you, Jim.
-lt's a present, Charlie.

289
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,101
Why, there's a nice one.

290
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,407
My son Gus used to collect these.
That's a real nice one. l thank you.

291
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,305
l'm going to keep this with me, all right?

292
00:26:25,382 --> 00:26:26,815
Makes me happy.

293
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:32,087
l owe you a debt
for your patience to Jim here.

294
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:36,323
lt's not hard. He's a good boy.
Besides, my debt beats yours all to hell.

295
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:39,226
You never did tell me
how you two met up anyway.

296
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:43,096
Kind of like l met you.
Bunch of bullies was beating him up.

297
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,470
-Cheyenne?
-lt could be wolves.

298
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:59,379
lf they're Cheyenne, l hope
they're only after our horses and mules.

299
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,714
So do l. You don't plan on
giving them up, do you?

300
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:04,253
lt's either that or give them our hair.

301
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,486
No, please don't hurt me!

302
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:59,546
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer...

303
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:02,286
in sickness and in health...

304
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:05,191
till death do us part.

305
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:10,564
With the blessings of the Lord,
l give you a man and his wife.

306
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,631
Well, kiss her.

307
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,922
-Jane.
-l'm so happy.

308
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:51,599
Madeline, is something wrong?

309
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:54,042
No, everything's fine.

310
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,808
lt's just that Maum Beatrice is taking care
of little Orry, and l should get back.

311
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,280
You go back inside.

312
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:04,683
Wouldn't it be a shame if someone was
to bolt the door on them fine people...

313
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:08,383
-and set the whole thing on fire?
-Damn shame.

314
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,287
Could be done, you know.

315
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,127
lt's real tempting.

316
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:16,460
That's not why you're leaving, is it?

317
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:20,592
This has brought back memories.

318
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:26,664
You take the buggy. l feel like walking.

319
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:31,875
Wait a minute. Who's that?

320
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,953
Well, now.

321
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:53,699
-Howdy, Mrs. Main.
-Girl, you know what we plan to do.

322
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,135
Why don't you settle down
and put your mind to it?

323
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,604
You're disgusting.

324
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,574
Come on, you haven't had it in a long time.
You ought to enjoy it.

325
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:02,974
Leave me alone.

326
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:11,911
Come on, Gettys. Nobody around.
Let's get that stuff.

327
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:16,188
l'm being whooped here.
Gettys, you fool, come help me!

328
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:18,851
Gettys, don't do this!

329
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,326
-Come on.
-Don't!

330
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,368
This lady took a stumble and fell down.
We was just helping her up.

331
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:36,036
-See, we live close by and--
-You're just being neighborly?

332
00:31:36,112 --> 00:31:37,374
Yes, sir.

333
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:40,141
Do it someplace else.

334
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:46,550
-Jenks is the name, ma'am.
-l'm Mrs. Main.

335
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:49,682
-You sure you're all right, ma'am?
-Yes, thank you.

336
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:52,250
Are you on Mont Royal to see me?

337
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,764
No, l'm a geologist
running a survey for phosphates.

338
00:31:56,966 --> 00:31:58,024
Who sent you?

339
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,898
A Charleston bank
employed my services, ma'am.

340
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:03,704
Mr. Jenks, thank you.

341
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:07,299
-l thank you very much.
-Certainly, ma'am.

342
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,986
-Did you say 10 cents?
-l believe l said 1, ma'am.

343
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:26,190
But you can have it for 10.

344
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:29,297
Can l have this ribbon for my hair, Mama?

345
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,533
lt's been a hard year, Sophie.

346
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:34,530
Ma'am, l'll tell you what.

347
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:37,697
l could use some hay to carry along
for my mule.

348
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,908
l'd be glad to trade you for it.
She'd look real pretty in that ribbon.

349
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:45,342
-l have to go get my husband.
-Could you do that, ma'am?

350
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:48,407
Appreciate it.

351
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:52,346
-Papa's in the far field. l'll go fetch him.
-All right.

352
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:54,012
Appreciate it.

353
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,720
You want me to tie that up
into a bow for you?

354
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:00,922
What do you say...

355
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,923
about showing me where that hay is,
little lady?

356
00:33:06,268 --> 00:33:07,565
All right.

357
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,380
Come in.

358
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:25,418
Mr. Cooper?

359
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:29,617
Forgive me for marching on in, but there's
someone here l'd like you to meet.

360
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:31,660
lsabel Truscott, Mr. Main.

361
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:34,389
Miss Truscott is interested
in investing hereabouts...

362
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:37,432
and when l related
your discovery of phosphates, she--

363
00:33:37,499 --> 00:33:41,595
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.
You've been quite gallant and useful.

364
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,130
When l have discussed matters
with Mr. Main...

365
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,040
l shall call on you again at the bank.

366
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:50,102
Very well.

367
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,046
When you need my services,
l'll be gladly available.

368
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,522
Have you remarried, lsabel?

369
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,728
No, but because
of Stanley's political hopes...

370
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,826
l feel it best to use my maiden name
in my business dealings.

371
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:22,733
After all these years,
you're still a fine figure of a man.

372
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:28,679
l understand Northern investors
are not always welcome in this house.

373
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:32,417
lt's not a rigid rule. You're quite welcome.

374
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:37,255
How did you come to learn...

375
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,487
about my phosphates?

376
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:45,299
When it comes to my money,
l always do scrupulous research.

377
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:48,095
l know all about your phosphates...

378
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:52,003
and that you're searching for money
for some of your other holdings...

379
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,809
such as Mont Royal.

380
00:34:55,477 --> 00:35:00,005
Exactly what sort of investment
were you thinking about making?

381
00:35:01,717 --> 00:35:05,380
Substantial enough
to open a full mine operation...

382
00:35:05,454 --> 00:35:06,944
and a fertilizer plant.

383
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,355
-My terms--
-l'm afraid that you're in no position...

384
00:35:10,426 --> 00:35:13,190
to accept anything but my terms.

385
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:18,364
1 for me, and the balance for you.

386
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,895
-That in exchange for full financial backing.
-My, my.

387
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:29,802
Would that extend
into my other companies, as well?

388
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,607
Now, my dear Cooper, don't be piggish.

389
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:36,809
This operation will be so successful that
you'll be able to invest your own money...

390
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:40,377
in whatever way you wish.
There is one problem, though.

391
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,784
Since Mont Royal is not fully yours,
and Madeline has enterprises of her own...

392
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:49,228
she will no doubt be interested
in the profit that you make.

393
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:54,527
You may split that with your sister-in-law
however you see fit.

394
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,264
There's one other consideration.

395
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,666
What other consideration?

396
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,470
Labor can be such a difficulty.

397
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,345
The workers must be bound to us...

398
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:12,147
and the best way to do that
is with a store that we control.

399
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,620
The workers buy everything on credit...

400
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:18,018
and it's convenient for all.

401
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,829
-A company store.
-Exactly. Do you know of such a place?

402
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:25,565
l know the perfect place...

403
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:29,301
and the perfect man for the job.

404
00:36:40,883 --> 00:36:43,351
Somebody must have put a nail in the log.

405
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:59,325
Damn fool woman!

406
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:02,169
Good morning. Good to see you, Cooper.

407
00:37:02,237 --> 00:37:05,229
How could you be so foolish
to rebuild that stupid school?

408
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,071
l'm not. The local sharecroppers are,
for the children.

409
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,441
Don't play with me, woman.
You know exactly what--

410
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:12,912
Tell me, was it you, Johnny, Gettys...

411
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:16,979
or that crowd of rabble
that call themselves the Brethren...

412
00:37:17,352 --> 00:37:19,286
that tore up my saw-blade?

413
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,153
Your saw-blade has been ruined?

414
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:31,691
Won't that distress George Hazard
all to pieces?

415
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:36,131
George doesn't know.

416
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,530
There's a great deal that he doesn't know.

417
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,032
Such as?

418
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:44,078
Such as, with the aid of his sister-in-law,
lsabel Hazard...

419
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:48,583
l intend to open a mine for phosphates
right here on Mont Royal.

420
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:50,675
Mont Royal belongs to me.

421
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,918
For as long as you make
the mortgage payments, it does.

422
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:00,057
But since your sawmill isn't operating,
how do you intend to do that?

423
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:01,355
l shall.

424
00:38:02,931 --> 00:38:04,523
But if l should fail...

425
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,293
l wish you all the best.

426
00:38:09,438 --> 00:38:11,303
Why would you wish me that?

427
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:14,306
Because l bear you no malice, Cooper.

428
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:19,047
-You're a fool.
-Perhaps that's my lot in life.

429
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,114
You are no gentlewoman.

430
00:38:23,285 --> 00:38:24,718
Were you ever?

431
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,014
l never claimed to be.

432
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,384
Damn you.

433
00:38:40,435 --> 00:38:42,335
How does he get down the chimney?

434
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,237
Well, he just does. He's Santa Claus.

435
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:47,203
What if he gets stuck?

436
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:50,903
Santa Claus never gets stuck.
He has got magic powers.

437
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,142
-What if--
-lf, if, if!

438
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:56,742
lf you keep asking questions,
we'll never get our shopping done.

439
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:02,512
Go, Gus.

440
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,797
What are you doing here?

441
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:21,802
That was nicely done, Charlie Main.

442
00:39:21,877 --> 00:39:25,836
You come around here like a specter,
and frighten the girl and the child.

443
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:28,112
Come on in.

444
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,221
Whoa, now.

445
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,763
Nothing?

446
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:49,061
Mr. Tackett said the blade ain't ready.

447
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,038
He wouldn't even give us
so much as a glance, Madeline.

448
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:54,371
l smell the odor of the Brethren in this.

449
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,378
-Anything else unusual?
-Stopped by Gettys' store.

450
00:39:57,446 --> 00:39:59,641
Prices are way up, higher than ever.

451
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:02,073
You can get anything you want...

452
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,347
as long as you put your name down
or makes your mark.

453
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:08,078
Trouble is,
you got to pay him $12 a month.

454
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:13,155
And we only get paid every six months,
so they tack on something called interest.

455
00:40:13,228 --> 00:40:15,128
They don't use cash money...

456
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:19,160
just paper l ain't never seen the like of.
Something called scrip.

457
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:23,268
That way, they can never clear their debt.
lt's more slavery.

458
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:26,270
Sound familiar?

459
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:28,571
Unfortunately.

460
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,103
Soldiering's the only thing l know.

461
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,773
The Army needs civilian scouts.

462
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:38,280
Many of them have, shall we say,
dubious backgrounds.

463
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:42,050
-And what do l know about scouting?
-You've been there and survived.

464
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,748
You walked out alive.
That's something of value.

465
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:54,397
lf l decided on that,
you'd put in a word for me?

466
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:55,766
Yes, of course.

467
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:06,772
-Now, what about Elkanah Bent?
-George Hazard's wires reached you?

468
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:12,882
Someone should have put a bullet in him
long ago and saved us all that grief.

469
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:15,582
He'll be caught.
But until then, you watch your back.

470
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:18,524
-The man's insane.
-l'm dedicated to that.

471
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:22,525
-lf he wants to come after me, let him.
-What about Willa?

472
00:41:24,633 --> 00:41:27,329
-What about Willa?
-How can you treat her like that?

473
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:30,166
She adores Gus.
She spends a lot of time with him.

474
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,763
-l never asked her over.
-She does it for Gus...

475
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:36,777
-and because she's in love with you.
-l never asked for that, either.

476
00:41:37,846 --> 00:41:39,313
Go and talk to her.

477
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:49,349
''We are such stuff
As dreams are made on

478
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:54,451
''and our little life
ls rounded with a sleep.''

479
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:29,689
Sam's forming a traveling company.

480
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:32,197
Maybe we can meet
on the road somewhere.

481
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,228
l don't think so.

482
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,974
l'm not very good at this.

483
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:46,943
l can't see you anymore and l'd appreciate
it if you wouldn't see Gus, either.

484
00:42:50,018 --> 00:42:52,384
Charlie, come up to my room
with me now.

485
00:42:53,455 --> 00:42:57,186
-We can have some privacy and talk.
-We wouldn't just do that, would we?

486
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:59,090
We can just hold each other.

487
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:04,221
Charlie, l love you.

488
00:43:06,902 --> 00:43:08,802
You have to give me a chance.

489
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,812
l don't know why l'm here.

490
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:27,114
Yes, you do.

491
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,526
Tell me.

492
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,298
Out West....

493
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,637
l just don't know anymore.

494
00:43:54,683 --> 00:43:56,310
Let me help you.

495
00:44:02,157 --> 00:44:03,715
God, l missed you.

496
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:31,674
See that?

497
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:36,444
When l was out on the prairie,
a little boy named Jim gave me this.

498
00:45:37,585 --> 00:45:39,985
lt made me think an awful lot of you.

499
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,652
l got this one. Now l got two of them.

500
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:48,153
One to think of both of you with, Gus.

501
00:45:48,763 --> 00:45:50,128
You're a good boy.

502
00:45:50,966 --> 00:45:52,695
l'm mighty proud of you.

503
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:58,368
l hate to intrude,
but could l speak with you for a minute?

504
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:03,577
l secured a placement for you
as a civilian scout.

505
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,309
-Out West?
-Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

506
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:09,115
All right. That's all right by me.

507
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:12,017
The pardon still stands
even though Johnson's having trouble?

508
00:46:12,087 --> 00:46:13,111
lt does.

509
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,315
As long as l can hunt down
that damn renegade...

510
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,585
l don't have any problems at all.

511
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:28,064
You're leaving again, aren't you?

512
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,139
-When will you be back?
-l don't know.

513
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,181
Doesn't this mean anything to you?

514
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:49,954
What happened to you out there?

515
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,525
Please tell me.

516
00:47:00,468 --> 00:47:03,062
No, l told you this is the way it is.

517
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:06,599
-l've got a debt to settle.
-You're a bastard.

518
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:10,777
You used me, Charles Main.

519
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:16,610
l'm sorry for that.

520
00:47:27,328 --> 00:47:30,092
All right,
you just make your mark right there.

521
00:47:30,165 --> 00:47:32,463
May l see one of those labor contracts?

522
00:47:32,534 --> 00:47:35,128
Why? You thinking of signing up
for some work?

523
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:37,228
You can see mine, Miss Madeline.

524
00:47:37,472 --> 00:47:41,465
No, l'm sorry. That is not allowed.
Put your mark there.

525
00:47:41,543 --> 00:47:44,068
Seeing as how you're pretty strapped up
to Mont Royal...

526
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:46,636
maybe you'd like
to buy these things on credit.

527
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:50,582
-All these people are buying with credit?
-Sure.

528
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,219
All the Negroes are getting credit
for work done.

529
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,983
For a year's contract?

530
00:47:55,824 --> 00:47:58,122
-We'll pay with cash.
-Wait a minute.

531
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:01,356
You're sure you don't want to join
the rest of your folks, Madeline?

532
00:48:01,429 --> 00:48:03,659
Like l said, cash.

533
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:07,862
Come in.

534
00:48:09,437 --> 00:48:12,099
Mr. Cooper, Mrs. Main to see you, sir.

535
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:16,103
How are you, Cooper?

536
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:18,312
What do you want?

537
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:24,484
l've come to discuss the labor contracts
for the workers at your mine.

538
00:48:26,387 --> 00:48:27,877
That is none of your business.

539
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:31,119
You are deliberately placing hard-working,
decent men...

540
00:48:31,192 --> 00:48:33,683
into bondage once again.

541
00:48:34,295 --> 00:48:36,786
-Do you mean the Negroes?
-Yes.

542
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:40,266
You, of course, are sympathetic to them.

543
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:41,696
Deeply.

544
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,361
You know perfectly well they can't read...

545
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:48,068
and l'm sure you haven't explained
the contract to them.

546
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:51,805
Then your teacher and your school
should be educating them.

547
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,839
l have a contract with you
and rights to Mont Royal.

548
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:58,317
l will not permit this to happen.

549
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:04,223
You have the right to live there
as long as you pay the mortgage.

550
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:07,591
Some of the finest legal minds
in Charleston determined that.

551
00:49:07,662 --> 00:49:09,596
lf you wish to continue to live there...

552
00:49:09,664 --> 00:49:12,690
then you see
that the payments are made properly.

553
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:15,200
And if you wish
no more further trouble from me...

554
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:17,397
then you stay out of my business!

555
00:49:18,006 --> 00:49:20,634
What do you mean, no further trouble?

556
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:24,940
-Cooper, what's happened to you?
-l am regaining...

557
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,083
what you and others
sought to take away from me.

558
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:32,542
Pride.

559
00:49:35,456 --> 00:49:40,257
California is the most beautiful place.
lt's sunny and warm all the time...

560
00:49:40,328 --> 00:49:43,729
with the most magnificent mountains
and the ocean.

561
00:49:44,365 --> 00:49:47,459
And in some of the streams,
they say there's gold.

562
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:49,366
Have you ever got any yet?

563
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:54,335
No, not yet. But l'm going to keep trying.
Gold is very precious.

564
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:57,102
But not as precious as you are.

565
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:01,810
-Can we really come visit you, Aunt Brett?
-Nothing would make me happier.

566
00:50:02,083 --> 00:50:05,541
-But that really is up to your father.
-Can we, Papa?

567
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:09,483
What?

568
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:15,529
You'll have to excuse me.

569
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:23,926
Yes?

570
00:50:29,978 --> 00:50:31,912
Everybody's worried about you.

571
00:50:33,982 --> 00:50:36,473
George, we have trouble at the ironworks.

572
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:37,848
l hired two Negroes...

573
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:40,979
and six of our best men
threatened to walk. White men.

574
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,790
-Fire them.
-What?

575
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:47,987
-Fire them and keep the two.
-That's your responsibility, not mine.

576
00:50:48,062 --> 00:50:50,587
Come here. l want to show you something.
Look at this.

577
00:50:50,665 --> 00:50:53,156
We were able to track Bent
all the way to Chicago.

578
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:55,964
From here in Pittsburgh
to Canton, Ohio, to Columbus.

579
00:50:56,037 --> 00:50:58,904
Where they saw him
with a pierced earring. Remember that?

580
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,373
-l know it was Constance's.
-George, please.

581
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:03,706
Six days later,
Pinkerton loses him in Chicago.

582
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:05,905
George, stop it. You're obsessed.

583
00:51:09,217 --> 00:51:12,675
Please let me take the children
back to California till it's over.

584
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:15,621
lt'll never be over
while there's a madman running loose.

585
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:18,488
lt'll never be over till you let it be over.

586
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:22,053
Bent will just keep going
until you stop chasing him...

587
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,223
because it's what he wants.

588
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:27,196
You're scaring me, George.

589
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,963
Just think what it's doing to your children
to see you like this.

590
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,064
The children are safe here with me.

591
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:35,234
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

592
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,541
But where my business is concerned,
this business...

593
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:41,044
you may not intrude.

594
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:48,117
-Agent Jupiter Smith, sir.
-Show him right in.

595
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:52,259
l'm sorry to come unannounced...

596
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:55,125
but l'm heading out West
and wanted you to have this report.

597
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,029
-Tell me what's in it.
-We picked up Bent's trail again...

598
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:00,397
in a small farm in southern lllinois.

599
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:02,834
He attacked a young woman there, sir.

600
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:05,605
She's alive, but barely.

601
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,367
So much for my obsession.

602
00:52:11,179 --> 00:52:15,445
We believe he's headed for St. Louis next,
and from there, who knows?

603
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,686
My bet is he's after Charlie Main.

604
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,750
Look at the cards. Same old cards, right?

605
00:52:51,819 --> 00:52:55,550
l want somebody to pick me a card.
Who decides to pick a card?

606
00:52:55,623 --> 00:52:58,922
All right, pick your card.

607
00:52:58,993 --> 00:53:02,895
Show it to everybody.
Come on, now. Look at the card.

608
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:04,932
Don't show it to me.

609
00:53:04,999 --> 00:53:08,093
Put the card back in there.
Watch me shuffle it for you.

610
00:53:08,202 --> 00:53:11,103
Eyes are closed. Check out the eyes.

611
00:53:11,472 --> 00:53:13,497
Do you see the card in there?

612
00:53:14,742 --> 00:53:17,711
Please look.
Are you sure you don't see the card?

613
00:53:23,084 --> 00:53:24,381
Tie me up.

614
00:53:26,554 --> 00:53:28,715
Let me know when it's good and tight.

615
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:33,551
ls it good and tight yet?

616
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:36,597
Can you see that? You get over here.

617
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:41,599
Get on over here so you can see this.

618
00:53:44,539 --> 00:53:46,666
You want this?

619
00:53:50,445 --> 00:53:51,707
You men there.

620
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:55,873
Hey, you coloreds.
We'll have none of that at this camp.

621
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,445
You let them be. They're doing no harm.

622
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:02,649
-They're acting up. lt's not soldierly.
-They're just having some innocent fun.

623
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:05,590
A soldier's life is tough enough.
Don't you agree, Lieutenant?

624
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,561
What the hell would you know
about soldiering?

625
00:54:08,696 --> 00:54:10,391
A damn sight more than you ever would.

626
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:13,957
Why don't you find yourself something
useful to do right now, Lieutenant?

627
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:29,881
Excuse me.

628
00:54:31,419 --> 00:54:33,751
l want to thank you for that, sir.

629
00:54:34,322 --> 00:54:35,789
No need for it. He was wrong.

630
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:39,293
And don't call me sir. l work for a living.
Name's Charlie.

631
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,825
You a scout? They call me Magic Magee.

632
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:44,662
Yeah, l can see why.

633
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,436
l got my tent set up over there
by the stables.

634
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:55,636
When you get settled in and all,
stop by and we'll pull the jug awhile.

635
00:54:55,977 --> 00:54:59,674
l hear the South in you.
Are you sure you want to drink with me?

636
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:02,839
Stop by.

637
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,212
l hear we'll be fighting lndians.

638
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:10,389
When we have to.

639
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:15,262
Mostly we'll be riding escort
for wagons and stages...

640
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:20,432
hoping our presence will keep
the hostile ones on the reservations.

641
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:23,502
Mind you, l have sympathy for them...

642
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,539
save one in particular.

643
00:55:27,341 --> 00:55:29,673
No. One or two is enough for me.

644
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:32,645
l don't want any trouble
with officers or NCO.

645
00:55:37,919 --> 00:55:39,887
-You read and write, Magee?
-Yep.

646
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:44,788
Given that and seeing how
you can do tricks, why did you join up?

647
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:47,657
There ain't a lot of folks
looking to hire colored magicians.

648
00:55:47,728 --> 00:55:50,822
Besides, it's better than
emptying a spittoon in a saloon.

649
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:55,631
That was my last job
before reading about young men of color...

650
00:55:57,905 --> 00:55:59,896
putting on the army blue.

651
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:07,309
You learn to ride and shoot like that,
you'll rise fast.

652
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,747
You know they plan on promoting
from the ranks.

653
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:10,909
You mean officers?

654
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:14,978
For now, noncommissioned officers.
lt would be men like yourself.

655
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:18,255
So why are you scouting for the Army?

656
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:22,353
-l'm just looking for a friend of mine.
-Sounds like something personal.

657
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:26,694
His name is Scar and it's very personal.

658
00:56:28,903 --> 00:56:30,200
-Boy.
-Sir?

659
00:56:30,271 --> 00:56:33,707
-l'm looking for Brigadier Duncan's house.
-Right there, sir.

660
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:49,588
Gussie, naptime, dear.

661
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:25,186
Welcome.

662
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:29,528
My name is Francis Cardozo.

663
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:33,894
l have the good fortune
to have been born free...

664
00:57:34,435 --> 00:57:37,996
and l am deeply honored
that those of you who were not...

665
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:41,632
have chosen me
to conduct our proceeding.

666
00:57:48,816 --> 00:57:51,751
Any man who wishes to speak may do so.

667
00:57:51,952 --> 00:57:54,443
Below me, a clerk is at the table.

668
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:59,082
lf you can't write your name,
give it to him and he'll write it for you.

669
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:01,490
And you make your mark beside it.

670
00:58:01,629 --> 00:58:06,464
Do not hesitate to say
what's on your mind, please.

671
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,329
lsaac, you go.

672
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:16,805
Welcome, my friends.

673
00:58:17,178 --> 00:58:20,306
We have gathered for a high purpose:

674
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:23,407
to prepare an address...

675
00:58:24,018 --> 00:58:27,818
to the white inhabitants of South Carolina.

676
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:31,250
We do not claim
superior wisdom or virtue...

677
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:36,796
but merely ask in a conciliatory spirit...

678
00:58:37,531 --> 00:58:39,089
for rights...

679
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:41,800
due us...

680
00:58:43,504 --> 00:58:44,971
as men.

681
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,318
l now declare
this convention of colored people open.

682
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:08,391
Until recently,
the masters owned the land.

683
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:11,563
Now we got the right to own land.

684
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:15,794
But until we get the land
and can farm for ourselves...

685
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:19,028
the old masters
can hire us out for nothing...

686
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,435
or starve us if they want to.

687
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:24,400
Give us the land, l says.

688
00:59:25,946 --> 00:59:27,914
That's all l got to say.

689
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,719
Our next speaker, lsaac Kano.

690
00:59:52,807 --> 00:59:56,538
l ain't by no right no kind of speaker.

691
01:00:00,581 --> 01:00:04,540
But l've been doing me some thinking,
real recent-like.

692
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:12,684
l've been thinking a lot
about being a freed man.

693
01:00:15,763 --> 01:00:18,459
That's something l never knowed
as a child.

694
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:22,801
Now as a married man...

695
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:27,801
l've been thinking
a lot about having a family.

696
01:00:32,746 --> 01:00:36,113
l've been thinking
about the rest of my life.

697
01:00:38,953 --> 01:00:42,286
l've been thinking some about dying, too.

698
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:52,691
l reckon this here proclamation
ought to show some of them white folks...

699
01:00:54,168 --> 01:00:56,295
that we are just like them.

700
01:01:00,274 --> 01:01:01,764
Not different.

701
01:01:03,544 --> 01:01:07,605
Show them how we feels like them.

702
01:01:09,316 --> 01:01:12,581
We loves like them.

703
01:01:15,623 --> 01:01:19,354
We bears babies like them.

704
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:26,897
Lord knows, a lot of their daddies...

705
01:01:27,635 --> 01:01:30,126
give some of us their blood.

706
01:01:35,142 --> 01:01:38,737
And a lot of our mamas done fed...

707
01:01:39,013 --> 01:01:42,574
a whole lot of them their milk.

708
01:01:45,052 --> 01:01:46,986
And l've been figuring...

709
01:01:47,388 --> 01:01:51,119
somebody ought to tell
some of them white folks...

710
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:57,560
that when they dies, and when we die...

711
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:03,069
we all gets put into the same dirt...

712
01:02:08,776 --> 01:02:11,472
and how when we get to heaven...

713
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:17,375
we all gonna share...

714
01:02:19,386 --> 01:02:21,217
the same good Lord.

715
01:02:28,429 --> 01:02:33,298
l reckon enough has been said
about all them differences.

716
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:46,175
l thank you.

717
01:03:02,563 --> 01:03:05,862
Listen to them, Mr. Kano.
Just listen to them.

718
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:10,899
l just said what l thought.

719
01:03:10,971 --> 01:03:12,905
So pure and simple...

720
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,104
every man's heart soared.

721
01:03:17,478 --> 01:03:19,946
God bless you, Mr. Kano.

722
01:03:22,016 --> 01:03:24,541
-Thank you.
-For what?

723
01:03:27,788 --> 01:03:29,517
You called me ''mister.''

724
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:33,920
That ain't never been done before.

725
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:48,933
Them were some real powerful words
back there.

726
01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:52,137
You helped make them
real and powerful, lsaac.

727
01:03:52,946 --> 01:03:55,414
-Maybe.
-No maybes about it.

728
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:58,009
And what that make us?

729
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:00,246
We's Americans.

730
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:24,571
Get down, niggers.

731
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:27,271
l said get down!

732
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:32,414
You heard him. Get you down.

733
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:47,625
Your horse done run off, gentlemen.

734
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:51,599
But since you're here,
why don't you dance for us?

735
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:54,137
Dance for us, boys. Come on.

736
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:02,510
They ain't gonna dance.

737
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:05,410
Been to a nigger convention,
acting like white folks...

738
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:07,386
they forgot how to dance.

739
01:05:07,454 --> 01:05:09,251
Make them dance, boys.

740
01:05:20,467 --> 01:05:23,163
Madeline, come quick.
Something's wrong.

741
01:05:25,939 --> 01:05:27,702
Prudence, get the gun.

742
01:05:28,075 --> 01:05:29,906
Last chance to dance, boys.

743
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:32,610
Run, Titus!

744
01:05:34,281 --> 01:05:35,646
Get him !

745
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:39,184
Stupid nigger!

746
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,414
God, no!

747
01:05:46,126 --> 01:05:48,219
Help me!

748
01:05:50,264 --> 01:05:53,461
Give it to me. Jane, get on with me.

749
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:59,495
You critters can't dance,
but you can fight and you can run.

750
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,435
You think you're Americans.

751
01:06:01,508 --> 01:06:04,068
Never can be, and you never will be!

752
01:06:07,347 --> 01:06:09,008
Pull him up, boys.

753
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:17,985
Oh, God.

754
01:06:20,494 --> 01:06:23,429
Jesus, take care of Jane.

755
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:30,328
Yeah, now that's what l call dancing.

756
01:06:32,005 --> 01:06:33,700
Let's hang another one.

757
01:06:36,176 --> 01:06:39,077
Get him over here. Come on.

758
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:44,184
Here. Put it on him.

759
01:06:47,521 --> 01:06:49,079
Let him go!

760
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:52,281
Who's giving orders out here?

761
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:56,090
General Orry Main's widow
and this 12-gauge shotgun.

762
01:06:56,496 --> 01:07:00,557
Now let him down.
You four, get out of here now!

763
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,528
Oh, my Lord!

764
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:07,873
No!

765
01:07:15,015 --> 01:07:16,710
lsaac, please.

766
01:07:19,353 --> 01:07:21,583
Please don't.

767
01:07:21,755 --> 01:07:23,620
No, don't leave me.

768
01:07:43,343 --> 01:07:46,039
-That'll be all, Colonel.
-Sergeant.

769
01:07:49,783 --> 01:07:53,150
Troops, to the right, halt.

770
01:07:57,391 --> 01:07:59,825
Brigade Corporal, dismiss your men.

771
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:02,626
Troops dismissed.

772
01:08:10,904 --> 01:08:15,034
-Settling right into the life, aren't you?
-lt beats emptying out spittoons.

773
01:08:15,108 --> 01:08:16,370
How you doing?

774
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,237
But you know l'm an entertainer...

775
01:08:18,312 --> 01:08:20,837
and l've been teaching
some of the boys about drama.

776
01:08:20,914 --> 01:08:24,179
A bunch of the boys in C troop
would like to see some stage playing.

777
01:08:24,251 --> 01:08:26,310
They've got sort of a theater in town...

778
01:08:26,386 --> 01:08:29,480
but they don't sell no tickets
to colored folks.

779
01:08:29,656 --> 01:08:31,749
-ls that a fact?
-Sure is.

780
01:08:34,328 --> 01:08:37,126
There's a lot of facts changing these days.

781
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:43,261
Come on, my old dears, one more time.

782
01:08:43,337 --> 01:08:44,895
Why is this beard on me?

783
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:49,305
l didn't see that before,
my beard and hair are so long and white....

784
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,413
Tickets.

785
01:09:01,254 --> 01:09:03,279
-Change for $10.
-Thank you.

786
01:09:06,293 --> 01:09:09,490
-May l help you?
-l sure hope so.

787
01:09:10,364 --> 01:09:12,559
Do you sell tickets to colored?

788
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:16,697
Absolutely not. lf we did,
we wouldn't attract decent customers.

789
01:09:18,038 --> 01:09:19,801
ls Sam Trump inside?

790
01:09:20,107 --> 01:09:22,598
-You know Mr. Trump?
-You might say.

791
01:09:23,176 --> 01:09:25,576
He's very busy, and so am l.

792
01:09:35,355 --> 01:09:37,118
What are you doing?

793
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:40,884
What the blazes....

794
01:09:43,296 --> 01:09:44,422
You.

795
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:47,662
Get out. You've hurt her enough.

796
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:50,066
l'm not here for Willa, Sam.
l'm here for tickets.

797
01:09:50,137 --> 01:09:52,935
Tickets? See Mr. Thurlow, not me.

798
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:55,531
No, Sam,
the tickets are for colored soldiers.

799
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:57,076
-Colored?
-Yes, colored.

800
01:09:57,144 --> 01:09:58,406
Sell him the tickets.

801
01:09:58,478 --> 01:10:02,574
-Our policy will not allow Negroes.
-Then we won't play Leavenworth.

802
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:04,810
For God's sake, man, sell him the tickets.

803
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:07,251
All right, but no white people will attend...

804
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,788
and you people will suffer
at the box office.

805
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:11,084
Shut up.

806
01:10:15,228 --> 01:10:16,661
Care for a taste?

807
01:10:42,589 --> 01:10:44,784
You going to save some for me?

808
01:10:44,858 --> 01:10:47,088
You're supposed to be sober, Sam.

809
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,492
l will be thanks to you.

810
01:10:55,902 --> 01:10:58,803
All right, my old dears, once again.

811
01:10:59,105 --> 01:11:01,369
Why is this beard on me?

812
01:11:01,441 --> 01:11:03,636
Thank you for helping with Sam.

813
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,746
Thank you for backing me on the tickets.

814
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,957
Did you settle your debt on the prairie?

815
01:11:20,594 --> 01:11:22,118
No, not yet.

816
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:33,233
''Then must the Jew be merciful.

817
01:11:33,306 --> 01:11:36,571
''On what compulsion must l? Tell me that.

818
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:39,969
''The quality of mercy is not strain'd...

819
01:11:40,313 --> 01:11:44,181
''lt droppeth as the gentle rain
from heaven Upon the place beneath:

820
01:11:49,155 --> 01:11:50,918
''it is twice bless'd

821
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:57,296
''lt blesseth him that gives
and him that takes:

822
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:01,731
''lt becomes The throned monarch
better than his crown

823
01:12:02,802 --> 01:12:05,532
''But mercy is above this sceptred sway...

824
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:10,535
''lt is enthroned in the hearts of kings...

825
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:15,071
''lt is an attribute to God himself...

826
01:12:21,288 --> 01:12:23,188
''we do pray for mercy...

827
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:28,217
''And that same prayer doth teach us all
to render The deeds of mercy.

828
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:34,861
''l have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of my plea.''

829
01:12:48,014 --> 01:12:50,039
First you change the play.

830
01:12:51,885 --> 01:12:54,979
Then you change my staging of his play.

831
01:12:56,823 --> 01:13:00,816
William Shakespeare
wouldn't have any mercy on you.

832
01:13:01,528 --> 01:13:02,995
l had something to say.

833
01:13:03,063 --> 01:13:05,190
And you said it, regardless.

834
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:50,973
Cooper finally has the excuse
he's been waiting for.

835
01:13:51,678 --> 01:13:54,613
l can't make the mortgage payment
this month.

836
01:13:57,917 --> 01:14:00,818
Get the money
out of George Hazard's account.

837
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:03,516
-Go to his man.
-No, l won't.

838
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:05,758
The sawmill is dead.

839
01:14:05,892 --> 01:14:09,453
lf you don't go to him, you're condemning
your Negroes back into slavery.

840
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,123
George is in business for profit.

841
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:15,224
You think he doesn't know
what lsabel's doing?

842
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:18,702
You mean the same man
who worked alongside of our lsaac?

843
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:21,366
-lt's finished, Prudence.
-Never.

844
01:14:21,675 --> 01:14:25,441
All right, forget about them. Let Cooper
win and gloat. What do you care?

845
01:14:25,512 --> 01:14:29,972
You're a stubborn, spoiled, selfish...

846
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,940
Southern lady.

847
01:14:35,088 --> 01:14:39,388
lf he pushes me off onto Jack Ouinlan,
if he shows me...

848
01:14:40,694 --> 01:14:43,891
one ounce of pity...

849
01:14:45,432 --> 01:14:46,865
l swear....

850
01:15:01,614 --> 01:15:05,448
-What the hell's going on?
-Just following your orders, George.

851
01:15:05,518 --> 01:15:08,783
You asked me to tell you
if lsabel tries to move in on your interest.

852
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:12,347
She has, in South Carolina at Mont Royal.

853
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:34,543
l need your help.

854
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,421
Please.

855
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:58,002
Where is the partnership agreement
between Cooper and lsabel located?

856
01:15:58,071 --> 01:16:00,403
-l don't know.
-lt is important, Madeline.

857
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:02,236
l'm sure it is, but--

858
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:06,039
Wait, l'm sorry.
l'm sure we'll find it, wherever it is.

859
01:16:06,112 --> 01:16:08,672
This whole thing
has just got me so furious.

860
01:16:11,317 --> 01:16:12,784
What is this?

861
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:19,417
l've been tracking Elkanah Bent
with the help of the Pinkertons.

862
01:16:25,265 --> 01:16:27,165
l want to thank you for coming.

863
01:16:27,233 --> 01:16:31,693
l just had to. You have
a sizable investment at Mont Royal.

864
01:16:33,606 --> 01:16:36,507
That's not the only reason you came, is it?

865
01:16:41,781 --> 01:16:42,805
No.

866
01:16:44,818 --> 01:16:46,285
No, it isn't.

867
01:16:55,094 --> 01:16:57,062
-Edwin.
-Excuse me, sir.

868
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:01,130
Mrs. Main will stay the night with us.

869
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:05,137
She and l will need two train tickets
to Washington, earliest tomorrow.

870
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:06,365
Very good, sir.

871
01:17:06,439 --> 01:17:09,101
Jack, l'll need you to find the specifics...

872
01:17:09,175 --> 01:17:11,973
of a partnership entered into
in South Carolina.

873
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:24,179
Thank you, Mrs. Main.
You've done what no one else could.

874
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,173
Company, halt.

875
01:18:54,547 --> 01:18:57,482
Lieutenant, we got a war party
about half a mile out.

876
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,313
Lead the way, Mr. Main.

877
01:18:59,886 --> 01:19:03,720
Column, left turn forward. At a gallop!

878
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,817
Open fire! Fire at will!

879
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:59,134
Keep walking. Steady.

880
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,147
There they are, Lieutenant.

881
01:20:07,253 --> 01:20:08,413
Charge!

882
01:20:33,346 --> 01:20:35,405
What are you doing?
You ruined the whole thing.

883
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:37,574
We would have had them
if you hadn't interfered.

884
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:41,086
Sorry, Colonel. We had no idea
it was a trap. lt appeared to the scout--

885
01:20:41,154 --> 01:20:42,416
Shut up.

886
01:20:43,623 --> 01:20:44,783
Yes, sir.

887
01:20:51,697 --> 01:20:53,392
This is your scout?

888
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:56,260
Yes, sir. Mr. Main.

889
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:57,969
Sound recall!

890
01:20:58,204 --> 01:20:59,967
The main village is on Cottonwood Creek.

891
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:03,008
We were trying to bait out the warriors
and strike the village.

892
01:21:03,076 --> 01:21:05,476
Now it's all been ruined, thanks to you.

893
01:21:05,545 --> 01:21:07,206
Bring up my mount!

894
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:11,477
Main, not only are you
a despicable traitor...

895
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:13,881
you're a damn deserter, as well.

896
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:16,046
l only hope l see you hang!

897
01:21:16,422 --> 01:21:17,855
You go to hell.

898
01:21:58,531 --> 01:22:01,056
You say a word, boy, l'll hurt you.

899
01:23:48,574 --> 01:23:51,441
Running Wolf, you remember me?

900
01:23:56,215 --> 01:23:58,115
l don't speak Cheyenne.

901
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:03,183
Where is Adolphus and the boy?

902
01:24:03,256 --> 01:24:07,750
Man-ready-for-war and his dog soldiers,
they've killed them.

903
01:24:07,994 --> 01:24:11,589
-l did not know.
-You know where Man-ready-for-war is?

904
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:13,627
Would you kill him?

905
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,260
Yes, l would.

906
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:19,838
He was here three, four days back.

907
01:24:20,873 --> 01:24:22,898
He's gone. You may search.

908
01:24:23,843 --> 01:24:25,401
He's gone.

909
01:24:28,447 --> 01:24:31,416
He and his bunch
attacked a wagon train 3 miles east.

910
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:34,385
-You may search.
-l believe you, Running Wolf.

911
01:24:35,921 --> 01:24:39,755
The soldiers will be coming, understand?
They'll be looking for him.

912
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:41,886
This is my woman.

913
01:24:42,695 --> 01:24:46,791
We are old, with children and women.

914
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:49,134
We are not at war.

915
01:24:49,635 --> 01:24:51,068
No, l know.

916
01:24:53,306 --> 01:24:55,638
Come on, sound the charge!

917
01:25:23,636 --> 01:25:25,001
Venable.

918
01:25:28,274 --> 01:25:29,502
Damn you, Main!

919
01:25:29,575 --> 01:25:32,635
These people breed like rabbits
and make more warriors.

920
01:25:32,712 --> 01:25:34,873
Damn the red devils, and damn you!

921
01:25:34,947 --> 01:25:36,744
Let it go!

922
01:26:09,482 --> 01:26:11,211
Keep fighting!

923
01:26:19,191 --> 01:26:21,091
Kill the horses!

924
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:26,758
Use your sabers.

925
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:34,872
Kill them !

926
01:27:03,436 --> 01:27:04,869
Sergeant, good work.

927
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:08,395
Cordon the men up at the end of
the village. Let's get ready to move out.

928
01:27:08,474 --> 01:27:09,498
Yes, sir.

929
01:27:20,586 --> 01:27:22,451
You son of a bitch.

930
01:27:47,112 --> 01:27:50,343
-Form columns in twos, Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

931
01:27:53,452 --> 01:27:55,647
l would not advise that, sir.

932
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:00,651
l would advise
you getting out of here, now.

933
01:28:03,128 --> 01:28:04,186
Sir.

934
01:28:24,483 --> 01:28:27,111
Charlie, come back! You don't have to run.

935
01:28:27,186 --> 01:28:30,246
Charlie, what about your boy?
What about Gus?

936
01:28:30,322 --> 01:28:32,051
Charlie, come back!

937
01:28:34,793 --> 01:28:35,885
Damn!
