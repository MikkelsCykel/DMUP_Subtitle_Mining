The place: New York City.

2
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:16,965
The time: now. 1 962.

3
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:19,940
And there's no time or place like it.

4
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:25,106
If you've got a dream, this is the place
to make that dream come true.

5
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:29,653
That's why the soaring population
of hopeful dreamers has just reached...

6
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,756
...eight million people.

7
00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:37,327
Oh, make that eight million and one.

8
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:41,056
-Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
-Taxi!

9
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,030
Wait. Where are you going?

10
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,246
Down with the bomb.

11
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,477
Down with the bomb.
Down with the bomb.

12
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:06,146
Down with the bomb.
Down with the bomb.

13
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:07,848
Down with the b--

14
00:05:08,153 --> 00:05:10,815
Barbara?

15
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:13,423
-Barbara Novak?
-Oh, l think so.

16
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,560
-Oh, thank goodness you're here.
-Vikki?

17
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:19,060
Vikki Hiller, your editor, in the flesh.

18
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,859
lt is so nice to finally
meet you in person.

19
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:24,126
My goodness, you're gorgeous.

20
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:28,434
We'll have a photo shoot for
the book jacket. There's time.

21
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,235
The book doesn't come out for a week.
One week. Oh, my.

22
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,935
Don't be nervous. Cigarette?

23
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:40,684
Barbara, this is my secretary, Gladys.
Gladys, Barbara Novak.

24
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,786
Oh, l know. lt's a pleasure.

25
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:47,084
Hello, Gladys. l'm glad to finally
have a face to put with the voice.

26
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,955
Vik, l need you to sign off
on this pronto.

27
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,394
Maurice Johns, art director.

28
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,062
Barbara Novak, your cover.

29
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:02,432
Oh, Maurice. l love it!

30
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:05,132
Down With Love. Hear, hear.

31
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,301
l wish someone had
written your book...

32
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,913
...1 0 years ago before
it was too late for me.

33
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,072
Gladys, it's never too late.

34
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,879
Great job. Sorry if the guys in
reproduction have been riding your tail.

35
00:06:16,054 --> 00:06:18,113
Well, l'm not.

36
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:23,725
They're ready for you in the lion's den.

37
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:30,795
-Lion's den?
-Oh, don't worry. You'll be fine.

38
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,831
Just take a deep breath.

39
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:49,010
Gentlemen, this is Miss Novak.

40
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,848
-E.G.
-C.B.

41
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,686
-C.W.
-J.B.

42
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,521
-J.R.
-R.J.

43
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,323
-Okay.
-O.K. can't make it. He's down with T.B.

44
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,625
Oh, what a shame. ls it serious?

45
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:06,828
No, they're just having breakfast.
T.B. is Theodore Banner.

46
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:10,338
The owner of Banner House.
The fellow publishing your book.

47
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,437
That's his portrait, there.

48
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:19,313
Sorry if we've kept you, but Barbara hit
a storm on her way down from Maine.

49
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:21,543
So you've come down from Maine, huh?

50
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:23,653
Well, you remember, C.B.

51
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:26,382
Miss Novak is the farmer's
daughter librarian...

52
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:30,050
...who spent the long, cold New England
winter writing her manuscript...

53
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,388
...by the light of a lonely oil lamp.

54
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,896
l'm at a loss here, ladies.

55
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:39,002
l'm afraid l don't know exactly
what Miss Novak's book is about.

56
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,970
Miss Novak's book is a serious work
of nonfiction entitled--

57
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:45,507
Vikki, excuse me, it's right behind you.

58
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:47,770
Would you mind pouring me
a cup of coffee?

59
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:55,216
lt's a serious work of nonfiction entitled
Down With Love.

60
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:58,550
-This is empty.
-lf you're making a pot, l'll have a cup.

61
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:00,520
-Count me in.
-Likewise.

62
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,159
-Ditto.
-None for me, Vikki.

63
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:03,589
Thanks, R.J.

64
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:05,194
l'll have a Sanka.

65
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,564
As l was saying, the central thesis of
Miss Novak's book, Down With Love...

66
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:16,195
...is that women will never be happy
until they become independent...

67
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:20,071
...as individuals by achieving
equal participation in the work force.

68
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:23,112
And how do you propose
women do this, Miss Novak?

69
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:27,080
By saying, ''Down with love.''

70
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,015
Love is a distraction.

71
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:32,679
lf women stopped falling in love,
it would be the end of the human race.

72
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:33,881
Not at all.

73
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:40,055
l say women should refrain from love,
C.W., not sex.

74
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:42,028
lsn't that the same thing?

75
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,799
l mean, for women.

76
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:50,429
lt won't be, after they've mastered
the three levels in my book...

77
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,907
...that will teach any woman
to live life the way a man does.

78
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,107
Level 1 instructs women to abstain from
men altogether so they'll stop thinking...

79
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:02,981
...that the pleasures experienced
during the sex act are related to love.

80
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:08,148
They're not. As women will learn by
practicing the self-pleasuring technique...

81
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:11,988
...that l've detailed in chapter 7,
entitled:

82
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:13,887
''Up With Chocolate.''

83
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:18,092
You see, gentlemen, the female
experience is a biological reaction...

84
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,966
...to chocolate that triggers the same
pleasurable responses in the brain...

85
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,937
...as are triggered during sex.

86
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:27,567
By substituting chocolate for sex,
the female will soon learn...

87
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,509
...the difference between sex and love.

88
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:34,618
Love for a man
will no longer occupy her mind.

89
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:38,916
She will now find that she has the time
and the energy to move on to Level 2...

90
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,958
...where taking on new challenges will
lead to the self-sufficience of Level 3...

91
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:47,087
...where the woman becomes active in
the workplace and earns and achieves...

92
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:51,827
...an unequivocal equality with men.

93
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:58,699
And all this time the woman
is abstaining from sex?

94
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,377
Heavens, no.

95
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:05,107
By Level 3, she can have sex
whenever she likes, without love...

96
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:10,812
...and enjoy it the way a man does,
''à la carte.''

97
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:17,694
Well, Miss Novak,
your theories may have worked...

98
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:21,161
...with the gentlemen up in Maine,
but the men in Manhattan...

99
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:24,893
...are not the fine, upstanding,
straightforward men of Maine.

100
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,005
The men of Manhattan are devious.
They're dangerous.

101
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:31,233
They'll be coming at you
from every angle.

102
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:34,138
When you're watching your front,
they'll attack the rear.

103
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:37,679
And when you're protecting your rear,
they'll drop out of the sky.

104
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:49,154
One more kiss.

105
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,556
Easy, baby. Careful you don't fall out.

106
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,094
Bye-bye.

107
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,347
Very good. l'll let him know.

108
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,509
Mr. McMannus, Catcher Block
has just landed on the roof.

109
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:34,531
-Are you Catcher Block's secretary?
-Yes, Mr. McMannus.

110
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,765
l'm Sally. l'm new.

111
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:40,809
They're always new. When he gets in,
tell him to see me. He's fired.

112
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:46,783
-You're fired.
-No, l'm not.

113
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,384
Oh, yes, you are.

114
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:51,579
You can take your Pulitzer
and your beloved Underwood...

115
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:54,247
...and your change of underwear
and clear out.

116
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,325
Do you work for me?

117
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:01,955
You had a story due yesterday,
but l gave you more time.

118
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:06,797
l held the presses so you could get
your scoop on Nazis hiding in Argentina.

119
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,132
Then l see this.

120
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:11,742
''ltem:

121
00:12:11,909 --> 00:12:15,072
Know magazine's star journalist,
Catcher Block, ladies' man...

122
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:19,342
...man's man, man about town,
was seen leaving the Copa last night...

123
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,008
...with a doggy bag and three girls
from the floor show.''

124
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:25,621
l took the bossa nova triplets
to Cocoa Beach.

125
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,155
NASA was throwing a luau.

126
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,850
Oh, well, l hope you enjoyed it.

127
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:33,189
Because unless you found Nazis
hiding at your luau, you're fired.

128
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:39,699
There were Nazis hiding at your luau!
l knew you'd do it.

129
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:41,338
What do you got for me, Catch?

130
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:45,340
Argentina isn't the only hiding place
for Nazis. They're hiding in Florida too.

131
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,637
Wow. How? Who's hiding them?

132
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:50,280
-We are.
-We-- Americans?

133
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:53,042
Why? Nazis are bad. We're good.

134
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:56,050
Yeah, but some bad Nazis
are good scientists.

135
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,020
Like the guy building the rocket to land
on the moon and win us the space race.

136
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:03,217
He's a Nazi. And l saw
the top-secret file to prove it.

137
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,658
Here, l brought you a souvenir.

138
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:13,167
A top-secret NASA
security clearance badge.

139
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:16,330
-How did you get this?
-Blame it on the bossa nova.

140
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,242
-The triplets?
-Yeah.

141
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:26,907
You see, Lo shakes her maracas
and Rosa bounces her bongos...

142
00:13:27,352 --> 00:13:32,756
...while Nena is all hands.
1 20 words a minute.

143
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:35,415
The story, it's written?

144
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,594
Whoa, Catch!

145
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,356
But is it safe to print?
NASA is gonna blow its stack.

146
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:44,558
Well, they forgave Germany,
they can forgive us.

147
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:47,637
Get someone from Legal up here.

148
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:51,839
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

149
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,033
Yes, sir.

150
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:56,540
My analyst says l only react
to you with such vehement loathing...

151
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,614
...because l admire you so much.

152
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:01,752
He says l resent you
for being a self-made man.

153
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,410
As opposed to the son
of a self-made man.

154
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:08,184
Here, l hope you have your garters
from last night. There's none in here.

155
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,792
Garters?

156
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:12,555
l haven't worn garters
since Nixon conceded.

157
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,630
What are you, turning into a beatnik?

158
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,565
Oh, step into the future, Mac,
garters are a thing of the past.

159
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:23,132
l don't know, Catch.

160
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:26,242
l have enough of an insecurity
complex without worrying...

161
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:29,175
...about my socks falling down.

162
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:33,781
How can you know you won't show
a shiny shin when you cross your legs?

163
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:35,475
lt's a miracle of the space age.

164
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:41,056
Sock manufacturers are using new
fibers like Lycra, Orlon and Dacron...

165
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,194
...to put super stay-up power
into their over-the-calf sock.

166
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:47,656
What is the average length
for most men?

167
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:51,666
How would I know? Do you think I spend
time in the locker room looking around...

168
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:53,303
...making a comparative study?

169
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:55,439
Let me see yours again, then.

170
00:14:55,606 --> 00:15:00,441
-We could measure. I'll get a ruler.
-Better make it a yardstick.

171
00:15:00,611 --> 00:15:03,910
Let's be accurate.
Make sure you've got it fully extended.

172
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:06,106
Here you have it. Up the whole way.

173
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:08,980
It stays up all the way
all day long, Mac.

174
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:12,645
That's the miracle I told you about.
Better living through chemistry.

175
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,758
You got 1 6 inches.

176
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:17,417
Sixteen inches!

177
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,927
How long does a man's hose
have to be?

178
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,759
That's 32 inches of confidence
in every step.

179
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,368
Don't forget, l've got two of them.

180
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,640
l don't believe it.
You went through another one.

181
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,141
That's three this month.

182
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:37,338
What is it about the workplace
that women just can't seem to handle?

183
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,849
Men. They want us to fail.

184
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:43,111
lnviting me to New York
to launch my book...

185
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:45,653
...when they have no intention
of promoting it.

186
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:48,291
-Don't worry. l have a plan.
-You do?

187
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:52,225
Remember when you called to say you'd
like publicity where men would see it?

188
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:56,162
''Perhaps in a men's magazine,'' you said.
A prestigious men's magazine.

189
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,895
The most widely circulated
and highly respected men's magazine.

190
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,164
-Know?
-Yes, you did.

191
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,332
No, l mean Know.
Know magazine for men in the know.

192
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,375
Oh. Yes, exactly.

193
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:10,514
-You got us advertising in Know?
-l did better.

194
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:15,983
l got you a cover story written by Know
magazine's star journalist, Catcher Block.

195
00:16:16,153 --> 00:16:19,520
Catcher Block? The ladies' man,
man's man, man about town?

196
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,524
Oh, Vikki, you're the best friend
a girl from Maine who wrote a book...

197
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,889
...and came to New York
could ever have.

198
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:31,592
You don't know the half of it. l hear
Catcher Block is gorgeous and eligible.

199
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,065
Not that that matters to us.

200
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:37,002
Down with love.

201
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:40,439
l can't believe it.
Me on the cover of Know.

202
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:41,771
Know.

203
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:43,743
-No.
-Catch, please, l promised.

204
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,439
lt's one cover story.

205
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:49,245
A girl's never called me in my life,
let alone invited me for a drink.

206
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,049
l think this Vikki really likes me.
l think l might really like her.

207
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:54,919
l'm sure l would if she likes me.

208
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:58,027
And she does, because l told her
as owner of Know magazine...

209
00:16:58,195 --> 00:16:59,526
...l had pull with my staff.

210
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:03,064
Then pull your staff with one
of your other writers. l'm not doing it.

211
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,895
No, it can't be anyone else.

212
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,969
The best thing
l have to offer a woman...

213
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,265
...is the same thing
you offer a woman. You.

214
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,806
Yeah, but l'm all tied up, Mac.
l'm using me.

215
00:17:11,976 --> 00:17:14,740
Come on. lt'll be fun.

216
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:17,312
-You like fun.
-Fun?

217
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:21,110
lnterviewing a man-hating, embittered
New England spinster librarian?

218
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,775
How do you know what she's like?

219
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,320
Who else would write a book called
Down With Love?

220
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:28,652
You don't have to be a Nazi
rocket scientist to figure that out.

221
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:30,759
Catch, please, please, please, please.

222
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:36,264
l hope you won't be disappointed.

223
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:09,266
Oh, Vikki, it's adorable.

224
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:15,530
My first New York phone call.

225
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,298
lt must be Know magazine.

226
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,500
No one else has your number.

227
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:23,408
lt must be Catcher Block.

228
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:29,652
-This is Barbara Novak.
-This is Catcher Block.

229
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,483
Catcher Block? Catcher Block?

230
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:36,388
-Know magazine.
-Oh, yes, of course.

231
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,324
What can l do for you, Mr. Block?

232
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,692
l think it's what
l can do for you, Miss Novak.

233
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,494
l'd like to invite you to lunch
to discuss your book.

234
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:48,196
Well, that sounds very nice,
but l'll have to check my schedule...

235
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:49,737
...to see when l'm available.

236
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,239
We've already ordered. Can you be
in the Mahogany Room in 1 0 minutes?

237
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:56,038
l'm afraid that will be impossible,
Mr. Block.

238
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:57,680
Well, some other time, then.

239
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:00,715
Right, l'll see you in 1 5.

240
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:08,018
Catch, you are the best friend a guy
with 20 diagnosed neuroses ever had.

241
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:11,184
We've been friends a long time.
l knew you when you had 1 2.

242
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:16,231
Oh, this is great. l'll be right back.
Gotta go put in my shoe lifts.

243
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:23,172
-Guess who?
-As if l'd need to guess.

244
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,672
-Tell me my name.
-Tell me you love me.

245
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:27,538
Blimey, Catch, you know l love you.

246
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:31,011
And l love you too, Gwendolyn.

247
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:38,047
-How long's your layover?
-Never long enough.

248
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:41,123
There's always time for a matinee.

249
00:20:35,112 --> 00:20:36,340
Well, hello, Peter.

250
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:39,175
Barbara Novak, Peter McMannus.

251
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,511
Nice to meet you, Mr. McMannus.

252
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,016
Where's Mr. Block?

253
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:45,314
Yes, Mr. McMannus,
where's Mr. Block?

254
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:46,956
l don't know.

255
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:51,686
-Henri, where is Mr. Block?
-l don't know.

256
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:55,593
Mr. Block for you, Mr. McMannus.

257
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,701
Here he is now.

258
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:05,135
-Catcher, where are you?
-Mac.

259
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,005
Something sprung up. Is she there?

260
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,478
-Yes, she is.
-Let me speak to the spinster.

261
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:15,085
Mr. Block would like to speak with you.

262
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:21,615
-This is Barbara Novak.
-l'm so sorry, Miss Novak.

263
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,282
The darnedest thing.

264
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,554
l was waiting for you at the bar
and a little English foxhound...

265
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,961
...walked right in, came up to me
and started nuzzling me.

266
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:33,331
She seemed so lost, and didn't
want to go with anyone else...

267
00:21:33,504 --> 00:21:38,134
-...so l just had to take care of her.
-Mr. Block, that is so thoughtful.

268
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,403
l remember reading that
the true test of a man's character...

269
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:44,012
...is how he treats
a defenseless creature.

270
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:47,639
Tell me, Mr. Block,
how is the little bitch now?

271
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:52,414
Well, l've got her all nestled in a box,
but l don't think she'll be content...

272
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,022
...until l'm holding her.

273
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:57,024
Miss Novak, could we
rain check until dinner?

274
00:21:57,194 --> 00:21:58,855
Of course.

275
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:04,262
-Well, goodbye, Mr. Block. Until dinner.
-Goodbye.

276
00:22:22,186 --> 00:22:23,744
This is Barbara Novak.

277
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:28,119
Miss Novak, l am so sorry,
the darnedest thing.

278
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:29,623
Yes, Mr. Block.

279
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:32,626
l'm out in the park with
my little French poodle...

280
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:36,596
...and she's just not ready to go in yet,
if you know what l mean.

281
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,234
Oh, l do.

282
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:41,929
But here's a little advice
from a farm girl to a city boy.

283
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:45,132
You'll find that if you stick
a little twig in her bottom...

284
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,642
...she'll remember why she
went out with you in the first place.

285
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:50,746
l'll keep that in mind.

286
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:55,477
Miss Novak, l hate to ask, but could we
rain check until breakfast?

287
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:59,747
Of course. Goodbye, Mr. Block.
Until breakfast.

288
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,166
l just don't know.
lt's not like Catch to be late.

289
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:13,599
No, he usually calls to cancel
right on time.

290
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:18,071
Oh, Barbara, l'm sure he'll call.
l mean come.

291
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:22,140
Elke and l missed you at lunch
yesterday, Gwendolyn.

292
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:27,114
Oh, l took in a matinee
with Catcher Block.

293
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,784
ls that so?

294
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:33,480
Elke and l missed you
at dinner last night, Yvette.

295
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:36,421
l took in a night game
with Catcher Block.

296
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,957
l told him l'd give up flying for him.

297
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,497
l did too.

298
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,830
-Now l wonder if he ever loved me.
-l wonder if he even cared.

299
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:50,603
l wonder what's keeping Elke.

300
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:03,543
This is Barbara Novak.

301
00:24:03,754 --> 00:24:06,689
l'm so sorry, Miss Novak.
The darnedest thing.

302
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:09,849
l got waylaid by the sweetest
Swedish Lapphund...

303
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:13,394
...who kept me up half the night,
and l'm afraid l'm still in bed.

304
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:17,022
My, you do get way laid.

305
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:19,533
-Would you care for another beverage?
-Thank you.

306
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:22,365
-l beg your pardon?
-l was saying thank you, Miss Novak.

307
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,302
You are very understanding.

308
00:24:24,475 --> 00:24:26,409
Could we rain check until lunch?

309
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:30,673
Oh, Mr. Block,
you can take your rain check...

310
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,715
...and as we say
on the farm at harvest time...

311
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:36,717
...put it where the sun does not shine.

312
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:40,653
Miss Novak, if you're looking to get
dinner, then just say so.

313
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:44,316
Oh, Mr. Block.

314
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:49,831
l wouldn't meet with you
in 1 00 years.

315
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,437
Goodbye, Mr. Block. Forever!

316
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,835
Mr. McMannus,
thank you for your trouble.

317
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:04,947
Not at all.

318
00:25:05,115 --> 00:25:08,414
Vikki, l'll call a taxi.

319
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:15,191
-Guess this means we're through.
-Oh, it's sad, isn't it?

320
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,624
This is the first time l've eliminated
having a future with a man...

321
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:21,195
...before we've had the chance
to have had a past.

322
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:23,925
Goodbye, Mr. McMannus.

323
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,302
lt was nice while it lasted.

324
00:25:34,478 --> 00:25:38,380
l haven't had dinner and breakfast with
the same woman since l had a nanny.

325
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:41,313
l'm sorry, Peter, but Vikki
is not the only girl for you.

326
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:42,975
That's why l brought you here.

327
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:47,385
You brought me here
because we're buddies, right?

328
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:48,718
Bosom buddies.

329
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:06,734
-Get a load of those rockets.
-Here's to antigravity.

330
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,901
Stay with me, buddy.
You'll get the spins.

331
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,809
And whatever you do,
don't close your eyes.

332
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:14,746
Don't close your eyes.

333
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,153
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

334
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,020
lt's your book.

335
00:26:24,428 --> 00:26:26,419
On sale, Scribners Fifth Avenue.

336
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:29,427
One?

337
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,397
Just one?

338
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:36,339
All that work, and, and, and one.

339
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:40,375
lf somebody buys it,
well, then there will be none.

340
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:43,672
lt'll be as if it never even existed.

341
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:47,283
No, no. Doubleday also has one.

342
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:51,949
Barbara, l know you're thinking
this is a real setback...

343
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:54,454
...but l promise you
l will think of something.

344
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:03,960
lf only we could get your book
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

345
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:08,468
How exactly do you get a book
on The Ed Sullivan Show?

346
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:12,004
Vikki, you're incredible.

347
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:14,736
She wasn't even on the bill.
How did they fit her in?

348
00:27:14,945 --> 00:27:17,675
Oh, the best luck.
The Singing Nun fell off her scooter...

349
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:20,009
...coming across the Triborough Bridge.

350
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:23,517
l guess somebody up there likes me.

351
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,518
--a really big surprise.

352
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:31,594
Because it coincides with the arrival
of a new book, Down With Love...

353
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:35,357
...which this week is at your
booksellers from coast to coast.

354
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:41,732
We have a very, very special friend
of our show to do a song of that book.

355
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:48,174
Now, I want a really big, warm
welcome for Judy Garland.

356
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:38,090
Yes, ma'am.
Down With Love by Barbara Novak.

357
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:40,492
lt's called Down With Love
by Barbara Novak.

358
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,340
You said she was a spinster.

359
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:43,850
l never used the word spinster
in my life.

360
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,922
Okay, once. When l told my mother it
was incorrect to call her son a spinster.

361
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:50,719
-You said she was a brunette.
-l did not.

362
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:54,125
She didn't sound blond on the phone.
Do you still wanna date Vikki?

363
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:56,390
Of course. You think
l wanna die a spinster?

364
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,557
Call her. Tell her l'll do
the cover story.

365
00:30:58,735 --> 00:31:00,726
Oh, Catch, you are the best friend
a guy--

366
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:03,805
Just call.

367
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,374
Not since Johann Gutenberg's invention
of the printing press...

368
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:12,106
...which changed forever the landscape
of man's destiny...

369
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:16,378
...has one book reached so many
and achieved so much.

370
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:20,250
Reminding all of us here today
of the noble goal...

371
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:25,054
...which called us to toil in the field
of publishing to begin with:

372
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,124
Sales.

373
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:31,290
So here's to Banner House's
new number one author...

374
00:31:31,468 --> 00:31:35,234
...and our new number one editor.

375
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,273
Say cheers, everyone.

376
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,307
Cheers.

377
00:31:41,077 --> 00:31:42,908
Those men are livid, B.N.

378
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,070
You're a hit. You're bigger
than the pill.

379
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:48,183
Oh, talk about big, V.H.

380
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:51,411
This office is huge. Congratulations.

381
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:53,613
We did it.

382
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,623
Well, hello, Gladys.

383
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:57,987
You look wonderful.

384
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:01,756
As you told me, Barbara,
it's never too late.

385
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:07,427
Oh, Vikki, Peter McMannus called again.
Now it's every half-hour.

386
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,601
Tell him we're too busy.

387
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,870
What do you mean? Too busy?

388
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:16,137
You know what it means.
They hate us.

389
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:19,544
Too busy? Kennedy, Khrushchev
and Castro...

390
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:23,515
...weren't too busy during the Cuban
Missile Crisis to sit down and talk to me.

391
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:27,020
But this Down With Love chick
is too busy?

392
00:32:27,257 --> 00:32:29,691
Doing what? Eating chocolate?

393
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,351
I'm sorry, panel, you've been stumped.

394
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:34,827
The author of the bestseller
Down With Love...

395
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:37,761
-lt's Novak!
-...Barbara Novak.

396
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:42,001
Barbara, I know every woman bought
your book. And I know every man...

397
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:45,539
...sneaked out and bought it to find out
what their women were reading.

398
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:47,904
Oh, well, that's when the sales doubled.

399
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:50,408
But then they tripled.
How did that happen?

400
00:32:50,647 --> 00:32:54,378
It seems that church groups
in the Bible belt were so zealous...

401
00:32:54,584 --> 00:32:58,680
...about being seen burning my book
that every time they had a bonfire...

402
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:03,519
...they would call the next day and
reorder, so they could have another one.

403
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:09,332
Now, I've heard a lot of talk
about Chapter 8...

404
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:12,662
...about the worst kind of man,
the kind every woman should avoid.

405
00:33:12,836 --> 00:33:14,736
-What's that title again?
-Oh, yes.

406
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:18,397
Men Who Change Women As
Often As They Change Their Shirts.

407
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:22,910
And have you met a lot of that kind
of man in your research?

408
00:33:23,113 --> 00:33:25,547
You're not asking me to name names,
are you?

409
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:28,445
No, of course not.

410
00:33:29,185 --> 00:33:31,085
Catcher Block.

411
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:44,125
Four million women in the naked city...

412
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:48,737
...and the one you let get away, the one
you had to get on the bad side of...

413
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:53,740
...is the woman all the other four million
are listening to.

414
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:58,605
You blew it, buddy.

415
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:04,345
The age of Catcher Block, ladies' man,
man's man, man about town, is over.

416
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:06,317
The king is dead.

417
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:10,220
l hate to spoil your fun, Mac, but
the four million women l go out with...

418
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:13,487
...don't listen to Barbara Novak.

419
00:34:16,232 --> 00:34:18,132
Hello.

420
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:22,260
Hey, Gwendolyn, baby.
Where are you?

421
00:34:22,772 --> 00:34:26,003
Well, then get out of the airport.
We have reservations for 1 0:00.

422
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:31,505
Well, you can't sit in the terminal till
3 a.m. Aren't you gonna get hungry?

423
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:36,776
No, l'm pretty full. Besides, l have
to catch up on some reading.

424
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:41,253
Reading? Reading what?

425
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,320
Good night, Gwendolyn.

426
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:55,169
What's the matter, Catch?
Lose another one?

427
00:34:55,405 --> 00:34:58,806
l am going to bury that Novak broad...

428
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:02,843
...and turn this crazy upside-down-
with-love world right side up again.

429
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:06,312
l'm gonna write the exposé of
the century, so the world will know...

430
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:09,316
...once and for all that deep down,
all women are the same.

431
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,818
They all want the same thing:
love and marriage.

432
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:17,119
Even Miss Barbara ''Down With Love''
Novak. And l am going to prove it.

433
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:19,818
How? Novak won't even see you.

434
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:25,127
That's right. That's why Novak
won't even see me coming.

435
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:35,302
Barbara, you're not dressed.
Aren't you coming?

436
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:38,003
No. l'm just gonna stay in tonight.

437
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:40,308
Why? Because you don't have a date?

438
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:43,850
My date's a quarterback with 27
teammates. l'm sure he can fix you up.

439
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:49,356
l'm sure he couldn't.
l am persona non grata to all men.

440
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:52,393
l can't even get picked up
by a taxi driver.

441
00:35:52,562 --> 00:35:56,054
Now, this is crazy.
All of this fame and success...

442
00:35:56,232 --> 00:35:59,827
...and Miss Sex à la Carte is the only
woman who can't have sex à la carte.

443
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:01,903
At least not on this earth.

444
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:05,838
Maybe we can find you an astronaut
who's been in orbit the past two weeks.

445
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:09,103
lt's all right, Vikki. l'm perfectly content
on my own.

446
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:13,509
Well, when it comes to not needing
a man, you wrote the book.

447
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:37,530
-Taxi!
-Wait a minute.

448
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:41,143
-l have to pick up my dry cleaning.
-Can't. Gotta go back to the office.

449
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,609
Skip in Research is doing a fact-check
on Novak.

450
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,045
Who she knows, where she goes, what
she likes for dinner, à la carte.

451
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:50,778
Two minutes? l waited for you
to eat your hot dog.

452
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:55,448
You're right. l'll pick up your cleaning.
Go back to the office.

453
00:36:55,658 --> 00:36:57,125
Oh, but l--

454
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:03,257
Oh, make sure they starch the socks.

455
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:25,644
l'm getting it.

456
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:28,619
-You iron.
-No, you iron...

457
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:32,125
...and l'll spend all day up front
kibitzing with the customers.

458
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:34,687
We're equal now.

459
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:36,831
Again with that book.

460
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:47,200
Hello, Novak.

461
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:50,312
Hello, Mrs. Litzer.

462
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,277
Where's Mr. Litzer?

463
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:54,473
He's ironing.

464
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:58,348
lrving, say hello to Novak.

465
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:00,683
Hello, Novak.

466
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,523
l'll get your things, dear.

467
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:04,956
Thank you.

468
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:09,593
Yours too, mister.

469
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:20,974
Pardon me, miss, but you
sure look familiar. Are you...?

470
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:22,975
Yes, l am.

471
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:26,707
Well, l'll be a monkey's uncle.
Wait till l tell the folks back home...

472
00:38:26,883 --> 00:38:31,320
...l took my clothes to the same
dry cleaners as Miss Kim Novik.

473
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:34,012
No, no, my name is Novak.

474
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,715
Oh, that's right. Miss Kim Novak.

475
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:41,125
No, no, l'm not Kim Novak.
l'm Barbara Novak.

476
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:46,266
Oh, well, that doesn't ring a bell.

477
00:38:47,337 --> 00:38:49,271
You mean you've never heard of me?

478
00:38:49,505 --> 00:38:50,767
Oh, l'm sorry.

479
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,272
Oh, no. No, don't be.

480
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:55,877
l find it very refreshing.

481
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,339
You, Mr. Absent-minded Professor.

482
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:01,745
You left a lot of things
in your pockets.

483
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:04,512
Why, thank you, ma'am.

484
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:08,020
Excuse me. l'm sorry.

485
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:11,126
Do you mean that you've never heard
of my book...

486
00:39:11,294 --> 00:39:14,092
...the worldwide sensation,
Down With Love?

487
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:16,925
No, ma'am, l have not.

488
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:20,425
But lately, l've been out of this world.

489
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,937
Oh, look, my NASA security badge.
l've been looking all over for that.

490
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,306
-You're an astronaut?
-Why, yes, l am.

491
00:39:29,545 --> 00:39:32,537
Well, what's your name?
Maybe l've heard of you.

492
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:35,548
Zip.

493
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:38,419
Zip...?

494
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:42,581
Martin. Major Zip Martin.

495
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:45,961
Well, tell me, major...

496
00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:49,929
...are those parties in Cocoa Beach
as wild and uncivilized as they seem?

497
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:54,297
Oh, now, l couldn't say, ma'am.
l'm not much for going to parties.

498
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:59,169
My idea of a good time is to sit at home
with a good book...

499
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:03,108
...and smoke my pipe.

500
00:40:04,447 --> 00:40:07,974
Pay later. lrving's burning the ironing.

501
00:40:08,217 --> 00:40:10,515
Pardon me, miss.

502
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,289
Oh, we're stuck together.

503
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:20,827
Let me fix that.

504
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,728
There you go, Miss Novak.

505
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:36,801
Well...

506
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:41,045
...goodbye.

507
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,853
One, two, three, four.

508
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:46,818
Zip?

509
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:48,888
Yes, Miss Novak?

510
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,891
Well, l don't suppose that
you're staying in New York?

511
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:54,858
Why, yes, l am.

512
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:58,125
NASA sent me here to work
on a special project.

513
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,566
A top-secret project.

514
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:06,130
-Can you keep a secret?
-Yes.

515
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:07,536
Me too.

516
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:10,769
Gee, it sure seems like we got
a lot in common.

517
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,972
Why, yes, it does.

518
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,813
lt might be nice to see
just what we have in common.

519
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:21,423
And what we have that's different.

520
00:41:21,591 --> 00:41:23,422
l'm sorry?

521
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:29,097
Would you like to go to my place and
get to know each other a little better?

522
00:41:29,332 --> 00:41:31,994
-A little better?
-A lot better.

523
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,228
-A lot better than what?
-All the way better.

524
00:41:37,073 --> 00:41:41,510
Oh, gee. No, now, l couldn't do that.

525
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:44,612
Why, l couldn't get to know you
all the way better...

526
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:47,840
...until l knew you much, much better.

527
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:53,011
Do you think that you know me well
enough to let me buy you a drink?

528
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:55,084
Well....

529
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:59,954
l'd sure love a Tang.

530
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,096
Lose another pair of glasses?

531
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,965
No, l'm keeping a low profile.

532
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,470
Vikki's over there with some guy.

533
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:17,610
That's not some guy. That's
Johnny Trementus, the quarterback.

534
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:20,371
Fourteen hundred and thirty-two
complete passes.

535
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,310
ls he going for 1 433?

536
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:27,351
Well, Vikki's left herself wide open,
but Trementus surprisingly fumbles.

537
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,284
Now what's he doing?
ln layman's terms.

538
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:32,482
He's leaving. Now's your chance.

539
00:42:32,692 --> 00:42:34,660
l can't go over there. She hates me.

540
00:42:34,894 --> 00:42:36,589
She doesn't hate you. She hates me.

541
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,288
Now, stop warming the bench
and get in the game.

542
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:43,425
Once you run my Novak exposé, she will
hate you, and the clock will run out.

543
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:45,832
Can't you get off your Novak warpath?

544
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:47,940
Nope. l've got her surrounded.

545
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:51,305
And it won't take a surprise attack
to enter her tepee.

546
00:42:51,511 --> 00:42:53,877
l'm telling you, Kimo Sabe,
you want big wampum?

547
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:55,207
Make Vikki love you now.

548
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:59,909
Okay, okay, enough
with the football talk. l'm going.

549
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:06,052
-Here you are, Monsieur Block.
-Thanks, Henri.

550
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:10,128
Only, from now on it's Maj. Zip Martin.

551
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,358
Spread the word to the other maître d's,
the doormen...

552
00:43:13,533 --> 00:43:15,558
...theater ushers and taxi drivers.

553
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,862
Done, major.

554
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:26,673
lt'll be all right, McMannus.
Just be normal. Be cool.

555
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,010
Hello, Vikki.

556
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:35,983
Hello, Peter.

557
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,519
Are you in love
with that football player?

558
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:49,859
Not anymore. He only wanted one thing,
to slip me his manuscript.

559
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:53,699
He didn't even have the professional
courtesy to try and seduce me first.

560
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:56,740
The men who resent my success
won't give me the time of day.

561
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,778
And the men who respect my success
won't give me the time of night.

562
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:04,375
l don't know about other men,
but l swear if l had the chance...

563
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:08,385
...l would respect you and resent you
night and day and day and night.

564
00:44:08,588 --> 00:44:10,783
-Peter, you would?
-You bet.

565
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,288
You're on.

566
00:44:17,564 --> 00:44:20,727
Oh, Zip, isn't this exciting?

567
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,234
We must be the only two people in New
York who haven't seen Camelot yet.

568
00:44:25,405 --> 00:44:28,772
You're not just being nice?
You really haven't seen it either?

569
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:33,811
Oh, l can honestly say l have
never seen this show.

570
