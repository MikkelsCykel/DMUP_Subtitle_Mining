00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,832
Hey, Pete!
Hey, hold this.

2
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,393
I bought some sausage
to go with crackers

3
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,964
for Adrienne and me
because we made out last night.

4
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,141
Think she likes crackers?

5
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,271
I can't right now.
I gotta go. I'm in a hurry.

6
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,473
I bought French sausage

7
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,608
because I believe Adrienne's family
is of French descent.

8
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,209
Interesting. Look, I gotta go.

9
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,947
There should be plenty
if you want some later.

10
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,352
- Okay. Good luck.
- See you.

11
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,584
- You all right? Go!
- Wish me luck!

12
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,931
Last final.
Aced it, baby. Aced it!

13
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,161
Party time!

14
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,397
It all starts now.

15
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,200
Hey, I'm trying to study.

16
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,605
Booker, you finished
your last final yesterday.

17
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,404
I'm getting a head start
on next semester.

18
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,810
Wrong kind of head, little brother,
because today, you become a man.

19
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:32,318
No longer--get up--will you
look at yourself and see a little boy.

20
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,414
No longer will you cry in the shower
knowing no matter how hard you scrub,

21
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,949
you cannot rid yourself
of that most heinous of afflictions.

22
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,996
- Virginity!
- I don't cry in the shower.

23
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,225
Settle down.

24
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,497
This is all a very complicated process,
so pay attention.

25
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,028
Chicks won't have sex with a guy unless
the guy's bagged at least four other chicks.

26
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,304
Girls are shallow and want
a guy with experience--like me.

27
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,002
How am I supposed
to have sex with a girl

28
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,980
if girls won't have sex with a guy
who hasn't had sex?

29
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,609
The same way all men have been
doing it for thousands of years.

30
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,177
- The on-ramp to manhood--whores.
- I'm not going to a hooker!

31
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,813
- Don't you wanna be cool like me?
- You're not cool.

32
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,619
- Yes, I am.

- I'm not going to a hooker.

33
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,785
Look, I figured you'd try
and pussy out like this,

34
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,692
being the pussy that you are,
you pussy!

35
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,095
So I've already called an escort service,
your whore's on the way,

36
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,828
and I told everyone, so they're all gonna
think you're a homo if you don't do her.

37
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,462
I'm not giving
my special gift to a hooker.

38
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,869
I'm in love with Rachel.

39
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,032
You're a fag!

40
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,746
Forget that prude.

41
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,306
And that's for calling virginity
your special gift.

42
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,750
If you must call it something,
call it your horrible shame,

43
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,152
because that's what it is,

loser ass.

44
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,453
Did you really tell everyone
you got me a hooker?

45
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,685
Yes.

46
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,024
Now, you're gonna have sex with
this whore, and you're gonna like it.

47
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,960
Merry Christmas.

48
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,400
Did you hear?
Styles got Booker a prostitute.

49
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,372
- No way.
- Yes, way! He told me himself.

50
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,772
Pete, you've gotta hear this.

51
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,333
- I gotta meet someone at the station.
- Friend from out of town?

52
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,901
We're carpooling home for break.

53
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,380
- What's with the Christmas tree?
- Foosball bought it.

54
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,713
We're not supposed to have
Christmas trees--it's a fire hazard.

55
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,945
But the R.A. went home,

so who cares?

56
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,078
Whatever. See ya.

57
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,487
No, I can't come down.

I'm waiting for someone here!

58
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,150
No, I can't!

59
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,723
Adrienne, did you hear
about the prostitute?

60
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,194
Yeah, Styles told me.

61
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,824
It's disgusting. I don't even think
we should let her in the house.

62
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,332
- I agree.
- Tony, did you hear?

63
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,234
Yes, I heard about the prostitute,
and, no, I don't care.

64
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,965
- But prostitution--
- You know what?

65
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,904
You two need to stay out
of other people's shit.

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,940
You need to get a life.

67
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,405
He's such an asshole.
I don't know why Claire's with him.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,380
Yeah, what an asshole.

69
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,076
- Don't you think Tony's an asshole?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,382
- What's your problem?
- I kinda made out with Newmar last night.

71
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,853
I'm trying to avoid him.

72
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,853
I don't even need to tell you
how pathetic that is.

73
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,724
Maybe he'll forget about it
over Christmas.

74
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,599
- I doubt it. He's Jewish.
- How long are you here?

75
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,934
My last final's on Saturday.
I can't leave until then.

76
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,373
Come on, Lynne.
Let's go yell at Styles.

77
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,935
No prostitute is coming into this dorm
if I have anything to say about it.

78
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,355
- Hey, Adrienne.
- Gerri, how was the spelunking trip?

79
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,153
It was tough
but sort of interesting.

80
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,716
What's this?
From the university.

81
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,626
Maybe your appeal went through.

82
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,564
I wish. There's no way I'm getting
my scholarship back for next semester.

83
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,964
My grades were true shit.

84
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,025
- Who's the package from?
- I don't know.

85
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:42,040
I knew it. They rejected the appeal.
Oh, well. So much for college.

86
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,905
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't see that there's--

87
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,173
Have a great holiday, too.

88
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,810
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Hi, Claire.

89
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,785
Gerri, I'm going to the gym.
It's cardio-abs day. Wanna come?

90
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,989
- That was close.
- Explanation?

91
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,058
I kinda borrowed Claire's
favorite handbag without asking,

92
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,467
and I have no idea where I left it.

93
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,528
I'm trying to avoid her
until I can find it.

94
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,074
Or maybe she'll forget
about it over Christmas.

95
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,001
Yeah, you're screwed.

96
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,846
Do me a favor? A foreign exchange
student's meeting me here soon,

97
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,245
but I have to run down to work.

98
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,682
- Could you meet her for me?
- I'd like to, but I got a lot of--

99
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,351
Hey, Wang.
Hey, have you seen Adrienne?

100
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,021
No. Could you do me a favor?

101
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,586
Yeah. Maybe later, buddy.

102
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,824
But--but...

103
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,440
- You lose his bag, too?
- We kinda hooked up last night.

104
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,506
Shut up!
I was depressed.

105
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,573
I was hitting on Foosball all night
and he was totally ignoring me.

106
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,710
- lsn't Foosball gay?
- No!

107
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,988
- Sure. I'm here for you.
- Thanks, Foos.

108
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,650
Her name's Dominique,
she's French,

109
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,957
and she's gonna call my phone,
so hang on to it.

110
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,156
Do you still have
my copy of Steel Magnolias?

111
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,359
Booker's got it, I think.
He and Rachel were watching it.

112
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,098
- By the way, you're gay, right?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:23,768
Suck one! It's a free country
and I can get a whore if I want to!

114
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,038
No, you can't.
It's against the law.

115
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,512
Yeah, you're going to jail, mister.

116
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,105
Suck one!

117
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,464
Oh, my God!

118
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,129
Did I just hit you?
I am so sorry!

119
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,365
It's okay.

120
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,066
I was just looking for my handbag.

121
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,737
Okay. Well, did I leave
my books in here?

122
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,475
I don't know. I didn't see them.
But you can look if you want.

123
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,484
I'm on the way
to the gym, okay? Bye, baby.

124
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,899
"Britney, hope this
takes care of things.

125
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,374
Call me if you need
anything else. Lorenzo."

126
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,053
- Yeah?
- Lorenzo?

127
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,285
Hey. no names.
So. you got the package?

128
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,792
- Yeah, it's just--
- Cool.

129
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,487
We're square. right?
We're good?

130
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,291
I think there's been
some kind of mix-up.

131
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,026
What are you saying?
Is there a problem?

132
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,761
Well, yeah. The bag isn't--

133
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,497
You know what? We shouldn't
talk over the phone.

134
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,369
Meet me at the university arboretum
in 15 minutes.

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,930
- Yeah, but--

- Center bench.

136
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,839
So, you lost
all your money in Vegas?

137
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,575
I had a system, you know?

138
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,147
- But it didn't work.
- Right.

139
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,523
- Then Beth broke up with me.
- 'Cause you lost all your money?

140
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,187
I lost all her money, too.

141
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,463
Whatever. Then there's
the thing with the cat.

142
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,123
I don't even wanna hear about the cat.

143
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,463
- It was an accident.
- I'm sure it was.

144
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,494
That's in the past, man. What time
are you gonna be done with work?

145
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,507
I'm done at 6:00.
Just hang out at my dorm.

146
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,133
It's co-ed. You'll like it.

147
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,676
No one's gonna bother me, right?

148
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,077
I'm really not in the mood
for conversation. Just wanna chill out.

149
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,547
Pete, can you do me a big favor?

150
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,676
Tell Foosball my foreign exchange
student doesn't speak English well.

151
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,016
Foosball, no English. Cool.

152
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,687
I gotta get to work.
Come on, let's go.

153
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,848
Britney.

154
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,843
Lorenzo?

155
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,946
What's the problem?
You're expecting more?

156
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,051
Well, it's just that l...

157
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,930
What? Don't wanna talk in public?
I understand.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,763
Got someplace private we can go?

159
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,134
- Yeah, like a restaurant?

- No, like private.

160
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,308
Listen, there's something
I have to tell you--

161
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,707
I think that guy
right there's watching us.

162
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,473
Let's go.

163
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,588
This is your target.

164
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,484
You seem a little nervous.

165
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,993
I understand. You're worried
about your performance.

166
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,587
But you know what?
I have a fail-safe cure for that.

167
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,154
I wasn't gonna
share this with you,

168
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,291
but what's
an older brother for, right?

169
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,563
This is my beat-off rag.

170
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,105
I've been beating off with this
since I was in sixth grade.

171
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,664
I've never washed it, either.

It brings me luck.

172
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,677
- Oh, God, no!

- Oh, Booker, yes.

173
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,077
- Before Dominique gets here--
- Who's Dominique?

174
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,808
Your whore, you idiot.

175
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,009
Did you lose your virginity
to a hooker?

176
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,916
Hell, no.

I don't have to pay for it.

177
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,749
But Dominique comes
highly recommended,

178
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,483
so I'll probably do her
once you're done.

179
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,590
I want you to jerk off with this
before she gets here, okay?

180
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,994
I call it Susie. Trust me,

you are gonna be a stallion. Take it.

181
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,122
No!

182
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,259
Don't be such a girl.
It's just semen! Take it!

183
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,701
What the hell was that?

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,131
Nothing.

185
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,510
- What's up?
- I think that rag cut me.

186
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,943
Can I get my copy
of Steel Magnolias back?

187
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,176
Hey, guys.
This is my friend Cliff.

188
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,584
He's from France,

he doesn't speak any English,

189
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,144
so don't bother talking to him.

190
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,660
Look. Cola.

191
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,355
Yeah, let's go.

192
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,772
You know, I just realized the amount
you sent is what I agreed to.

193
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,968
I think I was just thinking
of another job.

194
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,436
So, you're saying we're cool?

195
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,504
Yeah, we're cool.

I'll keep in touch.

196
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:08,044
Wait. What do you say
we hang and talk for a bit?

197
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,786
I've wanted to meet you
in person for a long time,

198
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,518
Miss Master of Disguise.

199
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,521
I gotta a couple choice jobs
I want to run by you

200
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,790
that I think we could pull together.

201
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,593
I got a shitload of stuff
I gotta take care of.

202
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,361
Fifteen minutes.

203
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,334
Come on.
It'll be worth your while.

204
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,962
All right. Fine.
Fifteen minutes.

205
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,999
But...here's the deal.

206
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,876
I've set myself up in a dorm.
My name is Gerri Farber.

207
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,609
Don't do anything to blow my cover.

208
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,762
Claire, we have got to stop that prostitute
from coming in this house.

209
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,819
Sure. Whatever.

210
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,162
I'm not gonna stand by and watch
the moral decay of this dormitory.

211
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,005
What happened to your face?

212
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,098
Tony hit me.

213
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,772
With the door.
He hit me with the door.

214
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,642
I'll see you guys later.

215
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,843
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Tony's beating Claire.

216
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,784
He hit her with the door?
That was a pretty lame cover.

217
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,652
Didn't I tell you there was
something up with him?

218
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,747
You did!

219
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:19,813
French?

220
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,453
You didn't want to talk to anybody,
now they won't bother.

221
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,791
I don't speak French, man.

222
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,957
Neither does anyone else
in this dorm, so who cares?

223
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,125
We leave tomorrow, anyways.
I'm late for work.

224
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,567
I should've been there
like five minutes ago.

225
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,269
Oh, crap. Foosball.

226
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,439
- Have you seen Foosball?
- He's in McFee's room.

227
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,674
- Can you tell him something for me?
- I'm thirsty.

228
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,019
Newmar! I need you to go
to McFee's room and tell--

229
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,284
and tell Foosball the girl he's
waiting for doesn't speak English.

230
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,018
Yeah, but after l--

231
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,582
- Okay, fine.
- Thanks.

232
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,566
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

233
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,839
We're on to you, wife beater.

234
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,639
- What?
- We're on to you.

235
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,186
You know, sometimes I hate

this place. I really hate this place.

236
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,692
So, how long did it take you
to set all this up?

237
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,923
Over a year.

238
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,565
How do you feel
about armored cars?

239
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,540
Take Suzie and go use her
in the bathroom.

240
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,337
- No.
- Take it, Booker.

241
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,709
- Leave me alone!
- Take Suzie--now!

242
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,271
Shut up!
I'm calling Rachel.

243
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,742
Rachel lives
down the hall, tard. Tard!

244
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,788
Will you go easy on him?
He's nervous.

245
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,914
You know this is
a no-smoking dorm, don't you?

246
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,253
Good thing Brady went out of town.

247
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,056
Hey, when the cat's away,
it's time to play.

248
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,595
Give this back to me.

249
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,126
I have to go use the can.

250
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,309
Okay, when he comes out,
I'll just tell him that I love him.

251
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,380
Not tell him that I love him.
Tell him that I want him.

252
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,251
That is much sexier.

253
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,112
Adrienne!

254
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,265
- Where's Foosball?
- In the can.

255
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,291
- Are you guys waiting for a girl?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,702
Okay, I'm supposed to tell you
that she doesn't speak any English.

257
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,435
- Awesome!
- Okay.

258
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,068
Wait! Does that mean
she's here already?

259
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,372
I don't know.

260
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,110
She's here!

261
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,311
She doesn't speak
any English, either!

262
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,899
- Be a man!
- Rachel. it's me.

263
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:21,495
God!

264
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,834
He's here.

265
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,973
Get off the damn phone, Booker.
Your whore is here.

266
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,019
Can I help you?
Who are you looking for?

267
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,028
- I am looking for--
- Beat it, Marla.

268
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,031
Hi. You Dominique?

269
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,461
Great. Follow me.

270
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,061
- That's the prostitute?
- Yes, now get lost.

271
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,163
I am Dominique.
I am student from France--

272
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,902
- Get out, tramp!
- What? I am from France.

273
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,239
Come on, Dominique.
Ignore her. She's a bitch.

274
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,143
- Come on.
- Bitch.

275
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,274
Lynne!

276
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,511
Come on.

277
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,482
Loser!

278
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,085
Go freshen up, okay?
I have to prep him.

279
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,360
Come on!

280
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,226
- Have you guys seen Adrienne?
- Screw off, Newmar.

281
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,500
We could tell Foosball
about the prostitute.

282
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,543
He'll be on our side.
Gay guys are really sensitive.

283
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,941
Have you seen the prostitute?

284
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,603
She looked like such a skank.

285
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,875
Exactly what I pictured
a call girl looking like.

286
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,645
- A prostitute?
- I am from France.

287
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,173
Two hours max.
Next job's across town.

288
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,446
I'll be out in a flash.

289
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,112
I miss you.

290
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,485
Yeah. me. too.

291
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,352
- Hey, how's it going?
- Not too bad.

292
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,060
Listen, has anyone ever said anything
to you about thinking I'm a wife beater?

293
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,122
What?

294
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,294
Never mind, man.

You doing anything?

295
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,464
Just waiting for Wang's foreign
exchange student to show up. Why?

296
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,202
Well, Adrienne and I have

this acting final on Saturday,

297
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,938
and I can't find her anywhere.
You wanna help me?

298
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,079
- What's it about?
- Just some melodramatic crap.

299
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,979
My character knocks up
Adrienne's character.

300
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,642
In this scene, it's us fighting.

301
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,047
I don't know what
to do with a baby.

302
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,612
It's driving me nuts!

303
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,156
Of course I want her
to have the abortion,

304
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,750
but she won't listen to me.

305
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,795
So, I've made it up
in my mind to dump her.

306
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,854
Oh, God! Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

307
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,834
Tony got clair pregnant and wants her to
get an abortion or he's gonna dump her!

308
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,233
Oh, my God!

309
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,504
Hello? Dominique.

310
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,732
All right,
I'll be right down.

311
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,645
I'll catch you later. If you see Adrienne,
tell her I'm looking for her.

312
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,456
What's wrong with you?
Stop being such a lame-ass.

313
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,695
Leave me alone!
I love Rachel!

314
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,629
- Hello?
- Who is this?

315
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,642
- Who's this?
- This is Wang.

316
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,042
I'm gonna give you to the count
of three to get out of there.

317
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,943
Booker. why are you
answering my phone?

318
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,346
- You're not mom!
- One...

319
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,646
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Two...

320
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,153
I was trying to reach Foosball to see
how things went with Dominique.

321
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,950
- Three.
- Everything go okay?

322
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,014
Stop pressuring me!

323
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,296
My arm is broken, Booker!

324
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,392
Booker! Oh. my God.

325
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,130
The bone is popping out!

326
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,568
I'm gonna faint.

327
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,906
Mom's gonna kill me.
and it's your fault!

328
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,468
Booker. it's broken!

329
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,245
Sucker!

330
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,514
Dominique, I presume?

331
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,078
- That's me.
- Come in.

332
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,820
- So, you're French?
- Should I be?

333
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,295
- Yeah, that's what I was told.

- Then I'm French.

334
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,527
- Your English is wonderful.
- So is yours.

335
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,593
So, you just wanna wait for Wang?

336
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,161
Why wait?

337
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,402
I guess you could just come in with me,
or you could stay in his room.

338
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,737
Who has my money?

339
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,301
Money? I don't know anything
about any money.

340
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,041
Well, who's my guy?
Where is he?

341
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,948
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
He had to step out for a second.

342
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,379
God. This is great.

343
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,287
Why don't you wait in his room?
He'll be back any minute.

344
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,949
Okay, yeah. Whatever.

345
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,292
I'm just saving you from yourself.

346
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,196
I'm gonna go get
your whore. Okay?

347
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,845
Don't even think about trying
to make a run for it.

348
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,040
But how do you know
he's your soul mate?

349
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,653
I just know.
Kind of like you and Newmar.

350
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,885
What?! No, no. Last night
was an accident. That was--

351
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,486
Who is it?

352
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:46,497
It's Tony.
Is Adrienne in there?

353
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,226
Yeah. Hang on a sec.

354
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,035
I thought you might be Newmar.

355
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,166
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

356
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,073
We really need
to work on this scene.

357
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,211
All right, let's get
down to business!

358
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,611
Where is Wang?

359
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,675
Wow. Your accent is awesome!
His wang is right in here.

360
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,585
There he is.

361
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,118
Be gentle, okay?
He's nervous.

362
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,387
Can you understand
what I say?

363
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,430
Where is Wang?
I want Wang.

364
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,495
Wow, you're an eager one.

365
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,500
See, Booker. Your brother

knows how to pick 'em.

366
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:27,629
All right, he is the one.
Him right there. Hello? Hi.

367
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,107
I'm gonna leave
you two alone, okay? Bye.

368
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,305
Okay, is there a problem here?

369
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,651
That's right, money is
always up front. How stupid.

370
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,211
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty,
one hundred. There you go.

371
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,348
All right? Knock 'em dead.

372
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,658
Okay, come on.

373
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,254
Knock it off, Styles.
Clearly she doesn't want to do this.

374
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,855
Listen, she's a whore.

They have no discretion.

375
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,924
This must be part of some little act.

376
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,230
Start grabbing her ass.

377
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,864
All right, something is obviously wrong.
Booker, go wait in the hall.

378
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,670
She must want to haggle.
I'll fix this.

379
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,104
Rachel, it's me.

380
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,209
So, maybe if you're naked
when he comes back in, that'll help.

381
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,755
Go for it.

382
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,425
That's right, you don't speak
any English. Okay, look.

383
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,525
Get it? Hello?

384
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,191
No? Okay.

385
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,023
All right.

386
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,332
Hi. Look at the birdie.

387
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,734
See, you just need to go--

388
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,210
I think I really got
a hold of my character.

389
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,914
- Don't tell her you saw me!
- What?

390
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,576
- How are you?
- Good.

391
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,948
- Check out my abs!
- Nice.

392
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,085
- Punch me in the gut.
- Give me a break.

393
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,992
Seriously, I'm feeling
ripped right now.

394
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,053
No, we got people in the hall.

395
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,064
Come on, don't be a weiner.

Just do it.

396
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:03,566
Fine, but you asked me
to do it--remember that.

397
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,125
Bring it.

398
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,294
Oh, my gosh!

399
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,069
I can explain.
She asked for it.

400
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,338
I'm sure they all ask for it, Tony.

401
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,743
I don't mean she asked like--

402
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,146
Honey, tell them
that you asked me to do it.

403
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,116
It's not what it looks like.

404
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,514
He's trying to give her a miscarriage.
We've got to get her out of here.

405
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,183
Okay, sure.
We believe you.

406
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,353
Can we have a word
with you alone, Claire?

407
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,192
Wait, explain to these nags
that I'm not beating you.

408
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,425
Goddamnit, tell them!

409
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,433
Quit trying to scare her into lying.

410
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,629
What was that all about?

411
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,731
Don't ask.
They're frickin' insane.

412
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,207
Why are you hiding?

413
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,440
Well, I accidentally stole
Claire's favorite handbag,

414
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,140
and then I kind of lost it.

415
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,546
The one her grandmother gave her?

416
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,982
She'll kill me if she finds out.
Don't tell her you saw me!

417
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,679
I'm still looking for it.

418
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:58,154
I won't say anything,
but I would find it if I were you.

419
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:02,455
Look, we gotta work on this scene.
I don't wanna look like an idiot.

420
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,088
Well, let me hold the script,
'cause I'm still a bit rusty on my lines.

421
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,199
Are you ready? Okay.

422
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,937
- You're not having that baby!
- Yes, I am!

423
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,352
Hey, sexy.

424
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,620
- I want you.
- I bet you do.

425
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,265
You know you're the only one
who's ever pleased me.

426
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,823
That's funny.
I've heard that before.

427
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,335
I need you to do it to me so hard.

428
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:46,836
Oh, I will.

429
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,873
I'm gonna give it to you so good.

430
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,498
Yes, you are!

431
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:54,875
I'm gonna lick every inch
of your gorgeous body.

432
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,414
I can't wait to get
my hands on those tits.

433
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,815
What?

434
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,017
Oh, no!

435
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,034
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

436
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,043
Wait. Stop. What about me?
What about me? Come on!

437
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,240
You don't need us.

438
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,307
You've got Suzie.

439
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,720
I don't want Suzie.

440
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:37,982
Girls!

441
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,021
What the...?
How'd I get in the closet?

442
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,664
Crazy French whore!

443
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,966
Booker! Booker,

get me out of here!

444
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,529
What's all this about?

445
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:57,597
This way.

446
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,240
Who's this?

447
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,479
Some goon Pete is friends with.
Don't worry, he doesn't speak English.

448
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,716
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm pretty sure. Jackass?

449
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,621
Do you understand a word
I'm saying to you,

450
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,353
or is your brain pierced, too?

451
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,355
Perfect. Okay, about Tony,
we know what's been going on.

452
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:25,458
You guys think Tony's beating me,
right? That's what this is about?

453
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,334
- Don't try to lie about it.
- Or the baby.

454
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,895
We overheard him talking to Foosball.

455
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,373
We know he's beating you because he
doesn't want you to have the baby.

456
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,035
Well, honey, we're here for you.

457
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,803
What baby?

458
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,814
Claire...the one in your womb.

459
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,248
Seriously, Marla,
I'm not pregnant.

460
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,417
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

461
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,020
Tony must've been talking
about a different girl!

462
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:48,423
He's beating Claire
over the frustration over his mistress!

463
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:52,020
He's not beating me,
and no one is pregnant.

464
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,826
I'm gonna settle this, okay?

465
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,466
You guys just wait here,
and I'm gonna go talk to Tony.

466
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,228
So, I let Nick Stuckis

feel me up last Tuesday.

467
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,298
- Over or under the shirt?
- Under. What am l, 12?

468
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,181
- You're not having that baby!
- Yes, I am!

469
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,750
Listen, bitch, you're gonna have
that abortion either way!

470
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,482
If you won't go to the clinic,
I'm gonna knock you down them stairs!

471
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,887
I can't believe you.

472
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,926
You think you could
just have sex with me

473
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,893
wheneveryou want
and not pay the price?

474
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,361
You are a loser!

475
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,831
And don't think I won't tell
your skanky-ass girlfriend!

476
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,165
Look, bitch, you won't tell her
a goddamn thing!

477
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,574
What's going on in there?

478
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,611
Nothing! I'm changing!

479
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,771
Don't open the door yet.
Hold on.

480
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,415
Tony, who's in there with you?

481
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,745
No one!

482
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,753
Can you come back later?
I'm looking for something.

483
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,621
Yeah, fine.

I'll come back later. Asshole.

484
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,784
Oh, shit. She's pissed.

485
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,496
I gotta go after her.
You can split, if you want.

486
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,544
I don't think
that makes you a slut.

487
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,348
Sometimes a bathroom stall
is all you can find.

488
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,651
It's Adrienne.

489
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,855
Tony's been messing around
with her behind my back,

490
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,762
and she is most certainly pregnant.

491
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,563
Wow. And she screwed around
with Newmar, too.

492
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,966
What a slut!

493
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,130
She wants to tell me,

but he threatened her if she did!

494
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,764
You need to confront her.

495
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:43,899
Let's go.

496
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,391
See, it's like clockwork.

497
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,954
Every Tuesday and Thursday, this truck
picks up between one and two mill--

498
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,432
Put it on pause
for a second there, chief.

499
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,402
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

500
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,306
Where is she?

501
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,366
- Who?
- Come on. Claire.

502
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,975
She went outside.

503
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,551
Marla, you moron.
Like I don't have my keys.

504
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,561
Shit, I don't have my keys.

505
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,059
Marla, open the door!

506
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,305
- Hi!
- Did you find her?

507
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,108
No. Are you sure
she went downstairs?

508
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,169
Yeah.

509
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,374
Is someone out there?

510
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,384
What? No. Why?

511
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,260
Can you excuse me
for one minute?

512
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,626
Newmar, have you seen Adrienne?

513
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,425
Never mind.

514
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,593
What the hell?

515
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,707
I'm glad to see I'm not
the only one you're hiding from.

516
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,744
I'm not hiding from you.

517
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,465
Somebody open the door!

518
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,768
Well, if you're not
hiding from me, then...

519
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,334
that's great, because...

520
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,814
'cause I bought us a big sausage,
and...it's French.

521
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,316
You are
of French descent, right?

522
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,946
Look, Newmar,

about last night...

523
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,685
I was kind of drunk.

524
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,118
Yeah!

525
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,687
I was really drunk.

526
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:24,994
Yeah.

527
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,593
I like somebody else.

528
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,831
Is it me?

529
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,169
No, of course it isn't you.
It's somebody else.

530
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,642
Somebody who's not in this room
and is not you.

531
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,073
I see.

532
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,711
You don't like me.

533
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,682
'Cause I'm weird
and I'm boring

534
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,748
and I'm unattractive
and I have really bad hair.

535
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,884
No, no.

It's 'cause of something else.

536
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,861
So, you mean there's more?

537
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:58,094
Newmar, someday you're gonna
find a girl that really likes you.

538
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,734
It just won't be me.

539
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:05,105
I'm sorry. I'm just glad we could
finally get this out in the open.

540
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,738
Okay, let me just show you
the sausage, 'cause it's really nice--

541
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:16,176
Newmar! I don't wanna share
anything with you, okay?

542
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,912
Just leave me alone.

543
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,418
Please.

544
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,762
My shirt.

545
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:31,926
Wait, wait, wait.

546
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,419
Dude, what's wrong?

547
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,760
I'm just kind of bummed out,
that's all.

548
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,433
You wanna eat my sausage?

549
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,764
Excuse me?

550
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,500
I bought some really expensive
French sausage for Adrienne and l,

551
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,633
but I don't think she wants any.

552
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,476
She doesn't like me.

553
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,069
It's French sausage?

554
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,412
Wang's foreign exchange student
Dominique--she's from France.

555
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,645
She has nothing to do
until Wang gets back from work.

556
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,177
Why don't you see if she wants
to eat with it you? She's so hot.

557
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,227
Hi. Are you Dominique?

558
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,603
It's about time.
What's been keeping you?

559
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,164
I don't know.

560
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,639
I didn't think it took me that long
to walk down here, but...

561
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,638
Did Foosball call you?

562
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,013
Foosball? I don't know.

563
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,843
Look, I gotta go soon,
so can we get this going?

564
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,515
- Yeah, sure.

- Where do you wanna do it?

565
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,822
Well, I was thinking the kitchen,
but here's fine with me.

566
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,487
Why don't you sit here?

567
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,562
So, did Foosball tell you
about my sausage?

568
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,841
Why don't you tell me
about your sausage?

569
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,507
- Well, it looks really tasty.
- I'm sure it is.

570
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,712
That's really nice.

571
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,281
Yeah? Well, I want you
to feel good, baby,

572
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,192
so tell me what you want.
What do you want me to do?

573
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,965
Well, I want--

574
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,433
Foosball said you might like
some of my sausage.

575
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,869
I'm sure I'm gonna love your sausage,
but what do you want me to do with it?

576
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,840
Eat it. What else is there
to do with it?

577
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,842
Anything you can think of.

578
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,572
But if all you want is oral,
that's fine.

579
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,076
- You don't have a knife, do you?
- I've got handcuffs.

580
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,845
I don't think those will cut anything.

581
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,909
I'm sorry.
That's one thing I don't do.

582
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,818
No cutting,
and no hitting, either.

583
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,356
No cutting?

584
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,154
Well, this sausage
is pretty damn big.

585
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,351
I doubt you'd want
the whole thing.

586
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,158
I can take it all, baby.

587
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,496
That would be pretty impressive to see,
but just in case you're wrong,

588
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,058
I thought you could keep the rest.

589
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,570
- I'm not sure I know what you mean.
- As a present.

590
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,431
You don't have anywhere
you could put it, do you?

591
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,010
You can put it
anywhere you want.

592
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,741
Even in my ass.

593
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,274
Why would I wanna put
my sausage in your ass?

594
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,752
Some guys like that.

595
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:39,947
The French.

596
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:44,188
I think we should stick to the mouth
as the only point of entry, if you get me.

597
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,028
Whatever floats your boat.

598
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,159
Except for you have to pay up front--
in case your friend didn't tell you.

599
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:53,260
Pay? Money?

600
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,828
Why would I pay you
to eat my sausage?

601
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,839
If you want me,
you have to pay.

602
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:03,175
Well, I'd prefer to just eat it
myself if that's your attitude.

603
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,172
Look, l...

604
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,948
Look, I'm sorry,
Dominique, but...

605
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,718
while it's obvious
that you have feelings for me,

606
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,452
my heart belongs to another.

607
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,017
I don't know
what is customary in France,

608
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:19,756
but here in America,

609
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,321
when someone offers
to share their food with you,

610
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,732
you don't demand money.

611
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,791
Food?

612
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,837
You gotta help me find her.
Something's gone wrong.

613
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,239
Find heryourself.
She's your hooker.

614
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,473
- I never wanted her.
- Fine, you ungrateful bastard.

615
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,878
I will find her,

but this time around,

616
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,281
you don't get to have sex with her
because she's mine now!

617
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,542
Fuck!

618
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:48,821
Booker, I'm so happy you didn't
make love to that call girl.

619
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:53,193
I'm saving my special gift
for you, Rachel. You know that.

620
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,993
Oh, Booker.

621
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,730
No, no, no.

622
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,411
There you are. Come here.
I gotta talk to you.

623
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,419
- What is it?
- Remember the package I got?

624
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,088
Don't worry about him. I think that's
Wang's foreign exchange student.

625
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,718
He doesn't speak
a word of English.

626
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,329
The package wasn't for me.
It was for some girl named Britney.

627
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,889
Britney? Britney Spears?

628
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,494
No. They must've put the package
in the wrong mailbox or something.

629
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,629
There was a purse in it
with a phone number.

630
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,867
I tried to return the purse
to some guy Lorenzo

631
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,399
who's a drug dealer or a con artist,
and he's upstairs in my room right now.

632
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:17,606
And there's a bunch of money
hidden in the bag.

633
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,082
- How much money are we talkin' about?
- There must be like $30,000.

634
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,148
Bad.

635
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,383
Bad, you know?
Is sour.

636
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,056
Did Newmar find you okay?

637
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:33,119
I need to talk to you.
I think there's been some mistake.

638
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,358
- What do you mean?
- Have you seen Adrienne?

639
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,061
- No.
- You! That's the prostitute Styles got!

640
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,262
- Styles McFee--that was his name.
- Who is this?

641
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,033
Wang's foreign exchange student.
She's from France.

642
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,632
You know what we should do?
Call the police.

643
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,337
Prostitution is very illegal.
They would arrest her and Styles.

644
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,941
So, you're from France?

645
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,976
There's this guy here--
Cliff, I think, is his name.

646
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,045
He's French and
doesn't speak a word of English.

647
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,283
We should introduce you.

648
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,122
We need to do
something about that whore.

649
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,529
If you don't see me in ten minutes,
call my room.

650
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,500
If I say,
"No, I can't make it to the party,"

651
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,400
then I need you
to help me get rid of him.

652
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,460
Okay.

653
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,909
Help! Need Wang.

654
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:30,386
What the fuck!
I don't speak no English! French!

655
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,161
So long! Good bye.

656
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,932
Hi, Claire.

657
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,203
Remember--"No, I can't

make it to the party."

658
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,869
- You and I need to talk.
- I know.

659
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,277
We'll leave you two alone.

660
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,381
- Let's talk in here.
- Okay.

661
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,009
I'm not sure where he is.

662
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,414
There he is! Cliff!

663
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,885
I found you a friend!

664
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,724
Have anything
you'd like to confess?

665
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,193
You found out what I did?

666
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,325
This is gonna be good.

667
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,301
I want you to know
I am really sorry.

668
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:23,170
You're sorry? I hope you know this is not
something you can just apologize for.

669
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,571
You can't take this back.

670
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,372
- Are you really this mad?
- Shouldn't I be?

671
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:31,073
I realize it was kind of uncool
of me, but it's not that big a deal.

672
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,137
Are you kidding?

673
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,275
I shouldn't borrow things
without asking,

674
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,751
but I really needed it,
and I thought you'd say no.

675
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,721
- I only wanted it for one night.
- You call that borrowing?!

676
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,189
And of course I'd say no!

677
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,556
I don't care how bad
you needed it, you slut!

678
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,652
Excuse me?!
Who are you calling a slut?

679
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,323
Oh...you, slut!

680
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,890
Look at you. You want
everybody to know about it.

681
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,128
With Tony's shirt on.

682
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,329
Okay, I didn't ask
to borrow this, either, but...

683
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,863
Newmar spilled something on my shirt,
this guy was staring at my boobs--

684
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,911
How many guys do you have
on the side, tramp?

685
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,038
Okay, I don't care
what the hell I did,

686
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:07,277
if you call me a slut or a tramp
one more time,

687
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,751
I'm gonna slap you
upside the head, bitch.

688
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,264
You guys!

689
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:34,141
Come on, you two.
Don't be shy.

690
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,018
Menage a tois ever?

691
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,536
I'll leave you two alone.

692
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,842
Where the hell is everyone?!

693
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,648
So you don't speak
any English, do you?

694
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,756
- Hello?
- Hello.

695
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,661
- Yeah?
- Mona, it's me--Dominique.

696
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,996
- What's up?
- God, I'm in a fix.

697
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:35,061
I've been confused with a foreign
exchange student. They think I'm French.

698
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,300
They've got me in this room
with this weird French prick.

699
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:38,432
How did that happen?

700
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,570
They think the real foreign exchange
student is the working girl instead of me.

701
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:45,809
- Did your guy pay you?
- No, I never got the money.

702
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,714
I never found the guy
who ordered me.

703
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,117
- Where's Ted?
- What the--

704
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,180
Excuse me?

705
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,327
Let's get everything
out in the open.

706
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,228
You're not French, and I speak
American just fine, right?

707
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,195
This is so perfect.
You're like a pro, right?

708
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,600
Like, a hooker?

709
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:13,334
Just let me leave. I don't know
what you're after, but I don't do freebies.

710
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,901
What if I had
a proposition to make?

711
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,914
- How much you got?
- No. A different kind of proposition.

712
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,643
Like a partnership.

713
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,552
What if I said I knew
where we could get $30,000?

714
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:26,814
Okay.

715
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:32,586
Thanks.

716
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:37,464
So, I guess I'm gonna go back
to my room and finish getting ready.

717
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,525
- Wait, Foosball.

- Yeah?

718
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,534
Nothing.

719
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:46,769
Never mind.

720
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,913
I suck!

721
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,577
If there's a stack of money in this house,
and you know who has it,

722
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,985
why do you need a partner?

723
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,546
Why not keep it for yourself?

724
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:04,287
You're right. I don't need a partner.
What the hell was I thinking?

725
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:06,921
Psych!

726
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,063
No, no. Seriously.

727
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,398
The plan I have
needs two people.

728
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,403
One of them should be
a pretty girl.

729
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:18,134
Two--my friend lives here.
It puts me in a weird place.

730
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,176
But you--nobody knows
who you are.

731
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,270
So, what's the plan?

732
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,173
First we gotta write a note
to this girl Gerri.

733
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,107
That's it!

734
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:30,881
I'm too chicken to tell Foosball
that I like him to his face...

735
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,683
I'll just write him a love letter.

736
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,319
Why didn't I think of it before?

737
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,290
I'll write Adrienne
a romantic poem!

738
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:45,295
"l will not be happy until we can
be together. Yours truly, Adrienne."

739
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:50,096
What do you guys think?
It's missing something, right?

740
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,407
Perfume! Good idea, Oliver.

Where's that sample?

741
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,386
Claire's bag!
This'll get her off my back.

742
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,968
"...and like a rose in the sun,

so are you."

743
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,870
That's good stuff.

744
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,251
- What you got behind your back?
- My back?

745
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,315
Nothing.

746
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,958
Okay...what are you doing?

747
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,516
Going to the bathroom.

748
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:47,788
All right.

749
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,870
"Love...Newmar."

750
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,477
Thank God!

751
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,522
I'll go downstairs
and call her from that phone.

752
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:15,114
You go upstairs and get
that goon out of the room.

753
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,922
Also, remember to leave the note

so she can see it.

754
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:20,725
Here's what the note says--

755
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:23,391
"l know everything.
Decided to leave.

756
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,628
"Just give the bag
to my associate

757
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,863
who's waiting at the front
of your building."

758
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,607
Wait, are you sure your pimp's
not gonna look in the bag?

759
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,143
He's not my pimp, smart ass.

760
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:50,786
Sorry!

761
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:53,522
Are you okay?

762
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,627
Okay.

763
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,799
Shoot!
Where did it go?

764
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,582
Listen, some girl's gonna come
out here and give you a bag.

765
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,049
Hold on to it for me.

766
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,448
And don't look inside!

767
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:21,891
And, who knows,

if we do this job together,

768
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,425
maybe you and I can--

769
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,327
No attachments. I don't get
involved with people I work with.

770
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,388
And you never make
an exception?

771
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,836
- Hello?
- Hello. Gerri Farber?

772
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,476
- Yes?
- I have a package downstairs.

773
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,240
Could you please
come down here and get it?

774
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:45,838
- Okay.
- See you in a jiffy.

775
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:54,217
I'll be right back. There's a delivery
for Gerri Farber at the front door.

776
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,727
"Dearest, here is a poem
I've written for you.

777
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,203
"Your beauty fills...

778
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:11,567
Love, Newmar"?

779
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:34,621
Excuse me,

I foreign exchange student.

780
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:37,189
Could you help me
with something?

781
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,862
It only take a second,
okay? Yeah?

782
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,268
You should find somebody else.

783
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,742
But I need someone strong
to help carry something for me.

784
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,474
My back hurts when I bend down
to pick up things. See?

785
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,007
- Yeah, I see.

- Yeah.

786
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,316
- All right. Let's go. This way?
- This way. Okay.

787
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,090
For me?

788
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,136
"l know everything.
Decided to leave.

789
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,662
Give the bag to my associate who's
waiting at the front of your building."

790
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,437
Claire is insane about this bag.

791
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:35,481
- Hello?
- It's me. man. What's up. Pete?

792
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,719
Pete's not here, man.

793
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,023
Am I supposed
to give you the bag?

794
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,088
- I'm the guy.
- Well, here you go.

795
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,656
And I don't know who you are,

796
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,897
but you better tell that stupid bitch
to stay out of my way!

797
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,636
...the girls in your dorm--
maybe they'd be up for it.

798
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,200
What are you talking about?!

799
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,269
I can look in the bag
if I want to.

800
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:06,884
I'm loving this color.

801
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:13,925
Super for you, dude, but I'm
not Pete, and I'm going. Bye.

802
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,228
Yeah!

803
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,269
Einstein, our plan worked, man!

804
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,670
I'm just good for genius.
Genius!

805
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,637
Here.

806
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,643
Look at time!

807
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,711
I have to go, okay?

808
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,483
But--but...

809
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,985
What the...

810
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:49,395
- Well?
- We did it! Oh, baby!

811
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,128
Don't spoil things.
Let's just get the bag.

812
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,139
Maybe you got it wrong, Einstein.

813
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:10,152
It's bullshit, man! There was

supposed to be money in that bag.

814
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,814
Ted, did you take anything
out of this bag?

815
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,413
No. I didn't even look inside.

816
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,550
- And a girl gave it to you?
- Yeah.

817
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,186
And she said to tell
that stupid bitch to stay out of her way.

818
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,321
Stupid bitch?

819
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,565
Maybe she's on to us and that's
a dummy bag, you know?

820
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,364
- Is there a problem?
- Shut up, Ted.

821
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:30,167
Look, we gotta go soon.
We got other appointments.

822
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,141
Didn't you hear me tell you
to shut up the first time?

823
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,676
Now get rid of this!

824
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:38,236
Nobody calls me a stupid bitch.
We're getting that bag.

825
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,814
Just let it out!
Go for the eyes!

826
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,947
Focus!

827
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,766
- I don't think she wants to see you.
- Shut up!

828
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,464
- Claire, what the hell

is going on?

829
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,936
How could you cheat on me?!

830
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,600
Why do you listen to these two ho-bags?
I've never cheated on you!

831
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,338
I overheard you and Adrienne,
and then she admitted it to me!

832
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,243
- You got her pregnant!
- What?!

833
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,579
Oh! No! Look, that's a scene

for our acting class.

834
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,243
In the scene, I get her pregnant.

835
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,583
- You expect her to believe that?
- Suck my balls!

836
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,179
- Get a clue, loser!

- Wait.

837
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,555
Why would Adrienne admit it
to me if it was just a scene?

838
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,891
You must've confused her.

839
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,897
She's been hiding from you
because she lost your favorite purse.

840
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,261
What?! She stole
grandma's handbag?

841
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,498
Claire, I can prove to you
that we were just doing a scene.

842
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,233
Meet me in my room
in five minutes.

843
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,571
I'll find Adrienne
and I'll grab the script,

844
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,634
and this could all
be explained, all right?

845
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,941
Meet me in my room.
Five minutes.

846
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,371
You're not gonna go, are you?

847
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,215
Maybe I should hear
what he has to say.

848
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,318
I can't believe Adrienne
had sex with your boyfriend

849
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,254
and stole
your favorite handbag.

850
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:55,814
What a klepto-slut!

851
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,624
You look cute
when you're mad!

852
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:06,862
I've got a plan to get rid of this guy.

853
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,598
but I need you to keep this bag
for me until he's gone.

854
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,004
You're keeping the money?

855
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:14,168
- Doesn't it seem a little dangerous?
- I'm leaving tomorrow. anyway.

856
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,474
There's no way he can track me
all the way to San Francisco.

857
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,776
And he thinks the money
is mine. anyway.

858
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:22,011
Just hold on to this for dear life,

and I'll give you some for helping me.

859
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,144
- Shit, okay.
- Okay. Thanks.

860
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,479
This kind of looks like Claire's bag.

861
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,969
Where's the bag?

862
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,506
The bag? Isn't it here?

863
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,508
- Who was at the door?
- No one.

864
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,839
No one?
Well, that's interesting.

865
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,778
Because here's the thing--
while I was waiting for you to return,

866
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,512
I noticed that bag was missing,
and I got to thinking--

867
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,555
what if you really
are Gerri Farber and not Britney,

868
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,112
and now you're scamming me?

869
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,625
What are you talking about?
I am Britney.

870
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:07,185
And, you know, the bag
was here when I left.

871
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,595
You sent the package,
remember?

872
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:14,365
It's my money, so maybe I should
be asking you where the money is.

873
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,928
I really don't care
what you think right now,

874
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:19,065
because I know
I didn't take it!

875
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,632
And I know I sent it!

876
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,702
But what I don't know
is if you're who I sent it to.

877
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,818
Hey, it's me.

878
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:42,186
You've seen Britney before, right?
What does she look like?

879
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,799
When she's not
in disguise, idiot!

880
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,003
I guess you check out.

881
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,110
Sorry I doubted you.

882
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,846
It's fine. I can find the bag myself,
so why don't you just leave?

883
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,909
No.

884
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,850
You left the bag with me, and, clearly,
somebody called you out as a distraction.

885
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,760
I shouldn't have left the bag alone,
so this is my fault and I'm gonna fix it.

886
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,889
I think I knowwho took it.

887
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,032
I'll be right back.

888
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:23,799
Adrienne, open up!

889
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,665
Come on!

890
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:28,739
Shit!

891
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,983
Where the hell is my script?!

892
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,110
Shit!

893
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,219
Gerri, sorry to bug you, but you were
Garber's T.A. Iast semester, right?

894
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,885
Can I have her home number?
I need to call her.

895
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,019
Sure.

896
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,194
- Don't tell her where you got it from.
- Thanks.

897
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,637
You have no idea how much
of a huge jam this will get me out of.

898
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,140
- Help!
- What?

899
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,734
I'm from France. Help!

900
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:05,174
Man! There sure are a lot
of girls from France around here.

901
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,239
Hey, maybe you'd like my sausage.

902
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:14,179
Look, here you go. You can keep it.
I don't even want it anymore.

903
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:17,055
But I'm gonna tell you this--
I am not gonna pay you to eat it.

904
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,117
I don't care what they do in France.

905
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,993
- Need help!
- Help with what? Opening it?

906
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,260
There you are!
Come here!

907
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,826
She was just about
to eat my sausage!

908
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:30,805
Too bad! I'm the one
who paid for her! Come here!

909
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,034
Where you going?

910
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:37,940
Man! What's the deal with everyone
paying the French to eat their food?

911
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,051
- There you are.
- Hey, Foosball.

912
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,279
Why didn't you tell me sooner
that you were gay?

913
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,481
Well, I had to--what?!

914
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,548
I'm really flattered
that you'd come out for me, but...

915
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:50,888
you're just not my type.

916
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,257
I'm not gay!

917
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:55,229
No, don't go back in
just because I'm rejecting you.

918
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,892
Someday, you're gonna find a guy
who really likes you.

919
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,128
It just...
it's not gonna be me.

920
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,238
I'm sorry. I'm glad
we got this out in the open.

921
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,967
Well, what the hell.

922
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,975
What don't you like about me?

923
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,444
Newmar, listen.

You're a great guy, okay?

924
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,004
I just...I don't like you like that.

925
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,141
But I think I may know
someone for you.

926
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,177
Yeah.

927
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,824
I don't see Adrienne.

928
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,492
I couldn't find her. I'm actually
calling my professor right now.

929
00:59:31,567 --> 00:59:33,159
She'll explain what the scene is about.

930
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,967
- You've reached Proffessor Garber...
- Damn. It's her voicemail.

931
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,033
I smell perfume.

932
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,323
"My love...

933
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,524
"You have no idea how much
I desire to be with you.

934
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,261
"l think about you day and night
and dream of you.

935
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,702
"l need to share my life,
love, and soul with you.

936
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,706
"l will not be happy
until we can be together.

937
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,401
With love, Adrienne."

938
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,068
What?!

939
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:19,171
No! I--wow.
I've never seen this before.

940
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,913
Look, Gerri wrote my acting
teacher's number on the back.

941
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,420
See? Here's the number.
This is Gerri's letter.

942
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,889
Why would Adrienne
write Gerri a love letter?

943
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,425
Maybe they're lesbians.

944
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,086
Pretty lame.
Fuck off, Tony!

945
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,761
Come on.
I can explain, baby!

946
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,399
I know you're
around here somewhere!

947
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,531
Damn!

948
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:48,733
Buddy, seen a pretty girl
around here with a funny accent?

949
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:52,679
Yeah. I've been looking for her
'cause she has my money.

950
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,512
Your money?
That ain't your money.

951
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,609
Fuck off.
Who the hell are you?

952
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,828
Well?

953
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,328
Well, what?

954
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,136
What'd you think of the letter?

955
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,475
How'd you know about Newmar's letter?
Newmar wrote me a love letter.

956
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,981
- He's come out of the closet.
- Newmar's gay?

957
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,951
It's so cute. I had to turn him
down, though. Obviously.

958
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,816
Yeah. Obviously.

959
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,051
I'm so happy to finally have someone
to go clubbing with in this dorm.

960
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:39,424
Being surrounded by all you breeders
was really getting me down--no offense.

961
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:40,894
You're gay?

962
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:42,958
Are you sure?

963
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,524
- You didn't know I was gay?
- Yeah, of course I did. It's just...

964
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:49,536
Newmar's gay?

965
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,766
I almost wish
I were attracted to him.

966
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,937
He wrote the sweetest poem.
Here. Check it out.

967
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,674
What did you do?!

968
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,178
I'm not sure how this guy's connected,
but he knows about the money.

969
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,053
- I know this guy. I don't--
- Trust me. He knows something.

970
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,357
"Our love could be
a delightful bloom.

971
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,260
"From the beginning,
I already knew.

972
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:20,163
Like a rose in the sun,

so are you."

973
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,033
I wish somebody would write
a poem like that for me.

974
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,343
- I read your poem.
- You did?

975
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,247
- But I thought I gave it to Foosball.
- He let me read it.

976
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,711
I loved it.

977
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,546
Really?

978
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,214
It all makes sense now.

979
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,850
You only made out with me
'cause you were confused--

980
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:44,984
'cause you're gay.

981
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,929
No, it's okay. We can
hang out now. We can shop!

982
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:50,966
We can hang out 'cause...
I'm gay.

983
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,160
I've always wanted a gay friend.

984
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,665
Now that I know
that you're gay...

985
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,037
you suddenly seem
more attractive.

986
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,302
Great.

987
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,139
Your whole personality
makes sense now.

988
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,270
Apparently,
I'm still ugly, though.

989
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,406
I'm sorry
Foosball turned you down.

990
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,584
Maybe if you took off
these thick glasses.

991
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,315
You have really nice eyes,
Newmar.

992
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,217
Thanks.

993
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,990
I just wish they worked better.

994
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:24,090
I really loved your poem.

995
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,969
So, you do have my bag?

996
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,770
This is not your bag!
I gave your bag back!

997
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,936
You lying slut!
You never gave it back!

998
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:38,344
- Give it back, you psycho!
- What?!

999
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,975
My glasses!

1000
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:47,949
Hello?

1001
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,421
This fuckin'--

1002
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,195
Claire. This is perfect.
I just got ahold of my professor--

1003
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,426
Tell Adrienne
you haven't seen me.

1004
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,129
She went that way.

1005
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,937
Is she gone?

1006
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,444
- Come on, let's call the professor--
- I don't have time now.

1007
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,954
Adrienne's gone insane.
She's trying to attack me!

1008
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,217
I have proof at my fingertips
that I'm not lying.

1009
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,125
She's coming! Hold on to my bag
until I get back, then I'll listen to you.

1010
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,363
I see you!

1011
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,968
- She went that way.
- I know!

1012
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,496
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

1013
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:12,137
You know what?
Let me get you some help.

1014
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:16,611
No, I just need to lay down.
Take me into the room.

1015
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,207
Yeah, okay.

1016
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,508
You're heavy.

1017
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,090
Hello?!

1018
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,568
What happened to you?
Why are you wet?

1019
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,297
I don't know, but...

1020
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,004
Maybe I should get
out of these wet clothes.

1021
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:53,612
Wait. No, no, no...

That would end up bad for me.

1022
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,240
I'll go get you a towel.

1023
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:06,888
What are you doing?

1024
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,595
I was just admiring your bag.

1025
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,363
I think I should hold on to this.

1026
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,939
- What are you doing?
- I'm just admiring the bag!

1027
01:06:19,975 --> 01:06:21,237
What the hell?!

1028
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,338
Give me the bag!

1029
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:25,880
Crazy mother--

1030
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,944
Enough already, all right?

1031
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,011
Who the hell are you,
and what the hell's going on?

1032
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,284
We're wasting time!
Somebody will find it!

1033
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,191
That's my girlfriend's bag.
Her grandmother gave it to her.

1034
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,592
It's not. Why would your girlfriend
have a stack of cash?

1035
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,563
- Whose is it?
- It's mine.

1036
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,122
And I'll give you half
if you help me get out of this dorm!

1037
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,463
Right.

1038
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,797
- How much is half?
- $500.

1039
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,934
Let's go.

1040
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:56,637
I don't know anything about a bag.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1041
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,476
I assume you're
Dominique's pimp or whatever,

1042
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,311
and I don't know
what she told you,

1043
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,512
but we didn't even have sex with her,

so we shouldn't have to pay.

1044
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,013
You wanna work him over?

1045
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,081
He doesn't know anything.
Just put him back downstairs.

1046
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,518
Is that you?

1047
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,727
Whatever you say.

1048
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,068
I'm still chucking him outside
just to be safe.

1049
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,969
I really don't think the bag
would've fallen all the way down here.

1050
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:24,699
Well, just look for it!

1051
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:30,205
You idiot!
Now we'll never know where it is!

1052
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:31,439
Why are you yelling at me?

1053
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:34,039
You're the one who came to me
with the money and--

1054
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:36,050
Well, I never!

1055
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,485
- Who the hell was that?
- Some meatball who got fresh.

1056
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,356
So what took you so long?

1057
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:48,363
Look, I almost got the bag, okay?
I'll be back in a second!

1058
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,094
- Maybe I should go with you.
- No. No, I should go alone.

1059
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,659
Why's that?

1060
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:55,763
Cliffy...

1061
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,497
No, don't take that tone with me.

1062
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,907
You'll make me think
you don't trust me.

1063
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:06,007
You don't think
I'd double-cross you, do you?

1064
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:07,309
I was sorta thinking that.

1065
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:10,909
No, I would never

do that to you.

1066
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,421
But now that we're in the clear,

'cause I'm--I mean we're--

1067
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,652
that close to the bag,

1068
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:22,060
I don't know...I was kind of
thinking that after we got away,

1069
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:23,462
maybe we could...

1070
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,596
I thought maybe
we could see each other again.

1071
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:35,510
I was sort of...
sort of thinking the same thing.

1072
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,046
You were? Good.

1073
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:39,512
You stay here.

1074
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,275
Don't worry.

1075
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,556
Come on.
We don't have much time.

1076
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,024
Why the hell did you hit me?
And who's that guy?

1077
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:53,926
No one. He thinks he's getting
half the money, but it's yours now.

1078
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:58,558
I had to do that to get rid of him.
So, if you want it, get me that bag!

1079
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,861
You're right.
This does look like Claire's purse.

1080
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,840
- Where is she?
- I hope Tony didn't do anything to her.

1081
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,105
Bitch!

1082
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:13,337
Newmar, I need your help!

1083
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,448
Yes, it's me.

I need you to hold on to this bag.

1084
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,010
Don't let anyone take it,
no matter what they say.

1085
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,914
-Do you have my glasses?
- Yeah.

1086
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,520
Do you?

1087
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,188
What? Where are we going?!

1088
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,358
- I can't see!
- I'll come back!

1089
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,456
Hurry!

1090
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,644
Wow, that was fast.

1091
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,485
This is so stupid.

1092
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,647
I'm not gay!
I wrote that poem for you!

1093
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,618
I love you!

1094
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,895
Where did she go?

1095
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,868
Pardon me, ladies,

have you seen--

1096
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,807
- Have you seen a girl with a bag?
- Who the hell are you?

1097
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,071
- Maybe she went back upstairs.
- All righty!

1098
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,672
Something funny's going on here.

1099
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,694
How did I get outside?

1100
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,451
Finally got you horizontal,
you crazy bitch!

1101
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,782
I think I'll just be taking
my money back.

1102
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,195
Holy balls!

1103
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,130
Thank you.

1104
01:11:21,276 --> 01:11:22,436
Thanks again.

1105
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:30,047
What are you doing?
Where's the bag?

1106
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,450
What do you mean?

1107
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,284
You came and grabbed it
and bashed me over the head with it!

1108
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,347
I didn't! That wasn't me!

1109
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,852
Well, clearly, this is a good reason
to give me my glasses!

1110
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,760
What happened to you?

1111
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:52,473
Help. I'm from France.
I'm an exchange student.

1112
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:53,701
You don't say!

1113
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:56,572
What'd you do that for?!

1114
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,943
I can't have her saying that.
She'll blow my cover!

1115
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,606
I thought you were
the foreign exchange student.

1116
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:04,110
- I'm the hooker.
- So, you're the hooker!

1117
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:05,981
Come on, we gotta hide her.

1118
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:11,948
Hello!

1119
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,351
- Can you help me?
- I doubt it.

1120
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,920
No, wait! I...

1121
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:19,661
I'm looking for a girl, and she has
a handbag, and I need to--

1122
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:22,829
How many people
know about the frickin' bag?!

1123
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:23,963
I don't know!

1124
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,075
I gotta get the hell out of here.

1125
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,942
- Do you have any rope?
- Why would I have rope?

1126
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,539
I've got some bondage stuff
in my bag downstairs!

1127
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,983
- Use your belt for now.
- I need my belt. These pants are huge.

1128
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,782
Deal with it!
I'll only be gone for a second.

1129
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,114
No.

1130
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,758
Goddamnit.

1131
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,294
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1132
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:54,595
That was fast.
Come on in.

1133
01:12:58,373 --> 01:12:59,635
The prostitute?!

1134
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,467
I can explain!

1135
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,443
Just when l
was starting to believe you!

1136
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,243
Wait! No, no, no!

You're staying here!

1137
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,409
I forgot my bag.

1138
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,050
Oh, Jesus! Tony!

1139
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,419
- I could still explain.
- Where's my bag?

1140
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,318
About your bag...

1141
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:18,689
My grandmother
gave me that bag!

1142
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:19,989
I hate you!

1143
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:23,361
Claire, wait!

No, don't go anywhere.

1144
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:24,421
Wait!

1145
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,404
No!

1146
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,638
Come on!

1147
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:38,771
Open up!

1148
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:40,708
Not again!

1149
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,258
How ya doin'?

1150
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,126
Call me.

1151
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,585
Hi. Can I help you?

1152
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:21,521
So, you're Styles McFee.

1153
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,149
Who are you?

1154
01:14:24,226 --> 01:14:25,989
What if I said
I was the girl you ordered,

1155
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:28,222
and that other girl's
a foreign exchange student?

1156
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:31,594
That would explain some things.

1157
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:34,302
I'll cut to the chase.

1158
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,338
You've got my money. I'll let you
keep half if you help me get out of here.

1159
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:42,070
Possession is 9/10
of the law, toots.

1160
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,204
It's my money now.
You're gonna have to do better than half.

1161
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,879
I think we
can work something out.

1162
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:56,449
It's a lot of money.

1163
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,662
Get the chair, bitch.

1164
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:05,928
See, now we're talking.

1165
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,002
I'll gonna make you
a little deal, okay?

1166
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:15,706
If the sex is really, really great,
I'll give you half the money.

1167
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:19,403
Baby, when l
get done with you...

1168
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,676
you'll give me all of it.

1169
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,978
We'll see.

1170
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:27,515
I'm done with you.

1171
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:31,323
Oh, and look...

1172
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:34,826
I got all of it.

1173
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,496
That's not fair!

1174
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:42,059
Okay, I can play fair.

1175
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,672
- Fair enough.
- No!

1176
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,911
Come on, Styles.
Reach out and touch it.

1177
01:15:58,453 --> 01:15:59,784
Oh, yeah. You can't.

1178
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,416
Thanks for the good time, Styles.

1179
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,484
No, stop! Come on.

1180
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:09,494
I don't deserve this!

1181
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:10,588
Help!

1182
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:15,403
Someone help! Help!

1183
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,437
Get over here!

1184
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:22,609
Tony! Help me.

1185
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:23,770
What happened to you?

1186
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:27,042
There's no time to explain.
A whore stole my purse!

1187
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:30,676
My girlfriend's purse.
But you gotta help me get it back.

1188
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,743
Man, that two-timing--

1189
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:36,958
Go get her. Tony!
Don't look in the purse. though!

1190
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,762
Someone help!
Help!

1191
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,576
Help!

1192
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,218
Someone help!

1193
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,059
I call the police.
They come!

1194
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,693
Let me just explain, because I think
you might've misunderstood.

1195
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:26,104
And...you look great.
You do.

1196
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,507
This is gonna hurt you
more than it's gonna hurt us.

1197
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:30,602
What?

1198
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:44,924
Hey, man. We need to talk.

1199
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:48,525
- Knock it off. It's about the money.
- What money?

1200
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:51,361
Don't give me that.
I need the frickin' bag back!

1201
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,832
The hooker screwed us both!

1202
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,301
I knew she was too hot
to be trusted.

1203
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,530
We gotta get her!

1204
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:03,006
Where do you think you're going?!
Give me the purse.

1205
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,842
I was looking for you, baby!
Both you babies.

1206
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:06,972
Shut up!

1207
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:09,483
You don't mind us keeping
this bag, then, right?

1208
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:12,315
Hold her hands. I bet she's
got something hidden on her.

1209
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,616
Yeah, you like that, right?

1210
01:18:16,691 --> 01:18:20,183
What's this?
This a vibrator or something?

1211
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,730
Pepper spray.
You gonna spray me, huh?

1212
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,993
- Let me go!
- What if I strip search her?

1213
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,729
We should just let her loose, pervo.
We got the money.

1214
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:32,729
I called the police.
You all go to jail!

1215
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:38,439
I don't have time for this.

1216
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,652
- She's getting away!
- Forget her. We got the bag!

1217
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:50,213
- No. I got the bag.
- Hell, no!

1218
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,956
We're gonna head down
to the student union now.

1219
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:58,125
You'll find students studying,
having a snack--in their natural habitats.

1220
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,745
- My bag?!
- I can explain.

1221
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:14,373
That bitch tricked us!
There's only a little money here!

1222
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,887
- Come on. We gotta get out of here.
- It's about time.

1223
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:31,659
- Give me the money!
- Ted.

1224
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:38,062
That's not fair, man!

1225
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,506
Pleasure doing business
with you boys.

1226
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:48,741
- Man, that's my money.
- No! It's my money!

1227
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:54,755
Our graduates include two
Nobel prize winners and 14 senators.

1228
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:58,020
Our faculty is one of the most
prestigious in the entire country.

1229
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,591
Tradition.
Studiousness. Dignity.

1230
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:05,258
These words come to mind
when one thinks of this fine university.

1231
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,568
So, here's an interesting bit of trivia.

1232
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:16,839
Can anyone tell me which campus building
Eugene O'Neill died in? Anyone?

1233
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:21,707
Hey, Pete.

1234
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,312
One of the nice things
about this university

1235
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:27,378
is that public beatings like this
rarely happen. Oh, God.

1236
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,686
How does everyone know
about the bag?

1237
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:36,754
I don't know.
Something weird's going on.

1238
01:20:36,831 --> 01:20:40,289
I think we're being set up.
You should pack some things.

1239
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:41,357
Why?

1240
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:43,359
Trust me.

1241
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:44,666
What are we doing?

1242
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:49,040
I'm looking for my bag.
Where is it?

1243
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:53,173
Okay...we have to back
in the dorm.

1244
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,045
Oh, no.

We're out of here.

1245
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,607
Listen, you idiot,
you do what I say.

1246
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,551
And I say we're going
back in the dorm!

1247
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,354
Do you know someone
who lost a purse around here?

1248
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,919
- You found it?
- Yeah.

1249
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,828
Adrienne's been looking for it!

1250
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:11,888
Here you go.

1251
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:14,699
Well, thanks!

1252
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:19,571
Everyone, this is not a representation
of how things work on this campus.

1253
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,632
I'm giving 3 to 1 odds
on the ugly white guy.

1254
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,701
- This is ridiculous.
- My money's on tattoo-boy!

1255
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:27,544
Gambling is not allowed on campus.
Sir, gambling is not--

1256
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,811
- What are the odds?
- Three to one.

1257
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:31,146
I'm good for 20.

1258
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,016
- Hold it.
- Yeah, right.

1259
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:36,948
Out of my way, morons!

1260
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:42,825
36 Starflower.
We're 10-97 making entry.

1261
01:21:42,897 --> 01:21:44,057
You live here?

1262
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:46,225
Yeah, I'm the R.A.

What's going on?

1263
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:50,135
We received a call saying there was some
kind of hostage situation at this address.

1264
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:56,371
Reggie. I thought
you went home already.

1265
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,140
Who called the police,
and why is there a Christmas tree?

1266
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:01,239
- That's a fire hazard!
- Don't look at me.

1267
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,251
- Grandmother's handbag.
- You should kick Tony in the balls.

1268
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,584
- Totally! The police are here.
- Thank God.

1269
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:11,717
Officers, you will be interested to know
that there is a prostitute in this dorm.

1270
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,351
- A prostitute?
- That's her!

1271
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:17,762
- That's Dominique the prostitute!
- Me student! They crazy attacking me!

1272
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,595
- It seems she's on drugs.
- Cuff her!

1273
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,228
- What's going on?
- They're arresting Styles's prostitute.

1274
01:22:22,304 --> 01:22:24,101
- Did Dominique ever arrive?
- That's her.

1275
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,936
Wait, let me get this straight.
There are two Dominiques?

1276
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,805
But one's the whore,

and one's just a foreigner.

1277
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:32,974
We should get going, or we'll miss
our flight to North Dakota.

1278
01:22:34,549 --> 01:22:37,643
Well, it was really nice meeting you.
Dominique, was it?

1279
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,710
Have a nice time
in North Dakota.

1280
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,757
I just have a few more things to pack.
I think you'll like North Dakota.

1281
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:43,950
I smell smoke.

1282
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,050
- Foosball was smoking.
- He bought the tree.

1283
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,288
- You bitches!
- This is a no-smoking building.

1284
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,661
Marla and Lynne have
an eight-ball of coke in their room.

1285
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,826
- It's hers!
- Whore!

1286
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,308
- Stop it!
- What?

1287
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:05,346
They're going back in the dorm.
Obviously, the money's still there.

1288
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:07,643
- Oh, yeah.
- So we should go!

1289
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,922
I am Dominique from France,
foreign exchange student!

1290
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:22,257
It looks good to me.
But if you're the student--

1291
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,025
Then who are you?!

1292
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:25,621
There she is!

1293
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,131
Where do you think
you're going, babycakes?

1294
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,206
Finally we meet.
I'm Wang.

1295
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,508
Who actually called us?
Where's this hostage situation?

1296
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:40,707
The cops!

1297
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,875
- Lorenzo Rosatti!
- Let go of the girl!

1298
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:43,940
Take that!

1299
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:53,387
Booker, I think I smell smoke!

Seriously! Do you smell that?

1300
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:05,906
- Finally we have the Black Hand!
- You! Down here!

1301
01:24:07,108 --> 01:24:08,575
Cuff all three of them right here.

1302
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,042
- Who are you?
- Gerri Farber.

1303
01:24:10,111 --> 01:24:12,841
No, that's just a cover.
She's Britney the Snake.

1304
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,814
I am not going down alone!

1305
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,044
- Does anybody know this girl?
- Yes. Gerri.

1306
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,710
- Give me the gun.
- It's really her!

1307
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,221
I've seen her before, Rosatti.

That ain't Britney.

1308
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,985
- She's lying!
- Shut up, Rosatti.

1309
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:26,185
Okay, now I smell
something burning.

1310
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:42,235
- They were supposed to fix this.
- Do you know how to turn that off?

1311
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,470
I think so.

1312
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:55,282
All right. You three stay put.
Everybody else, back to your rooms.

1313
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:02,486
- I can--
- You can explain.

1314
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:07,557
- I'm really sorry. It's just that--
- I believe you.

1315
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,264
God, I love you.

1316
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:11,896
I love you, too, baby.

1317
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,809
- My grandmother was a bitch, anyway.
- Yeah, she was.

1318
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:25,482
- Wanna go find that money?
- Really?

1319
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:32,250
There you are.

1320
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:38,393
I got your bag back.

1321
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,161
That's not the right bag.

1322
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,869
Can I have my glasses back?

1323
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:49,236
I have...

1324
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,011
a confession to make.

1325
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:55,239
I'm not gay.

1326
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,910
I didn't write
that poem for Foosball.

1327
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,851
I wrote that poem for you.

1328
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:02,520
You did?

1329
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:12,932
There's a shitload of money in here.

1330
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,568
Keep it together.
Sorry. Please.

1331
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:21,333
- You don't need to look over there.
- Forget it.

1332
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:24,674
Screw it. We don't want your stupid,
ugly kids at our university, anyway.

1333
01:26:24,746 --> 01:26:26,737
This place is a madhouse.
What a day.

1334
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,476
We got Lorenzo Rosatti--
"the Black Hand," a prostitute,

1335
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,382
and a couple of kids
with a bunch of coke.

1336
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,790
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
I don't know.

1337
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,521
Totally! After we give
Gerri some for her tuition,

1338
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:42,927
we can go to the Bahamas
and live like kings.

1339
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,261
I don't know if we'll have
enough money to do that.

1340
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:47,324
All right,
then we'll go to Vegas.

1341
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:51,236
We'll go away and have the best
Christmas break ever...together.

1342
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:54,798
- I'm feeling kind of lucky.
- Yeah, so am l.

1343
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,196
Booker, thank God!

1344
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:22,669
I don't even want to know.

1345
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,471
I've had some time
to think about it...

1346
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,102
and I'm really sorry
for the way I've been acting.

1347
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:34,779
In fact,

I have a confession to make.

1348
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,907
I'm a virgin, too.

1349
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:41,717
I know. I talk really big
'cause I can't find a girlfriend.

1350
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:46,654
And I guess I ordered
the whore for myself,

1351
01:27:46,728 --> 01:27:48,423
but I was too embarrassed
to admit it.

1352
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,897
But I realize now
that it's okay to be a virgin, Booker.

1353
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:55,299
It's okay. We don't have
anything to be ashamed of.

1354
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,965
Speak for yourself, loser.
I just lost my virginity.

1355
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:01,972
In fact, I only came back
to get some Gatorade.

1356
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:04,910
I'm gonna go have
a bunch more sex now.

1357
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:08,905
See you tomorrow, Styles.

1358
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:19,452
You're not really
gonna leave me here, are you?

1359
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,293
I don't deserve this, Booker!

1360
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:25,692
Yes, I do.

1361
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,812
I'm such a jerk!

1362
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:50,586
I mean, I don't do unto others

as they would want it--

1363
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:53,149
I don't even know what it is,

but I don't do it.

1364
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:09,065
My family has a lot planned
for us to do over the break.

1365
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,474
Tell me about your family.

1366
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,346
Need bathroom.

1367
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:21,683
It's right over there.

1368
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:26,951
Sorry.

1369
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:31,424
Somehow I got your phone,

1370
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:34,297
and it's campus security
about something.

1371
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:35,693
Thanks.

1372
01:29:36,504 --> 01:29:37,562
Nice robe.

1373
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:39,762
Hello?

1374
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,103
Yeah, this is Wang.

1375
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:47,037
What? That's impossible.
She's here with me!

1376
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:49,709
I don't know who that is,

because I'm standing here with a girl

1377
01:29:49,784 --> 01:29:51,513
who was mugged
on her way to see you.

1378
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:54,077
They took all her things.
Even her passport.

1379
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:58,023
We have confirmed her identity.
She is your foreign exchange student.

01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,492
So can you please come
open the door and let us in?

1381
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:01,687
I'll come right down.

1382
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,028
Then who the hell is...

1383
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:17,069
- Yeah, Lorenzo double-crossed me.

- He got away?

1384
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:19,613
I followed him and this girl
to her dormitory on campus.

1385
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,874
Can anyone ID you?

1386
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:25,214
No. This dumb foreigner arrived,
which gave me the perfect cover.

1387
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:27,117
This whole thing's falling apart.

1388
01:30:27,188 --> 01:30:29,179
- Shit.
- Did you get the money?

1389
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,088
I had it in my hands,
but I lost it.

1390
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,649
We need to find it!

1391
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:34,991
What the hell happened?
How'd you lose it?

1392
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,222
Hang on a sec.

1393
01:30:46,874 --> 01:30:49,866
It's a long story.
I'll tell you when I get there.
