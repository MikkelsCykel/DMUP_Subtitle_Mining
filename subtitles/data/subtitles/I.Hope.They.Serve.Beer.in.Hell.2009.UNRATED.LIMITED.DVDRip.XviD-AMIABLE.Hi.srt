- All right.
- I got your number, I'll call you.

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,944
Perhaps.

156
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,884
Who says romance is dead?

157
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:02,319
How can you hate women...

158
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,891
...yet at the same time
be mad at what Tucker does?

159
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,723
- It makes no sense.
- I am like a feminist.

160
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:11,094
I can assert
multiple contradictory positions.

161
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,792
Do me a favor.
Can you not talk to my server like that?

162
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,997
It's disrespectful, okay?

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,533
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, I think you heard me.

164
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,304
Oh, I heard you, hero.
You don't want me flirting with your server.

165
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,539
- I didn't know she belonged to you.
- It's a figure of speech.

166
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:29,981
Here's another figure of speech:
mind your own fucking business.

167
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:33,184
I'm sorry I've accomplished more
with Leslie in 30 minutes...

168
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,655
...than you have in two years,
but she looked happy talking to me.

169
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,158
Or maybe she rubs her crotch
against all customers.

170
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,319
- Probably.
- It's time for you to leave.

171
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,989
- It's time for you to get us another drink.
- Yeah, I don't think so, man.

172
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,603
Could you just go ahead
and put this on my tab, please? Thank you.

173
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:50,705
Can you get me another beer for...?

174
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:53,774
- Actually, another two beers for table six.
TUCKER: Last one.

175
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:56,343
All right.
Three beers for table six. Thanks.

176
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,309
What the eff, Leslie?

177
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,081
Okay, come on, fuck stick. Let's do this.

178
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,275
DAN:
You're gonna fuck this girl, pal.

179
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,022
You think you're tough?

180
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,282
No.

181
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,789
Just tougher than you.

182
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,757
Tell your friend I know Brazilian jiujutsu.

183
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,294
He wants to make out.

184
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,704
Why is he twitching?

185
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,636
Listen, we need to discuss
a change of venue for your party.

186
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:26,832
This should be good.

187
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,773
No, seriously, the strip club
we're supposed to go to sucks.

188
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:31,207
It's dirty and decrepit...

189
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,611
...and the girls have personalities
like the worst parts of the Bible.

190
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,878
Personalities?
Are you saying we have to talk to them?

191
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,522
Some of us actually enjoy
the company of women, Drew.

192
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,626
Oh, yeah, I'm the misogynist here. Okay.

193
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:48,286
Wouldn't be an issue if Richmond hadn't
passed the no-touching-strippers ordinance.

194
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:51,661
Wait a second. You wanna touch
them now? You said they're disgusting.

195
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,166
Well, what do you wanna do, Dan?
Play checkers?

196
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,168
This is a fucking bachelor party.

197
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:57,806
What did you have in mind?

198
00:10:57,973 --> 00:10:59,634
All right. Thank you very much.

199
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,905
A short three-and-a-half hour drive away
is a strip club called Avarice.

200
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,310
You know what,
I'm sorry, let me back that up.

201
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,006
This isn't just some strip club.

202
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,152
This is the Super Bowl
of carnal pleasures.

203
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,048
We've been to strip clubs before.

204
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:15,088
Not like this one, dude.
First time I got a lap dance there...

205
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,885
...the stripper grabs my hands
and puts them on her tits.

206
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,257
Second dance, she turns around
and dry humps me the entire time.

207
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,490
She was gorgeous and she wasn't close
to being the best one there.

208
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,727
I used to think there was a line
between a gentlemen's club and a brothel.

209
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:30,929
- Now you're telling me it's all just gray.
- Wait a second.

210
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,599
You can full on grab their tits
and they don't even care?

211
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,439
- They encourage it.
- Bet they had good childhoods.

212
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,819
The very best part,
$ 10 dances all night long.

213
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:49,720
I would rather fellate a hot curling iron
than drive 250 miles...

214
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,520
...because Tucker breastfed till he was 9.

215
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,959
Look, sounds great, but I can't leave,
all right?

216
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,258
I got all kinds of meetings
and stuff tomorrow.

217
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:58,798
What kind of meetings?

218
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,927
You know, important stuff,
like the seating chart and whatnot.

219
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,005
A seating chart?

220
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:08,974
I'm pretty sure
Kristy can cut that Gordian knot.

221
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,511
Look, the wedding is next weekend,
all right?

222
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,877
I'm not gonna leave Kristy hanging
because of some no-touch policy.

223
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,711
That's your issue, Tucker, not mine.

224
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:18,513
We'll be back tomorrow afternoon.

225
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,348
If we stay in Richmond...

226
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,654
...we're not gonna have the experience
we need to make up...

227
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,354
...for that abomination of an engagement
party you had with Kristy's family.

228
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:34,066
So the tension builds.
G, 61.

229
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,533
Any bingos?

230
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,399
G, 61.

231
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,098
Genesis chapter six, verse one.

232
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,075
- Yeah, that was pretty bad.
TUCKER: This is it.

233
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:51,247
This is our last fucking gasp together
as single men.

234
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:53,545
I guess.

235
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,417
Dude, you're my boys.

236
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:58,788
I'm just gonna be honest with you,
if you keep acting like a bitch...

237
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,225
...somebody's gonna fuck
that pussy in your face.

238
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:04,025
He's right. Someone will do that.

239
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,258
What about Drew?

240
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:07,061
Oh, don't drag me into this.

241
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:09,500
There is a <i>Next Generation</i> marathon
this weekend.

242
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:12,004
I'm more than happy
just lusting after Deanna Troi.

243
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:14,972
He hasn't been out of his nerd hole
for two weeks.

244
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:17,840
- Drew needs this.
- You do need this.

245
00:13:18,013 --> 00:13:19,776
I need this like I need hepatitis C.

246
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:21,211
You need this.

247
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:23,412
You need this.

248
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,816
He needs this. I need it.

249
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:27,421
We all need it.

250
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,558
Because it's our destiny as men.

251
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:33,425
There is no way
I'm not gonna regret this.

252
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:35,496
But fuck it. Let's go.

253
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:36,995
Done. Fuck it.

254
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,532
- Whatever.
TUCKER: Let's get the fuck out of here.

255
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:43,501
DREW:
Why not?

256
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:48,099
TUCKER: Bro, make sure to tell Leslie
that I'm an asshole...

257
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:50,905
...and she should stay away,
it'll only help me.

258
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,411
LESLIE: Hey, see you.
- Hey.

259
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,310
That's for you.

260
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,419
I already fingered her.

261
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,823
Remember, you're the reason we're going
on this trip and you fucking earned it.

262
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,796
So put your goddamn game face on.

263
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,294
- Let's do this.
- All right.

264
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:23,075
He's gonna fail
worse than a <i>Friends</i> spinoff.

265
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,880
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

266
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,313
What are you working on?

267
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:31,851
The seating chart.

268
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:33,215
Oh, yeah?

269
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,516
Wow, looks like you're almost done.

270
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,249
Not really.

271
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,018
- Hey, guess who just called.
- Who?

272
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,320
My mom.

273
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,623
What?
Another dinosaur fossil test her faith?

274
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,294
She's coming into town early to help out.
Isn't that nice of her?

275
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,165
- How early?
- Tonight.

276
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:52,804
Tonight?

277
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,411
You know she's only coming in early
so she can take control of everything.

278
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,139
No, she's not. Quit being so dramatic.

279
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,547
If she has it her way, the reception's
gonna be a potluck in a barn.

280
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,711
She's pious and conservative, Dan,
not Pennsylvania Dutch.

281
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,881
Probably gonna churn our own butter
for the dinner rolls.

282
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:13,551
My parents are paying for this entire
wedding. She's entitled to some input.

283
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:15,060
Come on, babe.

284
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,427
I just don't want her
to suck all of the fun out of the wedding.

285
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,727
It's my day too.

286
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,164
All right, Groomzilla.

287
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,429
Oh, whoa.

288
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:26,302
Don't Groomzilla me. Those squirrel hunters
wouldn't know a good time if it...

289
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:28,909
...landed on the front lawn
of their megachurch.

290
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,310
What's taking him so long?

291
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,747
He's talking to a woman.
Anything is possible.

292
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,648
What are you doing?

293
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:40,880
Packing.

294
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,080
For what?

295
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:45,590
I'm going to Salem with Tucker and Drew
for my bachelor party.

296
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,956
- I thought you were staying.
- Change of plans.

297
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,598
Tucker knows about a great strip club
down there.

298
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:53,030
Oh, good for Tucker.
I hope he has a great time.

299
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,569
Babe, come on.
You know I can't let him go off by himself.

300
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,235
- Somebody needs go have his back.
- Oh, and who's got your back?

301
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:01,933
Drew?

302
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,472
Tucker's got my back.

303
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,081
Tucker? Tucker says he's got your back.

304
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:10,013
Except you're the one who
always ends up bailing him out.

305
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,052
I wish you took care of me
as well as you take care of Tucker.

306
