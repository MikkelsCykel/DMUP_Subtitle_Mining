1
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,632
We got cenizo...

2
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,876
...that's purple sage...

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,270
...agave, nopal...

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,953
What's that stuff?

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,275
That's whatchamacallit.

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,752
That's horse crippler.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,070
This place is a gold mine.

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,993
Lead mine.

9
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,429
What?

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,351
I said it's a lead mine.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,476
- Right.
- Why am I talking to you?

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,437
You got that thing on your head.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,670
You find lots of cactus and shit?

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,876
Not just cactus. There's acacias...

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,873
...the yuccas...
- Looks like a lot of cactus to me.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,151
Man knows 150 varieties of beer,
can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,275
Cliff!

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,637
You live in a place,
you should learn about it.

19
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,349
- Explore.
- You've got to look at this.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,314
Don't tell me.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,277
Spanish treasure, right?

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,395
Pieces of eight...

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,630
...from the Coronado Expedition.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,149
Jesus!

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,110
Was Coronado in the Masons?

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,510
The forensics fella's coming down
from San Marcos.

27
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,915
There's no way to know how old
the body is without lab work.

28
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,473
That ring?

29
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,439
Mason's been around a long while.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,558
He a treasure hunter?

31
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,799
Old bullets.

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,832
Makes art out of them.

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,832
Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything.

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,031
He can't hear with that rig on.

35
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,713
Mikey!

36
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,998
Hey, what have we got here?

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,954
We're supposed to leave everything
where we found it.

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,952
They're real particular about that.

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,872
The scene of the crime.

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,999
No telling yet if there's been a crime...

41
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,558
...but this country's seen a good number
of disagreements over the years.

42
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,909
He went to school on the post
when we were in Korea.

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,798
It's all kids in the same boat, army brats...

44
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,591
His record shows he's a good student.

45
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm more worried about the social thing.
Are there, like, gangs or guns...

46
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,711
We haven't had any serious violence,
if that's what you mean.

47
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,031
But we've got a pretty lively mix.
Mexican kids...

48
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,792
...anglo kids, black kids.

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,389
- And the blacks are what?
- The smallest group.

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,708
Except for a couple...

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,074
...of Kickapoo kids.

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,958
Look, you're obviously a concerned parent.

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,398
Chet has no history of getting into trouble.

54
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,589
Pilar...

55
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,309
Is Amado okay?

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,234
He's not here?

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,196
Is he sick?

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,590
He's going to wish he was dead.

59
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,310
Somebody hand me a CD player.

60
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,072
They've come a long way
since those old eight-tracks, ain't they?

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,354
Something wrong?

62
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,557
Stolen property. I'm hauling
the bunch of you to jail.

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,713
If anything else is wrong,
tell me on the way to the station.

64
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,758
Cleaning his toenails with a pocketknife.

65
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,877
He was the most hygienic
of all the McHenry's.

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,192
"Fishbait," Buddy says,
in that quiet way of his...

67
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,155
..."what do you know about the tires
that went missing from Merkel's?"

68
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,038
Fishbait thinks for a minute...

69
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,998
...then lifts up a loose board
from the porch floor...

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,191
...and calls down into it.

71
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,678
"Come on out, Hooter, they caught us!"

72
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,636
Buddy Deeds, he had a way.

73
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,757
He'd known who it was
from the tire tracks in the dirt...

74
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,832
...leading from the back of the garage
to where they loaded up.

75
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,273
"Old Fishbait," he said...

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,955
..."never lifted a thing,
if there was a way he could roll it."

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,672
Never be another like him.

78
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,115
You know that boy of his can't cut it.

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,351
He's all hat and no cattle.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,195
Hey, fellas.

81
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,196
We was telling a few on your old man.

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,510
He was a unique individual.

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,113
He was that.

84
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,159
Big day coming up.

85
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,397
I wish we'd have thought of it
while he was still living.

86
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,039
Went so unexpected.

87
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,151
Better late than never.

88
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,756
Korean War hero,
sheriff for nearly 30 years...

89
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,708
The Buddy Deeds Memorial Courthouse.

90
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,030
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.

91
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,151
Well, the usual troublemakers.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,756
Danny Padilla from the <i>Sentinel</i>.
That crowd.

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,390
We call everything else in the country
after Martin Luther King.

94
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,671
We can't have one measly courthouse?

95
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,273
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton.

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,193
Bad enough that all the street names
are in Spanish.

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,998
They were here first.

98
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,352
Then let's call it after Big Chief
Shit-In-The-Bucket. That Tonkawa had...

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,759
...the Mexes beat by centuries.

100
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,638
Nineteen out of 20 people here
are Mexican.

101
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,950
There was a faction pulling
for that boy killed in the Gulf War...

102
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,992
Yeah. Santiago.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,355
Mexicans that know remember what...

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,998
...Buddy was for their people.

105
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,196
Hell, it was Mercedes over there
who swung...

106
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,793
...the deciding vote for him.

107
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,518
She made it an even 3-3.

108
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,109
As mayor, I get to cast the tiebreaker.

109
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,832
The old-timers won't have a problem.
They know how Buddy come to be sheriff.

110
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,832
Tell that story, Hollis.

111
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,990
Everybody heard it a million times.

112
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,673
I'd like to hear it.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,709
Your version of it.

114
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,553
Yeah, come on, Hollis.

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,028
Well, the two of us...

116
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,516
...were the only deputies back then.

117
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,270
Me and Buddy, in what, '58?

118
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,278
'57, I think.

119
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,876
The sheriff at the time
was big Charlie Wade.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,955
Charlie...

121
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,113
...was one of your old-fashioned
bribe-or-bullets kind of sheriffs.

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,115
He took a healthy bite out of whatever
moved through this country.

123
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,191
It was in here one night...

124
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,875
...back when Jimmy Herrera run the place.

125
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,879
<i>Started over a basket of tortillas.</i>

126
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,715
This beaner fare doesn't agree with me
but the price sure is right.

127
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,435
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks,
most of them relatives.

128
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,830
Those people breed like chickens.

129
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,549
So?

130
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,233
I roust some <i>muchacho</i> on the street
with no papers, all he's got to say is:

131
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,231
<i>I work for Jimmy Herrera.</i>

132
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,154
Sort of a...

133
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,632
...l- scratch-his-back-he-washes-mine
arrangement, if you know what I mean.

134
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,638
This'll be one of your pickups.
First of the month, like the rent.

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,513
Get the car, Hollis.

136
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,152
I'm not doing it.

137
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,953
Come again?

138
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,159
It's your deal.

139
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,834
There's going to be some left over for you.

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,353
I take care of my boys.

141
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,671
That's not the point, Charlie.

142
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,190
You feeling bad about Jimmy?

143
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,230
Ask him how big a <i>mordida</i> they took
when he run a place on the other side.

144
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,631
Those old boys from Ciudad León...

145
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,393
I'm not picking it up.

146
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,756
You do whatever I say you do
or else you put it on the trail, son.

147
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,318
How about this, Charlie?

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,310
How about you lay that shield
on this table and vanish...

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,396
...before you end up dead...

150
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,834
...or in jail?

151
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,996
You're not making sense, Buddy.

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,390
Stick around and I'm bringing up charges
on the county road project.

153
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,153
Two-thirds of that money went straight
into your pocket.

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,239
You're being mighty careless
with your mouth, son.

155
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,238
You ever shoot a man
who's looking you in the eye?

156
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,835
It's a whole different story, isn't it?

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,079
You're fired.

158
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,632
Not a soul in this county isn't sick to death
of your bullshit.

159
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,313
Make yourself scarce and you'll make a lot
of people happy.

160
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,958
- You little piss ant.
- Now...

161
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,029
...or later.

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,710
You won't have any trouble finding me.

163
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,511
You're a dead man.

164
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,678
Get the goddamn car.
We're going to Roderick's.

165
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,755
<i>Boy...</i>

166
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,031
<i>... another beer, please.</i>

167
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,110
Yeah, that Buddy was a cool breeze.

168
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,635
Wade was known to put quite a few people
in the ground...

169
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,752
...and your daddy gets eyeball-to-eyeball
with him.

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,473
We made our pickup at Roderick's place.

171
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
Nobody's seen hide nor hair of him since.

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,391
He went missing the next day along
with $10,000 in county funds from the safe.

173
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,958
Never heard from him again.

174
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,952
Buddy Deeds said a thing,
he damn well backed it up.

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,712
Never be another like him.

176
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,119
So, I suppose then he arrested
all of Jimmy Herrera's people and...

177
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,111
...sent them back to the other side?

178
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,111
He came to an accommodation.

179
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,153
Money doesn't always have to change
hands to keep the wheels turning.

180
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,749
I know you had problems with your father.

181
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,234
- And he and Muriel...
- Your mother was a saint.

182
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,349
But Buddy Deeds was my salvation.

183
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,796
Won't be another like him.

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,953
It is an honor for me...

185
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,792
...to assume command of this unit.

186
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,189
I look forward to working with all of you.

187
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,794
I'm sure you're all aware
of the Army's decision...

188
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,518
...to shut this post down.

189
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,958
That doesn't mean, however,
that we're here to mark time...

190
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,678
...until we're reassigned.

191
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,357
You may have heard rumors...

192
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,875
...that I run a very tight operation.

193
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,993
These rumors...

194
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,918
...are not exaggerated.

195
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,870
Somebody call a doctor!

196
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,151
You weren't in here tonight, were you?

197
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,355
No, no, sir.

198
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,913
Go out the back way.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,150
Somebody call a doctor!

200
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,712
Tearing everything down.

201
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,237
Our heritage, the memory of the people
who fought and died for this land.

202
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,675
We fought and died for this land too.

203
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,110
We fought the U.S. Army,
the Texas Rangers...

204
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,679
Yeah, and you lost.

205
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,436
Winners get the bragging rights.

206
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,310
People. It'd be best if we don't view this
in terms of winners and losers.

207
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,119
The way she teaches,
she's got everything backward.

208
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,839
I was on the textbook committee.
Her version...

209
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,389
We think of the textbook...

210
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,516
...as a guide, not as an absolute.

211
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,234
It is not what we set as the standard.

212
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,399
Now, you people can believe
whatever you want...

213
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,152
...but when it comes to teaching...

214
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,199
They're our children too. As the majority
in this community, we have the right.

215
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,070
The men who founded this state
have the right to have their story told.

216
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,669
The men who founded this state
broke from Mexico.

217
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,389
They needed slavery to be legal
to make a fortune in the cotton business.

218
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,994
I think that's a bit of an oversimplification.

219
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,516
- You reporting or running this meeting?
- Adding some historical perspective.

220
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,795
You call it history, I call it propaganda.

221
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,634
I'm sure they've got their own account
of the Alamo on the other side...

222
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,718
...but our schools shouldn't teach it
that way.

223
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,915
Excuse me.

224
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,190
I've only been trying to get across part
of the complexity of our situation here.

225
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,311
Cultures coming together
in both negative and positive ways.

226
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,592
If you mean food and music and all,
I have no problem.

227
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,959
But when you start changing...

228
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,314
...who did what to who...

229
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,676
We're just trying to present
a more complete picture.

230
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,712
That's what's got to stop!

231
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,112
There's enough ignorance in the world
without us encouraging it in school.

232
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Now, who are you calling ignorant?

233
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,079
I hope the sucker dies.
Mess with me, that's what you get.

234
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,116
Hospital says the kid is in bad shape.

235
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,474
The shooter local?

236
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,438
Houston. I think he knew the girl
from before.

237
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,957
We'll take a statement from the GI's
before they go back to post.

238
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,474
You can get the story from Otis.

239
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,600
Any poop on the John Doe
we found today?

240
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,873
No, nothing much.
Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it.

241
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,753
I'll catch you later.

242
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,349
He's only 15. He's about 5 foot 5...

243
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,475
Pilar.

244
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,434
Something wrong?

245
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,113
They've got my son.

246
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,156
Here?

247
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,030
Somebody called about a house that was
broken into. They say they don't have...

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,035
All right, I know what he looks like.

249
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,798
I'll see what's going on.

250
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,949
I was...

251
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,919
I was real sorry about Nando.

252
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,358
He was a good fella.

253
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,719
We haven't talked...

254
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,916
We haven't talked since high school.

255
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,878
I'll go check on your boy.

256
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,875
Ritchie didn't say nothing,
'cause he didn't want to get in it.

257
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,239
Then, next thing I know
there's shots and Ritchie's down.

258
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,196
You got some boys you run in earlier?

259
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,598
They tell me you're good at fixing things.

260
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,629
Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

261
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,628
You know, if you figure minimum wage...

262
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,280
...on the time most thieves spend in jail...

263
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,358
...they could have bought
most everything they stole.

264
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,116
They asked me to hook it up for them.
I didn't steal anything.

265
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,716
Well, I didn't say you did.

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,070
My name's Sam, by the way.

267
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,751
- He's all yours.
- Are you okay?

268
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,831
What's the big deal?

269
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,717
You'll find out when I get you home.

270
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,395
Thanks, Sam.

271
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,233
It's no problem.

272
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,153
It was good seeing you again.

273
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,511
Big O's is the only place
where African American soldiers...

274
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,352
...feel comfortable, sir.

275
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,751
- Have we had trouble there before?
- Fistfight now and then.

276
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,479
- This town isn't much.
- They didn't come for a vacation.

277
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,712
For many, it's their first time away
from home, dealing with new people...

278
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,235
- I remember my first hitch...
- Substance abuse?

279
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,073
Yes, sir, but I went through the program.
I haven't drunk...

280
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,799
I meant on the post.
How are you dealing with it?

281
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,474
We throw a urine test at them
once a month.

282
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,199
Random numbers...

283
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,191
...maybe 100 people at a time.

284
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,192
- Let's make it once a week for a while.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,194
I sprint the last quarter mile.
You don't have to keep up.

286
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,954
Appreciate it, sir.

287
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,675
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.

288
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,310
You get the feeling
he doesn't want to be here?

289
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,115
Sam the Man.

290
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,154
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.

291
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,719
So, how's business?

292
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,078
Business is booming.

293
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,870
Got your drugs, got your illegals.

294
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,273
Had a shooting the other night
at O's place. Soldier got ventilated.

295
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,194
I hear they're closing Fort McKenzie.

296
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,430
It'll pull a lot of jobs out of this county.

297
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,718
We'll have folks swimming over to Mexico
to work in the sweat shops.

298
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,632
Is that the word on our boy?

299
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,514
This is Skinny.

300
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,036
Skinny?

301
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,799
When we find a body, it's Skinny or Stinky.

302
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,269
Depends on how much meat's left
on the bones.

303
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,198
That's a nice job.

304
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,878
"A male Caucasian...

305
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,358
"...40 to 60 years old...

306
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,998
"...5 foot 9...

307
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,559
"...5 foot 11.

308
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,514
"Chewed tobacco."

309
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,114
Then we'll get the dental records
and personal effects.

310
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,758
It's Charlie Wade.

311
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,949
That badge...

312
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,349
Didn't come out of a cereal box.

313
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,557
You know the popular version
of how he left town.

314
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,315
Everybody on the border knows that story.

315
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,272
You got a cause of death?

316
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,554
Skull was intact.

317
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,995
No signs of trauma on what we found.

318
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,872
Not much to go on.

319
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,633
So, he could have gone out to the post,
just hopped the fence...

320
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,236
...dug into the dirt on the rifle range...

321
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,072
...and had a heart attack.

322
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,271
You remember what old Buddy carried
for a side arm?

323
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,719
Colt Peacemaker.

324
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,869
.45.

325
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,109
He swore by it.

326
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,909
What?

327
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,393
I was just wondering.

328
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,191
Is Buddy on your short list?

329
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,995
If it were some poor <i>majadero</i>
who swam across, got lost in the brush...

330
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,231
...and starved out there
it wouldn't go much further, but...

331
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,034
...this is a once prominent citizen
who disappeared.

332
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,551
You've got to investigate.
There's no question about it.

333
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,433
I'll keep names out of it until we get
some answers or hit a dead end.

334
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,671
You know how the press is when they get
ahold of a murder story, even 40 years old.

335
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,920
Yeah, yeah. They can do a number on you.

336
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,239
I remember...

337
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,831
...Charlie Wade come
to my father's hardware store once.

338
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,558
I was just a little boy.

339
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,909
I'd heard stories
about how he shot this one...

340
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,877
...how he shot that one.

341
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,952
The man winked at me.

342
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,432
I peed my pants.

343
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,074
Winked at me.

344
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,753
We have the fight against the Spanish,
a bloody conflict for dozens of years...

345
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,991
...till they are finally defeated in 1821...

346
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,232
...and Mexican independence is declared.

347
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,757
Anglo settlers are invited
to colonize the area.

348
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,117
By the time they begin the movement
against Santa Anna...

349
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,477
...they outnumber the Mexicans here
by four to one.

350
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,834
The war between Mexico
and the anglo forces ends...

351
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,672
...in 1836...

352
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,879
...with the formation
of the Texas republic. Texas...

353
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,032
...joins the United States...

354
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,635
...as a state where slavery
is legal in 1845...

355
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,589
...after the so-called Mexican War,
then secedes to join...

356
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,873
...the Confederacy in 1861.
The Confederacy is beaten...

357
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,829
...and the Reformation period here
is marked by range wars...

358
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,990
...and race wars and all this...

359
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,430
...paralleled by the constant battles...

360
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,239
...between the Mexican
and anglo settlers...

361
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,876
...and the various Indian nations.
What are we seeing here, Chet?

362
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,995
Everybody's killing everybody else?

363
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,676
I always wondered what you mayors do...

364
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,512
...when you're not cutting ribbons.

365
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,789
Sam!

366
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,509
Partner.

367
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,197
You caught me playing hooky.

368
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,360
Floating around out here,
playing hell with them bass.

369
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,271
Sounds great! Where do I sign up?

370
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,309
You been by your old place lately?

371
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,669
No.

372
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,796
New people painted it some awful color.

373
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,752
We found a body out
by Fort McKenzie yesterday.

374
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,878
It'd been there a long time.

375
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,269
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?

376
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,958
You recall if Charlie Wade was a Mason?

377
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,755
Charlie?

378
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,710
I believe he used to go for Lodge meetings
over to Laredo.

379
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,519
What's Charlie Wade got to do
with your body?

380
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,158
All he was wearing was
a big old Masonic ring...

381
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,350
...and a Rio County sheriff's badge.

382
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,472
You remember anything else
from the last night you saw him?

383
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,199
I told the story enough times.

384
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,439
We were in the car. He was stewing about
his fight with Buddy as we drove over...

385
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,272
...to Roderick Bledsoe's.

386
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,589
Bledsoe?

387
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,950
He owned the colored roadhouse
before Otis.

388
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,075
He's still living?

389
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,435
No.

390
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,159
I think his widow's still in their place
in Darktown, though.

391
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,114
You think it was Charlie Wade, huh?

392
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,876
Forensics people are sure of it.

393
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,600
You got any idea
who might have put him there?

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,877
Besides my father, I mean.

395
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,430
There's no call for that, Sam.

396
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,998
Wade made himself a pile of enemies
over the years.

397
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,193
- Buddy was one of them.
- The dedication's tomorrow.

398
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,834
It's a hell of a time
to bring up old business.

399
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,393
People have made this whole big thing
around my father. If it's built on a crime...

400
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,072
...they deserve to know.

401
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,512
I understand why you might want
to believe he couldn't do it.

402
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,592
I understand why you might want
to think he could.

403
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,196
Thanks for your time, Hollis.

404
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,194
Look at all this.

405
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,439
Tackle, boat...

406
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,750
All just to catch a little old fish...

407
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,991
...minding his own business
down at the bottom of the lake.

408
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,073
Hardly seems worth the effort,
does it, Sam?

409
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,476
You knew this young man before?

410
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,912
From back in Houston.
We both come up off the street.

411
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,997
Did you know he'd be there last night?

412
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,719
If I had, I wouldn't have gone in.

413
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,355
And you and Private Graves were...

414
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,232
We were just dancing.

415
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,157
We're not running a dating service.

416
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,753
I know that, Sergeant.

417
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,276
We were just dancing.
There was a bunch of us there.

418
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,956
Shadow... just come down
looking for trouble.

419
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,391
I don't like to get involved
with soldiers' personal lives...

420
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,795
...but when it interferes with training...

421
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,189
Shadow just gets crazy.

422
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,878
Sergeant, how is Ritchie doing?
Private Graves?

423
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,589
He'll live.

424
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,637
He'll be transferred to Fort Sam...

425
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,073
...as soon as he's stabilized.

426
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,754
He'll probably be getting
a medical discharge.

427
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,911
Will this go on my record?

428
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,270
The incident will be noted.

429
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,472
If it happened the way you say...

430
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,430
...there hasn't been an infraction.

431
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,993
Thank you, Sergeant.

432
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,395
You're dismissed.

433
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,038
Thank you, Sergeant.

434
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,671
You spoil them, Cliff.

435
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,471
- You don't believe her?
- That wasn't much of an interrogation.

436
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,199
I'm in charge of her sorry ass and frankly...

437
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,636
I won't give her the third-degree
because her ex-boyfriend's a thug.

438
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,393
She's pulled herself out
of a rough neighborhood.

439
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,995
And if she isn't careful,
she's gonna slide right back into it.

440
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,033
Mrs. Bledsoe?

441
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,395
That's me.

442
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,238
I'm Sheriff Deeds.

443
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,917
Sheriff Deeds is dead, honey.
You're just Sheriff Junior.

444
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,750
Yeah, that's the story of my life.

445
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,038
You ever play one of these?

446
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,519
Yeah, I've seen them.

447
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,195
Don't ever start up on them, because...

448
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,430
...once you do, you can't stop.

449
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,238
I tell myself I'll just play
three little games after breakfast...

450
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,312
...and here I am...

451
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,116
...with half the day gone.

452
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,193
May I ask you a few questions
about your husband?

453
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,114
Roderick.

454
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,754
I ain't gonna say nothing bad
about the man...

455
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,757
...but you can ask away.

456
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,516
He had the club on Old Trail Road.

457
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,154
We run that club for over 20 years.

458
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,950
Give it over to Otis Payne...

459
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,949
...in 1967, April.

460
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,271
You must remember Sheriff Wade.

461
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,874
Them days...

462
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,513
...you deal with Sheriff Wade
or you didn't deal.

463
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,189
First of the month, every month...

464
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,748
...he'd remind you
who you really working for.

465
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,071
So, he squeezed money out of you?

466
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,316
It wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass
back then, unless you was a club, see?

467
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,838
Roderick used to say:

468
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,879
"Buy yourself a glass,
get a free membership."

469
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,829
Sheriff Wade...

470
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,350
...he could close you down anytime.

471
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,758
And my father?

472
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,231
Sheriff Buddy was a different story.

473
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,393
As long as Roderick throw his weight
the right way at election day...

474
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,554
...make sure all the colored come to vote,
throw a barbecue for the right folks...

475
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,949
Sheriff Buddy kept to his word.

476
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,437
That Sheriff Wade, though...

477
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,158
...he could get ugly.

478
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,078
People didn't complain?

479
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,270
Not if you was colored or Mexican.

480
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,550
Not if you wanted to keep breathing.

481
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,997
I remember the last time I seen him
before he gone missing.

482
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,275
He come fussing around our place.

483
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,194
He used to come in
whilst we was in full swing.

484
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,070
<i>Making everybody nervous.</i>

485
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,198
<i>Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper.</i>

486
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,632
<i>He used to sit there</i>
<i>with his hand on his old gun...</i>

487
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,359
<i>... acting the kingfish with everybody.</i>

488
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,428
<i>Otis Payne come...</i>

489
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,670
<i>... to work for us about that time...</i>

490
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,310
<i>... and that boy had him some attitude.</i>

491
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,475
Pour it.

492
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,875
What?

493
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,475
Pour it.

494
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,475
I know you?

495
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,754
Name's Otis.

496
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,914
Otis what?

497
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,549
Payne.

498
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,873
They call me "O."

499
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,632
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?

500
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,390
I sent your daddy to the farm once.

501
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,399
Yeah, I know that.

502
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,432
Why you think that was?

503
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,391
Some crop needed picking
and the man was short-handed.

504
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,036
As I remember, it was 'cause
he had a sassy mouth on him.

505
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,599
Must run in the family.

506
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,194
You wouldn't be running numbers
out of this club?

507
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,196
Running numbers is illegal, sir.

508
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,513
Running numbers without I knowin'
about it is both illegal and unhealthy.

509
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,233
You remember that.

510
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,998
Son, you're not finished.

511
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,309
Pour his.

512
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,319
I prefer it in the bottle.

513
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,719
Shut up, Hollis.

514
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,432
How come you don't look familiar?

515
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,917
I've been away, up in Houston.

516
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,709
Houston?

517
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,394
I hear they let you boys run wild up there.

518
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,838
Look what you've done now.

519
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,395
Better get something to wipe it up, son.

520
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,234
You spilled it.
Maybe you should wipe it up.

521
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,913
I told you to do something. Will you hop
to it or will we have a problem?

522
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,113
You don't want to turn tail
in front of your people?

523
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,519
I understand.

524
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,670
Come on, Houston, give it a try.

525
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,354
Come to Papa.

526
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,868
Don't mind him.

527
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,555
He's a bit slow, is all.
He don't mean nothing by it.

528
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,193
That the problem, son?

529
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,469
You slow?

530
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,156
Otis!

531
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,479
Apologize to the sheriff.

532
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,439
Sheriff, you got him too scared to peep.

533
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,151
Maybe if you'd put that gun up.

534
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,073
You telling me what to do?

535
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,878
No, Sheriff, I'm just...

536
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,592
Is that whisky in them glasses?

537
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,712
I'll have to cite you
for violation of a state law.

538
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,589
This is a club, Sheriff. You've been here.

539
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,560
You people better clear out of here now!

540
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,996
Learn how to act your place, son.

541
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,039
This isn't Houston.

542
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,909
'Course, I was young...

543
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,791
...and full of beans back then.

544
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,993
I didn't understand the spot
I was putting Roderick in.

545
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,953
And that was the last time you saw him?

546
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,160
I think he came in one more time...

547
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,152
...with Hollis and...

548
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,836
No, no, your daddy wasn't with him.

549
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,150
Made their monthly pickup.

550
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,152
Roderick wasn't in, so I kept my mouth
shut and handed over that envelope.

551
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,078
That was the night he disappeared?

552
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,714
Could have been.

553
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,348
You own a gun?

554
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,356
Back then?

555
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,275
No.

556
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,715
How about Roderick?

557
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,748
Oh, he kept...

558
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,432
...a big old piece back behind the bar,
just so folks knew it was there.

559
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,311
I don't keep one here now.

560
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,797
Don't much care for them.

561
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,271
And when my father was sheriff?

562
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,549
What about him?

563
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,472
What was your deal with him?

564
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,119
Buddy was more part of the big picture:

565
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,436
County political machine...

566
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,680
...Chamber of Commerce, Zoning Board...

567
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,955
If I kept those people happy,
he was pretty much on my side.

568
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,076
When somebody thought of starting up
a new bar for the black folks, they'd be...

569
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,712
How should I say this?

570
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,475
They'd be officially discouraged.

571
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,031
He ever accept cash for a favor?

572
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,910
I don't recall a prisoner ever died...

573
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,231
...in your daddy's custody.

574
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,875
I don't recall a man in this county...

575
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,116
...black, white, Mexican...

576
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,429
...who'd hesitate for a minute...

577
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,589
...before they'd call on Buddy Deeds
to solve a problem.

578
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,353
More than that...

579
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,712
...I wouldn't care to say.

580
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,397
I'm supposed to tell my friends
they're too low-class to hang with?

581
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,833
Come on, Amado.

582
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,191
- 'Cause I'm not like Miss Honor Roll?
- Leave your sister out of it.

583
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,271
You and those teachers in that dump...

584
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,635
Your story's over, so nobody can have fun.

585
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,630
You jerk.

586
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,551
You have no friends.

587
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,631
Who'd be friends with a <i>pachuco</i> wannabe?

588
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,549
- I don't pretend I came on the Mayflower.
- And those stupid girls.

589
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,675
Shut up.

590
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,356
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school
she's in love with Santo Guerra.

591
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,316
So?

592
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,868
You can't be desperately in love
when you're 14.

593
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,876
Not if you have half a brain in your head.

594
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,552
Of course, you can.

595
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,036
What?

596
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,119
It's got nothing to do with being smart.

597
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,508
It's ancient goddamn history, Danny.

598
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,355
1963, they dam up the north branch
to make Lake Pescadero...

599
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,351
...and a whole town disappears.

600
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,634
A squatter's town!

601
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,032
People lived in Perdido for over 100 years!
Mexicans and Chicanos are deported...

602
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,829
...forcibly evicted by our local hero,
Buddy Deeds, and his department.

603
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,116
There was a bill from the state legislature.

604
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,317
Families were split apart!
A whole community was destroyed!

605
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,592
And who gets Lakefront property
bought for a fraction of the market price?

606
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,754
Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County,
and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue.

607
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,839
Are you finished?

608
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,037
Look, I'm not after you, Sam.

609
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,910
I just think people ought to know
the full story on Buddy Deeds.

610
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,759
That makes two of us.

611
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,838
What's the big deal? Go back over,
talk to the man, and bury the hatchet.

612
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,151
Why me? He's had almost 40 years
and I haven't heard from him.

613
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,639
He was probably embarrassed.

614
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,871
Otis Payne was never embarrassed
about a thing in his life.

615
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,917
You were 8 when he left.

616
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,232
He moved three houses down
with my mother's best friend.

617
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,795
Dad.

618
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,630
"Delmore, where's your daddy?"

619
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,275
Godforsaken town.
Everybody in everybody else's business.

620
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,152
Everybody loved Otis. Big "O."

621
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,357
Always there with a smile or a loan...

622
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,238
...or a free drink.
- Dad, can I talk to you about track?

623
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,275
People change.

624
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,989
Not that much.

625
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,035
I talked to the coach.

626
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,315
I told you. Next year,
if your grades are high.

627
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,594
I have a B average!

628
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,353
How many B students do you think
they take at West Point?

629
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,829
We'll be here for three years.
We'll have to see him.

630
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,879
No, we don't.

631
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,152
Get off the phone.
We've got a big wedding.

632
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,435
Mommy...

633
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,715
They are getting stupider every year.

634
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,115
Maybe you're getting less patient.

635
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,877
If they're going to survive,
they have to know how to work.

636
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,708
You hire illegals, what do you expect?

637
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,191
Nobody's illegal in my cafe!

638
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,996
They've got green cards,
relatives who were born here.

639
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,153
If they only had a little common sense,
I'd be happy.

640
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,232
If you took more time training them,
you wouldn't have to...

641
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,676
Did you come here to teach me
how to run my business?

642
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,476
Do you want to take a trip...

643
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,033
...down south with us?

644
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,111
Maybe see where you grew up?

645
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,393
- Why would I want to go there?
- You must be curious...

646
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,234
...how it's changed. Amado is
into this big <i>tejano</i>- roots thing...

647
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,274
...and I've never been further
than Ciudad León.

648
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,118
You want to see Mexicans?

649
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,316
Open your eyes and look around you.

650
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,477
We're up to our ears in them.

651
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,754
Mommy...

652
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,194
...how old were you when my father died?

653
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,439
He was killed.

654
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,758
Right, when he was killed.

655
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,908
A little older than Paloma is now.

656
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,631
How come you never remarried?

657
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,151
It just didn't happen.

658
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,954
There must have been...

659
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,155
...somebody.

660
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,959
I was too busy.

661
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,391
Nobody is too busy.

662
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,035
Maybe now.

663
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,356
It was different back then.

664
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,718
I had to do all the shopping,
all the cooking...

665
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,874
What do I need some <i>chulo</i> with grease
under his nails to drink up the profit?

666
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,876
Thank you.

667
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,388
I don't mean Fernando.

668
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
When I brought him home,
those were your exact words:

669
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,351
"A <i>chulo</i> with grease under his nails."

670
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,555
I never said that.

671
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,359
You made it pretty damn clear.
You thought he was nobody.

672
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,236
I thought you could do better.

673
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,833
What? What?

674
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,510
Become a nun? You didn't even want me
to go out with anglos.

675
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,034
I never said that. Just that boy.

676
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,434
"That boy."

677
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,790
Say his name, for Christ's sake.

678
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,149
You people are stealing from me.

679
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,195
<i>Is she your mother?</i>

680
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,755
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

681
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,040
Now, I'm as liberal as the next guy.

682
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,476
If the next guy is a redneck.

683
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,679
But I got to say...

684
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,391
...I think there's something
to this cold-climate business.

685
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,149
I mean, you go to the beach...

686
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,919
...what do you do?

687
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,709
Drink a few beers, wait for that fish
to flop up on the sand.

688
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,838
You can't build no civilization that way.

689
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,995
But you got a cold winter coming on...

690
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,838
...you got to plan ahead.

691
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,434
That gives your old cerebral cortex
a workout.

692
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,829
Good thing you were born down here then.

693
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,750
You joke about it, Sam,
but we are in a state of crisis.

694
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,993
The lines of demarcation are getting fuzzy.

695
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,034
To run a successful civilization, you've got
to have your lines of demarcation...

696
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,192
...between right and wrong,
this one and that one.

697
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,279
Your daddy understood that.

698
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,271
He was... What do you call it?

699
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,237
The referee in this damn <i>menudo</i>
we got down here.

700
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,470
He understood how most folks don't want
their salt and sugar in the same jar.

701
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,709
If you mixed drinks...

702
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,552
...as bad as you mix metaphors...

703
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,312
...you'd be out of a job.

704
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,393
You're the last white sheriff
this town will see.

705
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,559
Hollis retires next year.
Jorge Guerra will take over.

706
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,991
This is it, right here, Sam.

707
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,150
This bar is the last stand.
<i>Se habla</i> American, goddamn it!

708
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,868
And even in here, it's sliding away.

709
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,829
Take that pair over there in the corner.

710
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,393
A place like this, 20 years ago...

711
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,790
...Buddy'd been on them.
He'd have went over there...

712
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,632
...and given them a warning.

713
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,634
Not that he had it in for the colored,
but just as a kind of a safety tip.

714
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,278
Yeah, bet he would.

715
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,032
The day that man died...

716
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,709
...they broke the goddamn mold.

717
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,196
- Seriously.
- Seriously?

718
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,351
I think we should get married.

719
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,192
We've been through this before.

720
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,633
We should just do it.

721
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,269
And if I get transferred to another post?
Germany or Korea?

722
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,159
I'd ask for a transfer too.

723
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,151
Which they'd most likely turn down.

724
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,470
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.

725
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,712
You know, you are something.

726
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,749
Man's going to retire in two years
and he offers to quit.

727
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,518
Big goddamn deal.

728
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,269
Excuse me.

729
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,555
Sheriff.

730
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,753
This is Sergeant...

731
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,957
This is Priscilla Worth.

732
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,038
Sheriff Deeds was with us
on our archeological find.

733
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,111
They're building a shopping mall there?

734
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,156
If certain people have their way,
it's gonna be a new jail.

735
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,752
They're closing down military
and putting up jails...

736
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,239
...like 7-11 stores.

737
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,033
Do either of you have any idea
when they stopped using that site...

738
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,553
...as a rifle range?

739
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,270
Fort McKenzie stopped training infantry...

740
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,875
...there in the late '50s. It was just
a playground for the jackrabbits...

741
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,634
...till they gave it to the county last year.

742
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,878
You know who it was they dug up?

743
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,753
Not for sure yet.

744
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,991
But I kind of wish they hadn't.

745
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,516
In English, Enrique.
This is the United States.

746
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,353
We speak English.

747
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,951
Is very beautiful, your car.

748
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,398
- Good night, Enrique.
- <i>Buenas noches, seòora.</i>

749
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,069
Carolyn...

750
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,348
Knock that off.

751
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,199
Black Seminoles?

752
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,119
Hobby of mine.

753
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,193
A few artifacts...

754
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,712
...couple of pieces one of your men
out on the base made.

755
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,719
Admission's free.

756
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,998
This is where he was shot?

757
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,119
He fell right by the door.

758
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,679
You get much of that here?

759
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,594
It's a bar.

760
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,312
Folks come together...

761
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,753
...drink, fall in love, fall out of love...

762
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,672
...hear their grudges out.

763
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,991
Deal drugs in the bathroom.

764
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,831
If I thought it would do any good...

765
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,354
...I'd put up a sign telling them not to...

766
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,116
...right next to the one about
the employees washing their hands.

767
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,119
This here is Carolyn.

768
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,070
Honey...

769
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,720
...this is my son, Delmore.

770
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,912
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

771
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,839
I'll be in the back waiting for that delivery.

772
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,315
So?

773
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,075
So.

774
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,318
Tell me why I shouldn't make
this place off-limits.

775
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,071
This is an official visit then.

776
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,391
I assume most of your business
is with our people.

777
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,193
Your boys are cooped up together.
They need a place to let the steam out.

778
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,309
If they're black, there's not
but one spot in this county...

779
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,118
...where they feel welcome.

780
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,992
It's been that way...

781
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,111
...since before you were born.

782
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,589
We have an enlisted man's club
at the post.

783
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,229
You the man out there now, ain't you?

784
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,548
It's your call.

785
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,594
That's right.

786
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,599
I've been hearing about
this new command out there...

787
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,557
...for a couple of weeks now.

788
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,439
The boys say they hear he's a hard case...

789
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,110
...a real spit-and-polish man.

790
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,274
Full bird colonel by the name of Payne.

791
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,315
Bet you never figured
you'd end up back here.

792
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,479
When the Army offers you a command,
you go...

793
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,919
...wherever it is.

794
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,074
Right.

795
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,389
I hear things too.

796
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,072
They call you...

797
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,557
...the mayor of Darktown.

798
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:11,435
Over the years this is the one place
that's always been there.

799
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,116
I loan a little money out,
I've settled a few arguments.

800
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,958
I got a cot in the back. Folks get scared
to go home, they spend the night.

801
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,238
There's not enough of us
to run anything in this town.

802
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,991
It's the Holiness Church...

803
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,594
...or Big O's.

804
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,117
And the people make a choice.

805
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,436
Most of them choose both.

806
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,629
It's not like there's a borderline...

807
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,355
...between the good people
and the bad people.

808
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,388
You're not on either...

809
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,879
...one side or the other.

810
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,309
Right.

811
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,592
Will I meet that family of yours?

812
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,471
Why would you want to do that?

813
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,629
Because I'm your father.

814
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,596
You'll get official notification
when I make my decision.

815
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,553
So, that's him.

816
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,473
Yeah, that's him.

817
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,831
Historic occasion, ain't it?

818
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,115
Seems like we have another one
every week.

819
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,239
Jorge and the boys down at the Chamber
of Commerce got to keep things humming.

820
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,952
Building up tourism, Sam.

821
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,477
Most people come here to catch bass and
get laid at the Boy's Town in Ciudad León.

822
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,078
You ought to put up a banner, "Frontera,
Texas - Gateway to Inexpensive Pussy."

823
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,230
That kind of talk doesn't help.

824
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,152
I'd rather have that
than a 10-foot-high catfish statue.

825
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,959
Eddie Richter at the <i>Sentinel</i>
will kill that story.

826
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,473
The Perdido thing?

827
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,716
He agreed it wasn't exactly news.

828
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,750
Danny will be out for blood the next time.

829
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,594
That's why we need to talk to you
about the new jail.

830
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,830
Come on, we don't need a new jail.

831
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,678
That's a matter of opinion.

832
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,513
We're already renting cells to the Feds
for their overflow.

833
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,750
It wouldn't be your construction company
who'd get the bid on building this thing?

834
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,274
And, Jorge...

835
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,073
You wouldn't be thinking
about a couple dozen new jobs...

836
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,550
...to dangle by the voters when you run
for mayor next election?

837
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,598
Damn it, Sam! The people
are concerned about crime.

838
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,553
I'm not gonna campaign
against your deal here.

839
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,239
But if anybody asks...

840
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,995
...I've got to tell them the truth.
We don't need a new jail.

841
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,389
We backed you...

842
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,278
When you backed me,
you needed somebody named Deeds...

843
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,715
...to bump the other fella out of office.

844
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,955
- Hey, folks.
- Fenton, what's up, buddy?

845
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
- How you doing?
- Let's get this thing over with.

846
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,430
I never thought I'd see a buddy of mine
dating a woman...

847
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,596
...with three bars on her shoulder.

848
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,557
It's beyond what you'd call dating.

849
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,358
You're going to get married?

850
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,395
Maybe.

851
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,913
You met her family?

852
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,554
They gonna be cool
about you being a white guy?

853
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,395
Priscilla says they think a woman over 30
who's not married must be a lesbian.

854
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,309
She figures they'll be so relieved
I'm a man...

855
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,279
It's always heartwarming to see
a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.

856
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,995
But marriage, man, I don't know.

857
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,869
Let's see...

858
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,799
I did two tours of duty in Southeast Asia...

859
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,190
...and I was married for five years.

860
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,875
I couldn't tell you
which experience was worse.

861
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,631
Mikey?

862
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,439
I knew she was Japanese,
but she didn't tell me...

863
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,318
...the Ninja-assassin part.

864
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,712
Parents acted like I'd blow my nose
on their curtains.

865
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,190
If I stayed out past 10:00,
she'd do a Madam Butterfly routine.

866
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,992
Mikey, look at this.

867
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,549
What?

868
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,756
It's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets.

869
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,114
It's a.45.

870
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,278
This is the stuff we picked up
the other day, right?

871
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,677
- Rest of this is all.30 caliber.
- They used M-1s.

872
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,430
So what's a pistol slug doing
on a rifle range?

873
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,877
We'd better call that sheriff.

874
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,754
Back in the early '70s...

875
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,911
...a reporter from a national magazine
asked the governor of our Lone Star state:

876
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,275
"Governor...

877
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,273
"...what's your ideal...

878
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,874
"...of what a real Texan ought to be?"

879
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,308
Governor said:

880
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,238
"Son, that's easy.

881
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,948
"Just go down to...

882
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,837
"...Rio County and look at...

883
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,797
"...Sheriff Buddy Deeds."

884
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,675
Thank you.

885
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,269
There's...

886
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,319
...one more person
we ought to hear from and...

887
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,635
...I think he's somebody that knew Buddy
better than any of us.

888
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,195
Sam...

889
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,754
Say a few words?

890
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,238
Well, you folks who remember my father...

891
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,392
...knew him as sheriff.

892
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,077
But at home he was also judge, jury...

893
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,919
...and executioner.

894
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,119
This is a real honor you're doing him today.

895
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,556
If Buddy was around, I know his hat size
would be getting bigger every minute.

896
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,597
I used to think there wasn't a place here
you could hide from my old man.

897
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,958
And now I'm sure of it.

898
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,711
I do appreciate it, though.

899
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,792
And wherever he is, Buddy's putting
the beer on ice for you. So, thank you.

900
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,112
And now, my favorite council member...

901
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,399
...and one of Frontera's
most respected businesswomen...

902
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,916
...Mrs. Mercedes Cruz...

903
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,873
...will do the honors.

904
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,236
It does look kind of like Buddy.

905
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,199
I think he'll run that Mexican kid in
for loitering.

906
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,191
Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.

907
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,633
Field trip?

908
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,074
Lunch hour.

909
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,470
My next class isn't until 1:30.

910
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,478
You want to take a walk?

911
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,632
They cooked the whole thing up
without asking me.

912
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,592
People liked him.

913
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,432
Most people did, yeah.

914
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,830
I remember him watching me once...

915
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,118
...when I was little...

916
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,873
...before you and I...

917
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,072
I was in the playground
with all the other kids.

918
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,995
I thought he was only looking at me.

919
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,714
I was afraid he was going to arrest me.

920
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,876
He had those eyes, and that...

921
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,149
Yeah.

922
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,030
It's weird what you remember.

923
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,394
Your boy there.

924
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,156
Amado.

925
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,309
Nice looking kid.

926
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,515
He hates me.

927
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,470
No.

928
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:10,356
With Paloma, it's like she pities
and tolerates me, totally age-appropriate.

929
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,278
But with Amado...

930
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,594
...you know, he's always had
difficulty reading and me...

931
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,596
...being a teacher and caring
about those things, it's like a betrayal.

932
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,352
But Fernando did okay.

933
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,754
He dropped out.

934
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,231
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody.
He just wanted to fix their cars.

935
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,950
I spent my first 15 years
trying to be just like Buddy.

936
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,079
The next 15 trying
to give him a heart attack.

937
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,949
So, why did you come back here, Sam?

938
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,918
I got divorced...

939
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,558
...and I wouldn't work
for my father-in-law anymore.

940
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,751
And the fellas down here...

941
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,511
...they said they'd back me.

942
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,751
You don't want to be sheriff.

943
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,474
I got to admit,
it's not what I thought it'd be.

944
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,356
Back when Buddy had it...

945
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,471
Hell, I'm just a jailer.

946
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:32,471
