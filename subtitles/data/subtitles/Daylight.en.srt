The sandhogs worked 36-hour shifts
building this thing.

They had bunk rooms there, chapels,
kitchens-- They had everything.

-Three hours, max.

here's what I think we oughta do.

480

seal off the survivors from the fumes...

for two-and-a-half minutes.
- Each ?

00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:23,863
Total. They're revved all
the way up to compensate for
the damaged exhaust shaft.

500
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:27,025
When we shut them down,
it'll severely cut their oxygen.

kicks the fans back on.

- You don't have a child down here !

751

And his past may have
a great deal to do with our future !

752

and he's all we've got !

753

meet me halfway ? Is that fair enough ?

- Are we gonna drown ?
- No.

- What is your name ?
- Ashley.

756
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:29,901
Ashley, there's time to stop
the leak before it gets high
enough to worry about drowning.

757
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,438
- That's the good news.
- What's the bad news ?

758
00:57:32,505 --> 00:57:37,238
This water's 38 degrees. What we
have to worry about is hypothermia.

759
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:39,437
- Hypo what ?
- Hypothermia.

760
00:57:39,512 --> 00:57:41,810
Your body loses heat
and shuts down.

761
00:57:41,881 --> 00:57:44,816
You feel like you're getting tired,
but you're really getting dead.

762
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:47,785
But that's not gonna happen
to us, because we're gonna
look out for each other.

763
00:57:47,854 --> 00:57:50,846
We're gonna stay high and dry
right on this car dam over here,

764
00:57:50,924 --> 00:57:53,188

get on the car dam.

765

Let's get outta the water.

770
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:18,541
Okay, so here we are.
We're high and dry.

771
00:58:18,618 --> 00:58:21,143

In a situation like this,

773
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:26,554
it's very important that everybody
knows exactly what is happening, okay ?

774

That last thing we need
is any more surprises, right ?

775
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,658
What I'm gonna try to do
is collapse a section of that tube...

776
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:35,292
to seal us off from the fire
and try to plug that leak.

777
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:38,963
- How do you plan to do that ?
- I have to use an explosive.

778
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:41,837
- Wait, please, let me explain !
- Another explosion ?

No wonder you got people killed.
- Steven.

now is the time to tell me.

this substructure's already sustained,

782
00:58:52,452 --> 00:58:54,886
so how do you know you can
contain it to one section ?

783
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:57,218
I don't know !
I don't know anything !

784
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:01,556

not gonna make it another hour
unless I shut this thing down !

785
00:59:01,628 --> 00:59:03,493
That I do know.

786
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:06,123
What we need is someone
to go to the Manhattan end...

787

- You're George, right ?

795
00:59:29,122 --> 00:59:32,216

she wants her bracelet back.

- Good luck, man.

797
00:59:35,562 --> 00:59:38,224

to herself.

- I appreciate that,
but I don't know anything--

801
00:59:49,809 --> 00:59:52,573

to do that. What's your name ?

802
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:55,170
- Uh, Madelyne.
- Madelyne, I need your help, okay ?

803
00:59:56,516 --> 00:59:59,110

on Brooklyn-Queens.

-Open it up.

806
01:00:04,691 --> 01:00:07,592
Open it up ?
Let's open it up.

807
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,993
Okay. Still not getting
any trace of them, am I right ?

808
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:14,431
There was a meltdown on the
phone lines. Walkie-talkies
have been known to go dead.

809
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:19,803
Am I wrong in saying that
you don't know whether there's
anyone to transmit, period ?

810
01:00:19,906 --> 01:00:22,136
- We saw people !
- Hours ago.

811
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:25,905
We're gonna break through from
the Manhattan side. That's the
consensus of the city engineers.

812
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:28,174
- Consensus my ass !
- Who's this ?

813
01:00:28,248 --> 01:00:32,014
- That tunnel's being held up
by counterpoint pressure.
- I asked your name !

814
01:00:32,085 --> 01:00:35,680
Why don't you forget what her name is ?
Listen to what she's saying to you.

815
01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:40,419
You bring in heavy equipment,
cause a pressure shift,
the whole thing could implode.

816
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:43,656
- That's speculation.
- Maybe a little more time.

817
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:48,861
We are time poor.
That tunnel is an artery.
The city is bleeding.

818
01:00:48,935 --> 01:00:53,167
Look, you try to redirect
half a million people
in and out of this city...

819
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:56,072
without that tunnel, you got a problem
you don't wanna think about.

820
01:00:56,142 --> 01:00:59,202
Are you saying that because
of a traffic problem...

821
01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:01,304
you're giving up
on possible survivors ?

822

Come on, man.
You gotta hold off on the drill.

823

- I can't. I can't.

831
01:01:32,045 --> 01:01:36,505

It's like the first person
that ever ate a raw oyster.

832
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,983
- What are you talking about ?
- Well, think about it.

833
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:42,647
A person would have to be
starving to death to get
involved with a raw oyster.

834
01:01:42,722 --> 01:01:46,283
- He probably had to eat it
or die. Stay with me.
- Uh-huh. I'm here.

835
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:50,193
It was slimy. It smelled. It looked
like something out of a bad chest cold.

836
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:54,723
So there had to be that moment
of truth before he sucked that
slider down. Staying with me ?

837
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:58,168
- I'm here.
- Think of that moment of truth.
Do I really need this ?

838
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:01,139
Do I want this in my life ?
But he had to eat.

839
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:03,971
So he dug down and found the guts
just like you did.

01:02:04,043 --> 01:02:07,240
- Is that a compliment ?
- Yes. Come on. Where're you from ?

841
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:09,747
- La Porte, Indiana.
- And what do you do ?

842
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:14,185
I write. I try to get my plays produced.
Nobody goes to the theater anymore.

843
01:02:14,254 --> 01:02:17,348
- And you were going home ?
- Yeah. I was.

844
01:02:19,025 --> 01:02:22,483
So, uh-- So tell me something,
all right ? For real.

845
01:02:22,562 --> 01:02:27,397
I probably won't be able to take it,
but are we gonna get out of here ?

846
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:32,598

if I didn't think so. I swear.

that we're setting could cause
the whole thing to cave in, right ?

01:02:52,759 --> 01:02:56,627

- It's better than a blowout.
