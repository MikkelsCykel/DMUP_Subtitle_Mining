00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,148
There's a lot of good people,
just point them out.

2
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,017
There. Mr. Wilson.

3
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to mingle.
I'll see you later. Good luck.

4
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:41,724
Thank you.

5
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:57,902
So now we're onto the 3rd of 3 pieces
by Zeppelin Crespo tonight.

6
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:00,315
I believe this to be the best one...

7
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,147
at least the most interesting
and unusual.

8
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:06,049
This is what Crespo called
a head trumpet painting

9
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:08,707
or sometimes a flubug painting.

10
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,689
These were made during
a very brief period

11
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,552
between Crespo's incarcerations
and when public health records

12
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:17,068
first indicated a diagnosis of autism.

13
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,740
This painting,
lot number 21, is titled

14
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,759
"My True Love, True, True, True."

15
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,886
Let's start the bidding
for this amazing work at $7,000.

16
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:33,238
Ladies and gentlemen do I have $7,000
for this wonderful Crespo?

17
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,819
Thank you, ma'am.
Can I have $7,500 for a good cause?

18
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,970
$7,500, Bernadette has on the phone.

19
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:44,836
Do I have $8,000 in the back row,
sir, with the hat.

20
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,304
You like this one?

21
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:49,170
Let's get it to $8,500.

22
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,549
Come on people,
I know there's money in this crowd.

23
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,680
- $9,000, for this beautiful...
- It makes me happy.

24
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:03,709
But I'm going to buy the UFO.

25
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:08,421
$9,500, Bernadette has on the phone.
Do I have $10,000?

26
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:27,718
Where did you come from?

27
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:30,698
North Carolina

28
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,970
Allright, Charlie, I'll be right here.

29
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,120
Mr Wark.

30
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:52,736
Hello?

31
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:59,315
A Tweeleree repeating rifle...

32
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:02,786
I'm guess you never hear'd
that before, have you?

33
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:05,064
No sir, I haven't.

34
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,335
Well, I recon,

35
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:12,144
you never have
because it come to me in a vision.

36
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,939
Now, here...

37
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,904
I couldn't finish Lee's cock on the front...

38
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:19,558
so I painted around on the back.

39
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,938
That's General Lee's cock?

40
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,513
Ya.

41
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:26,485
Now this other one over here...

42
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,572
Madeline, he is really great.

43
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:32,117
I'm serious. We just saw...
this stuff is excellent

44
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:34,606
and when people hear his ideas...

45
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,277
Can I talk to him?
Let me talk to him.

46
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:39,261
Well, we're outside right now.
I'm standing outside...

47
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:41,903
but we were were just inside
and he's got tons of stuff

48
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,553
I'm telling you,
he's going to bowl people over.

49
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:47,117
You know what, don't crowd him, just...
I heard he's really shy.

50
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,118
Can you e-mail me pictures?

51
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,816
Find someplace, go to Kinko's or something.

52
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,430
Madeleine, this is Bill Mooney.
You remember me?

53
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:55,019
Oh of course I do.

54
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,854
I want to put my two cents in that

55
00:06:56,855 --> 00:07:01,899
I agree that Wark is much better
for you than Micheaux would be.

56
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,406
And I think that you should
come down here yourself, maybe.

57
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:08,276
Because I think
he would really be into that.

58
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,089
And I think it would make
a big difference.

59
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,167
Oh. OK.

60
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:18,269
You are so great. Really.
Let me think about it.

61
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,292
And I'll call you back. OK bye.

62
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:25,297
He says he thinks it would make
a difference if I went down there.

63
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,207
Is this the Battle of Antietam?

64
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,794
Which one?

65
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:36,795
Oh, yeah.

66
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,500
I recognize the corn fields.

67
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,501
I love all the dog head men.

68
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:47,049
And computers. And all the scrotums.

69
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,351
Away on the sea...

70
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:52,053
I fear life goes for me,

71
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,144
viewing see spray and white caps astern.

72
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:59,880
Oh! A stout heart, my love,

73
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:02,411
pray God grants to me...

74
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:05,794
and a promise
of my safe return."

75
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:07,700
You know who wrote that?

76
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:08,906
Who wrote that?

77
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:10,186
Glow-ray.

78
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,624
You don't know her, do you?

79
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,325
I've never heard of her. Tell me.

80
00:08:14,414 --> 00:08:18,782
That's because she come to me
in a dream. I dreamed that.

81
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:23,853
And I put it in the mouth
of a nigger slave right there

82
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:27,351
in that picture after getting captured.

83
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,407
Bless his heart.

84
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,287
Who is that out there?

85
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:45,508
That's my husband George.
You met him.

86
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,154
He's got a nice face.

87
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,644
Oh, he's from here.

88
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:53,112
His family lives not too far away.

89
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:55,385
The Johnstons. Have you heard of them?

90
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,866
I see a face and it sticks in my head.

91
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:00,772
And I paint it.

92
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:05,356
I'll paint your legs if you want.

93
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:06,967
Put them in a painting

94
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:11,504
Cause you got pretty legs.

95
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,177
You ever heard that before?

96
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,378
Yes.

97
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:21,814
I bet you have.

98
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:29,569
I'm not kidding,
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven!

99
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:33,469
Yeah. I'll give him a day,
maybe and then I'm going to call.

100
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:38,906
Make sure you overnight the Cheerwine.

101
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,447
Cheer, like "Cheerleader".

102
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,211
Today.
I want him to have it immediately.

103
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:44,584
It's his favorite soda pop.

104
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,838
It's regional.
You can only get it down here.

105
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,627
George says
you can only get it down here.

106
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:50,693
So, do that?

107
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:54,273
OK, bye.

108
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,514
If this happens. Oh my God.

109
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,717
It will.

110
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,813
I think I'm in love.

111
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,610
It will!

112
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,472
You gonna make her a bird.

113
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,568
Fuck!

114
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,636
Where are the cigarettes?

115
00:11:20,677 --> 00:11:21,705
Top of the fridge.

116
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,170
Where?

117
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,513
Right there.

118
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,355
I can't find them.

119
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,658
Then we're out.

120
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:33,781
I found them.

121
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,654
I told you, they were right there.

122
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,599
We're out of cigarettes.
You got any matches?

123
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,167
No.

124
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,759
Well, can I use your lighter?

125
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Perhaps?

126
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:55,532
Thanks!

127
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,630
Don't mention it.

128
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:02,453
Are you too busy to help out?!

129
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,569
You too busy
with them coming any minute?

130
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,277
And I know I can't even ask you
what's new because if it ain't...

131
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:13,257
on the sport pages in the funnies
you won't know about it.

132
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,360
Holy cow.

133
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:31,042
Did you eat all the rest
of my eggs?

134
00:12:31,704 --> 00:12:33,006
What did you do with my eggs?!

135
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,736
Stuffed them up my butt!

136
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:36,760
How come every time
I read the paper you bother me?

137
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:38,162
- Go somewhere else.
- I'm back.

138
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,747
I can't spread
the paper out anywhere else.

139
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:40,947
You got your own room to go to!

140
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,880
Have you seen all the shit
she's got in there?!

141
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,317
Where have you been?

142
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,656
Gone.

143
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,529
Did you go to the store?

144
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,494
Yeah.

145
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,612
Did you remember to get my Vantages?

146
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,201
No. I forgot.

147
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:54,827
I figured you would.

148
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:56,266
No cigarettes in the whole damn house.

149
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,026
And no eggs.

150
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:00,080
Where's Ashley?

151
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,456
How should I know?

152
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:07,300
What?

153
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:40,316
Have you met her?

154
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:43,397
Is she thin?

155
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:46,503
How could I have met here, Ashley?
Use your head.

156
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:52,032
I bet she is thin.
I bet she's prettier than I am, too.

157
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:55,036
I know I'm gonna hate her.
I can't wait.

158
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,399
Oh, did you know
I lost two more pounds?

159
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:03,679
Yesterday all I had to eat was
a hot dog with a little bit

160
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,636
of mustard and no bun.

161
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,221
I think you can tell that
I've lost some weight.

162
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:14,536
Johnny, look.

163
00:14:15,423 --> 00:14:18,166
It's got all these exercises
you can do during your pregnancy.

164
00:14:18,378 --> 00:14:19,680
It's got like 14 exercises

165
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:22,748
you can do after you give birth
to flatten your stomach.

166
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:25,350
Isn't that great?

167
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,733
You making that for them?

168
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:33,877
Yes. Don't mess. Go sit or something.

169
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:48,408
I can't! I'm too excited.

170
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,321
- Ashley, sit down!
- What's she like?!

171
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,930
Have you thought of anything? Huh?

172
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:15,205
'Cause I know if we have a little boy
that we'll name him Johnny,

173
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,953
but I was thinking that if we have
a girl we could name her Jonni too,

174
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:20,701
but just spell it with an "I".
What do you think?

175
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:22,804
I think it's stupid.

176
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:27,288
Well, so are you. You're stupid too.

177
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,853
Johnny, Ashley, Pat, Eugene.

178
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:45,137
Peg.

179
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,342
Peg. What did I say?

180
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,223
What did I say?

181
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,483
I'll be fine, right?

182
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:06,311
I'll be fine.

183
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:12,790
Was that a car door?

184
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,872
I thing they're here.

185
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,617
They're here!

186
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:18,211
Oh lord!

187
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:24,583
Damn it. Look at this mess!
Are you coming?

188
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,326
You haven't seen your brother
in 3 years!

189
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:26,963
Quit it!

190
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:29,603
I'd think you'd want to know what's
going on with him and welcome him.

191
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:33,696
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Come on Eugene, George is here.

192
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:35,068
George is here.

193
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,019
You're here! You're here!
You're here right where we live!

194
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:42,557
Hi! Hello!

195
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:45,644
Hi! Look at you. You're here.

196
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,249
- You're about to burst.
- I know. I wrote you about it.

197
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,634
You're so thin.

198
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:54,065
- Hi, Momma.
- Darling. I'm so glad to see you.

199
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,961
I thought you'd never get here.
Guess what's upstairs?

200
00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:57,771
Mr. Johnsten.

201
00:16:58,436 --> 00:16:59,635
Hi!

202
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,756
Wow, you're so beautiful!

203
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,532
Fermented cheese just for you.

204
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,395
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi.

205
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,385
How do you do?

206
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,135
Do you diet?

207
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,016
No. I run. And swim.

208
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,807
What was that?

209
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,963
I smashed your birdie!

210
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,523
- No, darling...
- Ashley!

211
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:29,082
I just bumped the wall. I'm sorry.
We can replace it. Can't we replace it?

212
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,497
I declare, Ashley.

213
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,541
I'll pick it up! I'll pick it up!
Let me do it.

214
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:34,244
No, wait a minute.

215
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:37,742
You go on, upstairs and I'll see
if we got anything to feed you

216
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:40,119
after I clean up Ashley' mess.

217
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:44,604
You still got 3 left.

218
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:49,947
No wonder he's thin.
She sure don't look like she can cook.

219
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,755
I love her.

220
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:00,731
Johnny?

221
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:08,172
I'm Madeleine. I married George.

222
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,967
You got any cigarettes?

223
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,183
What? No. Sorry. I don't smoke.

224
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,211
George got any?

225
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,633
Oh. George doesn't smoke.

226
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,345
He give it up?

227
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:33,574
I can tell you're brothers.
You're just as handsome.

228
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:36,544
He give up being an asshole, yet?

229
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,054
Madeleine?

230
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:39,293
What was that?

231
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:40,899
Madeleine, I'd swim too,

232
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,344
but I wouldn't be caught dead
in a bathing suit like this.

233
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:44,602
See, I'm about to have a baby.

234
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:45,513
No!

235
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:48,605
I am too. Any day now.

236
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,028
But I've got this exercise book,

237
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,253
and I'm trying to lose weight
'cause Johnny hates it when I'm heavy.

238
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,610
And I can't stand it either.
Do you have kids?

239
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,770
Oh no. No.

240
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:03,560
Have you ever been married before?
When did you and George get married?

241
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:06,746
It'll be exactly 6 months tomorrow.

242
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,447
I'll be damned.

243
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:14,175
I know. I actually find it hard
to believe myself.

244
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,482
How's Johnny?

245
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:20,996
Good.

246
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:24,662
He still working at Replacements Ltd?

247
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:29,222
Still there. Back living here.

248
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:35,111
It's good you come down here.

249
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:42,910
I want to know everything
there is to know about you.

250
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:45,127
I want you to tell us
every little thing.

251
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:46,450
God. That would be so boring.

252
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,178
Not to me.

253
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,139
What makes you tick?

254
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:56,315
All we got is dry cereal for you.

255
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,927
That's fine, Pat.
Can I do anything to help?

256
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:03,377
No. Nobody messes in my kitchen.

257
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:09,593
Oh, OK. Pat, your little ceramic thing.
It wasn't...

258
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,393
Are you wearing make-up?

259
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,977
'Cause, you could wear more
if you wanted to.

260
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,054
You're so tall. I'm fair.

261
00:20:15,253 --> 00:20:17,697
But, I like to experiment
with a lot of different looks.

262
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:19,894
Were you born in Chicago?
I was born right here.

263
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,640
I've lived here all my whole life.
My favorite animal is the meerkat.

264
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:25,020
Do you know what they are?
They're so cute.

265
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,251
I've got this little charm bracelet
with meerkats on it.

266
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:30,925
Did you have lots of boyfriends?
I bet you did.

267
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:32,583
Did you ever try out
for cheerleading or anything?

268
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,624
I tried out, but I didn't make it.

269
00:20:41,018 --> 00:20:42,719
I was born in Japan.

270
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,086
You were not.

271
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:51,153
My father was in the diplomatic service.
And then we moved to Africa.

272
00:20:51,294 --> 00:20:53,567
And then to Washington, DC
for a short while

273
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,677
and then back to Africa
and then to Chicago.

274
00:20:57,316 --> 00:21:01,293
Wow. What kind of things did you like
to do when you were a little girl?

275
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:02,809
What type of things?

276
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,400
Reading and horseback riding.

277
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,840
At the same time?

278
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:10,468
No. I never tried it at the same time.

279
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,345
Do you have any brothers or sisters?

280
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,622
I have a half-brother now
but he's gone now.

281
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:23,393
So that's why
this is pretty much my family.

282
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:25,939
And children
are the most important thing.

283
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,579
They're so important.

284
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:34,295
Can you still have kids?

285
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,775
Ashley!

286
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,947
George wrote that you own
a art museum or something?

287
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:44,453
Yes. An outsider gallery.
Self-taught artists.

288
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:48,340
That's my cellphone.
Don't worry, I'll just call back.

289
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:49,565
And that's why we're here really.

290
00:21:50,068 --> 00:21:55,759
We drove down to meet-have you heard
of this artist from Pinnacle... David Wark?

291
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:57,437
Wark?

292
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:01,485
He lives about half an hour away.
Most people haven't heard of him yet.

293
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,448
Anyway we drove down to meet him.
For the gallery.

294
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,294
I wouldn't think you'd have to come all
the way down here from Chicago

295
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,435
to find a good artist.

296
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:15,602
And I insisted to George...
I said if we're this near anyway,

297
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:17,239
let's come here.

298
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:18,885
You drove all that way?

299
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:23,008
We stayed one night.
We had sort of a little honeymoon.

300
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,376
And then last night
we stayed in Asheville.

301
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,822
- You stayed in Asheville last night?
- Yes. Last night.

302
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:29,276
Well.

303
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:32,634
And then we work up early this morning
to see David Wark.

304
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:34,683
And that's so exciting.

305
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:38,924
He paints mostly his conceptions
of the Confederate War.

306
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:42,562
It's extraordinary.
He's not schooled or trained.

307
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:45,510
If you get him talking
he goes off on these ideas,

308
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:47,705
and it's strange
because he sort of gets confused

309
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:50,642
with his own personal history
and that of the world.

310
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:53,186
Momma Peg does arts and crafts!

311
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:57,242
That's great.

312
00:22:57,243 --> 00:23:00,914
And George told me that
you do woodworking, Mr. Johnsten.

313
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:04,663
Just call him Eugene. That's his name.

314
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:06,025
Eugene.

315
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:10,777
Come on. I want to show you your room.

316
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:11,682
I'll get that.

317
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:15,483
No. It's OK. I like to carry things,
it's good for me.

318
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,360
I bet you went to college, huh?
I want to go to college.

319
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,584
Here's you all's room,

320
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:24,585
it's the nursery

321
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,296
You'll love this. Paw made that cradle.

322
00:23:28,297 --> 00:23:30,672
Johnny helped him.
Of course they need to paint it.

323
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:31,408
They made this?

324
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,017
Yeah. Here's the bathroom.

325
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,126
We're going to share that, 'cause
my bedroom's right through there.

326
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:41,315
So if you get lonely at night and you
want to talk you can just go like,

327
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,106
knock on the wall
and then I'll know it's you

328
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:48,248
and I can come out and we can talk.

329
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:57,916
Shouldn't I tell Pat about her thing?
I should replace it.

330
00:23:58,211 --> 00:24:00,987
No. Don't worry about it.
She's got lots of them.

331
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:03,692
And I want her to like you.

332
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:07,255
And Madeleine, you keep calling her Pat.

333
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,312
Her name's Peg.

334
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:11,305
Oh, fuck.

335
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,355
I'll let you alone right now.

336
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,722
OK.

337
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:21,566
I want to hear all about how you
and George met and everything.

338
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,420
Was it love at first sight?

339
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,662
Yeah.

340
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:27,799
Really?

341
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:33,030
Yeah. I saw him at the gallery
and a week later we were married.

342
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,116
I love that.

343
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:37,277
It's so...

344
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:39,507
fuckin' cool,

345
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:41,384
Madeleine.

346
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:48,878
Can I help you unpack?

347
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,789
There you are.
We thought we'd lost you, George.

348
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,085
Look at you! You just light up a room.

349
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,563
Hey, man.

350
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:02,977
Hi.

351
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,143
Where you going?

352
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,021
I'm late.
Some of us do real work, you know.

353
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:13,134
Where's Madeleine?

354
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,149
Sit down, it's breakfast!

355
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:28,522
Hi. If you go to the mall today get me
the Cliffnotes for "Huckleberry Finn".

356
00:25:28,664 --> 00:25:29,565
Let's go to the mall.

357
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:32,743
I love that book. It's my favorite.
Don't you love it?

358
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:34,294
No. I'm getting the Cliffnotes.

359
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:37,105
It's for his GED.
He didn't graduate high school.

360
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,084
We just loved each
other too much to wait.

361
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:41,967
- Ashley! Do you ever stop it?
- No.

362
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,340
See you later.

363
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:47,965
How you getting to work?

364
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:51,557
Norman's giving me a ride.
If he ever fuckin' gets here!

365
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:58,189
Let's go to the mall now. Let's do.
You'll love the mall.

366
00:25:58,331 --> 00:26:01,074
It's got like a thousand fountains
and it's got this fudge factory!

367
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:03,418
And it's got a Nike store,
and a Barnes and Noble's,

368
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,759
and I can show you Aladdin's Castle

369
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:06,809
which is this arcade where
I first saw Johnny.

370
00:26:06,946 --> 00:26:11,024
And there's Joanne's Nuthouse which is
where you get nuts and almonds.

371
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,185
Hey guys,
Madeleine wants to go to the mall!

372
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:48,274
Johnny Johnsten! Johnny Johnsten!

373
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:56,585
Johnny Johnsten! Johnny Johnsten!
Goddamn it!

374
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,875
Who's got their Panther pride?
Count down, boys.

375
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,121
Johnny, 200 more days. Panther pride!

376
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:14,316
Panther! Let's catch scratch
those motherfuckers!

377
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,006
Next year,

378
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:17,378
I guaran-goddamn-tee it they're going

379
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,960
to fuckin' at least go to the fuckin'
Superbowl again.

380
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,512
Guaran-goddamn-tee it.

381
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:24,422
I'm serious.

382
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:29,446
I will not get a girlfriend ever.

383
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:33,264
I'm sick of it goddamn it.
Tarra, are you in love? You're in love.

384
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:36,764
Yes, I'm in love now.

385
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:37,765
His name is Keith.

386
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:40,153
Why don't you ever bring him
around here?

387
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:42,096
No. He's a professional football player.

388
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:44,243
Shut up! What position?

389
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:45,355
Fullback.

390
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,831
I worked with this one guy.
He liked to go deer hunting.

391
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,246
He got a tic stuck on his anus.
He thought it was a hemorrhoid.

392
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:53,636
He kept on putting Preparation H
on it for week,

393
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:54,681
made it all supple.

394
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:56,481
He had his wife look at it
and she screamed,

395
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,584
Oh my God, it's a tic.

396
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:01,117
He pulled it off and stomped it
and it wouldn't even crush

397
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:03,220
because the Preparation H
made it so soft.

398
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:04,706
I don't know what love is, dude.

399
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:07,623
Man, my neighbors
are just driving me up the wall.

400
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:08,641
And they're in love.

401
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:09,832
They're technically in love,

402
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,981
but they're fighting over
a fuckin' goddamn mini-dish.

403
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:17,607
Get a mini-dish, is all I'm saying!
Just get a goddamn mini-dish.

404
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:19,274
This is the best fuckin' job I ever had.

405
00:28:19,562 --> 00:28:20,762
Shut the fuck up.

406
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,009
I tell you what though,
you should come over to the house, man.

407
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,358
I got that Superbowl on tape.
I been watching it like every other day.

408
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:28,431
I always feel like they're going to win,
you know,

409
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,648
if I watch it on tape I fell like
they're going to pull it out.

410
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:35,792
But they never do. They never do.

411
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:41,586
Let's do it now.

412
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:44,085
Here?

413
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,569
Yeah! Don't you like 'Cinnamon Fizz'?

414
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,879
We can play beauty parlor.

415
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,464
Why hello, Miss Madeleine.
You called about...

416
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:15,410
'Cinnamon Fizz'.

417
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:20,023
Don't you just love the way that sounds?

418
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:29,397
I suddenly have the urge to drink this.

419
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:35,736
Oh, that could be hormonal. Pica.
Do you feel like you want to eat dirt?

420
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:37,860
Or clay, as well?

421
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:42,773
NO! Yuck! What do you think I am?

422
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:43,774
Clay.

423
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,147
No. Yuck.

424
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,522
What'd you say that was-pica?

425
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:53,610
Yeah. You might need iron, or something.
Do you take supplements?

426
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:54,750
No.

427
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,239
I bet that's why George married you.

428
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:03,547
Why? What's wrong?

429
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:08,692
Nothing. The head's just on my nerves.
I'm fine.

430
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:10,197
I'm fine.

431
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:12,152
I'm fine.

432
00:30:15,811 --> 00:30:17,114
What are you going to name it?

433
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:19,887
Junebug.

434
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:24,994
I mean, his real name will be Johnny
but we'll call him Junebug.

435
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:28,450
And if it's a little girl
we'll christen her Junebug Johnsten.

436
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,634
Can't you see a little baby
named Junebug?

437
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,482
So you don't know what you're having?

438
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:40,554
A baby.

439
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:45,463
No, I meant a boy or a girl?

440
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:48,571
Oh that.

441
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:50,264
I don't know.
I don't want to know.

442
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,274
I want to be surprised.

443
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,957
I don't care, so long as it's healthy
and it looks like Johnny.

444
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:57,159
What does he want?

445
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:01,446
I don't know
if he wants a baby right now.

446
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,006
But I know just as soon as he sees it
he's going to fall in love.

447
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:06,708
He's just going through a phase.

448
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:08,921
I read in one of my books that
that can happen.

449
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:12,946
How long has he been like that?

450
00:31:14,631 --> 00:31:16,266
Two years.

451
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:20,550
But I know as soon as he sees that baby
he's going to snap out of it.

452
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:24,513
I think. Yep.

453
00:31:27,738 --> 00:31:29,109
What do you think?

454
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:33,435
I don't know him.

455
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,481
Gosh, I wish that
I could grow my nails out like this.

456
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,356
I'm always biting on mine.

457
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:48,180
I do too. But these are wrapped.

458
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,563
You are kidding me! These are fake?

459
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
Yeah. I used to bite my own ones
right down to the quick.

460
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:56,766
George doesn't even know.
I even bite my toenails.

461
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:03,572
You do not! I do too!

462
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,052
I didn't think anybody else
in the world did that!

463
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:10,609
Ashley, what are you doing to her?

464
00:32:10,813 --> 00:32:12,640
Cinnamon Fizz. Do you like it?

465
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:16,355
It's way past your nap time, Ashley.
You know what the doctor said. Come on.

466
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:18,068
I am not finished with her yet.

467
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,606
She's a grown-up.
She can finish her own fingernails.

468
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,954
Let me have that please.
I don't want that on my carpet. Go on.

469
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,579
Can I bum one of those?

470
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:31,239
For later.

471
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:38,355
Tah. Don't tell George.

472
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:53,681
How was your day?!

473
00:32:58,064 --> 00:32:59,366
When's dinner?

474
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:34,388
Oh God. Don't stop. Don't stop.

475
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:50,346
Don't stop there. Do what you do...

476
00:34:00,911 --> 00:34:02,213
I'm serious.

477
00:34:42,076 --> 00:34:47,596
Oh hey. Don't talk to me 'cause
I'm working out. Did you not go?

478
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:48,678
No!

479
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,952
The Camaro still tore up?
Can't you fix it?

480
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,618
George wanted to take us
to a fancy dinner tonight

481
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:59,705
after the shower
but we got the church thing.

482
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:03,544
Hey, why don't you ask George?
He could help you fix it.

483
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:09,096
18, 19.

484
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:10,539
When did he call there?

485
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:14,741
This morning.
It was his sister who's a lawyer.

486
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:17,063
Did you know that he had a sister
who's also a lawyer?

487
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:18,804
What, a real lawyer?

488
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:21,147
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Fuck.

489
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:24,586
She's definitely negotiating something
with somebody in New York.

490
00:35:25,016 --> 00:35:26,512
Okay. What gallery?

491
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,822
It sounds like it could be Mark Lane.

492
00:35:28,823 --> 00:35:31,462
Right, of course.
She thinks because they're in New York...

493
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:36,324
Yeah. She's influenced
by their highfalutin talking.

494
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:39,326
Wait. Did she sign anything?

495
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:44,417
I have no idea. I mean, probably not.
I doubt it. I highly doubt it.

496
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:47,492
OK. No, I can handle this.
I can deal with this.

497
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,695
Okay. Are you having fun?

498
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,651
It's fine. You know what? I got to go.

499
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,425
- You don't want me to call?
- Okay, darling. Bye.

500
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,316
Okay. Bye.

501
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:03,620
I think it's time for a game, ladies.
The how big is your belly game.

502
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:04,905
It's huge!

503
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:18,932
This is Madeleine.
This is my new sister.

504
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:19,834
Hi, Nice to meet you.

505
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:21,809
She's George's wife. Isn't she pretty?

506
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:22,875
That's my little tuxedo-

507
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:24,364
- Did you do that?
- I did.

508
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:28,683
You are so good!
You can make anything, Miss Peg.

509
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:31,655
Do you have children?

510
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:33,944
No.

511
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:44,660
The reason people like meerkats...

512
00:36:47,616 --> 00:36:49,181
you got 2 eyes looking right at you.

513
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:51,953
That makes them look kind
of humanoid to you.

514
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:54,286
The meerkat approaching you

515
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,682
creates a hostile defense
until it can smell you.

516
00:36:56,683 --> 00:36:59,184
Ashley? Ashley!

517
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:07,328
...help in reproducing individuals
where they're young.

518
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:12,540
Only the offspring of the alpha female
are allowed to live.

519
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:15,394
The others, if they happen
to get impregnated accidentally,

520
00:37:15,517 --> 00:37:17,618
while the alpha female is pregnant

521
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,488
sometimes try to sneak their young
in with a newborn of the alpha female.

522
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:23,808
They live in social groups

523
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:29,665
of which non-reproducing individuals
contribute to the welfare of the...

524
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:35,845
Look at these. Thank you so much.
It's just too much.

525
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:41,737
Here, open this one.

526
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:42,910
Okay.

527
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:49,885
What's this?

528
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,804
That's a baby spoon.

529
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,905
That should be in a museum.

530
00:37:56,798 --> 00:37:58,362
I bet that's as old as crap, Ash.

531
00:37:58,508 --> 00:37:59,880
Who's that from?

532
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:02,998
I don't know.

533
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:07,155
Hush! Who gave this little old spoon?

534
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,697
George and me.

535
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,784
I love it. Thank you so much.
I love it. Thank you so much.

536
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,565
It means so much that
you're here with me.

537
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,586
I don't believe
that can go in the dishwasher.

538
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,203
Thank you.

539
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,484
Goddamm it!

540
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:44,291
Hold on second. Hold on. Sorry.

541
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:54,552
Why are you swearing?

542
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:56,758
I was trying to tape this fuckin' thing
on TV and it won't work.

543
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:59,816
Well, did you use a tape I already used?
Maybe the tab thingy is pushed in.

544
00:38:59,954 --> 00:39:02,021
No, I did that. I pushed it in.

545
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:05,213
No, you push it in if you don't want
to tape something.

546
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:06,881
That's why it didn't work.

547
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,301
Here, let me help you.
What are you trying...

548
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,275
No! No! Go on! Forget it. Go on.
Forget it. Fuck it. Go on.

549
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,640
God loves you just the way you are

550
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,353
but he loves you too much
to let you stay that way.

551
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,816
Lucille.

552
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:09,493
These people got the wrong house.

553
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:13,477
We're having a little thing for Ashley.

554
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,583
Her friends. Kind of last minute.

555
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:21,332
We want that woman been courting
my brother's pictures. Is she here?

556
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:24,520
Hi Mrs. Speas! Hi.
We're having my baby shower.

557
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,964
You should come on in.
Who you got with you?

558
00:40:27,104 --> 00:40:28,600
Madeleine?!

559
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:30,647
God.

560
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:35,882
You all come on in. Sure. Come on in.

561
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:40,006
I'm Madeleine.

562
00:40:40,143 --> 00:40:42,085
I've been trying to call you all day.
How did you find us?

563
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:44,723
A roomful of ladies.
Did you do this for me?

564
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,103
Of course.

565
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:48,480
- That's my sister.
- How do you do?

566
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:52,075
Oh, I think it's that retarded
artist Madeleine knows.

567
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:55,473
I'm telling you
they're not the right gallery for him.

568
00:40:55,474 --> 00:40:56,502
They won't take care of him.

569
00:40:56,911 --> 00:41:00,990
He sounds pretty good on the phone.
Course he never came himself.

570
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,470
Right. That's why I came down here,

571
00:41:03,647 --> 00:41:06,594
because I love your brother's work,
ma'am. I love it.

572
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:09,916
They said you came down here
because your husband lives here.

573
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:10,909
Who said that?

574
00:41:11,046 --> 00:41:12,451
The New York people.

575
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:14,516
No - it's just a coincidence.

576
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:17,729
They said you was small potatoes.

577
00:41:17,772 --> 00:41:18,536
That's right.

578
00:41:18,692 --> 00:41:20,886
Ma'am, honestly,

579
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,161
- I can make your brother money.
- Dear Jesus...

580
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:25,863
If that's what you want.

581
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:27,059
Glory be to you, Lord,

582
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,819
I want to say thank you for this day
and for the blessings of this party

583
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:36,048
and for my friends
and all my presents-which I love.

584
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:39,628
And for the gift of life
growing inside me.

585
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,911
Help me to be a good Christian mother,

586
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:45,810
and to raise the child to praise
your name, Jesus. Amen.

587
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:47,329
Amen.

588
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:52,202
Sister Glow-ray from a beam
of light on high.

589
00:41:52,203 --> 00:41:57,577
For those who suffered April 15,
1865 in the Battle of Bentonville.

590
00:41:57,578 --> 00:42:02,160
Who saw the Satan Sherman victorious
on North Carolina ground.

591
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:06,212
Forever we honor their risen souls...

592
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:10,160
Amen.

593
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:17,294
Amen.

594
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:06,100
How are you?

595
00:43:06,696 --> 00:43:07,648
Just great.

596
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:09,121
Yeah? Have you been good?

597
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:13,366
My wife Madeleine. This is Mary.

598
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:17,713
We were kind of in school together.
A couple of years apart.

599
00:43:20,479 --> 00:43:23,085
George Johnston,
you can't hide from me. Get up here.

600
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:25,502
- How you doing?
- Hey, Bud. I'm good.

601
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,267
You remember Emily?

602
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,983
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

603
00:43:28,094 --> 00:43:29,829
- I'm wonderful.
- Nice to see you.

604
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,373
Hey, Pastor, this is my wife Madeleine.
This is Bud.

605
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,278
Hi. You're so young.

606
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:37,433
It is nice to meet you.

607
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,828
Look. Who's that?

608
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:52,477
Will we see you tomorrow morning,
Mrs. Johnsten?

609
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:56,829
That's you, darling.

610
00:43:58,279 --> 00:43:59,214
Oh, me!

611
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,686
You don't know who you are yet, huh?

612
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:01,797
No.

613
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:04,676
Well Eugene, I'm gonna pray
with you family here real quick.

614
00:44:04,815 --> 00:44:07,557
And then I got to get this show
on the road. Alright?

615
00:44:10,078 --> 00:44:14,397
Lord, I just thank you
for this fellowship tonight

616
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:17,918
and for the safe return
of George to his home flock.

617
00:44:19,665 --> 00:44:24,087
I pray, Lord, that you would bless
his marriage to Madeleine.

618
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:29,819
Or God that it would be
a spirit filled union.

619
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:35,077
That they would see the impermanence
of this world.

620
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:37,593
And pray, Lord God that
you would banish the Devil

621
00:44:37,732 --> 00:44:39,640
and all evil-doers from their door,

622
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,785
no matter where they are
in the kingdom, Lord.

623
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:45,837
Praise you Jesus.

624
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:48,755
Amen.

625
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:50,027
You ready for that song?

626
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,479
Uh oh.

627
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:52,950
Come on.

628
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:55,809
Kind of a big room.

629
00:44:56,247 --> 00:44:57,982
It's good. Come on.

630
00:44:58,225 --> 00:45:02,408
Alright everybody,
you all knew that we had a treat

631
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:06,021
when you heard George Johnsten
was back in town.

632
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,900
Now don't tell a lie.

633
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:10,388
Who of you all thought that
he was going to get out of here

634
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:12,296
without giving us a hymn?

635
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:14,973
This wasn't my idea.

636
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,819
Now, I know you're a little rusty,
so I want to get Eddy McGee.

637
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:22,320
Come on,
Eddy and bring your son up here.

638
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:25,835
Come on up here and help this man out.

639
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,019
You remember the number don't you?

640
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,516
I think I need the book.

641
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:32,547
- It's 283.
- Thank you.

642
00:45:35,198 --> 00:45:39,079
This one here is, he's 16.
His voice just broke. He's singing bass.

643
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:48,189
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,

644
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:55,280
Calling for you and for me;

645
00:45:56,357 --> 00:46:02,201
See, on the portals
He's waiting and watching,

646
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:08,953
Watching for you and for me.

647
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:16,365
Come home, come home,

648
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:25,262
Ye who are weary come home;

649
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:33,082
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,

650
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:37,817
Calling O sinner

651
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:40,750
come home.

652
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:47,839
Oh for the wonderful love
He has promised,

653
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:55,693
Promised for you and for me,

654
00:46:56,228 --> 00:47:02,593
Tho' we have sinned
He has mercy and pardon,

655
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:08,928
Pardon for you and for me.

656
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:13,228
Come home, come home,

657
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:18,051
Come home, come home,

658
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:25,507
Ye who are weary come home;

659
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:33,809
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,

660
00:47:34,835 --> 00:47:38,718
Calling oh sinner

661
00:47:39,139 --> 00:47:44,633
come home.

662
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:02,468
I don't think I'd ever move back
to Baltimore.

663
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:05,053
This is just so much more peaceful.

664
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:07,428
Yeah, I hear you.

665
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:11,352
Momma Peg made it.
She makes most of my maternity stuff.

666
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:13,729
It's so beautiful. Such lovely work.

667
00:48:14,441 --> 00:48:18,132
It's not much,
but I'm kind of proud of it.

668
00:48:18,133 --> 00:48:19,133
You sew?

669
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:20,946
Oh no, I can't do anything
with my hands.

670
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:23,106
You don't have to. You're smart.

671
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,622
George knew that when he married you?

672
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:30,502
Hey. Why doesn't Madeleine help you
with you report?

673
00:48:30,503 --> 00:48:32,619
She'd be good at it.

674
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,454
It wouldn't take much.

675
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:34,985
You all could do it tonight.
Couldn't you? Please.

676
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:36,751
Sure, I can help you.

677
00:48:37,442 --> 00:48:38,796
You all ready to skedaddle?

678
00:48:38,797 --> 00:48:39,927
I bet you get an A.

679
00:48:40,021 --> 00:48:41,083
Where did you get that?

680
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:01,970
Hey Peter, we're going to go home.

681
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:13,102
Come on!
You need an engraved invitation or what?

682
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:33,416
You coming to bed?

683
00:49:35,269 --> 00:49:39,384
Not now. I'm looking for something.

684
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:48,804
My Phillips-head.

685
00:49:54,544 --> 00:49:55,949
Peg?

686
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:44,315
Peg?

687
00:50:47,274 --> 00:50:49,146
No, it's me Ashley.

688
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,308
There's some 'Zingers'
on the bottom shelf.

689
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:56,822
Oh, I'm just getting a carrot.

690
00:51:03,072 --> 00:51:04,911
Dolly would be a nice name.

691
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:33,007
I turned the light on and everything.

692
00:51:33,008 --> 00:51:34,596
Are you going to go?

693
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:40,343
She's really, really smart
and she wants to help you.

694
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:51,725
I'll wait up for you, OK?

695
00:52:02,262 --> 00:52:03,359
He's ready for you.

696
00:52:03,408 --> 00:52:04,547
OK.

697
00:52:04,608 --> 00:52:06,466
You look so pretty.

698
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:10,492
You smell good too.
All baby powder and shampoo-y.

699
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,199
I'm going to bed.

700
00:52:16,238 --> 00:52:17,300
OK.

701
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,032
- Good night.
- Good night.

702
00:52:21,033 --> 00:52:22,266
- Thank you.
- OK.

703
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,975
So what do we do?

704
00:52:58,363 --> 00:52:59,596
Write a paper.

705
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,089
They don't believe you read it unless
you can write a paper on it.

706
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,075
So... a paper.

707
00:53:08,587 --> 00:53:10,151
Have you read any of it?

708
00:53:10,297 --> 00:53:11,964
Yeah. I looked through it.

709
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:14,614
Did you think it was funny?

710
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:19,706
No. I thought it was long.

711
00:53:22,834 --> 00:53:23,826
OK.

712
00:53:31,525 --> 00:53:32,358
What?

713
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:33,765
- Nothing.
- What?

714
00:53:36,946 --> 00:53:39,246
You smell like George.

715
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,599
OK.

716
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,700
How about I help you
with some of the themes?

717
00:53:53,056 --> 00:53:57,067
OK, how about you help me
with some of the themes.

718
00:53:58,327 --> 00:53:59,629
OK?

719
00:54:02,957 --> 00:54:04,277
OK.

720
00:54:07,216 --> 00:54:08,468
How about escape?

721
00:54:10,836 --> 00:54:12,538
Huck, and Jim,

722
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:15,953
are constantly managing to
just wriggle out

723
00:54:15,954 --> 00:54:17,582
of one situation before...

724
00:54:17,583 --> 00:54:18,748
Who's Jim?

725
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:22,189
The black man. The slave.

726
00:54:23,616 --> 00:54:24,845
Traveling down the Mississippi.

727
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:27,588
Oh, yeah. Jim.

728
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,387
OK.

729
00:54:35,194 --> 00:54:38,630
Well, their relationship is a...

730
00:54:39,074 --> 00:54:41,069
Well, it's Huck's...

731
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,187
gradual sort of...

732
00:54:43,986 --> 00:54:47,314
love affair with this slave
is the major theme...

733
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:49,058
Wait. They fall in love with each other?

734
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,144
No, not love affair like that

735
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:51,481
I don't think you're talking
about the right book.

736
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:52,592
I'm not talking about a romance.

737
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,882
Two people can love each other
and it's not really...

738
00:54:56,482 --> 00:54:58,262
It's more...

739
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
It's more

740
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:01,595
respect.

741
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:08,522
Huck comes to see this slave
as a real person.

742
00:55:08,523 --> 00:55:14,043
A whole person. Like himself.
And that's a new insight.

743
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:20,883
This is what
you'd call a picaresque novel.

744
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:23,735
That's good word to use.

745
00:55:24,484 --> 00:55:28,941
And it means, usually,

746
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:34,043
a main character that's traveling like
'Don Quixote', or 'Candide'.

747
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:38,607
You think I'm a complete idiot,
don't you?

748
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:41,399
No. God no.

749
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:48,429
I just don't know how much
of this book you've read.

750
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,583
And it's a pity,
because it's a great book.

751
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:53,456
And it is really funny.

752
00:55:53,775 --> 00:55:55,910
Doesn't this boy's dad try to kill him?

753
00:55:57,394 --> 00:55:58,661
Yeah.

754
00:55:58,974 --> 00:56:03,782
That's not funny.
You're doing this to make fun of me.

755
00:56:03,783 --> 00:56:08,793
No, I'm not. I'm trying to help you.

756
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,540
Let's just read the first chapter.

757
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:19,453
It actually lays out
a lot of the themes.

758
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:24,494
Are you listening to me? Will you do it?

759
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:26,542
What?

760
00:56:26,663 --> 00:56:28,467
Just read the first chapter.

761
00:56:29,377 --> 00:56:31,982
I don't have to. That's why I got this.

762
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:53,146
You're right. This thing it tells you
everything I could have told you.

763
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:58,410
I don't even know what
I'm doing here. Do you?

764
00:57:12,165 --> 00:57:16,379
It's been hard, lately, around here.

765
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:18,613
What do you mean?

766
00:57:20,301 --> 00:57:25,992
Just with everything. You know?

767
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:28,166
Oh. Did you not want to have children?

768
00:57:33,393 --> 00:57:36,740
I would have gone to Washington D.C.
In 12th Grade.

769
00:57:36,868 --> 00:57:38,277
You know?

770
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,547
Except for her.
She kept looking at me all junior year.

771
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:46,796
And I couldn't concentrate.
That fucked me up.

772
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:48,019
So, when is this due?

773
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:49,860
Any fucking time now!

774
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:53,116
No, I meant the paper.

775
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:56,380
Tell me what you're doing here.

776
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,515
What do you mean?

777
00:57:58,735 --> 00:58:01,444
Tell me what you
and George are doing here?

778
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:02,747
- Johnny.
- Fuck you.

779
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,770
I don't need George sailing in here
all-help out poor Johnny, some shit.

780
00:58:08,367 --> 00:58:10,102
No. None of us need shit from you.
Okay?

781
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:10,879
Johnny.

782
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,927
And fuck Huck Finn! Fuck!

783
00:58:12,928 --> 00:58:18,619
Johnny, stop! Stop. Oh God. Sorry.
Darling, I'm trying to help you.

784
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:22,100
I wasn't laughing at you.
I wasn't laughing at you.

785
00:58:22,101 --> 00:58:25,664
We didn't come here to upset you. Okay?

786
00:58:25,777 --> 00:58:29,969
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK?
Just be still. Sorry.

787
00:58:36,214 --> 00:58:37,344
There.

788
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:45,088
What are you doing?

789
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:50,515
Hey.

790
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:58,828
Oh shit. I'm sorry. Oh my god, Johnny,

791
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:01,672
it's so sweet almost. I'm sorry.

792
00:59:02,303 --> 00:59:04,679
What, you think I'm a fuckin' idiot?

793
00:59:04,816 --> 00:59:07,021
Ever since you got here
you've been playing me, man.

794
00:59:07,163 --> 00:59:09,163
Don't tell me
you didn't mean anything by it.

795
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:12,843
I know it when I see it.
I'm not stupid! I'm not an idiot!

796
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:18,618
Johnny, you completely misunderstood me.
I was helping you. Sweetheart, listen...

797
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,733
Oh shut up! You bitch! Fuck!

798
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,994
Where the hell you think
George come from anyway?

799
00:59:26,486 --> 00:59:27,891
He's no better than us!

800
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,356
- He doesn't think-
- And neither are you. Alright?

801
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:33,979
Flaunting around!

802
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,904
We all see it!
We're not stupid.

803
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:39,251
I don't know what George
isn't giving you,

804
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:41,011
but you want something.

805
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:03,011
Oh he taught me...

806
01:00:07,044 --> 01:00:08,044
to love him.

807
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:12,869
He promised to laugh.

808
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:35,232
He called me his blossom.
He called me his flower.

809
01:00:35,777 --> 01:00:41,171
A blossom to cheer him
though life's weary hour.

810
01:00:42,454 --> 01:00:48,213
But now he has gone and left me alone.

811
01:00:51,763 --> 01:00:56,585
The wildflowers to weep
and the wild birds...

812
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:08,057
Where would I be if I was a screwdriver?

813
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:14,784
You may be seated.

814
01:03:18,777 --> 01:03:22,594
You all, when was the last time
you were so filled up

815
01:03:22,734 --> 01:03:24,767
with the Holy Spirit
that people mocked you?

816
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,558
And said, That person must be drunk.

817
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,835
That person must be filled
with new wine.

818
01:03:31,817 --> 01:03:36,537
I think I have to confess that
that time for me may have been never.

819
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:52,766
Well, I don't like that she was
"just helping him out".

820
01:03:53,237 --> 01:03:55,544
I don't think anyone
ever taught her how to do.

821
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:56,521
Do what?

822
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:59,001
Do right. Don't be dumb.

823
01:04:00,746 --> 01:04:02,986
I like her.

824
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:06,879
She means well.
George likes her.

825
01:04:07,048 --> 01:04:08,852
She doesn't know George.

826
01:04:09,529 --> 01:04:10,659
She loves him.

827
01:04:11,005 --> 01:04:12,604
What do they have in common?

828
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,353
He loves her.

829
01:04:15,698 --> 01:04:18,040
And then she's up all hours with Johnny?

830
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,110
I don't like it.

831
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:22,993
I want you to say something to her.

832
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:28,805
Are you listening to me?

833
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:30,478
Don't be stupid.

834
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:34,587
But just find out if she
and George are happy.

835
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,884
And tell her Johnny and Ashley
are real happy.

836
01:04:37,037 --> 01:04:40,214
We don't need some stranger
coming in here messing things up.

837
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,194
She ain't a stranger. She's family.

838
01:04:45,005 --> 01:04:50,936
She's still strange.
She's older. She's too pretty.

839
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:54,555
And she's too smart
and that's a deadly combination.

840
01:04:54,693 --> 01:04:55,685
Hi.

841
01:04:58,514 --> 01:05:00,078
Speak of the devil.

842
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:05,212
So, how was church? Where's George?

843
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,682
Gas.

844
01:05:07,665 --> 01:05:08,899
He left again?

845
01:05:10,884 --> 01:05:15,067
Eugene says that you
and Johnny stayed up late last night.

846
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:19,329
Yeah. I was helping with his paper.
Kind of.

847
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:26,630
Talking. I guess that's the way
you do things in Chicago?

848
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:28,446
What? Say up late?

849
01:05:28,952 --> 01:05:30,985
Yeah. Talking.

850
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:34,204
Remember when we used
to go honkytonking at the Grange?

851
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:35,685
Be quiet, Eugene.

852
01:05:35,823 --> 01:05:37,090
We stayed up till all hours.

853
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:40,511
Eugene, nobody's listening to you.

854
01:05:46,886 --> 01:05:48,919
Eugene, sit up straight.

855
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,408
And remember what I said.

856
01:05:56,205 --> 01:05:59,483
She's a very strong personality,
isn't she?

857
01:05:59,724 --> 01:06:04,272
That's just her way.
She's not like that inside.

858
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:09,108
She hides herself.

859
01:06:11,223 --> 01:06:12,560
Like most.

860
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:21,207
What are you looking for?

861
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:23,691
Oh, nothing.

862
01:06:27,647 --> 01:06:30,995
My screwdriver, I guess. It's nothing.

863
01:06:32,408 --> 01:06:34,246
How long
have you been doing woodworking for?

864
01:06:34,385 --> 01:06:35,687
I'd love to see your...

865
01:06:50,129 --> 01:06:51,567
Hey!

866
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:58,411
Hey! You all! I think this is it!

867
01:06:59,546 --> 01:07:02,805
Hi. They're getting really close.

868
01:07:03,016 --> 01:07:04,421
I knew I should have washed my hair
this morning.

869
01:07:04,557 --> 01:07:05,357
- What can I do?
- Hey, Ashley.

870
01:07:05,497 --> 01:07:06,559
Could you cut my toenails?

871
01:07:06,703 --> 01:07:08,233
- Are you sure this is it?
- Sure.

872
01:07:08,378 --> 01:07:09,370
Let me get my scissors.

873
01:07:09,518 --> 01:07:11,220
They been coming all morning,
I've been timing them.

874
01:07:11,363 --> 01:07:15,110
They're really close. Johnny?!

875
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:21,954
Where you going?

876
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,018
Bring the car up front.

877
01:07:23,162 --> 01:07:25,000
Don't just stand there. Go get the car.

878
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,513
Hey, do you have
any of that nail polish left?

879
01:07:27,653 --> 01:07:29,424
I know I have clippers.
I'm just looking!

880
01:07:29,564 --> 01:07:30,556
What's going on?

881
01:07:30,703 --> 01:07:32,473
Your baby that's all. Where you been?

882
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:35,425
It's OK. Relax, honey.
We got plenty of time.

883
01:07:35,566 --> 01:07:38,411
- What do you want me to do?
- Why don't you got get the car.

884
01:07:38,547 --> 01:07:40,077
Your daddy's got it.

885
01:07:40,392 --> 01:07:42,699
Okay. I need my little suitcase it's...

886
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:44,276
No, don't tell me that.
I want to do something important.

887
01:07:44,414 --> 01:07:47,122
Call the doctor?

888
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:50,068
Lord have mercy!
What do you think I'm doing?

889
01:07:50,214 --> 01:07:53,825
The line is busy.
Go get her little suitcase!

890
01:07:56,802 --> 01:07:59,374
How can every line
at the hospital be busy?

891
01:07:59,678 --> 01:08:01,711
What if we had an emergency?

892
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:05,156
Breathe.

893
01:08:05,937 --> 01:08:07,467
Hey, it's alright. It's fun. It's fun.

894
01:08:07,947 --> 01:08:10,928
Just think after all this
I get to take home a baby, too.

895
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:11,762
Damn it to hell!

896
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,324
- It's better than Christmas!
- Come on, let's go.

897
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:14,141
Come on, get up.

898
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:14,978
I got it!

899
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,421
Thank you. Could you go grab my flower
flops please.

900
01:08:18,245 --> 01:08:20,015
- Where are they?
- They're in there.

901
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:21,701
I know. But where?

902
01:08:21,918 --> 01:08:23,722
By my side of the bed.

903
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:24,647
What do they look like?

904
01:08:24,955 --> 01:08:26,690
- Shoes!
- Brown!

905
01:08:35,568 --> 01:08:37,475
I'm sorry. You stay here.

906
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,092
When George gets home tell him to come
on to the hospital. He'll be a help.

907
01:08:40,228 --> 01:08:41,324
OK.

908
01:08:41,703 --> 01:08:44,879
Pop the trunk!

909
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,160
I'm trying.

910
01:08:46,295 --> 01:08:48,099
We'll keep you posted. You OK?

911
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,307
Ashley, you're the one having the baby.

912
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:51,216
I know!

913
01:08:51,357 --> 01:08:54,383
Come on, let's go.
I don't want your water breaking.

914
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,384
We just had that upholstery cleaned.

915
01:08:59,158 --> 01:09:01,729
Can you get in? Watch your head.

916
01:09:02,034 --> 01:09:04,512
I hope it's a big baby.
I want to lose like 40 pounds.

917
01:09:04,804 --> 01:09:07,180
Will you ride with your wife!

918
01:09:09,184 --> 01:09:10,680
Heaven's sakes.

919
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:15,888
Is everybody in?

920
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:17,728
What do you think?

921
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:20,245
We bucking up.

922
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:23,045
Will you drive, Eugene?

923
01:10:42,787 --> 01:10:44,225
Look!

924
01:10:44,363 --> 01:10:46,807
Come on. You'll get your one of
your own soon enough.

925
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:54,924
- Hello?
- Bernadette! Oh, thank God!

926
01:10:55,593 --> 01:10:58,499
Did Jane ever get through to you?
We've been trying to call.

927
01:10:58,542 --> 01:11:00,713
I really don't want
to be the one to tell you this.

928
01:11:01,559 --> 01:11:02,426
What?

929
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:04,507
David Wark isn't going with us.

930
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:07,122
No! What? Why?

931
01:11:07,258 --> 01:11:08,354
His lawyer or his sister,

932
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:10,028
called yesterday
and said they want to show

933
01:11:10,174 --> 01:11:11,910
in New York
so they're signing with Mark Lane.

934
01:11:12,052 --> 01:11:13,349
Oh shit.

935
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:17,673
I just saw them.
He was here. He ate cake.

936
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:19,484
He went home with all the balloons.

937
01:11:19,627 --> 01:11:22,505
He said he enjoyed the party.
Did you throw him a party?

938
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:26,447
No, it was... nevermind.
What else did they say?

939
01:11:26,634 --> 01:11:28,633
I don't know what happened.
They offered them something he wanted.

940
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,414
I don't know what it was.
You'll have to talk to Tommy.

941
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:31,359
Tommy spoke to her...

942
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:36,926
No. No. Don't let anyone call him.
I'm going to go there.

943
01:11:36,927 --> 01:11:41,349
I'll go back there and I'll see him.
He likes me. We have a thing.

944
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:47,194
I'm just going to tell him
how much I love him and...

945
01:11:49,214 --> 01:11:53,827
We're not going to lose him.
We're not going to lose him. So, okay?

946
01:11:53,828 --> 01:11:54,592
Okay.

947
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:57,379
- Okay.
- Okay.

948
01:11:57,503 --> 01:11:59,421
- Love you.
- Love you too. Bye.

949
01:11:59,422 --> 01:12:00,357
Bye.

950
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:09,985
There's got to be a cigarette
in this house.

951
01:12:14,948 --> 01:12:16,421
Are you allergic to any medications?

952
01:12:16,557 --> 01:12:17,653
No.

953
01:12:17,798 --> 01:12:19,100
Are you taking any medications?

954
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:20,403
No.

955
01:12:21,385 --> 01:12:23,223
How many children do you have?

956
01:12:23,832 --> 01:12:25,739
Where you been? Timbuktu?

957
01:12:25,876 --> 01:12:29,830
Sir, I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here
This is a non-smoking facility.

958
01:12:30,872 --> 01:12:33,838
Hey, wait a second. Hey, come back.

959
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:35,628
Can I get you anything?

960
01:12:36,628 --> 01:12:38,680
My husband just walked out of the room.

961
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:41,226
He went to smoke a cigarette.
He'll be back.

962
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,508
We have to go.
We have to go to Pine Mountain.

963
01:13:32,652 --> 01:13:33,489
What? Why?

964
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,895
- Wark's signing with Lane Gallery.
- Are you smoking?!

965
01:13:35,032 --> 01:13:38,243
No! Come on, give me the keys. Hurry.

966
01:13:38,384 --> 01:13:39,480
I'll drive.

967
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,267
No. I'll drive. You're too slow.
Oh and Ashley's gone into labor.

968
01:13:42,268 --> 01:13:43,903
They've all gone to the hospital.

969
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,122
What?

970
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:48,759
What?

971
01:13:51,452 --> 01:13:52,480
It means something.

972
01:13:52,879 --> 01:13:53,871
What?

973
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:55,169
Family.

974
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:59,138
Can I drop you off, George? Please.

975
01:13:59,176 --> 01:14:01,210
I don't understand why you don't know
how much this means to me.

976
01:14:01,456 --> 01:14:03,455
Do you want me to lose him?
Because I will.

977
01:14:03,764 --> 01:14:05,865
And they won't take care of him.
You know that.

978
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,101
And actually, he's why we're here
in the first place.

979
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,122
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

980
01:14:10,224 --> 01:14:11,252
I know.

981
01:14:11,733 --> 01:14:16,247
You need to be there, I agree with that,
but I just don't think it's my place.

982
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:17,880
I think it is.

983
01:14:25,497 --> 01:14:26,860
OK.

984
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:32,156
I'll leave you when
we're closer to him now.

985
01:14:32,157 --> 01:14:35,733
I'll leave you there
and go back to the hospital.

986
01:14:36,144 --> 01:14:38,359
Really?

987
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,360
Are you sure?

988
01:14:40,803 --> 01:14:43,077
If that's what you want.

989
01:14:44,736 --> 01:14:46,618
If that's what you think is right.

990
01:15:04,006 --> 01:15:06,988
According to my chart
and according to everything,

991
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,919
you've done extremely well...

992
01:15:27,575 --> 01:15:28,774
- Hey.
- Hey.

993
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:56,720
It's as if I have this personal,
spiritual connection to what you do.

994
01:15:56,858 --> 01:15:58,423
You know? Ever since I was a child,

995
01:15:58,568 --> 01:16:01,881
I've been drawn
to things from the South.

996
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,597
It's as I recognize something.

997
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:10,396
It's as if ever painting is
like my child.

998
01:16:10,636 --> 01:16:15,057
My own child.
It's not just a commodity.

999
01:16:15,194 --> 01:16:17,194
These other dealers,

1000
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,144
they would just treat you
like a commodity

1001
01:16:19,284 --> 01:16:23,457
and they would never understand
your vision and your mission.

1002
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,217
I believe, Mr. Wark,

1003
01:16:26,357 --> 01:16:29,864
I love your work more
than Mark Lane does.

1004
01:16:30,513 --> 01:16:34,020
I'm a collaborator with God.

1005
01:16:34,268 --> 01:16:37,525
This life here is
just a saddening well of tears.

1006
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:40,973
I got no great wish to tarry here.

1007
01:16:41,278 --> 01:16:44,633
And I'm ready to ascend anytime.

1008
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:50,487
But my job here is
to make the invisible visible.

1009
01:16:50,614 --> 01:16:51,916
I want to help you.

1010
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,353
I want to give you the opportunity
to do just that. I can.

1011
01:16:56,164 --> 01:17:00,381
There. Right there, that's
my Niggerland Uprising series.

1012
01:17:01,786 --> 01:17:07,028
Poor old nigger slaves
arising up against their evil oppressors.

1013
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:13,399
I never could draw a colored face.
I've never known one personally.

1014
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,122
I just look in a mirror
and put my own in there.

1015
01:17:16,707 --> 01:17:20,563
Or... somebody I like.

1016
01:17:21,974 --> 01:17:24,016
There's a surprise in there.

1017
01:17:24,017 --> 01:17:25,017
Look at them faces.

1018
01:17:32,288 --> 01:17:36,036
George. Hubby.

1019
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,587
His face stuck with me
and I put him in a painting.

1020
01:17:41,386 --> 01:17:46,334
I want you to tell him that he's helping
me get my message to the world.

1021
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:50,824
You could reach the whole of
Europe with me. Think about that.

1022
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:52,494
Sissy says New York.

1023
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:54,948
Okay, well, if New York is the obstacle

1024
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:57,658
I can absolutely guarantee you that
we would show in New York.

1025
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,470
We work with Mimi Steinberg there...

1026
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:00,709
- Jew?
- Love you.

1027
01:18:00,852 --> 01:18:01,880
What?

1028
01:18:02,093 --> 01:18:05,007
Jewess? That lady?

1029
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:11,410
That wouldn't be what we want'n to do.

1030
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,160
Mark Lane is Jewish.

1031
01:18:17,111 --> 01:18:19,110
What?

1032
01:18:20,898 --> 01:18:22,388
Nothing.

1033
01:18:24,724 --> 01:18:27,603
I would be your representative.
Personally.

1034
01:18:27,646 --> 01:18:29,530
To the whole world
you would only deal with me.

1035
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:31,614
Whatever you want,
I would get it for you.

1036
01:18:38,195 --> 01:18:41,881
A Barker's Fruit Basket.

1037
01:18:41,882 --> 01:18:42,882
You get me one of those.

1038
01:18:43,257 --> 01:18:45,165
I had one when I was a kid.

1039
01:18:45,461 --> 01:18:47,060
I don't know
if they still make them or not.

1040
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:49,725
You get that and the deal is yours.

1041
01:18:51,701 --> 01:18:52,934
That's all you want?

1042
01:19:04,450 --> 01:19:11,410
You promise to join me
with God's angels in my quest,

1043
01:19:11,521 --> 01:19:13,060
you done that.

1044
01:19:14,077 --> 01:19:18,191
And you believe in Jesus Christ
as your personal savior.

1045
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:19,852
I believe in you.

1046
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:25,505
I look in your eyes
and I view your soul,

1047
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,791
clear as spring water.

1048
01:19:28,878 --> 01:19:32,912
I can see that you're good.

1049
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:35,971
And that you strive for righteousness.

1050
01:19:39,026 --> 01:19:42,636
So you get me a
big old Barker's Fruit basket

1051
01:19:42,797 --> 01:19:46,304
with a lot of navel oranges
in it and the deal's yours.

1052
01:19:46,826 --> 01:19:49,697
I make my mark on your paper.

1053
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:51,675
Right here it is.

1054
01:19:55,802 --> 01:19:57,240
Where?

1055
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:10,877
There.

1056
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:13,894
Finished.

1057
01:20:16,737 --> 01:20:17,708
Thank you.

1058
01:20:19,958 --> 01:20:24,140
Didn't no one say
them people were Jews to me.

1059
01:21:21,468 --> 01:21:22,941
George is staying.

1060
01:21:34,944 --> 01:21:37,949
George, darling,
why don't you leave your cellphone on?

1061
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:40,871
I've been trying to reach you.
I got him back.

1062
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:42,781
And you can't believe,
it's the most bizarre thing,

1063
01:21:42,922 --> 01:21:45,995
all he wanted was a fruit basket.

1064
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:48,742
Well, that's good for you.

1065
01:21:49,894 --> 01:21:51,479
I know.

1066
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,916
Have you heard of a Barker's basket?

1067
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:57,195
Listen, we lost him.

1068
01:22:04,339 --> 01:22:05,675
George, what happened?

1069
01:22:08,454 --> 01:22:13,436
She didn't want the fetal monitor
and it came fast.

1070
01:22:15,144 --> 01:22:16,173
I have to come to the hospital.

1071
01:22:16,511 --> 01:22:18,281
You could have.

1072
01:22:21,455 --> 01:22:22,826
What?

1073
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:28,043
There's nothing to do.

1074
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:33,515
Will you come get me?

1075
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:39,040
No. I'm going to stay with Ashley.

1076
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,783
I guess you should,

1077
01:22:44,498 --> 01:22:46,928
you could take a cab.

1078
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:47,929
Bluebird Cab.

1079
01:22:52,155 --> 01:22:54,290
I'm going to get back to her now.

1080
01:23:15,149 --> 01:23:16,679
You got the acid reflux?

1081
01:23:30,182 --> 01:23:31,554
Don't you want some?

1082
01:23:33,886 --> 01:23:34,857
OK.

1083
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:51,392
It's funny how you're gone all the time
but you always here when I need you.

1084
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:52,835
Isn't that funny?

1085
01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:56,209
Is Madeleine alright?

1086
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:58,068
She's on her way home.

1087
01:23:58,299 --> 01:23:59,532
To Chicago?

1088
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:01,690
No, no. Here.

1089
01:24:05,361 --> 01:24:07,465
Did she ask about me?

1090
01:24:07,466 --> 01:24:09,516
Is she too old to have babies?

1091
01:24:10,326 --> 01:24:11,697
Wait a second,
that's none of my business.

1092
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,619
You don't have to answer that.

1093
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:18,709
Is she?

1094
01:24:20,247 --> 01:24:21,843
No, no, not.

1095
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:25,956
I don't think she is.
We haven't really talked about it.

1096
01:24:26,656 --> 01:24:30,701
Oh, you better.
For the relationship to work out.

1097
01:24:31,537 --> 01:24:33,307
That's what they say, anyway.

1098
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:47,004
I hate hospitals,

1099
01:24:47,824 --> 01:24:51,034
but it really wasn't all that scary...
all the needles and stuff.

1100
01:24:51,088 --> 01:24:52,459
It wasn't all that bad.

1101
01:24:53,763 --> 01:24:56,696
I'll tell you what
the scariest thing is to me.

1102
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:00,901
The scariest thing to me is Johnny.

1103
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:03,669
It is.

1104
01:25:07,655 --> 01:25:09,688
He didn't say nothing.

1105
01:25:10,142 --> 01:25:12,293
Not one word.

1106
01:25:12,883 --> 01:25:16,598
I don't know what it is.

1107
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:19,237
I think he really did want it, too.

1108
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:22,428
It's a boy.

1109
01:25:24,655 --> 01:25:26,075
You know how I know?

1110
01:25:27,837 --> 01:25:32,351
'Cause I heard him tell your pa
to paint the cradle brown.

1111
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:39,939
You wouldn't put a baby girl
in a brown cradle.

1112
01:25:43,617 --> 01:25:46,496
You just wouldn't.

1113
01:25:59,383 --> 01:26:01,187
I don't know what he's thinking.

1114
01:26:06,838 --> 01:26:08,745
It's not my fault.

1115
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:10,087
Course not.

1116
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:16,133
And all that time and all that stuff
I got and all those months.

1117
01:26:16,393 --> 01:26:18,494
It was just all for nothing!

1118
01:26:20,323 --> 01:26:23,031
And those fucking doctors!

1119
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:26,735
They think that they know everything!
But they don't know anything.

1120
01:26:26,736 --> 01:26:27,736
They don't know anything.

1121
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,270
I don't understand.

1122
01:26:40,421 --> 01:26:43,197
I don't understand
why would God let this happen!

1123
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,950
Why would he.

1124
01:26:47,372 --> 01:26:52,782
I just wanted something good
to come out of all of this!

1125
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:01,721
I mean it.

1126
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:06,082
I really mean it.

1127
01:27:25,146 --> 01:27:27,248
I bet I'm real pretty right now.

1128
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:35,541
Boy, these things
really make you think, huh?

1129
01:27:39,391 --> 01:27:41,652
You know what?

1130
01:27:42,955 --> 01:27:45,719
I'm craving some nuts.

1131
01:27:47,099 --> 01:27:50,447
Well, I am too!
And they won't give me any.

1132
01:27:52,124 --> 01:27:54,270
You want me to go see
if I can get you some peanuts?

1133
01:27:54,355 --> 01:27:56,026
Would you?

1134
01:27:57,066 --> 01:27:58,066
You always know what I need.

1135
01:28:02,951 --> 01:28:06,170
All want in the whole world is
for Johnny to love me

1136
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:07,771
like he did in high school.

1137
01:28:12,101 --> 01:28:14,254
You held him, didn't you?

1138
01:28:15,389 --> 01:28:19,875
He was beautiful. He was perfect.

1139
01:28:22,614 --> 01:28:23,916
He was.

1140
01:28:26,418 --> 01:28:27,651
He was blue.

1141
01:28:34,516 --> 01:28:36,859
You'll come back and see me tomorrow,
won't you?

1142
01:28:37,277 --> 01:28:39,219
And can you all stay for the service?

1143
01:28:40,143 --> 01:28:43,551
We want to and I have to figure out...

1144
01:28:43,636 --> 01:28:45,127
I know.

1145
01:28:46,052 --> 01:28:48,648
You got stuff you
got to get back to. I know.

1146
01:28:49,066 --> 01:28:50,767
But you'll be there in spirit.

1147
01:28:53,664 --> 01:28:54,635
I will.

1148
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:55,875
I know.

1149
01:29:01,974 --> 01:29:04,213
I don't understand, but

1150
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:06,605
you make me feel better
about things than anybody else.

1151
01:29:06,648 --> 01:29:08,921
And you don't even do anything!

1152
01:29:19,308 --> 01:29:20,765
I love you.

1153
01:29:21,396 --> 01:29:25,084
I'm so happy that you
and Madeleine are my family.

1154
01:29:25,641 --> 01:29:26,612
You too.

1155
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:35,293
Okay.

1156
01:29:38,785 --> 01:29:39,949
Bye.

1157
01:29:41,163 --> 01:29:43,182
Hey, send her my love. Okay?

1158
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,006
Yeah.

1159
01:29:51,812 --> 01:29:54,851
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry to get you out of bed.

1160
01:29:55,062 --> 01:29:56,090
Oh... well.

1161
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:59,904
I'll call you soon. I'm really happy.

1162
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,502
Well.

1163
01:30:05,839 --> 01:30:10,627
I'm just so sorry
for your family's loss.

1164
01:32:54,921 --> 01:32:56,943
Piece of shit.

1165
01:32:59,548 --> 01:33:01,136
I'm gonna sell it.

1166
01:34:06,388 --> 01:34:07,826
George?

1167
01:34:13,475 --> 01:34:15,109
I'm sorry.

1168
01:34:19,342 --> 01:34:20,941
We're going home tomorrow.

1169
01:34:22,644 --> 01:34:25,820
We are? But I haven't seen Ashley.

1170
01:34:26,019 --> 01:34:27,355
I took care of it.

1171
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:32,109
You don't want to tell her
why I didn't go...

1172
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:37,630
There's nothing to do. So we're going.

1173
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,376
Darling, what happened?

1174
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,053
Don't touch it.

1175
01:34:55,703 --> 01:34:57,303
George?

1176
01:36:00,806 --> 01:36:01,869
Mayo?

1177
01:36:02,178 --> 01:36:03,149
What?

1178
01:36:03,696 --> 01:36:04,878
You want mayonnaise on these?

1179
01:36:04,879 --> 01:36:08,021
No, I don't...
does George eat mayonnaise?

1180
01:36:08,563 --> 01:36:12,276
Lord yes. He could eat it with a spoon!

1181
01:36:16,882 --> 01:36:19,122
- You'll tell Ashley that I...
- Sure.

1182
01:36:19,744 --> 01:36:20,543
And I promise I'll write.

1183
01:36:20,714 --> 01:36:21,947
I got it.

1184
01:36:26,496 --> 01:36:30,458
She'll like that.
But don't worry about Ashley.

1185
01:36:30,459 --> 01:36:32,284
She's a firecracker.

1186
01:36:33,755 --> 01:36:36,183
You looking forward to the drive?

1187
01:36:38,272 --> 01:36:41,219
You and George play car games?

1188
01:36:43,222 --> 01:36:47,944
You know like name the presidents
and count billboards and such as that.

1189
01:36:48,071 --> 01:36:51,331
We used to love that.

1190
01:36:51,658 --> 01:36:53,792
Watch out though, he's a cheat.

1191
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:06,480
Where's George?

1192
01:37:17,074 --> 01:37:18,308
You need any help?

1193
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:19,660
All done.

1194
01:37:25,412 --> 01:37:26,976
You got another one of those?

1195
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:34,814
Don't tell Madeleine.

1196
01:37:39,551 --> 01:37:41,356
I guess she's gonna stay around.

1197
01:37:47,263 --> 01:37:48,393
I hope so.

1198
01:37:49,578 --> 01:37:52,113
I guess she'll find out all my faults,
sooner or later.

1199
01:37:54,609 --> 01:37:56,759
Well...

1200
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,439
She's got lovely hands.

1201
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,440
I'll give her that.

1202
01:38:06,184 --> 01:38:08,926
But you don't have a thing wrong
with you George...

1203
01:38:11,608 --> 01:38:13,309
not a thing.

1204
01:39:45,955 --> 01:39:47,068
You OK?

1205
01:39:47,069 --> 01:39:49,480
Oh! Wait a second.

1206
01:39:54,451 --> 01:39:56,131
Look what I found.

1207
01:39:56,132 --> 01:39:57,434
Hey.

1208
01:39:59,532 --> 01:40:01,337
I just remembered
I woke up this morning

1209
01:40:01,477 --> 01:40:03,819
and I rolled over
and I saw it lying under there,

1210
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:04,892
but I was half asleep,

1211
01:40:05,029 --> 01:40:08,572
so I was just sitting in the kitchen
and I remembered.

1212
01:40:08,716 --> 01:40:10,315
So strange. Isn't that funny?

1213
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:14,537
I have done some screwing in here,
I guess.

1214
01:40:22,221 --> 01:40:24,631
I never saw any of your woodworking.

1215
01:40:25,193 --> 01:40:30,014
Yeah, well, it'll hold til next time,
I guess.

1216
01:40:35,758 --> 01:40:36,730
Thank you.

1217
01:41:08,821 --> 01:41:10,123
Hey.

1218
01:41:14,988 --> 01:41:16,460
Fine.

1219
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:19,545
I know.

1220
01:41:21,793 --> 01:41:23,793
Just 'cause I want to.

1221
01:41:24,173 --> 01:41:28,405
I was waiting until after you got up.
How are you this morning?

1222
01:41:29,035 --> 01:41:30,131
What's that?

1223
01:41:31,112 --> 01:41:32,517
Old bird.

1224
01:41:50,857 --> 01:41:54,373
Yeah I know you're sad.

1225
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:56,550
I know.

1226
01:41:58,297 --> 01:42:01,920
It's OK. I'm right here.

1227
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:10,357
Hey, I was thinking what do you think

1228
01:42:10,501 --> 01:42:16,397
about maybe sometime later
we could try again or what?

1229
01:42:42,246 --> 01:42:45,425
I'm so fuckin' glad we're out of there.
