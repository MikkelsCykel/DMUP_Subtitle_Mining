Every aircraft that takes off...

794

Administration or risk getting shot...

And this is the answer.

A unique, man-made element.
In its present state it's completely inert.

In the process, the fragment's potential
yield is increasing exponentially.

We're now reaching the yield level
of a sidewinder missile.

[FIRE ENGINE SIREN WAILING]

932
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:22,315
Guess we both got what we wanted.

933
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,550
So, what happens to the stones now?

934
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,910
They'll be destroyed.

935
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,956
Guess I'll be spending some time in jail.

936
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,589
Jail?

937
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:41,039
Come on, man. He just saved the planet,
man. Can't he at least get probation?

938
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,355
I'll do what I can.

939
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:43,635
- Thanks.
ARCHIE: Great.

940
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,837
Because we make a hell of a team,
am I right? Except for you.

941
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,560
You're law enforcement.
But we gotta stick together.

942
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,790
And a white guy comes in handy.

943
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,589
You wanna rip off a country club,
or somebody needs to hail a cab. Right?

944
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,910
- So, what percentage are we talking?
- None.

945
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,752
That low, huh?

946
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,995
It's about time I got my shit together.

947
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,479
- About time we all did.
- I'm with you, T.

948
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,079
Come on, buddy, it's just getting fun.

949
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,119
Well, I mean, you know,
it's not that fun...

950
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:20,276
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

951
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:23,515
Faith.

952
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,709
Faith.

953
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,114
Faith.

954
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,633
Faith.

955
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,268
Faith.

956
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,829
So you guys are all just gonna
up and go straight?

957
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,150
Yeah. You ought to try it yourself, man.

958
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,675
I could do it. I've had straight jobs.
Have you?

959
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,638
- I've had plenty of straight jobs.
- Really? Name one.

960
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,239
I sold Avon.

961
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,830
- You were an Avon lady?
- I was an Avon man. All right?

962
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,150
- You got a problem with that?
- No, it's fair.

963
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:53,311
- Why you looking at me like that?
- It's okay.

964
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,670
TOMMY:
All right. All right.

965
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,630
I'm just fucking with you. But my mama
sold Avon. Don't be disrespecting her.

966
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,360
- I know her. Remember the party?
- She whipped your ass.

967
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,999
No, she sucker-punched me.

968
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,152
That ain't the first time you
been sucker-punched by a big woman.

969
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,788
You know, I think
I got kind of a fetish.

970
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,389
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass?

971
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,189
No, I said I have a kind
of a fetish for big women.

972
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,432
- Oh. But she do got a fat ass though.
- Yeah, she does have a fat ass.

973
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,989
You can see it when she's sitting
on your head.

974
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,630
I've seen it. I had to rub that ass
naked when I was a teenager.

975
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,917
You know, you look a lot like her.
Except her hair is different.

976
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,629
Yeah. I shave my beard,
she keeps hers growing.

977
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,791
- Yeah. You know what?
- What?

978
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:40,590
I'm gonna write a movie about the shit
we got through. I've been taking notes.

979
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,718
It's gonna make a lot of money.
I'm calling it <i>Sidekicks.</i>

980
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,713
We're the real stars of this.
We shot down the damn helicopter.

981
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,633
- Who's playing you?
- I've been thinking about that.

982
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:52,951
I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger,
then I saw him at the gas station...

983
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,439
- Midget.
- He's like 5'6".

984
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,397
- Midget.
- Got a terrible lisp.

985
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,994
So I'll go with Mel Gibson.
We have similar features.

986
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,798
Right. I see the forehead.

987
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,155
- Yeah. And you? Guess.
- Denzel!

988
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,355
Denzel!

989
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,796
- You noticed I've been cutting it down.
- And he's been beefing up.

990
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:12,476
- I try to get down to Denzel's weight.
- Know who'll be your girlfriend? Oprah.

991
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,551
- Big Oprah or little Oprah?
- Medium Oprah.

992
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,790
That's the one I like.
The eyes are straight.

993
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,996
- This is about reality.
- Right. Realism.

994
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,230
- Yeah. So you know who's my girlfriend?
- Who?

995
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,075
Halle Berry. And let me tell you why.
It'll add a whole different element.

996
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,959
This is an interracial couple.
She's never done that before.

997
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,275
- Uh-huh.
- Also, Fait.

998
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,750
I've been thinking about
that a lot. I'll go with Shaquille O'Neal.

999
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:36,071
The most dominating player ever
in the NBA. You saw <i>Kazaam.</i>

1000
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,276
- Right
- It wasn't the right material.

1001
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:42,035
He's gonna kill with this stuff.
And Su, I've been thinking about him.

1002
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,760
- Remember the movie <i>Sixteen Candles</i>?
- Yeah.

1003
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:47,150
- Who am I thinking about?
- Molly Ringwald?

1004
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,231
- No, the Donger!
- Oh! Okay!

1005
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,868
How funny was that guy?
What happened to him?

1006
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:54,270
- He waiting tables someplace.
- He was funny!

1007
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:58,353
- Yeah, he was. Hey, Daria.
- Daria? Who you got?

1008
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:01,159
- Winona Ryder.
- Yeah, she's good. She'd be good.

1009
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,470
- Yeah, she's good.
- She'd play a thief.

1010
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,712
She'd play a thief. She a good actress.
The whole elbow thing.

1011
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,190
Remember when she's going to court
and hit the one elbow, broke that elbow.

1012
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:14,035
- Electricity went through her body.
- She's a ventriloquist with the elbows.

1013
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,350
Now who do we get to direct this thing?

1014
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,035
You know what?

1015
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,353
We should get the dude that directed
<i>Romeo Must Die</i> and <i>Exit Wounds.</i>

1016
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,988
- The director, the Pole, Polack.
- The Polack?

1017
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,799
Yeah, we'll get him in there.
<i>Exit Wounds,</i> did you see that?

1018
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,473
- I saw that.
- The best part...

1019
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:30,675
- The end.
- The very end.

1020
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:34,799
- Over the credits. The rest sucked.
- Can't have the movie without the end.

1021
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,918
- There's no movie.
- Whatever happened with those guys?

1022
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,195
I heard they're gay.

1023
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,636
Yeah, of course. Hollywood.
