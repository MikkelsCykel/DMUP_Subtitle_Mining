00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,718
Pull them down!

310
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,277
All right! Pull them down,
all these window shades!

311
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,630
Pull the shades down. Pull the shades.

312
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,716
Pull these down!

313
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,193
Abdul, come here.

314
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,590
What is it?

315
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,675
Come quick.

316
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,795
What?

317
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,235
Look.

318
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,272
This is Hebrew.

319
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,277
There are Israelis here.

320
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,711
<i>(Abdul)</i> Come here!

321
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,309
Come here!

322
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,160
There are Israelis aboard this airplane.

323
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,430
I want you to identify them for me.

324
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,438
We don't know who the Israelis are.
How could we?

325
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,632
They came off the El Al flight!
And I will find them.

326
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,672
Collect all passports.

327
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,997
- Why?
- Do it!

328
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,278
OK.

329
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,637
Ladies and gentlemen, attention. They
want all of you to turn in your passports.

330
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,716
So, please, get out your passports...

331
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,910
...and hold them over your head.

332
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,395
- Why?
- I don't know why.

333

<i>(stewardess)</i> Thank you.

Come on!

335
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,830
Mustafa, watch her.

336
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,793
Just be quiet and
do what they tell you to do.

337
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,309
No! Just women! You go back! Go back!

338
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,716
<i>(nun)</i> Miss, did they tell you
why they want our passports?

339
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,193
Will we get 'em back?

340
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,391
Put them here!
All of them! I want all of them!

341
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,478
No cheating. I know
there are 144 passengers.

342
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,477
Ingrid is getting the rest.

343
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,956
Excuse me, miss. We don't have
passports. We're in the Navy.

344
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,275
- We have these Navy IDs.
- Hide them away.

345
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,516
<i>(whispers)</i> Hide it, man. Put it away.

346
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,155
Hey, you. Why didn't you
collect these men's passports?

347
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,238
- They don't have passports.
- You are lying.

348
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,397
No, wait a second. We have these.
We have these.

349
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,476
It's a Navy ID.

350
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,036
- Marines.
- No. We're divers for the American Navy.

351
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,879
- You?
- All three of us. We're all Navy.

352
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,669
Marines. American Marines killed many
of my friends when they bombed Beirut!

353
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,358
America never bombed Beirut.

354
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,233
Planes from your ship <i>New Jersey</i>
bombed our camps!

355
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,079
- Relax.
- Son, you're making a mistake.

356
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,156
America never bombed Beirut.

357
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,475
- Your American ship!
- <i>(woman)</i> No!

358
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,195
No!

359

<i>(all protest)</i>

360
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,036
Stop! He's a priest!

361
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,075
Enough, enough!

362
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,069
These three are
American Marines. Look.

363
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,113
Oh, yes?

364
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,990
Three American heroes.

365
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,635
From now on, you travel
only first class, gentlemen.

366
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,680
- What's goin? on here?
- Shut up.

367
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,916
- Why do you want us...
- Just shut up!

368
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,232
Come here.

369
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,237
Hold this.

370
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,830
Please, please, just be quiet.

371
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,359
OK?

372
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,835
Everything will be all right.

373
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,236
Listen. You don't have to do that.

374
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,590
- We'll cooperate.
- Shut up. Sit down.

375
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,316
Sit... down!

376
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,953
Now you listen to me.

377
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,674
Look at these passports one by one.

378
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,268
Pick out the passport with Jewish names.

379
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,595
American passports do not state religion.

380
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,870
Give me the Israelis.

381
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,718
There are no Israelis on board.

382
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,630
Then pick out the Jewish names.

383
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,878
I told you, there is no way
I can know who is a Jew. How can I?

384
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,910
Do it!

385
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,838
I can't! I won't do it!

386
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,791
Yes, you will do it!

387
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,114
No, not me!

388
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,549
Don't you see? I'm German!

389
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,192
- What does that mean?
- The selections.

390
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,638
The Nazis!

391
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,478
The death camps!

392
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,319
Don't you see I can't do
what you want me to do?

393
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,836
Very sorry, dear lady.

394
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,997
But... you <i>must</i> do this for us.

395
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,511
You claim you belong to
a revolutionary organisation.

396
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,236
That is correct. We are freedom fighters.
We are fighting for our brothers.

397
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,238
But then you don't want
to be associated with Nazis...

398
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,316
...who killed six million Jews.

399
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,396
Not enough, lady! Not enough.

400
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,988
The Jews stole Palestine.
They took our lands.

401
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,429
Leave her! With no gun,
you wouldn't be shit!

402
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,075
- Shut up, you American imperialist pig!
- Stop it, please!

403
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,350
You are all pigs and killers!

404
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,953
Don't kill him, please!

405
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,869
Stop him! Don't let him kill him!

406
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,274
<i>(sound of punches)</i>

407
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,039
You will do what Abdul said!

408
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,958
He is your new captain,
and you obey or you die.

409
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,036
Do you hear me? You die!

410
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,436
We will kill everyone on this bloody plane.

411
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,118
No! I won't do it!

412
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,119
Yes!

413
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,679
What's going on, Colonel? Men and
equipment are aboard. What's the delay?

414
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,950
- I'll give him five more minutes.
- Who?

415
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,231
Oh, uh, nothing, sir.
Just... Just a few more minutes.

416
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,476
<i>(vehicle approaches in distance)</i>

417
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,679
Colonel?

<i>(tyres screech)</i>

419
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,356
Well, it's about time you showed up.

420
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,675
I was afraid I was gonna have to use this.

421
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,153
What is it?

422
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,272
A presidential decree
ordering you back to duty.

423
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,830
And you can leave the keys
in the van, too.

424
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,916
I've got your gear on the plane.

425
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,792
General, we're all set.

426
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,878
- How was your engagement party?
- A little cut short.

427
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,468
- Bobby, good to see you.
- Welcome back, boss.

428
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,556
- Do you know who that guy is?
- No!

429
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,636
- Well, let's go do it.
- Let's do it!

430
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,913
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you, Captain Jack.

431
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,556
- Don't make me carry your ass this time.
- No way, Captain.

432
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,113
Uh... Major.

433
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,196
Yes, sir, Major!

434
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,433
- What the hell, huh?
- Congratulations.

435
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,159

Oh, shit.

789
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,236
Take off - immediately! Take off!

790
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,557
- All right, all right!
- Take off! Take off!

791
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,596
Come! Come!

792
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,189
<i>(speaks Arabic)</i>

793
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,079
Americans!

794
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,111
Look what you have done!

795
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,878
Look here, Americans!

796
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,116
- Look!
- He's gonna kill him.

797
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,834
Now your president
will know we are serious!

798
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,791
- Here is a token...
- Don't shoot.

799
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,478
...for the American people!

800
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,238
One Marine killer!

801
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,672
- Oh, Jesus!
- Son of a bitch. Let's go!

802
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,120
Come on, move!

803
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,592
Sorry I had to do it that way, boys. It was
the only way I could stop you in time.

804
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,917
- What happened, Colonel?
- 12 terrorists got on board.

805
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,636
They were in every part of that plane with
machine guns. It woulda been a disaster.

806
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,069
He's an American. He was in the Navy.

807
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,431
- Where do we go from here?
- After them, I hope.

808
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,032
<i>They're going back to Beirut.</i>

809
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,391
<i>- You mean it' all over for us?</i>
- On the contrary, Colonel.

810
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,476
The President wants you to fly to Israel.

811
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,238
Israel?

812
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,717
<i>Israel is our best friend in the Middle</i>
<i>East, and it' only 20 minutes from Beirut.</i>

813
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,994
You're gonna get everything you want
to do it right.

814
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,554
<i>The President wants those people home.</i>

815
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,274
<i>So do we, General. So do we.</i>

816
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,552
We are Americans! Stay down!

817
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,677
- Clear!
- Clear!

818
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,835
Not bad, McCoy. Not bad.
20 seconds. Just like clockwork.

819
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,155
- We can do it in 10.
- All right, one more time.

820
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:06,150
ISRAEL, AIRFORCE BASE
SATURDAY, JULY 20TH - 5:50AM

821
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,230
Hold it, McCoy. We've got visitors.

822
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,035
- Colonel Alexander?
- Yeah.

823
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,197
Good morning. I'm Colonel Amir
from Israeli Intelligence.

824
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,038
Oh, yes. This is Major McCoy.

825
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,196
- Good morning, Major.
- Colonel.

826
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,038
Can I talk to you?

827
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,434
Certainly.

828
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,199
Bobby, take over.
I want it done in 10 seconds.

829
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,799
We'll be right down.

830
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,435
- <i>(Nick)</i> So what's happening?
- They took the hostages off the plane.

831
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,118
- Where to?
- I don't know.

832
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,549
They could be spread
all over Beirut by now.

833
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,673
Colonel, I assume your Mossad still has
people planted in Lebanon, right?

834
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,756
Your assumption is correct.

835
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,238
- I need to get in contact with one of them.
- Do some reckoning before the rescue?

836
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:53,716
- It'd be a great help to us, Colonel.
- If I may suggest...

837
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,879
- They've announced a press conference.
- Ah, of course.

838
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,232
Now that they got the world's attention,
they wanna manipulate the press. Perfect.

839
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:08,390
BEIRUT, MEDITERRANEAN BEACH
SATURDAY, JULY 20TH - 8:00AM

840
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,278
<i>(priest chants in Greek)</i>

841
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,469
<i>(chants in Greek)</i>

842
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,556
<i>(shouting in Arabic)</i>

843
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,597
? Oooh... ooh, ooh, ooh

844
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,436
Move them in... quickly!

845
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,515
Bring in the mattresses fast.

846
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,911
Give them to the dogs.

847
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,719
Mahmud! Go and double
the guards. Quickly!

848

Another funeral.

849
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,473
Another Christian.

850
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,716
I was in Beirut 20 years ago.

851
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,716
You should have been here then.

852
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,075
It was something. They had everything.

853
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,875
Nightclubs, dancing, concerts...

854
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,831
...laughter.

855
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,918
It was the Las Vegas of the Middle East.

856
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,756
Beirut was beautiful then.

857
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,075
Beautiful.

858
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,159
I don't like it.

859
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,153
What don't you like?

860
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,314
This Christian place.
