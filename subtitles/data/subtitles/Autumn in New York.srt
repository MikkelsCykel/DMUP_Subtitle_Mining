00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,360
Sorry. Are you alright?
l'm getting my radar fiixed Monday.

2
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,320
-You live in New York?
-l do.

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,080
-There you are! l didn't see you there.
-You are shameless.

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,880
-That woman was 6 months pregnant.
-Which is the reason l flirted with her.

5
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,800
lt made her day.
lt made her feel really good.

6
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,640
-So, it was out ofcompassion, right?
-l'm working on it.

7
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,560
-Good, good. What about the other woman?
-Blind.

8
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,440
-Blind.
-Blind... like love.

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,280
Let's go for a ride. Why, you're afraid
you're gonna pull a muscle?

10
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,120
No? Come, lets ride the lake.
lt'll be fun.

11
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,920
-l can't. l'm breaking up with you.
-So, do it in the boat.

12
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,800
No.

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
What's the matter?

14
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,080
My God, you're serious.

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,840
lt's got nothing to do with you.

16
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,760
-Really?
-Really.

17
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,400
l can only offer you what we've got...
right now... just this.

18
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,280
Until it's over. And it will be over.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,960
l could've put offtelling you
but it wouldn't be fair...

20
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,720
l don't understand this.

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,600
How can you be so sure?
lt's only been a few weeks!

22
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,440
Feelings change. Situations evolve.
You don't even really know me.

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,280
Maybe not. But l know me.

24
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,120
l'm sorry.

25
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,360
l'm looking to see a Chilean Sea Bass.

26
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,240
-lt's not on the sideboard?
-No. l see no Bass.

27
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,000
l'm gonna kill that son-of-a-bitch!
Fakir! Did you move my fiish?

28
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,840
l'm talking to you.
Did you move my fiish?

29
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,680
Could it be this one lying here
disguised as an Artic Char?

30
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,480
Artic Char! The other son-of-a-bitch,
Gluckman, who calls himselfthe fiish man.

31
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,320
-Boss, l'm getting pissed.
-l validate that emotion. Netto? Problem!

32
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,240
-Yes, boss.
-Bouillabaisse?

33
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,120
-ln there 20 minutes.
-This pot is empty.

34
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,880
-This pot is bouillabaisse-less.
-Fakir! What did l tell you?

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,760
-You got a minute, boss?
-Yeah. Where'd it go?

36
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,640
-Taste it.
-Tumeric.

37
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,440
-No tumeric!
-How much? Three or four?

38
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,240
-Four.
-You're right. Perfect. Congratulations!

39
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,160
Excuse me? l'm here to meet Will.

40
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,920
Ofcourse.

41
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,600
l know, l got it, l got it.

42
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,480
What happened to Lynn?

43
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,400
l believe l baked that cake.

44
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,280
Light up the oven. There's
a fresh bowl of batter at the door.

45
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,120
l'm an easy-going guy, right?

46
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,840
l'm good to my staff. l treat them well.
ls that a mistake?

47
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Because, an occasion, one ofthem has
stepped over the line and said very...

48
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,480
-familiar things about my private life.
-lf l didn'tfeel like...

49
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,320
l was leading these poor
women to the slaughter...

50
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,120
-So, warning you has no effect?
-No. lt's like a Greek tragedy, isn't it?

51
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,960
Guys, l've got bad news.
l'm kicking you out...

52
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,800
so other people may eat.
Here are your checks.

53
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,560
The good news is the bar drinks
are on me. Tommy?

54
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,480
-You got it.
-Thanks.

55
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,360
Lady, what am l gonna do with you?
You're killing me.

56
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,120
-Us? Come on!
-How about l set you up out on the patio?

57
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,040
-Out on the patio?
-Before my bartender leaves his wife.

58
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
-l was divorcing her anyway.
-Restrain yourself, Tommy.

59
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,760
Eriko...

60
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,440
-Are you too busy?
-lt's frantic tonight, a madhouse.

61
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,360
-Can you bear with me 2 minutes?
-Sure.

62
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,280
Alright, l'll be back.

63
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,080
We got the heat going now. Billy? The
heat's gonna be up all the way around?

64
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,880
l got this and the champagne
is coming in any second.

65
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,800
Happy Birthday toyou...

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,640
Happy Birthday toyou...

67
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,440
Happy Birthday to dear Charlote...

68
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,200
Happy Birthday toyou...

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Everything okay?
l'll come back later.

70
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,440
-Finally. l'm sorry. You alright?
-ls that Will Keane? lt sure is.

71
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:41,080
He hasn't changed a bit. What did you
do, make a deal with the devil?

72
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,720
-l'm sorry, do...
-Come on. lt's Dolores Talridge.

73
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,560
-Dolly? l can't believe it...
-Be careful ofthe cocktail.

74
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,320
-Oh my God...
-l know.

75
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,120
-Time has kicked my ass a little.
-No, don't be silly. You look wonderful.

76
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Will... spare me the bullshit.

77
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,480
Honey, are you feeling alright?
You look sort ofseafoam green.

78
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,320
l'm fiine.
lt's him.

79
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,200
-He's how old?
-Who cares?

80
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,040
lf he's rich as well, you might
have a fiight on your hands.

81
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,760
l want you all to meet an old
chum of mine. He's irresistible.

82
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,480
He's Will Keane. And he owns
this overpriced establishment.

83
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,280
Overpriced? l can't believe you'd say...
Where else are you gonna fiind a...

84
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,080
-beet salad for under 35 bucks?
-l loved the Chilean Sea Bass. Shannon.

85
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,960
-Shannon. Thank you.
-l'm Simon.

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,880
-Hi Simon.
-Nice to meet you.

87
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,720
You too.
May l ask whose birthday this is?

88
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,520
The birthday girl happens to be
my granddaughter, Charlotte.

89
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,280
lt's not Katie's daughter?

90
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,080
You bet. She's got Katie's eyes,
hasn't she?

91
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,920
And talent! Forget about it.

92
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Do you know that this kid made
from scratch all these crazy hats?

93
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,520
-They're great.
-Then she got serious with mine.

94
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,400
-Pretty sassy, isn't it?
-Very elegant.

95
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,280
-lsn't it divine?
-You're not kidding about this?

96
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,200
Have l ever lied to you?

97
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,080
No, it's wonderful.
Really wonderful work.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,880
Do you speak?

99
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,600
-Thank you.
-So, you're Katie's daughter.

100
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,480
-You about...
-Twenty-tow and never been kissed.

101
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,280
No, l don't buy that.
Happy Birthday, Charlotte.

102
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,160
-Thank you.
-Great to see you again, Dolly.

103
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,960
-Great to see you, Will.
-Go right in there. There you go.

104
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,760
-Great seeing you. Bye.
-Be still my beating heart.

105
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,640
-Or, is that yours?
-l think it's mine.

106
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,520
He's cute but
he's a little old for Charlotte.

107
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,360
-He's simply fabulous.
-How do you know him?

108
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,240
>From Newport. He's an
old friend ofyour Mom's.

109
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,960
Thanks, Melissa. Good night.

110
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,680
When Will Keane comps Crystal to an
underage girl, l know what'll happen.

111
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,600
She's not underage. She's 22.

112
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,440
-l know her grandmother.
-Tell me you're not gonna date her.

113
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,280
The grandmother? l promise
l'm never touching that woman.

114
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,120
You know what's wrong with people like
you? Too much sex. lt melts the brain.

115
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,000
-Here we go.
-No worry about that around our house.

116
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,880
l'm on your side. l'm the good guy.

117
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,720
l'm sorry. l melt
at least 3 times a week.

118
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,560
-ls he lucky l'm offthe market or what?
-They wouldn't even look at him.

119
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,400
-You hear? They wouldn't look at you.
-You're going to do this, aren't you?

120
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,320
What is it with you two?

121
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,080
l smile at this girl, she bushes from
head to toe. Why would l do this?

122
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,920
Knock it off. You'd kill
to be in his place.

123
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,440
-Okay bitch, l'm ready.
-Not me!

124
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,120
-Can we start with "good-morning"?
-My God, l'm so sorry. Who is this?

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,040
Guess.

126
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,800
-You?
-lguess.

127
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,600
-Who'd you think it was?
-My friend, Simon.

128
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,400
He always callme the morning
after to... dish.

129
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,120
-Do you want to talk to my grandmother?
-No, l was calling you.

130
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,040
-You were?
-lgot this littleproblem.

131
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,680
l thought you could help me out. l got a
Benefiit coming up. One ofthose...

132
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,480
black tie worthy cause,
lousy foodkindofthing.

133
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,200
l'd like you to make a hat... for me.
Actually, not me, it's for my date.

134
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,120
l don't wear hats,
except to Yankee games.

135
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,680
The problem is that l don't know her hat
size and l don't want to ask her...

136
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,440
-because it's a surprise.
-Was it the woman you're with last night?

137
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,360
No.

138
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,160
Cause she had an
abnormally small head.

139
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,040
lt might accountfor
the limited conversation.

140
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,840
l could always put in
an adjustable band.

141
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,600
-That'sperfect. Wonderful.
-lt is risky doing it this way.

142
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,400
You can do it. Life rewards the
courageous few. You can do this.

143
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,240
Can you give me
a point of inspiration?

144
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,040
-Like what?
-Like an image. This hat is like...

145
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,840
Like the line ofa woman's hip.

146
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,640
-Okay.
-When can lhave it?

147
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,320
-Let's say... two weeks.
-Great!

148
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,120
-l'llgiveyou till Thursday, 4 o'clock.
-Okay. Wow.

149
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
One other thing...

150
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,880
-you say "wow" an awful lot.
-l know.

151
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,800
You're a grown-up now.

152
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,720
-When is thatgoing to stop?
-Soon.

153
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,560
-l'll see you Thursday.
-Okay. Bye.

154
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,360
Wow.

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,760
-Mikey, howyou doing?
-lcan'tcomplain.

156
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,680
You're early, aren't you?

157
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,560
ln this soup, you're
better safe than sorry.

158
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,440
-Will Keane?
-Visitor.

159
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
He's going to a fancy party tonight.

160
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,720
He's up on twenty-four.
l'll key the elevator for you.

161
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Tony, this was notan ace
Parmesan from Froman's...

162
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,120
Tony, this was more like
a pepperino from Scarsdale...

163
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,040
lknow the difference!

164
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,880
lt's difference price.

165
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,680
-You're late.
-l know.

166
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,520
l'm so sorry. l tried to get a cab and
couldn't. l took the subway and...

167
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Yeah, yeah, it's alright.

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,120
What's the point of being beautiful
if it isn't to keep men waiting.

169
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,000
ln fact...

170
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,800
l'm disappointed. l was looking forward
to at least half-hour ofsuspense.

171
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,560
-l could leave and come back.
-Too late.

172
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,360
So, whaddya got?

173
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,640
-Try it on.
-l'm soaked.

174
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,520
lt's alright.
Go ahead. Try it on.

175
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,280
You have to imagine it on your friend.

176
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,160
ls it the line ofwoman's hip?

177
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,000
-ls it?
-Yes.

178
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,680
-What a shame.
-Why?

179
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,520
-She stood me up.
-Who?

180
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,320
My date. She called an hour ago;
said she had a cold.

181
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,240
lt sounded more like
the hiccups to me.

182
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,960
-So, you mean you're not going to go?
-Alone? No, no...

183
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,920
Unless...

184
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,800
What?

185
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,720
No... no...

186
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,640
-Wait, no... wait...
-No. Forget it.

187
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,520
No wait, what were you
going to say?

188
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
l don't know. l don't know.

189
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,240
You wouldn't want to go, would you?

190
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,080
Great. Forget it. Thanks.

191
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you very much.

192
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,960
lt'sjust...

193
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,640
-You've got the hiccups!
-Are you kidding? l'd go in a heartbeat.

194
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
-You're fabulous!
-Yeah?

195
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,360
Oh dear...

196
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,200
-lt must be me.
-Must be.

197
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,920
-Do you think l'm too old for you?
-No, l collect antiques.

198
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,840
Or l aspire to.

199
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,640
We appreciate it.

200
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,400
l would love to go,
but l'm a disaster.

201
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,120
l think with a little plaster and a
little paint, you're as good as new.

202
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,880
Do you wanna see the dress?

203
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,760
There's a dress?

204
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,600
l'm curious. What made you choose
my restaurantfor your party?

205
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,360
l had to pick a place for my party.
l read that article about you.

206
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,160
-The magazine!
-The magazine.

207
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,960
-lt's so embarrassing.
-No. l liked it.

208
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,480
You don't dance. You float.

209
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,360
That's from my dad.

210
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,160
l used to stand on his feet.

211
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,960
My mom was a great dancer too.

212
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,840
But, you knew what. Maybe.

213
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,760
We danced a couple oftimes.

214
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,560
Now you're dancing with me.
How weird is that?

215
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,400
She was very special.

216
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,120
l had great parents.
l was lucky.

217
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,880
Shall we do this?

218
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,880
Here you go!

219
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,640
-Do you want something to drink?
-Yes, champagne please.

220
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,520
l'll get you one. Sit at the table
and l'll be over in a second.

221
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,560
l had to come. l work at the museum.
What's your excuse?

222
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,400
-A date... sort of.
-With Will Keane, right?

223
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,160
-Yeah, do you know him?
-Only by reputation.

224
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,000
-l'm Lisa Biloy.
-l'm Charlotte.

225
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,920
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

226
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,800
What's he like?

227
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,440
Damn it, l see a huge donor
disappearing. l gotta go.

228
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,400
-Enjoy yourself.
-Yes, you too.

229
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,880
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

230
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,680
-Who was that?
-Lisa somebody.

231
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,320
-Here's to...
-Us!

232
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,960
Some people star to fall
into recognizable patterns.

233
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,720
The next step is that... immediately...
you know people...

234
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,520
inside. And if it's a woman...
it's a romance, forget it. lt'sjust...

235
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,320
this majorly chilling effect'cause
you know exactly in the beginning...

236
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,240
what's going to happen in the end.

237
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,960
What l like about you is l fiind you...
completely unprecedented...

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,800
and therefore, utterly unpredictable.

239
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,520
God! That must be a relief.

240
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,440
What?

241
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,240
To fiinally deliver that speech to a
woman and have it apply to there.

242
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Because, coincidentally,
l am all those things you just said.

243
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,920
-Yes.
-And so much more.

244
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,760
My yoga teacher calls me a "unique".

245
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,680
-Come again?
-A unique.

246
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,560
A unique. He's a very wise man.
Are you sure he's not hitting on you?

247
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,320
lt's a woman! You are what
she would call a "typical".

248
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,240
-Really?
-Yes! Really.

249
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,000
l can prove it too.
You want me to?

250
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,920
-Okay, try.
-Alright...

251
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,760
Come here.

252
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,480
l'm serious.

253
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,360
Closer.

254
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,160
Closer...

255
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,920
Close enough?

256
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,680
Yes. l was hoping
gravity would do the rest.

257
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Maybe l am a "typical".

258
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,680
We should go.

259
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,080
l can smell the rain.

260
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,800
When did l learn how to do that?

261
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,440
What should we do, Will...

262
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,200
with this moment that we're in?

263
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,440
Do you look guilty.

264
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,360
l'm thinking.

265
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,160
-You hungry?
-Yep.

266
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,680
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it was bad manners...

267
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,480
to stare at a girl
while she's eating like a pig?

268
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,920
This isn't right.

269
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,720
You... you are...

270
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,600
Young.

271
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,480
Yes, and l am...

272
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,400
Old.

273
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
-Older.
-Much older.

274
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,240
Alright, much older.

275
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,840
The point is... l could put this off,
but l genuinely like you.

276
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,640
l want to be clear from the start, so
there's no confusion later on, okay?

277
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,400
What l want to say to you is that...

278
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,240
all l'm able to offer you...

279
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,040
is this... what we have right now.
Nothing more.

280
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,920
Until it ends.

281
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,720
What l mean is..

282
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,600
we have no future.

283
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,440
l know.

284
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,080
l'm sick.

285
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,880
What do you mean?

286
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,760
lt's my heart.

287
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,560
Nobody even thought l'd last this long.

288
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,320
l could've put offtelling you but...

289
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,200
l genuinely like you.

290
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,040
l wanted to be clear
rightfrom the start...

291
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,840
so there was no chance
for any confusion later.

292
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,560
She's the perfect woman. Young,
beautiful and on her way out.

293
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,400
-Notfunny, John.
-l know it's not. lt's sad.

294
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,240
-She's so young.
-No, l mean you're sad.

295
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,120
Even this, as far as it's gone.
You shouldn't be doing this.

296
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,000
-Why not?
-'Cause it's out ofwhack.

297
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,880
lt doesn'tfeel totally out ofwhack.

298
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,720
lt doesn'tfeel totally out ofwhack
to you because you're looking at her.

299
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,560
l'm looking at you and it's fucked.
There ain't a right angle in it.

300
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,360
Alright... l end it.

301
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,240
l don't know.

302
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,120
Make up your mind!
What do you want me to do?

303
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,920
l don't know. Maybe it's a good thing.
Maybe it makes a sad girl happy and

304
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,600
a desperate guy think. Anyway you look
at it, one thing... treat her nice.

305
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,480
What do you mean, "desperate"?

306
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,360
Treat her nice.

307
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:47,920
-Well, well...
-Well, well...

308
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,840
She'll be right down.

309
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,680
She's upstairs, gilding the lily,
so to speak.

310
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,480
-He's here!
-l'm coming!

311
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,360
Now, come on. Do come in.

312
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,280
These are for you, Dolly.

313
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,160
Thank you very much.

314
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,000
They are "Loverly".

315
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,840
Aren't they... lovely?

316
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,640
Care for a "cock-i-tail"?

317
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,560
-Yeah, sure.
-Scotch?

318
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,440
-Neat, please.
-My kind ofguy.

319
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,200
Sorry about the mess.
My maid died 14 years ago...

320
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,040
and l have found it absolutely
impossible to replace her.

321
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,800
What can l say, Will?
Time is a thief.

322
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,560
One day, you're rich as an Arab.

323
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,320
Next day, you're lucky
ifyou can afford pistachio nuts.

324
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,640
lt's funny. Most of us are young for
what? About a minute and a half?.

325
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,400
Not Katie.
Katie will be young forever.

326
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,240
So will the guy she married.

327
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,080
l console myself
with that idea sometimes.

328
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,680
Who'd have thought
what time had in store for her.

329
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,480
l'm sorry. l should have
called after the accident.

330
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,400
Then, on the other hand...

331
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,200
time is in love with some people.

332
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,080
Like you, for instance.

333
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,960
You look exactly the same!

334
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,840
-Please...
-Handsome as ever.

335
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,600
And up to your old tricks...
looks like to me.

336
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,400
-Look, Dolly...
-Leave her alone!

337
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,280
She's sick.

338
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,120
Will, she's really sick.

339
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,680
-What are you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

340
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,560
Just how much you look
like your mom, is all.

341
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,440
Yes... Yes, you do.

342
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,320
Are you ready?

343
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,080
Yes. Bye Dolly.

344
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,960
Don't listen to her.

345
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,880
Have fun!

346
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,360
You gotta look on the bright side.
lf l wasn't sick...

347
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,200
this would not work. There is no way
that we would be sitting here.

348
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,080
We're totally wrong for each other.

349
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,920
We're totally wrong for each other.
l know. l could be your father.

350
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,720
l prefer, Uncle.

351
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,520
Do you think we should break this off?.

352
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,160
Afraid you mightfeel something?

353
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,840
Well, look at it this way.

354
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,720
We can have it real,
which we both know is way better.

355
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,600
You wouldn't have
to pay full price...

356
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,520
because, in a year or so...

357
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,240
l'd bejust a sob story
you could use to bag more chicks.

358
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,080
That is a pathetic characterization.

359
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,960
l don't know. l don't accept that.

360
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,800
The stench oftruth.

361
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,080
"O world, l cannot hold
thee close enough!

362
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,920
Thy winds, they wide grey skies!

363
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Thy mists, that roll and rise!"

364
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,520
lt does feel like rain. You wanna get a
cup ofcoffee, and go to the West side?

365
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,400
No, no. You'd abandon the universe...

366
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,120
and me for a cafe late? No, let's not do
it. Let's not do no thoughtless thing.

367
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,680
We can't talk about
he fact that you're sick?

368
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,520
l'm right here, right now.

369
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,440
Let's talk about you.

370
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,320
-Come on, 49 years...
-48!

371
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,080
All right, 48 years. Come on,
tell me about it. Give it. Share it.

372
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,720
You look at me in a way
that l haven't quite earned.

373
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,600
Then earn it.

374
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,480
Earn it, please.

375
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,360
What do you want me to do?

376
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,280
l'm yours. What is it?

377
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,040
What are you doing?

378
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,960
l'm keeping it.

379
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,760
-This is my watch.
-Yep.

380
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,560
-When do l get it back?
-When you forget that l have it.

381
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,960
Mix this up a little bit...

382
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,840
Sorry...

383
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,640
What?

384
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,560
Your mother used to do that.

385
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,480
-Really?
-Yep.

386
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,280
That's how we met. l was a waiter...

387
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,080
at the Beach Club. Whenever l'd pass
with a tray, she's steal the garnish.

388
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,000
What else did she do?

389
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,880
What do you mean?

390
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,760
l don't know. Little things.

391
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,560
She'd eat her ice cream with a fork.

392
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,480
-Really?
-Really. Yeah.

393
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,280
She wrote great letters...

394
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,160
But she couldn't spell.

395
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,680
She was a McGovern Democrat
but incredibly snobbish.

396
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,600
She hummed all the time.

397
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,400
And Stephen Stills was
her favorite singer.

398
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,320
Who?

399
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,200
Never mind.

400
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,080
What's else?

401
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,960
Considering the times...
she was actually...

402
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,680
pretty straight. l think
she only tried drugs once.

403
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,600
There was a lifeguard
who gave her a hash brownie.

404
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,520
She threw it up all over him.

405
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,280
She laughed just like that.

406
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,080
Words and poetry is what she loved.

407
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,960
She was a "unique".

408
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,640
Okay, you guys.

409
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,440
How about a toast?

410
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,360
Welcome to Charlotte.

411
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,240
Welcome.

412
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Cheers! Thanks, you guys.

413
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,520
You know, call me crazy... but l could
swear your friends like me more...

414
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,440
-than they like you.
-That's altogether possible.

415
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,200
-My friends defiinitely like me more.
-What's your point?

416
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,040
That l'm way outfront
in the love race.

417
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,880
-What? Love is not a race.
-Our love is.

418
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,720
-Our love?
-Yes, we're going for it, aren't we?

419
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,640
Why not?

420
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,360
-Alright, l have to tell you something.
-What?

421
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,160
l never had a date for the benefiit.

422
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,080
-Really?
-Yeah.

423
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,960
l was kind ofwondering about that.

424
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,800
-l made that hatfor myself?.
-Yes.

425
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,640
-You bought that dress for me?
-Yeah.

426
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,440
You did all that so you could
get a hold of me and muss me up?

427
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,360
Yes.

428
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,120
First ofall, you have great taste
because that dress was amazing.

429
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,960
-Thank you.
-And second, you didn't have to lie.

430
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,800
lfyou wanted to seduce me,
all you had to do was ask.

431
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,680
That's not seducing,
that is asking.

432
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,400
Besides - l don't know why - but women
seem to love it when you lie to them.

433
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,240
There isn't a lie in the world
l'd rather hear than the truth.

434
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,080
There she goes again, stepping out
on me and breaking my heart.

435
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,000
Even he likes me more.

436
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,880
You're fiired.

437
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,720
-Come on, it'sjust...
-No! Ouch! Ouch!

438
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,200
l can't believe this!

439
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,720
Breathe, breathe.

440
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,440
Breathe... are you alright?

441
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,920
That's not accurate. Neuroblastoma is a
soft-tissue malignancy, but not a cancer.

442
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,720
Most common in children.
Very rare in young adults.

443
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,560
ln Charlotte's case...
the tumor is in her chest cavity.

444
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,400
lt's growing rapidly, it's proved
resistant to both the radiation...

445
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,240
-and the chemotherapy.
-What about alternative therapies?

446
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,160
Eastern medicine...?

447
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,960
You don't hum this away.

448
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,760
Charlotte is the expert in that area.

449
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,560
Eventually, she'll be treated for pain.

450
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,360
l suppose, as a fiinal effort...
surgery could become on option.

451
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,200
But it's risky. So risky that
Charlotte has signed a directive...

452
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,040
forbidding it,
or any other form...

453
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,920
of heroic intervention.

454
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,840
All right.

455
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,360
Doyou have any idea...
about time?

456
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,120
Ayear. Maybe ayear, atbest.

457
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,640
Real charmer, isn't she?

458
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,320
How are you on
Cambodian money units?

459
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,960
-Are you okay there?
-Yes, thank you.

460
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,360
That's incredible.

461
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,240
Doesn't it look exactly like
something she would have worn?

462
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,160
Who?

463
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,920
"Hope is a thing with feathers
That perches in the soul."

464
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,880
Woody Allen?

465
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,520
Emily Dickinson! Only the greatest
poet ever! Uncultured swine.

466
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,320
We all have our areas. l'm a food guy.
Why don't you ask me aboutfood.

467
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,040
Why are you the food guy?
What is it about the food?

468
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,960
Food... food is the only...

469
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,680
beautiful thing that truly nourishes.

470
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,560
ls that a quote?

471
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,360
That's me.

472
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,640
-Excuse me? Excuse me?
-Yes.

473
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,520
The woman whojust passed
by here and went in the door...?

474
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,400
-Yes?
-lt's not Lisa, is it?

475
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,280
-Yes.
-Lisa Tyler?

476
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,240
Yes.

477
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,960
Could you...?

478
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,800
No. Thanks.

479
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,760
-Hello. Come in.
-Oh, you look so great.

480
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,680
-Where are the girls?
-They're upstairs.

481
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,600
l'm going to run up and say hi.

482
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,480
You're a dog. Oh, man!

483
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,320
There's stuff... in the kitchen.

484
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,160
You want to give the can out to the
trick-or-treaters... when they come?

485
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,040
One, two, three, go! Go!

486
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,840
Ricky, don't laugh, or you're
going to get snot in the water.

487
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,560
-Snot? Where is this snot in the water?
-Can l get you a bone or something?

488
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,360
Don't bite anything
that's not an apple.

489
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,880
Guess who?

490
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,640
-lt's Wonder Woman.
-No.

491
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,520
-Get your hands out ofthere.
-l got it!

492
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,440
-We got the champ!
-Let me give you a hint.

493
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,200
l was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

494
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,040
-lt couldn't be Lynn McHale.
-God! You are really bad!

495
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,960
Lynn! l can't believe it!

496
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,840
-Where are the kids?
-Upstairs in their room.

497
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,720
Keep bobbing for apples in there.

498
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,560
-Just one more.
-Please...?

499
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,440
But then you're going to have to promise
you're going to get in yourjammies.

500
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,360
-Yes.
-You promise?

501
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,200
Which one?

502
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,000
l know, "Butterflies".

503
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,840
"Two butterflies... went out at noon..."

504
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,680
"And waltzed above a stream..."

505
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:47,360
"Then stepped straight through the
fiirmament... and rested on a beam."

506
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:54,080
"And then together bore away...
upon a shining...sea."

507
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,880
"Though never yet, in any port...

508
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,760
their coming mentioned me..."

509
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,520
ln my day, you bobbed for the apple...
may there's a nickel in it but...

510
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,320
you eat the apple! Your little animals,
grab the coin and run for the door.

511
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,160
-They're offto by crack.
-Defiinitely.

512
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,960
-Where's my little puppy dog?
-l think he's upstairs.

513
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,440
-There you are.
-Hi.

514
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,280
We werejust up on
the roofchecking out...

515
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,040
-The kids are sleeping.
-John's got this amazing set-up there.

516
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,000
Lynn, l want you to meet Charlotte.

517
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,760
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

518
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,240
Something tells me
you're upset with me.

519
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,120
What is it?

520
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,880
l wasjust wondering if...

521
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,680
ifyou had sex with that woman?

522
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,360
With Lynn?
Ever?

523
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,080
-The answer to that is kind ofobvious.
-She's an old girlfriend.

524
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,880
-You knew that.
-l meant... tonight.

525
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,680
-On the roof.
-You're not serious?

526
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:07,400
You are serious. no!
No, ofcourse not.

527
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,240
First off, it's... it's not
exactly my style. Second...

528
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,120
You have a girlfriend.

529
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,040
lsn't thatfor me to say?

530
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,720
As far as Lynn goes, why would l do
that? lt doesn't make any sense.

531
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,520
l know. l mean,
that's what l was thinking...

532
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:35,240
we're... so happy...
What would be his reason?

533
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,040
l thought, God, if he did do it,
then you'd at least look... guilty.

534
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,880
And you don't.
You look totally relaxed.

535
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,760
You look more relaxed...
than before the party started.

536
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,680
Well... there you go.

537
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,480
But, you're a womanizer.

538
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,360
You were a womanizer.

539
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,120
-What is that exactly?
-Here we go.

540
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,920
That's a guy who has sex with a lot of
women and is good at lying about it.

541
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,640
Yes. But in this case l don't have
anything to lie about. Nothing happened!

542
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,240
There's something about being sick...
in my heart.

543
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,040
lt's like l can feel every beat.

544
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,600
l'll know ifyou're lying.

545
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,160
Oh, God!

546
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,960
Oh, my God!

547
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,400
-Can you pull over, please?
-Don't do this.

548
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:17,840
-Charlotte! Charlotte!
-What?!

549
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,520
Look, l never pretended to be...
what l'm not.

550
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,440
-Why?!
-Why?!

551
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,360
All right, fiine, why? Why?

552
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,160
Because l felt like it.

553
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,000
Because nothing stopped me!

554
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,840
What about love?

555
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,520
Why do you have to be sojuvenile?!
lt was nothing.

556
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,400
lt was nothing! lt meant nothing!

557
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,280
lf l could be different... l would.

558
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,160
What about love?

559
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,800
You know what?

560
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,560
This was all wrong. This was a mistake,
rightfrom the beginning.

561
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,440
You're a kid... l'm a creep.

562
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,280
You've got better things to do with
your last... with your time...

563
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,080
then spend it with a man like me.

564
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,240
Look who's here.
The Belle ofAmherst.

565
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,520
l've seen thatface before.

566
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,320
-You have?
-On several... occasions.

567
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,160
All for the same reason.

568
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,960
You said Mom and Will
werejustfriends.

569
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,680
They were friends.
But she wasjust nuts about him.

570
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,520
She never slept with him.

571
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,360
Maybe because she was
an old-fachioned girl.

572
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,240
But she was smart.

573
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,040
She made the big mistake.
She told him how she really felt.

574
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,840
lt was up in Newport at the club.

575
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,720
Labor Day weekend.
Big clam bake.

576
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,560
Well, what happened?

577
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:38,200
Next thing you knew, he was knocking
up Millie What's-her-name in a cabana.

578
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,040
-Millie?
-Your mother's doubles partner.

579
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,840
Why didn't you tell me any ofthis?

580
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,600
-You know, you could have warned me.
-l could have. But l didn't.

581
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,400
You never talk to me.
You never tell me what to do.

582
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,160
Charlotte, take a good look at me.

583
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,960
You want me to tell you what to do?

584
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,760
Yes! You're my family!

585
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,640
You're my family.

586
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,440
You're supposed to take care of me.

587
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,640
-Where you been?
-Home.

588
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,520
-l called you ten times.
-l had the ringer off.

589
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,360
-l don't get it.
-What's to get? l was hanging out.

590
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,160
-Something happen at my party?
-You were there. We had a good time.

591
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,080
-Come on! What's going on?
-Nothing!

592
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,960
What is it, something with Charlotte?

593
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,800
-We called it quits.
-You're shittin'me!

594
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,640
lt's not exactly we called it quits,
it was a more of, she called it quits.

595
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,520
-What did you do?
-What do you mean...?

596
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,440
-What did you do?
-What did l...?

597
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,360
Don't bullshit me. What did you do?

598
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,160
l had sex with Lynn McHale
up on your roof.

599
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,040
You're kidding me.

600
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,760
No, l'm not kidding you.

601
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,600
Charlotte found out.
Now she's gone. Totally.

602
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,440
l'm really sorry you did that.

603
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,320
l blew it.

604
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,200
You can't get her back?

605
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,040
-l blew it.
-So?

606
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,840
So, l just go back to the way l was.

607
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,680
How are you going to do that?

608
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,360
lt wasjust going to get worse.

609
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,120
The more attachment on both sides,
leading to what?

610
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,880
lt's now or later, right?

611
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,720
l leave her a few months
from now, she...

612
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,520
No, this is better.
This is much better.

613
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,080
l wish the fuck l'd never met her.

614
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,680
l hate to tell you, but there's
only two kinds of love stories.

615
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,560
Boy loses girl.
Girl loses boy.

616
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,440
That's it. Somebody
always gets left behind.

617
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,240
Try and avoid that, you'll end up an
old man toasting yourselfat Christmas.

618
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,160
-Listen to me...
-l don't care!

619
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,920
-you're going to die in your own arms!
-l don't care! l want it over with now!

620
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,160
-Mr. Keane.
-Good night, Michael.

621
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,920
You've got a visitor.
She's been waiting almost an hour.

622
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,200
Lisa!

623
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:31,720
-Sorry to disappoint you.
-No... you surprised me, that's all.

624
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,560
Did you get my letter?

625
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,280
What did you do with it, burn it?

626
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,120
l read it.

627
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,600
-Do you want to come upstairs?
-No, thank you. l'm sorry.

628
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,440
l didn't plan this.
l didn't plan to come.

629
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,280
Peter, my husband
thought it was pointless.

630
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,080
But, as it turns out,
l'm pregnant... just a few months.

631
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,840
-Lisa! Congratulations! That's great.
-Thank you.

632
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,640
Anyway, that made me want to meet you.

633
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,360
l've been a little sentimental
about parenthood lately.

634
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:33,080
-Do you consider me your parent?
-ln a lousy absentee sort ofway, yeah.

635
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:40,760
-So, how... how is Millie? Your mother?
-She's great. She's good.

636
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:46,520
Well, she's a nut. She went to Costa
Rica last summer with some guy.

637
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,360
He owns a charter airline
and wears sunglasses indoors.

638
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,240
l think he's a gun runner, but...

639
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,040
-Do you really care?
-No. No.

640
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,920
l guess not.

641
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,600
What about you? How long
have you lived in the city?

642
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,440
Just a few months.
We moved from Austin.

643
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,240
lfyou hadn't been on that magazine...

644
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:22,960
l might not have recognized you. l only
have one photograph and it's ancient.

645
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,800
l have one picture ofyou, too.

646
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,520
Just one. Your mother sent me one...
a long time ago.

647
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,320
You must have been about twelve.

648
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,200
You had a horse.

649
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,960
Summer camp. My teeth are
bigger than the horse's.

650
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,720
-l hated that picture. l hate it.
-l don't. You were very beautiful.

651
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,520
And you... haven't changed a bit.

652
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,720
-l should go.
-Why?

653
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:24,320
l reallyjust wanted to meet you.
And maybe...

654
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,120
-l don't know.
-What? Tell me.

655
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,920
lt's not big deal. l've always had a
fantasy that you were looking for me.

656
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,760
And all you really wanted was
to say that you were sorry.

657
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,160
Lisa, l am.

658
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,440
Hey, can l... Can l call you?

659
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,920
How did you get in here?

660
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,720
Dolly.

661
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,520
Would you mind leaving now, please?

662
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,280
l need to talk to you.

663
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,120
l think you've wasted
enough of my time.

664
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,680
What l did was... very wrong.

665
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,360
And stupid.

666
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,000
l have no excuses...

667
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,680
l did what l did because...

668
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:27,480
-l was scared.
-You were a coward!

669
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,080
Can you forgive me?

670
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,920
You betrayed me! For what?
Because you got the shakes?

671
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,720
-l was scared.
-You don't think l'm scared?!

672
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,560
You don't think l'm hanging onto
my courage by my fiingernails!

673
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,360
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
Get out of here!

674
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,160
Just go!

675
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,000
You're not good enough.

676
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:06,840
l know... l know l'm not.

677
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,600
l just...

678
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,280
Can you let me love you?

679
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,040
Please.

680
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,880
Please. Please...

681
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,760
Please let me try again.

682
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,600
l'm so tired.

683
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:58,560
"The stars are as soft
as flowers and as near."

684
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:05,240
"The hills are webs ofshadow..."

685
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,000
"...slowly spun."

686
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,840
"No separate leafor single blade...
All blend into one."

687
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,880
l love you.

688
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,040
We did it... that was great.

689
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,920
-Bye!
-Bye!

690
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,680
Are you jealous?

691
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,480
-You think...? l am notjealous!
-Yes you are!

692
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:39,240
Do l look jealous? l am notjealous.
l'm a littlejealous.

693
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,960
-Wait, check me out.
-Excellent! Go! Go! Go!

694
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,800
Judges give it a ten!
A perfect ten!

695
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,680
Charlotte!

696
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,160
Doctor!

697
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,080
-Mr. Keane...
-Tell me.

698
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,920
The repeat MRl and CAT scan
show interval progression.

699
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,840
-The tumor's grown.
-Yes.

700
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,640
Considerably. lt's begun to obstruct
the outflow from her heart.

701
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,480
l'm sorry, l wish there was...

702
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,280
There's very little we can do.
We may be talking about weeks.

703
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,200
-Weeks?
-l'm sorry.

704
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,080
-You said she had a year!
-No, l said a year at best.

705
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,000
That's not good enough!
You said a year!

706
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,840
-l want to have a year!
-This is inappropriate.

707
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,720
Alright, sorry, sorry.

708
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,520
You said there would be
a point when surgery...

709
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,360
-might be an option.
-lf Charlotte agrees to it.

710
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:50,200
Let's assume that she did. When
would this operation take place?

711
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,080
When it's clear we're losing her.

712
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,760
-Would you perform it?
-l am not a surgeon.

713
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:03,600
The point is notfiinding someone
who's qualifiied.

714
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,440
lt's fiinding someone who's qualifiied
who is willing to do the operation.

715
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,240
-Hey!
-Hey.

716
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,120
-How are you? You okay?
-Yes.

717
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,960
-How do you feel?
-Stoned.

718
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,800
You're killing my hand.

719
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:54,400
Charlotte, there's something l would
like to talk to you about.

720
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,280
Don't. Heavy. No heavy.

721
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,120
Sibley and l have been talking...
about surgery.

722
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,960
About the paper you signed.

723
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,800
No violins. Come on.

724
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,680
l'm fiine.

725
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,560
Woody, you're the head ofsurgery...

726
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,440
ifyou can't help me, who can?

727
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,240
Are you trying to tell me that in all
of Mt. Sinai, there is not one single...

728
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:26,080
Yeah, Sibley told me that.

729
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,920
The 30th. Yeah, fiine... blank.

730
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,720
Right. Got it. Thanks. When will
the doctor be out ofsurgery?

731
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,520
This is urgent. l have a friend
who says she's one ofthe few doc...

732
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,400
l'm sorry. Thank you.

733
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,200
Please, l don't... speak German.

734
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:50,040
Please, l'd like to speak to a doctor.

735
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,800
Where's the doctor?

736
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:02,480
He can't be in surgery for a week
and a half. No! You do not hang up!...

737
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,160
She doesn't have long.

738
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:01,960
-Weeks. Maybe less.
-And they can't do anything for her?

739
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,760
No, her doctor says when
it's hopeless at the end...

740
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,520
...surgery could be an option.
Heroic surgery, she calls it.

741
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,320
That's why l'm out looking for someone
to make sure that when the times...

742
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,120
comes, it's a hero that performs it.
l haven'tfound anybody yet though.

743
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,960
l can'tfiind anybody who's even
willing to attempt it. l will!

744
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,800
l'm going to fiind someone
because l can't lose her.

745
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,640
lt won't happen.
She's too young.

746
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,000
l'm sorry. l'm here,
but l have no right to be here.

747
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,520
There's no excuse for
what l did to you, Lisa.

748
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,360
You were my child.

749
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,240
You needed me.

750
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,800
l'm sorry.

751
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,360
l want to help you... fiind a surgeon.

752
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,120
l'm a researcher. l can fiind anyone.
Even you.

753
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,840
What do you wantfor Christmas?

754
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,600
You can be really selfiish
about this... anything you want.

755
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,400
Or we can go somewhere... anywhere.

756
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,240
l'll take you to Bali...
Timbuktu... Buffalo.

757
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,120
Don't you have a restaurant to run?

758
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,840
What's more important,
is what do you wantfor Christmas?

759
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,760
No, you already gave me my present.

760
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,680
l forgot. Did you like it?

761
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,520
What was it again?

762
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,360
Misery, heartbreak, pain...

763
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,240
...happiness, love...

764
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:22,040
-life.
-l remember now.

765
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,880
What can l give you?

774
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:23,440

Thanks for a seeing me. l've got
everything that you asked for.

780
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:56,000
Just once l'd like
to get sent something simple.

781
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,760
That never happens anymore.
The downside of being good at myjob.

782
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,520
Good? My daughter was told
you were the best.

783
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:12,320
Like most people,
l do the best can.

784
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:19,040
Last time she passed out she regained
consciousness almost immediately.

785
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:22,880
Next time, or the time after, she won't.
When that happens, call me.

786
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:24,800
Room 1 7 is ready, Dr.Grandy.

788
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:32,480
-l can't thank you enough. Thank you.
-l haven't done anything yet.

789
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,280

790
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:39,160
Hello.

791
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,920
There you are.

792
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,680
-Where were you today?
-What do you mean?

793
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,560
When you called,
l thought you were at work...

794
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:56,440
then when l called you back, John
said you hadn't been in all day.

795
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:00,240
l was in Montclair, New Jersey.

796
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,160
-Why?
-An opportunity.

797
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,040
Do you mean sexual or professional?

798
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,920
Sexual.

799
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,840
l mean, professional!

800
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,520
You get it in there without breaking
it, l'll give you another 5 bucks.

801
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,400
Six dollars... six ofyou.

802
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,240
lt's way too crowded.
l'm way too claustrophobic.

803
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:15,080
-l'll take the next one.
-You sure? Okay... bye. Help.

804
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,760
-You're going away for the holidays?
-l doubt it.

805
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,640
-Did Mr. Keane enjoy his trip?
-What trip?

806
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:29,400
-Just yesterday.
-l wouldn't call that a trip.

807
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:35,160
l've never been to Ohio. lt's amazing
how little l've seen ofthis country.

808
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,920
Cool... l'm gonna
get me some hot chocolate...

809
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,440
-ls it straight?
-Not straight.

810
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,280
What were you doing in Ohio?

811
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:01,080
l had a meeting with heart specialist.
He's willing to operate.

812
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,840
That's exactly what
l didn't want you to do.

813
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,720
You went behind my back.
You lied to me.

814
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,600
-This what we talked about...
-Cut it out! Stop!

815
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,520
No, we talked about that!

816
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,400
You do not want to die!
You want to live!

817
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,240
You think l haven't
been through this? So many times!

818
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,080
l don't want to give people hope
when there isn't any.

819
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,920
Why not? Maybe, we need hope.

820
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,760
Maybe, l need to know that l've
done everything that l could do.

821
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,680
lf l'm gonna...

822
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:39,840
What would l do, Will
ifyou weren't here?

823
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,600
Where would l be? Seriously?

824
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,400
You'll never have
to worry about that.

825
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,080
l'll do whatever l have to do.

826
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:04,800
l'll tear up the papers. l'll tell
the doctors. Whatever you want.

827
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,480
Cause l really want...

828
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,280
l don't to leave you.

829
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,160
You know?

830
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,920
No. No,no,no.

831
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,280
-This is really good.
-What?

832
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:47,920
-This is much better than mine.
-No, you didn't!

833
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,880
-Yeah, l did.
-Oh, God!

834
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:52,760
-Forgeries!
-Yeah, a lot ofthem.

835
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,640
Mine...yours...

836
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,720
Will?

837
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,400
Will?

838
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,120
-What are you doing in there?
-Nothing.

839
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,680
Hey, no, no! Go back!
Give me another minute, alright?

840
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:05,680
-No, you're going to tire yourselfout.
-This l've got to see!

841
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,600
-Go back! Back!
-l can't believe it.

842
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,480
Oh, my God!

843
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,320
Alright. Almost.

844
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,120
Hold on, hold on.

845
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:22,920
Finishing up. Hold on now.
Just a second.

846
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:29,640
Here we are. Okay! Alright.
Surprise!

847
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:55,560
lt's New York.

848
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,480
This is Grandy.

849
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:30,480
-You won't have long.
-All right.

850
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:11,680
"Time cannot break...
the bird's wing from the bird."

851
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:18,400
"The bird and wing together...
go down, one feather."

852
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,120
"No thing that ever flew..."

853
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:28,960
"...not the lark, not you..."

854
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:35,680
"Can die as others do."

855
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,400
What have l done to you?

856
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,160
You ruined me for other women.

857
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,000
l saved you for them.

858
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,720
ls she type`n' cross 6 for units?
What're we waiting for?

859

-Just you, Doctor.
