<i>Where's she going?</i>

2
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,334
Hello?

3
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:29,257
Hello?

4
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:31,177
Shh!

5
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,096
- Jerk!
- What?

6
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:36,010
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Oh, it was a joke.

7
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,216
- Whatever. I'm going.
- Wait. No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

8
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,970
Don't be like that.

9
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,393
- This was supposed to be romantic.
- This is not romantic.

10
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:47,752
This is creepy.
I'm freezing my ass off.

11
00:03:47,753 --> 00:03:49,801
Fine.
Then, uh...

12
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:52,137
let's just-just forget it.

13
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,410
Forget what?

14
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:59,369
Happy birthday.

15
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,737
Oh!
It's not my birthday.

16
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,816
I'm early.
I couldn't wait.

17
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:07,530
Those are real diamonds,
in case you're wondering.

18
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:09,737
It's too much.

19
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:12,330
- Oh. Okay. Well, then I'll just take it back.
- No! No, no, no.

20
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:16,126
No!
I love it.

21
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,049
It's so beautiful.
Thank you.

22
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:39,593
What's wrong?

23
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:42,216
<i>Mmm.</i>

24
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,200
You're hearing things again.

25
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:47,465
No, no, no. I-
No, it's just a headache.

26
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,896
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

27
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,976
<i>- I just wanna get out of here, okay?
- Laurel!</i>

28
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:56,713
<i>Dad.</i>

29
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,200
Get in the car.

30
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,042
Bye.

31
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:27,423
Put some clothes on.

32
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,993
What are you doing way up here?

33
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:44,862
Did you follow me?

34
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:47,848
I asked you to stay away from him.

35
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,565
Michael and I are getting married.

36
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:55,080
That's not gonna happen.

37
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:58,147
I'll be 18 next week.
You can't stop us.

38
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:03,016
You're gonna be 18.

39
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,770
Why do you hate him so much?

40
00:06:05,771 --> 00:06:08,713
He has nothing to do with it.
I hate myself.

41
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:13,832
<i>I had so many plans for you.
Everything got spoiled.</i>

42
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,033
- Dad, what are you-
- It was all my fault.

43
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:19,209
I'm so sorry for what I did.

44
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,128
Have you been drinking?
Dad-

45
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,136
<i>- I didn't know what else to do.
- What are you talking about?</i>

46
00:06:24,137 --> 00:06:26,152
<i>Dad, can you slow down, please?
Dad!</i>

47
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,649
<i>Watch the road!</i>

48
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,688
- Just let me out of this car!
- The darkness is coming for you!

49
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:34,634
Let me out! No!

50
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,257
- No!
- Stop it!

51
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:39,241
<i>Dad!</i>

52
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:42,953
<i>I can't let you turn 18!</i>

53
00:06:42,954 --> 00:06:45,993
<i>- God, forgive me!
- Dad, don't!</i>

54
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:48,200
Stop!

55
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:51,169
Don't! Dad, don't!

56
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,241
Daddy.

57
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:18,697
<i>I- I don't understand.</i>

58
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:32,521
God, forgive me.

59
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:39,305
<i>I couldn't let you turn 18.</i>

60
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:42,371
<i>I couldn't let them take you.</i>

61
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:36,967
911. What's your emergency?

62
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:40,935
911. Are you there?

63
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,272
Hello?

64
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:12,872
<i>You're up early.
Did you sleep okay?</i>

65
00:09:12,873 --> 00:09:15,111
Yeah.

66
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:17,736
<i>You feelin' all right?</i>

67
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:20,389
This uniform makes me nauseous,
if that's what you mean.

68
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,672
I think you look pretty.

69
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:24,542
You're not wearing your glasses.

70
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,806
Even prettier.

71
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,752
<i>It's a good school, Molly.</i>

72
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,311
It's one of the best in the state.
Promise me that...

73
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,040
<i>you'll give it a chance.</i>

74
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,960
<i>A fresh start, okay?</i>

75
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,579
For both of us?

76
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,124
Okay. Enjoy yourself.

77
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:12,231
Yeah.

78
00:10:24,617 --> 00:10:28,071
<i>Mm-hmm.
Well...</i>

79
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,313
you are an excellent student,
Miss Hartley.

80
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,231
<i>I'm sure you'll find Huntington Prep...</i>

81
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,728
<i>every bit as challenging
as your last school.</i>

82
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:37,640
Your, uh, father...

83
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:41,480
has requested an appointment
with our school counselor.

84
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:45,256
<i>Dr. Emerson, Room 260, sixth period.</i>

85
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:47,944
Come in.

86
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:51,431
<i>Ah, Miss White.
Miss White, Miss Hartley.</i>

87
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:54,952
<i>Miss White will escort you
to your classes.</i>

88
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,872
"Nay, cursed be thou;
since against his thy will...

89
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,695
chose freely what it now
so justly rues. "

90
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:01,827
<i>Again with some feeling,
Mr. Young.</i>

91
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,616
<i>"Nay, cursed be thou; since"-</i>

92
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:08,359
Mr. Draper, this is Molly Hartley.
It's her first day.

93
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,464
She's from Boston,
and she had a 4.0 at Filmore Prep.

94
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,312
<i>Welcome,
Miss Hartley from Boston.</i>

95
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:15,248
Thank you.

96
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,119
Any other pertinent
information we should know about?

97
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,200
Hobbies?
Food allergies, maybe?

98
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:23,592
<i>I'm kidding. All right. Take a seat then.</i>

99
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:26,461
<i>We're in the middle
of Paradise Lost.</i>

100
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:30,977
We can share.

101
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,839
Jealous.

102
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,632
Excuse me?

103
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:43,112
<i>- Ladies, are we done?
- Yes, I'm done.</i>

104
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:45,831
Can we continue?

105
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:50,054
<i>- Mr. Young, keep reading.
- Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell.</i>

106
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:55,877
Do you want pizza?
Or maybe a sandwich?

107
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,005
It's my treat.

108
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,688
Don't worry.
They're not laughing at you.

109
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,088
People make fun of me
because I'm on scholarship...

110
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,771
not that it's any of their business.

111
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:16,360
And some people are offended
because I have a close...

112
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,360
personal relationship with Jesus.

113
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,966
<i>Doesn't bother me.</i>

114
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:27,812
Are you okay?

115
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,545
<i>Molly?</i>

116
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:36,520
I'll be right back.

117
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,007
<i>- Do you want me to come with you?
- No.</i>

118
00:13:08,073 --> 00:13:10,791
You can't hide in here
all day, you know.

119
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:12,391
Believe me.

120
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,782
I've tried.

121
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:24,232
<i>¶Do you know who I am ¶</i>

122
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,015
<i>¶ I'm alive, you understand ¶</i>

123
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:32,133
<i>¶ Alive, alive, alive ¶</i>

124
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:37,032
<i>¶ Check your head
I heard a sound ¶</i>

125
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:40,551
<i>¶ Makes so tender arms around ¶</i>

126
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:45,341
<i>¶ The sound, the sound, the sound ¶</i>

127
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:28,230
Whoa! I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

128
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:30,471
Are you okay?

129
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:32,839
I'm Joseph Young, from English class?

130
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,591
- Yeah. I remember.
- Yeah.

131
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:38,568
- Usually I'm pretty good at this.
- At what?

132
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,320
Flirting, I guess.

133
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,495
No one normally gets hurt though.

134
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:46,152
I am fine.
No permanent damage.

135
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,686
Good.

136
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,920
Ditching class on the first day, I see.
That's pretty bold.

137
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:54,695
- I don't have a sixth period.
- Everyone has sixth period.

138
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,791
Okay, I get it.
Woman of mystery.

139
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:02,532
So what are you doing right now?
You wanna go grab something to eat or what?

140
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,671
What about that girl from class?

141
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,350
- Who, Suzie?
- She's your girlfriend, right?

142
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,911
Well, hey, we can be friends.
Everyone needs friends, right?

143
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:14,150
I'm new. I don't need
that kind of trouble.

144
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,349
Okay.

145
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:22,212
<i>I have to get home.</i>

146
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,670
Uh, wait.
I can give you a ride if you want.

147
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,060
No, thanks.

148
00:15:28,615 --> 00:15:31,746
I'll see you in school tomorrow then.

149
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:58,726
- So?
- So?

150
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:01,285
How was the first day of school?

151
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,111
How was the first day of work?

152
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:06,150
Ah, it was busy.
Lots of meetings.

153
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,071
Bad coffee.

154
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,241
Same here.

155
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,382
Did you see the school counselor?

156
00:16:14,246 --> 00:16:16,390
Yeah.
He was fine.

157
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:19,653
School's fine.
Everything was fine.

158
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,862
Well, I was hopin'
things would be better than fine.

159
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:24,357
You know, maybe good...
or promising.

160
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,014
Stop acting like
everything is all right.

161
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,898
It's never going to be all right.

162
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:32,965
<i>- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me.</i>

163
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:36,646
<i>I am doing my best
to keep this family together...</i>

164
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,744
and I expect you to do the same.

165
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,518
Can she get out?

166
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,908
<i>Hmm?</i>

167
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:50,310
Can she get out of that place?

168
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:54,118
She's sick. But there's a chance that
she could get well. And if that happens-

169
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:57,573
<i>I wanna know that she can't get out.
I wanna know that she's locked up forever.</i>

170
00:16:57,574 --> 00:16:59,557
<i>She can't hurt you, Molly, I promise.</i>

171
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:03,269
No one is ever gonna hurt you again.
I won't let that happen.

172
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,659
<i>All right?</i>

173
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:10,374
<i>If you ever change your mind,
if you ever feel like seeing her...</i>

174
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,062
you know,
that would be okay too.

175
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:14,982
No.

176
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,371
She's still your mother.

177
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:21,349
I'm not hungry.

178
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,518
Do you-
You want me to make you something else?

179
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,005
I need to start my homework.

180
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:21,504
- Mom?
- Molly.

181
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:28,070
Honey, come pray with me.
Pray.

182
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,405
Pray, Molly!

183
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:33,158
I renounce his works and give my life to you.
Please fill me with your Holy Spirit.

184
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:35,845
Pray, Molly.
Pray!

185
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:40,165
Forgive me.
I have... sinned?

186
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,916
You know I love you.

187
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:48,676
I'm sorry,
but I know what you are now.

188
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:51,077
And it's the only way.
You understand, don't you?

189
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:54,533
No.

190
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,957
Close your eyes, Molly. I can save you.

191
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,794
<i>Molly, you awake?</i>

192
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:15,900
Yeah!

193
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:34,117
<i>¶ You're the one that keeps drivin' me crazy ¶</i>

194
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,164
<i>¶ Keeps pushin' me all the time ¶</i>

195
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:38,917
<i>¶ I'm the one who wants
to be more lazy ¶</i>

196
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,509
<i>¶ Sick of workin' it
all of the time ¶</i>

197
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,229
<i>¶ Whoa-oa-oa-oa ¶</i>

198
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,724
<i>¶ Whoa-oa-oa ¶</i>

199
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:49,573
<i>- ¶¶
- Hi.</i>

200
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:52,484
All right, take a seat.

201
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,940
<i>Well, after reading your papers
on Paradise Lost over the weekend...</i>

202
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:58,564
I've decided to revise
the lesson plans a bit.

203
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,900
Pass these back.

204
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,525
<i>- Check it out.
- The Bible?</i>

205
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,725
This isn't to be read
in a religious context.

206
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:09,702
But it occurs to me many of you
don't have the necessary reference points...

207
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:14,438
to fully appreciate these iconic texts
of English literature.

208
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,997
So, Leah, we're all gonna do
a little extra reading.

209
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:21,397
Look, my parents don't pay a shitload
of tuition for me to get stuck in Bible camp.

210
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:25,797
Your parents pay for an excellent education,
which is exactly what I'm giving you.

211
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,888
Hmm.
Thanks, but no thanks.

212
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:32,709
Yes, Alexis?

213
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,180
<i>I already have a Bible.
I don't need this one.</i>

214
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:35,493
Well, just to keep things clear...

215
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:39,045
we're all gonna use the same edition
just like all of our other texts.

216
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:41,029
I'm not comfortable with that.

217
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,238
I'm sorry?

218
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,213
I don't feel comfortable talking
about the Bible as some sort of text.

219
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:50,884
It's the word of God, not some morally
questionable novel you give us a pop quiz on.

220
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,796
- Jesus freak.
- That's enough.

221
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:56,997
It's sacrilegious.
It's profane.

222
00:20:56,998 --> 00:21:00,133
<i>Alexis, I appreciate your beliefs. I do.</i>

223
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:03,396
<i>You need to learn to navigate in the
secular world if you wanna succeed here.</i>

224
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,829
I can navigate in the secular world
without questioning my beliefs.

225
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,772
<i>I don't see why we have to talk about this
as if it's an opinion. It's the truth.</i>

226
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:10,692
I-

227
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:13,244
<i>Molly, do you have something to add?</i>

228
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:20,638
You're bleeding.

229
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,189
<i>Here.</i>

230
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,611
<i>You may be excused.</i>

231
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,598
All right,
open to the Book of Psalms.

232
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,493
<i>- And Leah's gonna lead us through it.
- Is this extra credit?</i>

233
00:21:37,701 --> 00:21:40,090
<i>Molly?</i>

234
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,419
Hello?

235
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,450
<i>Molly?</i>

236
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,109
<i>- Molly?
- Hello?</i>

237
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,350
<i>Molly?</i>

238
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:12,612
<i>- Who's there?
- Molly?</i>

239
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,053
Hello?

240
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:27,844
<i>Molly? Molly? Molly, where are you?</i>

241
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:29,349
<i>Molly?</i>

242
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,188
<i>Molly?</i>

243
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,781
Molly? Are you okay?

244
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:47,589
<i>I- I brought you a clean shirt.</i>

245
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,077
- Molly, what's happening?
- I can't- I can't-

246
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,458
<i>Somebody, help!</i>

247
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:05,316
Are you feeling better?
I was off campus at a meeting.

248
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,365
I'm Dr. Emerson.

249
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,789
I guess you got sidetracked on your way
to our appointment yesterday.

250
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,220
I understand.

251
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:16,036
I imagine it must be overwhelming
on your first day of classes...

252
00:23:16,037 --> 00:23:17,956
but your father insisted.

253
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:20,133
- He worries a lot.
- I hope you don't mind.

254
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:22,437
It's still technically sealed.

255
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:25,372
But everything stays between
you and me, all right?

256
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,227
I don't need to be here.

257
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:31,877
Heard you had a panic attack in class today.
You wanna tell me about it?

258
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,829
It was just a nosebleed.

259
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,805
Just got freaked out
by all the blood, that's all.

260
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:41,125
Must be hard being new at school
even under the best of circumstances.

261
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:44,260
<i>I'm new here too.
It's hard for me.</i>

262
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:46,597
How are you feeling otherwise?

263
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:49,348
Whatever it says in there,
I'm not like her.

264
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,677
<i>We're not suggesting that, Molly.
Our only concern is you.</i>

265
00:23:52,678 --> 00:23:56,255
Well, I told you, I'm fine.

266
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,756
Your mother stabbed you
in the chest...

267
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:00,676
with a pair of scissors.

268
00:24:00,677 --> 00:24:02,948
There was no sign of mental illness...

269
00:24:02,949 --> 00:24:04,773
<i>no warning.</i>

270
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,691
I don't remember, okay?

271
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:10,149
<i>Everyone keeps asking me what happened,
and I don't remember.</i>

272
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,244
<i>- She's locked up, and she can't get out.
- Are you interested in knowing...</i>

273
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,961
what her diagnosis is?

274
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,940

277
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,547
I get it.
She's crazy.

278
00:24:32,548 --> 00:24:34,883
It's okay to be scared, Molly.

279
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,484
What?

280
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,916

I'm not.

that much time left.

305

- Nothing.

314
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,436
You had a nosebleed.
You started hyperventilating.

315

You had a panic attack.
That's nothing?

316
00:27:36,004 --> 00:27:38,594
I'll just see you tomorrow, Molly.
It's fine.

317
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:40,515
Molly, how do you think
that makes me feel-

318
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:44,792
to know that my daughter is hurt
and bleeding and won't even call me?

319
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:05,957
I'm sorry. I-I overreacted.

320
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:09,572
I'm worried about you, that's all.

321
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:11,556
You never used to worry.

322
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,603
You never paid attention to me at all.

323
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,876
Stop trying to control my life.

324
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:19,006
I'm not trying
to control your life.

325
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:30,595
You went to see her?

326
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:33,442
She's my wife.

327
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,827
You need to tell me when you're not
feeling well. I need to know.

328
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:41,603
What?
You need to know if I'm crazy too?

329
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,396
Sweetie, you are not crazy.

330
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:46,883
My head hurts. I hear things.
Everything's mixed up.

331
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:49,187
I just-

332
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:53,507
It was all my fault.

333
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,632
Look, tomorrow I'll make
an appointment with a doctor, okay?

334
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:01,443
We'll get you checked out.
I know that everything is gonna be fine.

335
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:09,851
We're gonna get through this.
Okay?

336
00:30:35,652 --> 00:30:39,099
<i>Molly?</i>

337
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:45,018
Oh, shit.

338
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,538
<i>Molly?</i>

339
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,847
<i>Molly?</i>

340
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:17,025
<i>I know what you are, Molly.</i>

341
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:24,129
Wait! Daddy!

342
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,825
Daddy, help!
Let me out!

343
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,712
Molly, what's going on?

344
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:30,592
Daddy, let me out! Dad!

345
00:31:30,593 --> 00:31:33,473
Molly! Molly!

346
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:37,986
Daddy! Daddy!

347
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,998
<i>Molly? Molly, do you know where you are?</i>

348
00:31:57,602 --> 00:31:59,552
Molly, are you with me?

349
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:02,529
Easy. Easy.
Just relax.

350
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:09,025
How did-
What's going on?

351
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,168
You're in the hospital.
Everything's all right, baby.

352
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:13,952
- You're gonna be fine.
- How long have you been having nosebleeds?

353
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:17,409
A while, since before Mom-

354
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,145
Have you been experiencing vision problems?
Headaches? Dizziness?

355
00:32:24,706 --> 00:32:28,545
See this little spot?
It's most likely a tumor...

356
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,144
<i>in your sinus cavity.</i>

357
00:32:30,145 --> 00:32:32,576
<i>A nasal hemangioma.
A little mass of blood vessels...</i>

358
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:35,392
<i>growing out of control and creating
a whole lot of pressure in your head.</i>

359
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:39,553
That would explain the nosebleeds,
the headaches and the vision problems.

360
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:43,681
What about... hearing things?

361
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:45,153
<i>Can that happen too?</i>

362
00:32:45,154 --> 00:32:48,352
Sometimes the buildup of pressure
can cause episodes of vertigo...

363
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:51,455
or auditory hallucinations, disorientation.

364
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:55,393
I thought I was going crazy.

365
00:32:55,394 --> 00:32:58,432
We caught it early,
so there's nothing to worry about.

366
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:01,439
These things are pesky,
but usually benign.

367
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,712
<i>We'll do an endoscopic procedure...</i>

368
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:05,791
<i>and monitor you for a few days.</i>

369
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,288
<i>You don't mind missing
a little school, do you?</i>

370
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,103
Good. I'll schedule the surgery
for tomorrow morning.

371
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:13,494
Get some rest.

372
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,601
You see?
Everything's gonna be all right now.

373
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:20,797
Everything's gonna be absolutely fine.

374
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,063
Is my dad here?

375
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,472
Is there any water?

376
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:07,710
I know what you are.

377
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,593
It's okay. It's okay. You're okay.

378
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:13,057
You're out of surgery now, sweetie.
Everything went really well.

379
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:16,513
There was no complications.
The tumor's benign.

380
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,432
She was here.

381
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,033
- Who?
- Mom.

382
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:21,632
No, it's just you and me.

383
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:23,389
I saw her.
She tried-

384
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:25,847
No, it's just the anaesthesia.

385
00:34:27,873 --> 00:34:30,719
Just go and relax.
Lie back down.

386
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,436
I don't suppose you feel like
having a visitor?

387
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:38,332
- A visitor?
- Yeah, a friend from school came to see you.

388
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:45,922
<i>Oh.</i>

389
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:48,640
You want me to tell her to come back
when you're feeling better?

390
00:34:48,641 --> 00:34:50,561
No. It's okay.

391
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:53,856
Okay. Come in.

392
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,769
I'm gonna go scrounge up a decent meal.
You girls want anything?

393
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,967
A pizza, or chili cheese fries?

394
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,854
No, thanks, Mr. Hartley.

395
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:10,206
Okay. Okay.
I'll be right back.

396
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,208
- Your dad seems really nice.
- Yeah.

397
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,857
My grandmother works in a hospital.

398
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:19,873
She says flowers
make all the difference.

399
00:35:19,874 --> 00:35:22,208
How did you know I was here?

400
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:27,161
Everyone at Huntington knows everything.
No secrets.

401
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:31,578
- You're big news. But don't worry about it.
- What do you mean?

402
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:35,199
I brought some homework assignments.

403
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,600
Thought I could help you catch up.

404
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,087
Why are you so nice to me?

405
00:35:41,954 --> 00:35:45,568
Molly, can I ask you a question?

406
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,318
<i>Sure.</i>

407
00:35:48,353 --> 00:35:50,687
Have you been saved?

408
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:55,135
The doctor caught the tumor early.
I'm fine.

409
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:57,408
That's not what I mean.

410
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:59,584
Oh. Right.

411
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:02,650
Have you been baptized?

412
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,850
My parents don't believe
in that sort of thing.

413
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:08,797
Well, what about you?

414
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,584
This is your life, your journey.

415
00:36:11,585 --> 00:36:13,919
What do you believe?

416
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,487
I'm just worried about you, that's all.

417
00:36:19,488 --> 00:36:21,663
I'm feeling a little tired.

418
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:24,671
I brought this for you.

419
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:34,140
Thanks.

420
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,133
Sure.

421
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:46,841
I pray for you every night.

422
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:58,624
<i>How do you feel?</i>

423
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,871
Good.

424
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:02,335
Your birthday's coming up.
What about a party?

425
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,726
A party?

426
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:07,583
Cake, presents, a clown.

427
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,855
No clown.

428
00:37:09,856 --> 00:37:13,504
You know, time rushes by
like you wouldn't believe, Molly.

429
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:15,905
I mean, just yesterday
you were a little thing in pigtails.

430
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,000
And suddenly, you're 18.
All grown up.

431
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,240
You won't need me anymore.

432
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:25,754
Don't worry.
I'll need you.

433
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,501
<i>¶¶</i>

434
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:51,039

<i>Alexis, enough with
the musical interlude, please.</i>

438
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,229
<i>- Sorry.
- Thank you.</i>

439
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,351
I'm so glad you're back.
There's a calculus quiz tomorrow.

440
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,814
<i>My grandma said I can
come over tonight and help you study.</i>

441
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:16,416
Okay.

442
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:19,839
- Um, I'll see you in a few minutes.
- All right.

443
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,727
Hey.

444
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,767
- Welcome back.
- Thanks. Nice catch.

445
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,008
I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

446
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:28,982
I would've definitely milked that
" brain surgery" thing for,

447
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:30,400
like, a month off, maybe 2.

448
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:34,687
It wasn't actually brain surgery.

449
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,759
- You're better now, right? Aren't you?
- I'm fine.

450
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,319
Great. Then you can come
to my party tonight.

451
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,784
Tonight?
It's a Tuesday.

452
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:45,567
Exactly. It's a Tuesday,
and my parents are out of town.

453
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:48,479
I don't know.
Maybe.

454
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,783
Well, you'll need the secret code.

455
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:53,727
A secret code?

456
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:55,807
Just for the gate.

457
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:58,196
Can't be too careful.

458
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,920
Oh, and bring anyone you want
as long as it's not a guy.

459
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:04,309
<i>Yo, yo, let's go!</i>

460
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:09,461
Wait! Where do you live?

461
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,047
Molly.
Are you feeling better?

462
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:21,088
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Aw.

463
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:23,775
I hope it wasn't too serious.

464
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:25,728
No.

465
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:28,215
So what were you and Joseph
talking about?

466
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:32,800
- Nothing. We're just friends.
- Of course.

467
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:38,136
It must be really difficult
to... be in your situation.

468
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:41,686
What's that supposed to mean?

469
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,583
He doesn't really want you to come.

470
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:51,518
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
I didn't even see you there.

471
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,728
You're a bitch.

472
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:56,313
I know.

473
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:59,966
God, I hate her.

474
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:04,119
Do you wanna eat?

475
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:07,008
<i>So, are you gonna go?</i>

476
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:10,237
- To the party?
- Yeah, to the party.

477
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,888
I don't know if I wanna go.

478
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:16,479
Yeah, you do. You wanna go,
and you wanna take me with you.

479
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,399
You wanna go to the party?

480
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,543
Please.
It's not like I even care.

481
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:23,840
It's just-
You know, it's something to do.

482
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:27,903
Come on. You can't tell me
you're not bored out of your mind here.

483
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,719
You can count, right?

484
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,632
- So then what's your curfew for tonight?
- Curfew?

485
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,263
Molly!

486
00:40:35,264 --> 00:40:39,006
- Over here.
- I don't, um-

487
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:44,954
I don't really do the cafeteria thing.
So... call me later.

488
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,406
Ditch the Bible thumper.

00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,742
Where did you say you were going?

493
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:10,231
Um, study group.

494

<i>It might go a little late.</i>

495
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:16,480
Um, we have a big test tomorrow.
Calculus.

496
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:18,399
Are you sure you're up for this?

497
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,824
You're the one who said
I was perfectly fine, remember?

498
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,889
Plus, I need to catch up.

499
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:30,432
- Not too late.
- Not too late. Got it.

Let's go.

00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:49,150
Hey.

505
00:41:49,151 --> 00:41:52,703
You forgettin' somethin'?

506
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:55,488
Dad, this is Leah.
This is my dad.

507
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:58,078
<i>- Hey, Dad.
- It's nice to meet you, Leah.</i>

508
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,463
- Make sure she doesn't study too hard.
- Yeah, that won't be a problem.

509
00:42:02,464 --> 00:42:05,976
Okay.
Keep your phone on.

510
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,756
Nice outfit.

511
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:18,296
Better.

512
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:23,070
Do you know where he lives?

513
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:25,951
Come on. Everybody knows
where Joseph Young lives.

514
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:29,023
His father owns, like, half the city.
You didn't know that?

515
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:30,943
No.

516
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:33,823
Well, Suzie's not gonna let you
have him without a fight, so-

517
00:42:33,824 --> 00:42:35,996
Who says I want him?

518
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,999
Yeah. Okay.
That was convincing. Good job.

519
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,988
I saw you in Emerson's office
the other day.

520
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,494
Oh, really?

521
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:48,990
So what, does that mean
we're sharing now?

522
00:42:48,991 --> 00:42:53,748
Should we read each other's journals
and promise to be best friends forever?

523
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:59,740
I have- I have anger issues.

524
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,822
My father died
of throat cancer last year.

525
00:43:05,823 --> 00:43:09,823
<i>Then when he's dead I find out
he's not even really my father.</i>

526
00:43:09,824 --> 00:43:12,704
Turns out I'm adopted.

527
00:43:12,705 --> 00:43:15,742
My real parents, they gave me up.

528
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,750
<i>They just didn't
feel like keeping me.</i>

529
00:43:18,751 --> 00:43:22,271
So what about you?
You got low self-esteem?

530
00:43:22,272 --> 00:43:25,342
Or, uh, mild depression?

531
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:30,612
<i>Or maybe a weird
psychosexual disorder?</i>

532
00:43:35,712 --> 00:43:38,460
My mom tried to kill me.

533
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:44,030
She stabbed me in the bathroom
one day after school.

534
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:46,811
Right.

535
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,486
You're screwing with me.

536
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:59,900
She's locked in that psych ward
outside of town.

537
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:03,100
Clayton.

538
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:06,647
Dad wanted to move here
to make a fresh new start.

539
00:44:08,543 --> 00:44:11,410
So here we are.

540
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:17,886
You win.

I wasn't sure you'd show up.

550
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,646
- Leah talked me into it.
- You are so welcome.

00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:06,558
Do you seriously know,
like, all of these people?

552
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:09,982
- No. Should I?
- Probably.

553
00:45:09,983 --> 00:45:13,331
- Do you want a drink?
- Um... sure.

554
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:15,902
Okay, I can take a hint.
See ya.

hold it against me.</i>

So, where's Suzie?

563
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,838
I don't know.
Why?

564
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,983
Just wondering.

565
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:50,718
- You know we broke up, right?
- No, I- I didn't know that.

566
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,637
Yeah.
Things change.

567
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:55,092
People change.

568
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:57,662
You look different out of uniform.

569

That's a compliment, right?

570

Of course.
Here, try this.

It's all right, I guess, huh?

Don't your parents mind?

578

Let's not talk about my parents.

634
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:07,672
Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?

635
00:51:10,844 --> 00:51:13,724
<i>Go ahead
and make that an attempted code one.</i>

636
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:25,276
Molly.

637
00:51:25,277 --> 00:51:27,388
- She was here.
- No.

638
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:29,307
Yes.

639
00:51:29,308 --> 00:51:30,909
I know what I saw!

640
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,085
Sweetheart, I called Clayton.
She's in her room.

641
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:35,637
She's been in her room all night.

642
00:51:41,661 --> 00:51:43,643
I'm scared.

643
00:51:43,644 --> 00:51:46,236
Don't be scared.
I'm right here.

644
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:48,920
That's not good enough.

645
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:51,794
Everything is gonna be all right.

646
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:13,905
<i>Suzie.</i>

647
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,160
I'm really sorry.

648
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:22,235
I know what you are.

649
00:52:22,236 --> 00:52:25,018
What?

650
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:29,906
<i>What am I?</i>

651
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:33,716
What am I?

652
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:42,941
Molly, hey, are you okay?

653
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:46,716
I've been so worried about you. I left
you messages. Why didn't you call me back?

654
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:48,636
I don't know.

655
00:52:48,637 --> 00:52:51,516
What happened that night
at the party?

656
00:52:51,517 --> 00:52:53,627
I didn't mean to hurt her.

657
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:57,654
Molly, I don't care about what happened to
Suzie. I care about what happened to you.

658
00:52:58,556 --> 00:53:00,476
I don't know what happened!

659
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:04,372
- I-
- You can tell me. Just talk to me. It's okay.

660
00:53:07,038 --> 00:53:09,590
Please.

661
00:53:10,364 --> 00:53:12,284
Just leave me alone.

662
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:15,633
- Everyone should just leave me alone.
- Molly!

663
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:18,588
<i>It felt real.</i>

664
00:53:18,589 --> 00:53:20,539
But you understand that it wasn't.

665
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,227
What is happening to me?

666
00:53:23,228 --> 00:53:27,068
Fear is a very powerful emotion, Molly.
Plays tricks with your mind.

667
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:31,099
It makes you see things and hear things
that aren't really there.

668
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,747
Nothing is wrong with you.
You're perfectly normal.

669
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,886
Nothing about me is normal!

670
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:41,659
- Why did she try to kill me?
- Your mother is very ill.

671
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,660
She's not in her right mind. She's not
thinking clearly. Do you understand that?

672
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:49,172
We're gonna
work through this together.

673
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,148
Okay.

674
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:56,347
Here.
I want you to take this.

675
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:59,484
I want you to call that number
any time you need to talk.

676
00:53:59,485 --> 00:54:02,075
I'm here for you.

677
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:04,465
Okay.

678
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,619
Molly.

679
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,540
Look, I'm really sorry, okay?

680
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:16,123
I should've taken you home
the other night.

681
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:18,512
It doesn't matter.

682
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,525
But it's your birthday tomorrow.

683
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:25,372
I mean, let's-
let's do something.

684
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,843
Molly!

685
00:54:34,844 --> 00:54:36,444
<i>Hi.</i>

686
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:40,060
I need to get home.
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:40,061 --> 00:54:41,979
I know about the party.

688
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,796
I know what happened.
Suzie Woods told me everything.

689
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:46,907
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

690
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:50,617
I'm not mad you ditched me.
Honest.

691
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:55,129
You should come inside.

692
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:58,267
I can't.

693
00:54:58,268 --> 00:55:00,188
Whatever you're going through,
we can help.

694
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:04,571
If you're lost,
if you're afraid, we can help.

695
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:08,987
If you accept Christ into your heart,
you'll be blessed with eternal salvation...

696
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:11,163
<i>spiritual protection, grace.</i>

697
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,554
Isn't that what you want?

698
00:55:14,365 --> 00:55:18,139
You're a good person, Molly.
Let me help.

699
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,060
Hi, you've reached
Robert Hartley's cell phone.

700
00:55:44,061 --> 00:55:47,195
I'm unavailable to take your call right now,
but if you leave me a message...

701
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:49,594
I'll call you as soon as I can.

702
00:55:49,595 --> 00:55:52,955
I'm home. You told me to call
when I got here, so I'm calling.

703
00:57:08,668 --> 00:57:11,004
Stupid lock.

704
00:57:11,005 --> 00:57:14,075
Get away from me!

705
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:16,442
Molly, the nurse let me out.

706
00:57:16,443 --> 00:57:19,066
She let me out because she believes.

707
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:20,828
What do you want from me?

708
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:23,323
To save you.
That's all I want.

709
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:26,202
You have no idea
what you're about to become.

710
00:57:26,203 --> 00:57:28,731
<i>Can't you feel it, Molly?</i>

711
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:30,714
<i>There is evil everywhere.</i>

712
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:33,883
The darkness is coming for you, honey.
It's coming.

713
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,962
What's happening to me?

714
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:38,522
I'm so sorry.
We made a terrible mistake.

715
00:57:38,523 --> 00:57:40,187
What?

716
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:44,955
You were never meant to live.
We were so weak. We were so selfish.

717
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:47,835
You died the night you were born...

718
00:57:47,836 --> 00:57:51,067
on the bathroom floor
of a restaurant.

719
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:55,289
<i>You came too early. I never made it
to the hospital. There was too much blood.</i>

720
00:57:56,507 --> 00:58:01,339
I'd lost babies before- miscarriages-
and I couldn't lose another one.

721
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,609
<i>But then this woman
suddenly appeared.</i>

722
00:58:05,244 --> 00:58:08,795
I don't know where she came from,
but suddenly she was just standing there...

723
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,035
and she offered us a deal.

724
00:58:11,036 --> 00:58:13,915
She promised to make you live.

725
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:17,819
<i>Honey, they knew you were special.
That's why she came for you.</i>

726
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:21,595
<i>She promised us 18 years together.</i>

727
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:23,484
And then you would belong to them.

728
00:58:23,485 --> 00:58:26,363
- I don't believe you.
- There are others like you.

729
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:29,339
- Dad would've said something!
- No, he refuses to believe the truth!

730
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:33,115
He made the choice, but he doesn't
understand! But I know what we did!

731
00:58:33,116 --> 00:58:35,547
I know this has happened before.

732
00:58:35,548 --> 00:58:37,467
- You're crazy!
- No, I'm not crazy!

733
00:58:37,468 --> 00:58:38,460
Yeah!

734
00:58:38,461 --> 00:58:40,347
If I don't stop you now,
you'll do terrible things.

735
00:58:40,348 --> 00:58:44,699
I just wanna make things right
before it's too late, before you turn 18.

736
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,378
Don't you understand what's happening to you?
Can't you feel it?

737
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:50,298
You're being torn from this world.

738
00:58:50,299 --> 00:58:52,858
Everything you do will be
in the service of them!

739
00:58:52,859 --> 00:58:55,867
- Your life will no longer be yours anymore!
- Shut up!

740
00:58:55,868 --> 00:58:58,362
- Don't you understand? I can save you!
- No!

741
00:58:58,363 --> 00:59:01,691
May God take you
so you can be saved!

742
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:05,146
- Molly!
- Help! Somebody help me!

743
00:59:05,147 --> 00:59:07,962
<i>Molly!</i>

744
00:59:07,963 --> 00:59:10,683
No! I can't let you live!

745
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:13,115
I can't let the darkness take you!

746
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,547
They're coming for you!

747
00:59:15,548 --> 00:59:19,034
No! I love you!
Honey! No!

748
00:59:19,035 --> 00:59:21,969
No!

749
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,717
She came back.

750
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,269
She told me everything!

751
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:52,763
What happened
the night I was born!

752
01:00:52,764 --> 01:00:54,778
What'll happen to me
on my 18th birthday!

753
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:57,659
Molly, for God's sake, we didn't do anything!
She's delusional!

754
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,985
She knew something was going to happen
to me and she tried to help me!

755
01:01:00,986 --> 01:01:02,906
She wanted to stop it!

756
01:01:02,907 --> 01:01:05,498
No!
Nothing is gonna happen to you!

757
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:09,595
That wasn't real! That was some religious
nutcase screwing with your mother's head!

758
01:01:09,596 --> 01:01:13,305
You have to do something!
Tomorrow's my fucking birthday!

759
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:16,379
- You can't let them take me!
- No one is gonna take you!

760
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:18,683
<i>Now, this is exactly
how it started with your mother...</i>

761
01:01:18,684 --> 01:01:22,874
<i>with the religious delusions and the
paranoia and the losing touch with reality.</i>

762
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:25,178
<i>She's dead because of me!</i>

763
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:27,705
I won't let that happen again.
I won't lose you, too.

764
01:01:27,706 --> 01:01:30,193
Let go!

765
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:33,755
I'm gonna get you some help.
A good doctor.

766
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:37,113
<i>- Someone who can help you see the truth.
- I know the truth!</i>

767
01:01:37,114 --> 01:01:39,675
- I have to find a way to stop it!
- Then just let me help you.

768
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:43,766
- Let me take you someplace quiet and safe.
- I won't let you lock me up!

769
01:01:51,706 --> 01:01:56,377
<i>¶Through the blood of Jesus ¶</i>

770
01:01:56,378 --> 01:02:00,794
<i>¶ Through the blood of Jesus ¶</i>

771
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:05,242
<i>¶ Through the blood of Jesus ¶¶</i>

772
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:08,666
<i>- ¶¶
- What are you doing here?</i>

773
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:12,278
I need your help.
I don't know where else to go.

774
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:18,802
Of course I'll help.
But you have to tell me what's wrong.

775
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,722
Is it too late for me?

776
01:02:21,723 --> 01:02:24,602
Is it too late for me to be saved?

777
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:26,779
It's never too late.

778
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,946
Even if someone chose
a terrible path for me?

779
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:31,866
You're responsible
for your own salvation.

780
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:34,233
- God lets you make that choice for yourself.
- You're sure?

781
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:36,599
Of course.

782
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:38,554
I choose it then.

783
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:41,008
I choose salvation.

784
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:44,313
I'm really glad you came to me, Molly.

785
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:46,234
You won't regret this journey.
I promise.

786
01:02:46,235 --> 01:02:48,282
No!
I can't take a journey!

787
01:02:48,283 --> 01:02:51,034
I need you to help me now.
I'm running out of time.

788
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:53,275
Time for what?

789
01:02:53,276 --> 01:02:55,003
I need protection...

790
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,338
before it's too late.

791
01:02:57,915 --> 01:03:00,882
Please help me.

792
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:05,392
Come with me.

793
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:15,418
This way.

794
01:03:43,642 --> 01:03:46,032
Put this on.

795
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:51,035
This will work, right?

796
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:53,882
If you accept Jesus Christ into your heart,
you will be purified.

797
01:03:53,883 --> 01:03:57,232
You'll be born of water and the Spirit,
and you will be saved.

798
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,746
That's what you want, isn't it?

799
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:05,136
Yes.

800
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:08,248
Come with me.

801
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:27,545
Do you believe and trust in God, the
Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth...

802
01:04:27,546 --> 01:04:30,425
who gave us his only son
to die for us?

803
01:04:30,426 --> 01:04:33,626
Do you believe in his son, Jesus Christ,
who was crucified for our sins...

804
01:04:33,627 --> 01:04:36,506
rose from the dead,
and is the only way to salvation?

805
01:04:36,507 --> 01:04:38,006
Do you believe and trust
in the Holy Spirit...

806
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:43,281
who enables us to receive God's word,
repent, and believe the Gospels?

807
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:46,074
Say if you believe.

808
01:04:46,075 --> 01:04:48,465
I-

809
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,977
Yes.

810
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:58,074
Do you wish to be baptized
to seal this faith?

811
01:04:58,075 --> 01:05:00,058
Yes.

812
01:05:00,059 --> 01:05:02,229
Close your eyes.

813
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:21,231
Is it done?

814
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:24,727
<i>What's wrong?</i>

815
01:05:24,762 --> 01:05:28,209
Do you know
where my grandmother's a nurse?

816
01:05:29,594 --> 01:05:31,674
Clayton.

817
01:05:31,675 --> 01:05:35,188
I know about your mother, Molly,
and what she believes.

818
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:39,665
Jesus, forgive me for my sins.

819
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:42,392
This will save your soul!

820
01:05:42,393 --> 01:05:44,310
You promised to help me!

821
01:05:44,345 --> 01:05:47,509
I am! I'm saving you!
Now you'll be with God!

822
01:05:47,994 --> 01:05:50,776
Stay down!
I'm sending you to heaven!

823
01:05:50,907 --> 01:05:52,761
I know what you are!

824
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:56,664
I can't let you live!
Don't you see? This is the only way!

825
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:13,716
<i>Oh.</i>

826
01:06:16,058 --> 01:06:18,074
I'm sorry.

827
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:41,466
Molly? My God!
Are you okay?

828
01:06:41,467 --> 01:06:44,026
What happened?
Come here.

829
01:06:44,027 --> 01:06:47,920
Get in the car. It's gonna be okay.

830
01:06:52,506 --> 01:06:55,123
Are you gonna
tell me what happened?

831
01:06:55,963 --> 01:06:59,737
There are a lot of things
that you don't know about me.

832
01:06:59,738 --> 01:07:02,521
Terrible things.

833
01:07:02,522 --> 01:07:05,337
Well, I could probably say
the exact same thing, Molly.

834
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:07,256
No!

835
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,113
You don't understand!

836
01:07:09,114 --> 01:07:13,271
Okay, so explain it to me.
Please, Molly. Just tell me what happened.

837
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:35,833
Hey, Mr. Hartley.
Is, um- Is Molly here?

838
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:37,498
No. No.

839
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:39,418
I just-

840
01:07:39,419 --> 01:07:42,617
- I got her a birthday present, so-
- Yeah, I'll take it.

841
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:45,007
Okay.

842
01:07:46,235 --> 01:07:48,152
Is Molly okay?

843
01:07:48,153 --> 01:07:50,552
Yeah.
I'm sure she's fine.

844
01:07:50,553 --> 01:07:56,304
Um... do you have any idea
where she might be?

845
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:08,505
Say something.

846
01:08:08,506 --> 01:08:12,152
I just think you're tired.
Just go inside and get some sleep.

847
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:14,073
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

848
01:08:14,074 --> 01:08:16,313
Well, what am I supposed to say, Molly?

849
01:08:16,314 --> 01:08:19,576
Do you really expect me to believe
that your soul belongs to the devil?

850
01:08:19,577 --> 01:08:23,952
I mean, don't you realize
how insane that sounds?

851
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,849
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say it like that.

852
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:32,345
No. You're right.

853
01:08:32,346 --> 01:08:34,265
Maybe I am just like my mother.

854
01:08:34,266 --> 01:08:37,881
Maybe- Maybe I am just I-
losing my mind.

855
01:08:37,882 --> 01:08:40,921
No!
There's nothing wrong with you.

856
01:08:40,922 --> 01:08:43,801
I don't know what to do.

857
01:08:43,802 --> 01:08:47,994
We just need to get the hell outta here, away
from your dad, away from this whole damn town.

858
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:49,914
And go where?

859
01:08:49,915 --> 01:08:54,457
My dad keeps a lot of money in the safe,
enough to go practically anywhere.

860
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:56,792
Just you and me.

861
01:08:59,547 --> 01:09:01,935
You don't have to do this.

862
01:09:08,634 --> 01:09:11,317
I'll be right back.
Okay?

863
01:09:47,546 --> 01:09:49,225
This is Amelia Emerson.

864
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:50,704
Please leave me
a detailed message...

865
01:09:50,705 --> 01:09:54,035
and I'll return the call as soon
as possible. Thank you.

866
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:58,070
Dr. Emerson, it's Molly.

867
01:09:59,674 --> 01:10:04,084
Something's happened and I'm in trouble,
and I don't know what to do.

868
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:07,896
I'm at Joseph Young's...

869
01:10:07,897 --> 01:10:10,351
and I'm really scared.

870
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,713
If you could call me back-

871
01:10:14,714 --> 01:10:16,633
<i>Molly!</i>

872
01:10:41,465 --> 01:10:43,555
Joseph?

873
01:10:54,202 --> 01:10:56,291
Joseph?

874
01:11:04,442 --> 01:11:06,530
Joseph?

875
01:11:16,633 --> 01:11:18,723
Joseph?

876
01:11:26,138 --> 01:11:28,227
Joseph?

877
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:17,805
What're you doing?

878
01:12:18,457 --> 01:12:20,440
Are you surprised?

879
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:22,359
<i>It's your birthday, right?</i>

880
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,185
Tomorrow.

881
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:26,105
Well, it's almost tomorrow.

882
01:12:26,106 --> 01:12:29,334
So, happy birthday a few minutes early.

883
01:12:30,874 --> 01:12:33,464
Come on.
Don't you wanna blow out the candle?

884
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:37,432
I wanna get outta here.

885
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:39,416
But what about our party?

886
01:12:39,417 --> 01:12:43,606
Okay, you're scaring me.
What the hell is wrong with you?

887
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:47,224
<i>Joseph, let's go.</i>

888
01:12:47,225 --> 01:12:49,560
Let's go!

889
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:52,883
Fine.

890
01:12:54,553 --> 01:12:57,270
<i>Dr. Emerson,
you got my message.</i>

891
01:12:57,305 --> 01:13:00,824
- Message?
- I called you. I... I left you a message.

892
01:13:00,825 --> 01:13:03,444
No. No message.

893
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:10,105
Then... what're you doing here?

894
01:13:10,106 --> 01:13:12,441
Well, it's your birthday, Molly.
Of course I'm here.

895
01:13:12,442 --> 01:13:14,584
<i>Just a few more minutes now.
How does it feel?</i>

896
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,136
How does what feel?

897
01:13:18,137 --> 01:13:20,471
Your new life.

898
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:24,919
<i>We're all here for you, Molly.
We've watched you grow.</i>

899
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,761
<i>- We've chosen you.
- No.</i>

900
01:13:28,762 --> 01:13:31,151
No?

901
01:13:32,601 --> 01:13:34,989
You knew all along?

902
01:13:36,793 --> 01:13:38,361
You lied to me?

903
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:40,406
You promised to help me!

904
01:13:40,441 --> 01:13:43,193
<i>He is helping you.
We're all helping you.</i>

905
01:13:43,194 --> 01:13:45,233
You're the one, Molly.

906
01:13:45,977 --> 01:13:48,792
Don't you know how lucky you are?

907
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:51,863
<i>- Lucky?
- You'll have power like no one before you.</i>

908
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:54,263
I didn't choose this!

909
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:56,560
Your mother and father
made that choice for you.

910
01:13:56,561 --> 01:13:59,984
They did it to save my life.
That is not a choice.

911
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:01,305
Of course it is.

912
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:05,144
But human weakness
has its consequences. It always has.

913
01:14:05,145 --> 01:14:08,215
<i>D... D... Daddy!</i>

914
01:14:08,216 --> 01:14:10,297
I'm so sorry, Molly!

915
01:14:10,298 --> 01:14:12,888
<i>I didn't... I didn't...</i>

916
01:14:12,889 --> 01:14:16,217
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

917
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,871
I'm here to make you an offer.

918
01:14:21,113 --> 01:14:23,351
I didn't believe.

919
01:14:23,352 --> 01:14:25,463
We gave you exactly what you wanted.

920
01:14:25,464 --> 01:14:28,600
Then take me!
It was my mistake! Take me!

921
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:32,057
God, forgive me.
I- I have sinned.

922
01:14:32,058 --> 01:14:35,256
<i>- I renounce Satan and all-
- What can God offer you?</i>

923
01:14:35,257 --> 01:14:38,776
We've given you everything-
your very life.

924
01:14:38,777 --> 01:14:41,113
And now you have great power
ahead of you.

925
01:14:41,114 --> 01:14:44,344
- I don't want it!
- You will.

926
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:47,351
God always gives us a choice.

927
01:14:47,352 --> 01:14:51,726
Is that what you think?
God gives you a choice?

928
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,903
Your parents determined your fate.
They turned their back on God.

929
01:14:58,904 --> 01:15:00,696
They made a pact.

930
01:15:00,697 --> 01:15:02,616
Maybe if you kill your father...

931
01:15:02,617 --> 01:15:05,145
the pact will be dissolved.

932
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:06,579
What?

933
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:11,471
<i>Of course I can't offer you that choice,
but... maybe God can.</i>

934
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,239
No. No!

935
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,760
Go ahead. Do it.
Just do it.

936
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:19,149
Go on.

937
01:15:24,377 --> 01:15:26,798
Sweetie, I love you.

938
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,159
- It's... It's the only way.
- Just do it.

939
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,429
<i>Please do it.</i>

940
01:15:34,424 --> 01:15:36,845
I'm sorry.

941
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:43,415
<i>I love you.</i>

942
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,553
I've always loved you.

943
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,462
No! No!

944
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:51,314
No, no, no, no!

945
01:16:01,656 --> 01:16:04,371
You've always belonged to us.

946
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:10,709
Welcome.

947
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:13,805
<i>We've been waiting.</i>

948
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:22,264
<i>The patient confessed to the murder
and was brought in about a week ago.</i>

949
01:16:22,265 --> 01:16:24,664
<i>There were several
attempted suicides...</i>

950
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:28,886
<i>as well as paranoid
and religious delusions.</i>

951
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:32,215
I know this is a lot to take in.

952
01:16:32,216 --> 01:16:35,095
We've had him
under observation for a week.

953
01:16:35,096 --> 01:16:38,134
<i>So far there's been no change.</i>

954
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:40,818
I think some interaction with you
might draw him out of his shell.

955
01:16:43,076 --> 01:16:45,719
I can't.
I need to move on.

956
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:48,182
Don't give up on him.
He's your father.

957
01:16:48,183 --> 01:16:49,879
Not anymore.

958
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,559
Miss Hartley, is there
something you wanna tell me?

959
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,959
It's just the way
things were meant to be.

960
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:59,668
I know you'll take
really good care of him.

961
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,534
<i>On a personal note...</i>

962
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:06,296
<i>I would like to thank Huntington Prep
for not only welcoming me into their school...</i>

963
01:17:06,297 --> 01:17:08,950
but for endowing me with
the honor of valedictorian.

964
01:17:08,951 --> 01:17:13,590
<i>In closing, I truly believe that
each one of us has a special destiny...</i>

965
01:17:13,591 --> 01:17:16,567
<i>and we owe it to the world
to fulfill that destiny.</i>

966
01:17:16,568 --> 01:17:19,032
We are the generation
who will change the world...

967
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:21,303
like no one has
changed it before us.

968
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:23,223
You can count on it.

969
01:17:23,224 --> 01:17:25,143
Good luck, everyone!

970
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,925
<i>¶¶</i>

971
01:17:39,225 --> 01:17:41,911
Shall we?

972
01:17:41,912 --> 01:17:44,215
<i>- Congratulations, Molly.
- Thank you.</i>

973
01:17:44,216 --> 01:17:46,260
See you soon.

974
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:50,036
<i>¶ These prints can't lie ¶</i>

975

982
01:18:19,319 --> 01:18:22,487

<i>¶ But these prints can't lie ¶</i>

990
01:18:41,432 --> 01:18:44,404
<i>¶ Nine or 10 songs
I had let pass before ¶</i>

991
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:47,383
<i>¶ I have broke that
first thought progression ¶</i>

992
01:18:47,384 --> 01:18:50,487
<i>¶ And there we were
in the same restaurant ¶</i>

993
01:18:50,488 --> 01:18:53,334

underneath the table ¶</i>
