00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,839
They actually
pay you forthis...

2
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,841
...to tag beaver?

3
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:55,793
Imagine.

4
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:56,795
Was that,
like, sarcastic?

5
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:59,850
'Cause I know what you
Fish and Game guys think...

6
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:01,801
...of county sheriffs.

7
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:03,856
We know you like to
give these one-word...

8
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,858
...sarcastic answers.

9
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,810
Gee.

10
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:09,812
You ask me...

11
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,866
...whatan animal
does in the wild...

12
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,816
...is his own business.

13
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:16,872
So long as he
doesn't do itto man.

14
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,874
I think Mark Twain
said that.

15
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,825
Yeah, I think he didn't.

16
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:24,871
...butsince you said it,
I guess we're covered.

17
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:45,899
Everyone's a comedian,
sarcastic.

18
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:07,962
I'm sleepin'?

19
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:10,017
And right in the middle
of a good dream?

20
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,967
And all atonce
I wake up?

21
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:16,024
From something that keeps
knocking atmy brain?

22
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,974
Before I go insane?

23
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,022
I hold my pillow
to my head?...

24
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:58,068
Aah! Aah!

25
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,030
So whatam I
so afraid of?

26
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:03,086
I'm afraid
that I'm notsure of...

27
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:05,088
Help!

28
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:10,042
I think I love you?

29
00:06:10,094 --> 00:06:13,097
Isn't that what life
is made of?

30
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:15,101
Though it worries?...

31
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:16,629
Aah ha!

32
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:19,390
Ohh! Ohh!

33
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:22,099
No! Aah!

34
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:44,137
Aah!

35
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:50,145
Ohh! Don't let go!

36
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:54,139
Oh ho ho!

37
00:06:56,152 --> 00:07:00,147
Aah!

38
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,161
Aw,Jesus Christ.

39
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,144
Kelly?

40
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:31,198
Hey, Kevin.

41
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,148
Hi.

42
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,203
Listen, uh, could I
stealyou for a minute?

43
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,167
What are you doing?

44
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,221
Heavy breathing,
meditating.

45
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,171
Meditating?

46
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:52,173
Yes. To relieve stress.

47
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,726
Remember, Myra,
you're the one...

48
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,176
...who taughtme
all about breathing.

49
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:57,232
Yes, butyou're doing Lamaze.
are you giving birth?

50
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,235
If you're upset,
long, deep breaths.

51
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,242
Kevin dumped me.

52
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:09,195
I know.

53
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:10,196
He told you?

54
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:14,243
Well, I sort of had, uh,
inside information.

55
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,209
You?

56
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:22,263
Itstarted before you,
Kelly.

57
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:23,264
I neverwould have-

58
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,213
You?

59
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:27,270
Itwas justa quick thing
thatwe thoughtwas over...

60
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:29,272
...and... it's notover.

61
00:08:29,324 --> 00:08:31,223
You and Kevin.

62
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:35,274
I- I wish I could
say something to...

63
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:39,274
...the heartwants
whatthe heartwants.

64
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,300
Sheriff Keough?

65
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:52,249
Yeah.

66
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:54,805
Fish and Game.
Jack Wells.

67
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:57,308
Any recent
bear attacks?

68
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,258
This was no bear.

69
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,312
Bears don'tattack
people underwater.

70
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:03,264
Probably a beaver,then.

71
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:07,309
Ah, a whole sentence
sarcastic.

72
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:19,336
Thatthe way
he came outofthe water?

73
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:23,331
Yeah.

74
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,305
Hey.

75
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,360
Hey, Kevin,what's going on?
What's happening?

76
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,363
How's it goin'?
How's yourfamily? Good?

77
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:41,365
It's great.
So nice to see you.

78
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,314
Fuck off.

79
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:43,315
This is business.

80
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,319
There was an accident
in Maine.

81
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:49,374
Some guy got killed
by something in a lake.

82
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:52,379
Probably a bear,
butthey found a tooth.

83
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:53,329
Atooth?

84
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:54,330
Afragmentof a tooth...

85
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:57,334
...one they say couldn't
have come from any bear.

86
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:01,390
Evidently it looks prehistoric,
like maybe a dinosaur.

87
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:03,393
Oh,well,then I'm sure
thatthat's what itwas.

88
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,395
He was killed
by a dinosaur.

89
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,924
Is there anything else?

90
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:08,400
I, uh,wantyou
to go there.

91
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,350
What?

92
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,405
It's probably nothing,
butyou're a paleontologist.

93
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,356
This is whatwe do.

94
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,909
What do you mean,
this is whatwe do?

95
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,411
I'd like you to
check outthis tooth.

96
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:20,363
I'm nota field person.

97
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:23,914
Well, on this one,
I would like you to be.

98
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:27,413
You wantme to go to Maine
to look ata tooth?

99
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:31,428
Oh,this was Myra's
idea,wasn't it?

100
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,379
- Uh-
- Oh, of course.

101
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:34,432
Getme outofthe office
for a few days...

102
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:35,382
...waittill I cool off...

103
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,384
It has nothing
to do with that.

104
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,439
I don't do field work,
and even if I did, Maine?

105
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:41,389
I'm allergic to timber.

106
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,443
- Kelly.
- I am not going to Maine.

107
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,446
I'm not going
to Maine.

108
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:49,441
It's ridiculous.

109
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,406
It's gonna be rough...

110
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,460
...as we go over
these mountains.

111
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:59,490
Yeah,that's fine.
Thank you.

112
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,506
We're doing
the bestwe can.

113
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:05,472
Could you not
talk to me?

114
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:09,466
Thank you.

115
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:17,488
Keough:
Justcame up screaming.

116
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,438
Kelly:What did he say?

117
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,494
Just kind of gurgled.
He was pretty much dead.

118
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,444
You didn'tsee anything?

119
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,498
The lake was calm
until up he came.

120
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,448
The tooth is in here.

121
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,502
Oh,that's-
that's the morgue.

122
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,452
Yes.

123
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:34,009
Well, is the dead guy
in there?

124
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,513
That's where they
keep them.

125
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,463
Look...

126
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:40,517
...you wantme to bring
the tooth out here?

127
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:41,466
No.

128
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,021
No. Let's...

129
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,523
Afteryou.

130
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:49,530
This is reptilian.
And this is nota fossil.

131
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:51,532
You really pulled this
outofthis guy?

132
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,482
Yes, I did.

133
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:56,538
I'll need to get
a microscopic look at it.

134
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,539
There you go.

135
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:01,493
Great.

136
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,546
Maybe I should see-

137
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,497
I wouldn't.

138
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:09,543
I can deal with
dead men-bodies.

139
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,509
Ohh.

140
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:18,555
Uhh. Ohh,jeez.

141
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:25,575
How long did this attack
go on for?

142
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,526
Seconds.
8 maybe 10.

143
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:31,583
Oh, and, uh,this is how
he came up to the boat?

144
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,611
Yes.

145
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,535
Uh-huh.

146
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:39,541
I'd like
to see this lake.

147
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,544
Keough: Nobody lives
within 25 miles of it...

148
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,601
...exceptsome old couple
who live righton the lake.

149
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:47,603
Teenagers trek in
every once in a while...

150
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:49,554
...to skinny-dip.

151
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:51,556
None have disappeared.

152
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:53,610
None have spotted
anything unusual.

153
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,613
Did you talk
to the old couple?

154
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:56,562
Notyet.

155
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,617
What kind of backup
do we have?

156
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,145
We?

157
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,569
What?

158
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,625
I'm a little unclear
as to why the museum...

159
00:13:04,677 --> 00:13:05,575
...would send
somebody here.

160
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:07,129
You gota thing
againstmuseums?

161
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,631
No, I got nothing
againstmuseums.

162
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:12,625
Ever been in one?

163
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,590
What is that?

164
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:19,645
Lightweightforward-area
air-device unit.

165
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,595
Whatever's outthere...

166
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:23,649
...one shotwith this,
it's dead.

167
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,652
Why exactly
would you have that?

168
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:31,649
God.

169
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:36,666
Mosquitoes. I gota thing
aboutmosquitoes.

170
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:37,668
If you're all set,
let's go.

171
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,618
We're saved.

172
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,619
Amuseum in New York...

173
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,676
...just sent us some
additional backup.

174
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:45,704
Kelly Scott.

175
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:47,680
Jack Wells.

176
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:48,629
Hi.

177
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,632
Uh, some museum
sentyou, huh?

178
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,686
What, are we all
museum bigots in Maine?

179
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,635
She's rude sarcastic.

180
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:55,638
You two should
get along.

181
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,693
I'm afraid I can't letyou
go with us, ma'am.

182
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,643
Sheriff Keough
said I could.

183
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:01,698
Unfortunately, Fish and Game
supersedes the sheriff.

184
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,701
Why do you have to supersede?
Maybe I might be of-

185
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:04,650
Ma'am, look...

186
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,704
...this isn'tsome kind of
fact-finding expedition.

187
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,655
Yes, I knowthat.

188
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:09,656
It's nota science trip.

189
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,212
Could you be
a little more condescending?

190
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:14,663
'Cause I'm not real great
with subtlety.

191
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:16,717
Something in that lake
killed somebody, right?

192
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,667
I appreciate
you're trying to help.

193
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,723
I'm really glad that you
brought the raid.

194
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:22,672
Now,that's better.

195
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:23,673
Ma'am,
it's not gonna work-

196
00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:25,729
If you call me "ma'am"
one more time, I'll sue you...

197
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,730
...and with today's laws,
it's possible.

198
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,682
She's good.

199
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,685
Look, I won't interfere.

200
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,687
And if I do,you've got
a sheriff handy to arrestme...

201
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,742
...but I understand if I threaten
your Fish and Game authority-

202
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:37,692
Excuse me.

203
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,693
Is ittrue
you're going to look...

204
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,696
...for some kind of monster
in Black Lake?

205
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,752
Well,we're just gonna
investigate an accident.

206
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:44,701
There's no monster.

207
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,755
We heard a man
was bit in half.

208
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,705
Well,
there was an accident.

209
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:52,751
That's all. It's
nothing to worry about.

210
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,720
Oh, please.

211
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,766
All right. Let's go.

212
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:25,306
Well, my husband
passed away.

213
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,757
It's been
almost 2 years now.

214
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,811
My department doesn't
have any record ofthat...

215
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,339
Mrs. Bickerman.

216
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:32,763
Well, I'm sorry.

217
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,766
Incomplete records
hauntme so.

218
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,822
Whatwas the cause
of your husband's death...

219
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:40,773
...ma'am, do you know?

220
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,827
We don't mean
to invade your privacy...

221
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,830
...but was he ill?
Was he sick?

222
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:45,857
Was he swallowed?

223
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:46,780
Sheriff!.

224
00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:48,834
Uh, Mrs. Bickerman,
the reason we're here.

225
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:50,839
Aman was fatally
attacked yesterday...

226
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:53,790
...by some animal
in this lake.

227
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,845
Do you know
howyour husband died?

228
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:56,794
Oh,yes.

229
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,349
I killed him.

230
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,852
You killed him?

231
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:02,801
Oh,yes.

232
00:16:02,853 --> 00:16:03,802
Wells: Uh...

233
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:07,860
...and how would you have
accomplished this, ma'am?

234
00:16:07,912 --> 00:16:08,809
Well...

235
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,811
He was very sick...

236
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:13,815
...and-and he refused
to go to a doctor.

237
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:16,870
He'd be coherent one day
and incoherent the next.

238
00:16:16,922 --> 00:16:19,824
And,well,
one coherent day...

239
00:16:19,876 --> 00:16:20,877
...he asked me to end
his suffering.

240
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,827
And, um...

241
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,831
...he kept insisting
and insisting...

242
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:28,386
...and then,well,
finally Ijust gave in...

243
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,889
...and I hit him on the head
with a skillet...

244
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:34,883
...then buried him
out at the bulkhead.

245
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,899
Well, dig him up
if you don't believe me...

246
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:42,893
Sherlock.

247
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,414
Keough: Half mile up
there's a clearing.

248
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,917
What's with the water?
It's so black.

249
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,867
There's no waves
or anything.

250
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,922
Well,theywanted to
call it "Lake Placid,"

251
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,926
...butsomebody said
that name was taken.

252
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,879
It's too bad.

253
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,881
Tents were sent
ahead.

254
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:05,934
They should
already be set up...

255
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:07,937
...by the time
we getthere.

256
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:08,886
Tents?

257
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:09,887
We're staying
in tents?

258
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:12,944
I told you, 2 days
we'd have to camp.

259
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:14,894
Yes, camp...

260
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,447
...but I thought that meant
"Ramada Inn. "

261
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:17,950
I never heard tents.
Will there be toilets?

262
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,479
Maybe we should
justtake you back.

263
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:22,956
Why, because
I prefer a toilet?

264
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:23,905
Oh, God.

265
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,960
We forgot to pack
feminine napkins.

266
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:26,961
Oh, so you're
with him now?

267
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:27,910
Taking his side.

268
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:29,912
I didn't
say a word.

269
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,967
Oh, no, maybe I should
just wipe myself...

270
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,970
...with some leafy little piece
of poison oak.

271
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:34,919
And then I could
spend the whole day...

272
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,975
...scratching my ass,
blending in with the natives.

273
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,926
Then you'd be back
on my side.

274
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:41,980
You know,you really
don't have to bother...

275
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:43,983
...telling people
you're from New York.

276
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:44,984
What the hell
is that?

277
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:45,934
What?

278
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:49,991
There. I thought
I saw something.

279
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,994
Kelly:
Looks like a branch.

280
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,997
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,025
Aah!

282
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,949
Hey.

283
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,504
You threw it at me!

284
00:18:00,556 --> 00:18:02,282
Ijust let go of it.

285
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,671
You threw it at me!

286
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:05,009
Did you see that?
Oh!

287
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:05,958
Ma'am!

288
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,962
Stop hitting me.

289
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:09,515
Don't throw heads
at me!

290
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,017
Stop calling me
"ma'am!"

291
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,545
Aw,Jesus.

292
00:18:12,597 --> 00:18:13,969
Oh, God.

293
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,973
So, sheriff...

294
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:21,019
...howm any deputies you got?

295
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:28,027
What?

296
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:32,993
Could it be a bear?

297
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,996
I mean,the bears
get big here, right?

298
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:39,054
Hmm. I don't think a bear
could bite off a moose's head.

299
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:41,056
Everything you need
should be in there.

300
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,008
Ok. Good. Good.

301
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,061
So will we be
tent-mates then?

302
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,063
Nope.
This is all yours.

303
00:18:46,115 --> 00:18:47,591
Ohh. Great.

304
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:49,015
Excellent.

305
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,568
If there's anything else
you need...

306
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,346
Uh, one thing
I wanted to ask you.

307
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,072
Uh,what's it like
to be a woman...

308
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:56,023
...in the woods of Maine?

309
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:58,078
I mean,the guys don't turn
all horny or anything...

310
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,073
...like they did in
Deliverance, right?

311
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,036
Oh.

312
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:08,091
I knew you were there.

313
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,041
Hmm.

314
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,044
Never been to Maine
before, huh?

315
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:16,101
I have good hygiene.
I'm not welcome.

316
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:17,102
Why are you here,
really?

317
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:19,053
I told you.

318
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:21,107
A museum doesn't send an
investigator into the woods-

319
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,056
How would you know...

320
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,109
...what a museum would
or would not do exactly?

321
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,060
Well, even if they did...

322
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:28,116
I doubtwhether he or she
would have problems with tents.

323
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,065
So I don't like tents.
Why-

324
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:31,121
Oh,you don't like tents,
and you don't like mosquitoes.

325
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:32,148
Well, nobody likes
mosquit-

326
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,071
Look at
your finger nails.

327
00:19:33,123 --> 00:19:35,073
What's wrong
with my finger nails?

328
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,126
You have as much business
being in the woods...

329
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:38,077
...as Emily Post.

330
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,078
No, it doesn't make sense.

331
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,635
They sent you out here
to examine a tooth.

332
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:46,139
And what are you doing
out here on the lake?

333
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:48,668
Oh, no.

334
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,093
What?

335
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:55,151
Ifthis is
who I think it is...

336
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:56,679
It is.

337
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,103
Who?

338
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,104
Hector Cyr.

339
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,150
He's this rich, kook
mythology professor.

340
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,117
You know him?

341
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:11,171
He's done some work
with our museum.

342
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:14,175
He also treks the world to s...

343
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:15,124
What?

344
00:20:15,176 --> 00:20:19,170
To swim with crocodiles.

345
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:22,684
Crocodiles?

346
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,136
If he's here...

347
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:27,192
...he must think
you've gotone.

348
00:20:27,244 --> 00:20:28,141
Oh, look...

349
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,144
I admit I'm no
brain scientist...

350
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:33,200
...but I do know there's
no way a crocodile...

351
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:37,194
...can be in Maine, right?

352
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,209
You beat me!

353
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,159
Balls!

354
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:43,161
Splendid lake, eh?

355
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,215
Became a man
on a lake like this.

356
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,243
Rubber raft.

357
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:49,168
Sylvia Blake.

358
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,170
She gave a like a cow.

359
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:52,225
Who do we have
from Fish and Game?

360
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,174
Me.

361
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:54,176
Who is this man?

362
00:20:54,228 --> 00:20:56,230
I can see the algae blooms
justcoming in.

363
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:58,232
Look almost stagnant.

364
00:20:58,284 --> 00:20:59,181
Hector Cyr.

365
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,235
Oh,the earth is round
and so should you be.

366
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,185
Who is he?

367
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:04,187
I need topographic studies.
You got any?

368
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:06,242
You don't justfly in here
and start barking orders.

369
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,245
I apologize. Ijust don't
wantto lose the light...

370
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,772
...when we gottime
for a quick scout.

371
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:11,248
Have you had
a little work done?

372
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,275
I have not.

373
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:13,199
Who are you?

374
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,201
Hector Cyr.
I said itonce.

375
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,254
Letme know
when its inks in, ok?

376
00:21:16,306 --> 00:21:17,255
Have you seen it?

377
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:18,205
No.

378
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:20,260
Excuse me.
You came here to...

379
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,263
...help you find it.

380
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,264
A crocodile?

381
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,214
Yeah.

382
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,767
They've been migrating north,
you know?

383
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,545
This lake does connect
to the ocean.

384
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:29,271
It's not as far fetched
as it may sound.

385
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:31,222
Crocodiles can't swim
in saltwater.

386
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:34,277
Yeah,well,that'll be
your little secret.

387
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,306
Come on.
We're losing time.

388
00:21:36,358 --> 00:21:38,283
Why did the big one
heckle me?

389
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:42,277
Hey, pal...

390
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,824
If he's close,
we'll find him.

391
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:14,104
Their signatures
are unmistakable.

392
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:17,332
She tellyou
that we had sex together?

393
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:18,282
So vigorous!

394
00:22:18,335 --> 00:22:20,285
I never had sex
with you.

395
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:24,343
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

396
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:25,370
God.

397
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:26,384
Wait.

398
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:27,346
Stop!

399
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:35,304
Thought
I heard something.

400
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,359
I don't mean
to be discourteous...

401
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,309
...but, uh, how is it...

402
00:22:39,361 --> 00:22:41,364
...a person could come
to believe...

403
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,392
...a crocodile
is in New England?

404
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:45,317
How could it
survive winter?

405
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,372
Long as their nostrils
don't freeze...

406
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:48,322
...they survive.

407
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:49,875
Am I foolish
to explain things?

408
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:51,377
He had such trouble
with my name.

409
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:53,327
- Hector.
- Hey.

410
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:54,381
Is this
where it happened?

411
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,331
Around here.
Yeah.

412
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:58,385
We're a mile from the ocean.
Could've easily made it here.

413
00:22:58,437 --> 00:22:59,386
Kelly:Assuming he got
this far up the seaboard.

414
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:02,339
The big ones
have been on the move.

415
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:04,393
What have I been telling you?
You call me crazy.

416
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:06,396
Kelly:
Hector,just paddle.

417
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,346
You know, Sheriff...

418
00:23:08,398 --> 00:23:10,401
...when friends or family
say things...

419
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:11,350
...they tend not to register...

420
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,405
...so sometimes it helps
to hear it...

421
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:14,406
...from a total stranger.

422
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,435
You're fat.

423
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,412
Jesus. Hector!

424
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,361
Oh,yeah.

425
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:22,416
Kelly:What's that?

426
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,444
What is it?

427
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:26,369
White perch.

428
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:27,922
Are they feeding?

429
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,202
They aren'tfeeding.

430
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,342
They're scared.

431
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:33,913
- Aah!
- Aah!

432
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:35,199
Wells:Jesus!

433
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:36,435
Cyr: Oh!

434
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:40,428
Oh!

435
00:23:42,442 --> 00:23:44,444
Get your legs
out of the water.

436
00:23:44,497 --> 00:23:45,394
Don't move
your legs.

437
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:47,943
Keough:
Are you kidding me?

438
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:50,441
Cyr:
Keep your legs still.

439
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:53,403
Get off!.

440
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:54,457
Hector,
to the left.

441
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:55,984
Move it left!

442
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,408
Paddle, paddle!

443
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,465
No one actually saw
anything.

444
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:02,415
Yes, I realize that, sir...

445
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:03,416
...but something
flipped us over...

446
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:06,473
...and I doubt very much
if it was a mink.

447
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:07,422
I am a paleontologist.

448
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,476
I work for
a natural history museum.

449
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:10,425
I am notsome-

450
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:12,480
They don't believe her.

451
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:13,431
Thank you.

452
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:15,485
It's so rewarding to
imagine my tax dollar...

453
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,487
...finding its way to you,
you fuck-shit!

454
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,491
You're a saucy flirt.

455
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,440
You were right.

456
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:23,494
U.S.Wildlife
won'tsend anybody...

457
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,496
...without
a confirmation.

458
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,498
We don't need 'em.

459
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,525
Sheriff.

460
00:24:27,577 --> 00:24:28,449
Yeah?

461
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:32,496
Might wanna come
take a look atthis.

462
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:34,509
Oh, my God.

463
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:35,458
Worms.

464
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,513
Oh, I gota thing
about worms.

465
00:24:37,565 --> 00:24:41,506
It's a human toe.

466
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,523
Some decomposition,
a little acidic-

467
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:49,517
...definitely
been swallowed.

468
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,534
Is this the man
who was killed?

469
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,537
He seemed taller.

470
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:58,488
Phew.

471
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,042
You gota croc,
all right.

472
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:01,820
They're
a keystone species.

473
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,494
Did he just
explain something?

474
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:06,550
Keystone species effects
the whole ecosystem.

475
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,552
That would explain
these worms...

476
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:11,582
...and those perch.

477
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:15,094
We gota crocodile.

478
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,554
Here's yourfriend.

479
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:35,587
TomJones:
It's not unusual?

480
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,589
To be loved by anyone?

481
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:40,541
It's not unusual?

482
00:25:40,593 --> 00:25:44,546
To have fun with anyone?

483
00:25:44,598 --> 00:25:46,600
But when I see you
hangin' around?

484
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:49,552
With anyone?

485
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:50,605
It's not unusual?...

486
00:25:50,657 --> 00:25:51,606
He paid us.

487
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,558
500.

488
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,560
It's a trap.

489
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:58,616
You accepted money
from him?

490
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:02,569
We took a check.

491
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,574
When I see you
outand about?

492
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:07,628
Law enforcement
is very dangerous work...

493
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,578
...isn't it?

494
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,634
And you have such
big,wonderful boobs.

495
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:13,161
Ha ha. Thank you.

496
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:14,926
It's not unusual?

497
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:16,639
It happens every day?

498
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:17,589
Hey!

499
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:20,592
- Hey! -
Hey! - Hey!

500
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:21,646
You're on
official business.

501
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,598
This is not a party.

502
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,652
Yeah, but now
that you're here...

503
00:26:25,704 --> 00:26:26,679
Whoo!

504
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:27,693
Yeah!

505
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:28,655
Quiet!

506
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,661
What's with digging
the holes?

507
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,664
Well, crocodiles are-

508
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:37,615
...are very brazen.

509
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,617
They like to come on land...

510
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,672
...and of course
they're attracted to noise.

511
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,674
Everybody out!
Back to your tents!

512
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:44,623
Now!

513
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:46,677
Oh, could she stay?

514
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:47,627
We were...

515
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,681
...we were hoping to mate.

516
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,711
No.

517
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:54,637
Out.

518
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:55,690
Now,you listen...

519
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,693
If it were up to me,
you'd be on your way home.

520
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:00,221
But I'm not in charge.

521
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:01,986
That's a shockerthere.

522
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:03,647
I'm going to say this...

523
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,704
...because I believe in being
straightwith people.

524
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:09,707
I think you are a mental.

525
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,659
Sheriff...

526
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:14,713
I appreciate your candor.
Really, I do.

527
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:16,742
I think it's always good
to know...

528
00:27:16,794 --> 00:27:18,719
...where somebody's
coming from...

529
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:19,668
...and,frankly...

530
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,715
...your origins have been
a bitof a mystery to me.

531
00:27:41,748 --> 00:27:44,700
Look howflat
thatwater is.

532
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:47,756
You could get 10 skips
on a good one, easy.

533
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:48,706
Sorry?

534
00:27:48,758 --> 00:27:52,762
Skipping stones.

535
00:27:52,814 --> 00:27:53,712
Growing up...

536
00:27:53,764 --> 00:27:55,766
I used to summer
atmy grandparents' place...

537
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:58,296
...on a lake like this.

538
00:27:58,348 --> 00:28:00,721
I'd skip stones all day.

539
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:02,775
Beat playing
with the other kids.

540
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:06,729
I'm sure it did.

541
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:09,732
Look, I think it's best...

542
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:11,788
...if you stayed onshore
a while.

543
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,737
I beg your pardon?

544
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:14,739
I'm not trying
to pick a fight...

545
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,793
...but what ever's out there
did flip a canoe.

546
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:18,797
I am not
staying onshore.

547
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:20,747
It's dangerous.

548
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,801
No, I didn't fly up here
just to roast marshmallows.

549
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:24,804
Why did you fly up here?

550
00:28:24,856 --> 00:28:25,753
Look...

551
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,807
...paleontologists are not
sentto Maine...

552
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:28,756
...to huntfor crocodiles.

553
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:30,811
I was sent up here
to look atthe tooth.

554
00:28:30,863 --> 00:28:32,762
You looked atthe tooth.

555
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:36,808
What are you doing
out here?

556
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,772
I was dating my boss...

557
00:28:40,824 --> 00:28:44,829
...and he turned out to be
involved with a coworker...

558
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,780
...who was also my friend.

559
00:28:46,832 --> 00:28:48,835
And for the sake
of comfort-theirs-

560
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:50,785
I was shipped off
to Maine.

561
00:28:50,837 --> 00:28:54,831
And I don't feel
like going back yet.

562
00:28:56,844 --> 00:28:59,796
I'm not making it up.

563
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:00,850
Still,you don't
have to stay out here.

564
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:02,800
I mean,
you can stay in town.

565
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,854
I've come. I'm here.
I'm staying...

566
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:05,857
...unless there are ticks.

567
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:07,807
I know crocodiles.

568
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:09,809
And I won't
get in yourway.

569
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:13,855
Ijust really do want
to be a part ofthis.

570
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:20,870
7:00 A.M.?

571
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:23,868
Thank you.

572
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,886
Good night.

573
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,884
Thank you.

574
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,970
Jesus fucking Christ!

575
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:17,524
Ohh. Whatthe hell
are you doing?

576
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,801
Whatthe hell
are you doing?

577
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:20,027
Oh,Jesus.
You clowning around?

578
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,028
I'm laying
a spring trap!

579
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,977
Aspring trap?

580
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:24,033
I keep telling you
they can come on land.

581
00:31:24,086 --> 00:31:25,984
I could've shotyou.

582
00:31:26,036 --> 00:31:28,038
This could end up
saving your life...

583
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,566
...which is meaningful
for you...

584
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:30,990
...because the more
you live...

585
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:33,044
...the more sex you getto
have with your sister!

586
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:33,993
What's going on?

587
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:36,048
He's crawling around
like a cockroach here.

588
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,997
I don'tcare
how much money-

589
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,551
He's waving
his little wang around!

590
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,054
He's scaring the shit
outof me!

591
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,004
How big is this?

592
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,557
All right, all right!

593
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,007
I'll say this once.

594
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,060
Your fancy equipment
aside...

595
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,011
...which we appreciate-

596
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:50,067
...if you interfere,
you're gone.

597
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,062
Simple as that.

598
00:31:57,076 --> 00:32:00,080
How much of a wacko
is this guy?

599
00:32:00,132 --> 00:32:02,030
Well...

600
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:04,032
...the thing about Hector...

601
00:32:04,084 --> 00:32:06,087
...is he takes this
crocodile business very...

602
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:08,038
Oh, man.

603
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,092
He thinks they're godly.

604
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,620
Whatwas that?

605
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:13,044
In his defense...

606
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:15,098
...every primitive culture
known to man deified them.

607
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,103
Ancient China, Egypt,
Australia,Asia.

608
00:32:18,155 --> 00:32:20,053
Going back in history...

609
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,108
...crocodiles have been
more worshipped than Jesus.

610
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,636
Is this supposed
to make us...

611
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:25,060
...take him
more seriously?

612
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,114
No, it's supposed to make you
understand him.

613
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,065
He's a mythology professor.

614
00:32:29,117 --> 00:32:31,119
He believes
thatthey're divine conduits.

615
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:33,069
And he can find them...

616
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:34,122
...so we should try
to put up with him.

617
00:32:34,174 --> 00:32:37,075
He's a fruitcake.

618
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,129
We should get
some sleep.

619
00:32:39,181 --> 00:32:40,156
Yeah.

620
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,170
Aah!

621
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:42,081
Damn it!

622
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:46,127
And he's a good trapper.

623
00:33:07,165 --> 00:33:09,167
We can expect
a quick response...

624
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:10,116
...if he hears that.

625
00:33:10,168 --> 00:33:14,174
Adult crocs will move
on distressed hatchlings.

626
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,175
Again, I don'tmean
to be annoying...

627
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,126
...with my questions...

628
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:18,679
...but if
it is a crocodile...

629
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,130
...which I don'tthink
it is...

630
00:33:20,182 --> 00:33:23,185
...and they do charge these
baby hatchling sounds...

631
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:26,189
...why would you want to be
underwater at the time?

632
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:28,139
With you,
it makes sense.

633
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,141
You see, Sheriff,
the thing is...

634
00:33:29,193 --> 00:33:30,694
...they don't really
attack underwater.

635
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:32,145
ThatWalt guy
got hit underwater.

636
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:34,200
True. They don'tsee
that well underwater.

637
00:33:34,252 --> 00:33:36,203
They have nictitating
lenses on their eyes...

638
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:37,730
Burke, stop here.

639
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,154
- Now?
- Yeah.

640
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:41,158
...You dive underwater...

641
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,159
...and they probably won't
be able to see you.

642
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:44,213
Wells: I hate to interrupt
but we got work to do.

643
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:46,241
Hey,we can talk if we want.

644
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,167
Yeah,we can talk
if we want.

645
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:52,212
Would you mind putting down
the anchor?

646
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:55,227
Wait till
we're down there...

647
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,229
...before you turn
that thing on.

648
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:59,180
Got it.

649
00:33:59,232 --> 00:34:02,236
Let's go, Hector.

650
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:06,230
Good luck.

651
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,202
I brought a pork chop
for luck.

652
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,257
Maybe you can hang it
around you neck.

653
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:20,207
That's sweet.

654
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,262
Maybe later you can
chew the bark...

655
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:26,255
...off my big,fat log.

656
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,264
Was that, like,
a homosexual remark?

657
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:39,272
Don'task me.

658
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:29,296
Could be a mental.

659
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:31,351
I heard if a mental person
is rich enough...

660
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:32,352
...they justcall him
eccentric.

661
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:34,303
He's notmental.

662
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:36,305
He's seen every crocodile
in the world.

663
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:38,359
He even swam in the Grametti
with killer Niles.

664
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:40,310
He never got nipped.

665
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:42,364
And that's why he thinks
they're godly-

666
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:43,366
'Cause they don't
bite him?

667
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:45,316
I don't know.

668
00:35:45,368 --> 00:35:47,371
He said he knew it when
he looked in their eyes.

669
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:51,364
"Eyes of a Dragon. "

670
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:58,451
So much for crocodiles.

671
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:04,469
It's probably on land.

672
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:08,462
Yeah, right.

673
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,477
What was that?

674
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,480
I don't know.

675
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,008
Aah!

676
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,433
Shit.

677
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,489
Hey! Something's got
the anchor line!

678
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,491
Untie it!
Untie the line!

679
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:22,518
I'm trying!

680
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,533
Keough: Hurry!

681
00:37:23,585 --> 00:37:24,496
Cutthe line!

682
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:26,446
Right!

683
00:37:26,498 --> 00:37:28,501
Keough: Shit!

684
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:31,452
...come on.

685
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:33,006
What happened?

686
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:34,508
I don't know.

687
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,512
Hurry. Hurry up.

688
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:43,508
Must've just let go.

689
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,024
Come on.

690
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,527
Shit! Hurry!

691
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,532
Hank!

692
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:58,528
Ok!

693
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:08,540
Oh!

694
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:14,548
Hurry!

695
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:17,511
Hurry.

696
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:21,557
My God,
it's right underyou!

697
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,522
Aah! Oh, Christ.

698
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:27,575
Come on,
get in the boat.

699
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,578
You all right?

700
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,527
Yeah.

701
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,581
Where's Hector?

702
00:38:33,582 --> 00:38:34,532
I losttrack.

703
00:38:34,584 --> 00:38:38,578
We went different
directions.

704
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:47,590
There's some bubbles
overthere.

705
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:57,562
Pull it up.

706
00:38:57,614 --> 00:39:01,618
All right. Come on.
Bring him aboard.

707
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,619
Hector:What's happened?

708
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:03,569
Come on.

709
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:05,624
You see it?
How big is it?

710
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,575
Shut up
and geton board.

711
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:09,631
We losttrack of it.
Burke, pull up the speaker!

712
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:13,635
Are you all right?

713
00:39:24,649 --> 00:39:25,650
- Grab him!
- Aah!

714
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:29,180
Pull him in!

715
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,446
Aah! Aah!

716
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:34,081
That it?

717
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,613
Yeah.

718
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,667
Nobody actually saw it.
It happened suddenly.

719
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,671
Didn't get caught
in the out board?

720
00:39:41,723 --> 00:39:45,665
It wasn't the outboard.

721
00:39:51,684 --> 00:39:55,677
Tell them
to get here fast, huh?

722
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,694
You ok?

723
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:03,725
Kelly?

724
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,651
Yeah.

725
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,705
Nobody saw anything.

726
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:11,657
No.

727
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,659
U.S Wildlife's
on theirway.

728
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,215
The police wantto keep
everything quiet...

729
00:40:16,267 --> 00:40:18,718
...so the press doesn't
getwind of anything.

730
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,722
Everybody just wants us
to...

731
00:40:21,774 --> 00:40:25,715
"Sit tight. "

732
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:33,738
Are you... Ok?

733
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,266
Well...

734
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:38,743
...you know...

735
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:42,737
Yeah.

736
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:48,255
Well, Sheriff,
I'm, uh...

737
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:51,760
Very sorry
about your deputy.

738
00:40:51,812 --> 00:40:54,763
He was a good man?

739
00:40:54,815 --> 00:40:58,719
Yep.

740
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:00,721
Whenever somebody dies,
I...

741
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:03,276
I always think
that it's such a waste...

742
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:05,779
...that I didn't know them
any better.

743
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:09,784
Sorry for your loss,
Hector.

744
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:13,778
Not really what I meant.

745
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,794
Head was just...

746
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:21,747
...bitten off.

747
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:23,801
You know, I used to have
a recurring nightmare...

748
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:25,751
...that I was headless.

749
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:26,753
I'd be down
on the ground...

750
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:28,757
...looking up atmy body,
no head...

751
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:31,812
...just walking around
bumping into everything.

752
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,763
And my parents...

753
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:35,765
...wouldn't letme
in the house.

754
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:37,819
Because they just bought
all these antique lamps...

755
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:38,820
...and they didn't wantme
to knock them over...

756
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:39,770
...the fuckers.

757
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:42,774
Then the neighborhood
bullies...

758
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:43,827
...they'd see my round
head on the ground...

759
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:45,355
...looking like a ball...

760
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:46,779
...and they'd come over...

761
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:48,332
...and they'd start
a soccer game.

762
00:41:48,384 --> 00:41:50,110
And as I was being
kicked around...

763
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:52,996
I'd actually
just feel grateful...

764
00:41:53,048 --> 00:41:55,831
...for being allowed
in the game.

765
00:41:56,844 --> 00:41:58,847
What are-
what are your thoughts?

766
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:01,798
You know, Hector...

767
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,853
I'm sure
you're a fine person...

768
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:06,804
...in your own mental way...

769
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:09,353
...but I think it would be best...

770
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:11,852
...if you and I didn't speak.

771
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,816
Yaaah!

772
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:18,819
When is U.S.Wildlife
getting here?

773
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:22,866
I'm still waiting
to confirm if they...

774
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:26,830
Oh,Jesus.

775
00:42:26,882 --> 00:42:29,385
I- I could probably
cut him down...

776
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:31,888
...but there's this
odd look of mayhem...

777
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,892
...on his
upside-down face.

778
00:42:34,944 --> 00:42:35,919
Hank.

779
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:36,842
Yes?

780
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:39,398
Are you all right?

781
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,901
Could you cut me down?

782
00:42:41,953 --> 00:42:42,850
Do you promise...

783
00:42:42,902 --> 00:42:43,851
...that you won't attempt
to injure me?

784
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,907
I have no interest in ever
looking at you, Hector.

785
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:49,859
Ok.

786
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:52,915
Just, uh, pull him down.

787
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:54,944
It's a counter weight.

788
00:42:54,996 --> 00:42:56,869
Here. I'll get the knife.

789
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,872
If I'd remembered
it was there...

790
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:01,915
I never would've let
you walk that way.

791
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:03,929
All right. It's over.

792
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:04,879
It's over. Remember?

793
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:06,933
You promised
not to hurt him, so...

794
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,884
I lied.

795
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:10,438
Wait. Hey! Hey!

796
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,888
Come on! Hold up!

797
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,889
Now here to go,
my friend.

798
00:43:12,941 --> 00:43:14,943
Now,just-come on!
Knock itoff!.

799
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:16,947
Knock itoff.
Put that down.

800
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:17,948
Just settle...

801
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,955
Jesus! Look out!

802
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,958
Whoa!

803
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:37,973
Aw, shit!

804
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:56,946
Ok.

805
00:43:56,998 --> 00:43:58,948
I admit it.

806
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,951
It's a crocodile.

807
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:03,954
Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.

808
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:07,010
Scales were oval.
He's an Asian crocodile.

809
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:10,014
Why would he come here?
It's impossible.

810
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:11,965
Asia.
How would he get here?

811
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:14,019
Obviously some
asshole in Hong Kong...

812
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:14,969
...flushed him
down the toilet.

813
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:16,971
He was 30 feet, right?
Had to be.

814
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,027
Well, nowmaybe somebody's
happy I broughtmy big gun.

815
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,030
Oh you're gonna
blow him away now?

816
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:23,057
I should think so.

817
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,980
With your cannon?

818
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:24,981
Right.
What, I shouldn't?

819
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,535
Well, he's a miracle
of nature...

820
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:28,313
...but I know
he's very scary.

821
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,039
You're the miracle
of nature.

822
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:31,989
Guys, guys, easy.

823
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,993
We're not gonna do
anything tonight.

824
00:44:34,045 --> 00:44:37,048
I never heard of a crocodile
crossing an ocean.

825
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,052
Well,they conceal
information...

826
00:44:39,104 --> 00:44:40,079
...like that in books.

827
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:41,093
All right, pal!

828
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,003
Hey, hey, hey.

829
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,058
No, no.
Let him go.

830
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,009
I'm sick
of him,too.

831
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,562
I do need to warn
you, Sheriff.

832
00:44:47,614 --> 00:44:49,013
The thing
about being rich...

833
00:44:49,065 --> 00:44:50,066
...my parents did have
the added luxury...

834
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:51,016
...of ditching me off
at karate school...

835
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:53,070
...on a regular basis,
so I am a brown belt.

836
00:44:53,122 --> 00:44:56,073
Go ahead.
Take your bestshot.

837
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,100
Ohh!

838
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,024
Hank!

839
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:00,078
He said he knew karate.

840
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,105
You hit him.

841
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,080
I did,yeah.

842
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,032
Here.

843
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:06,035
Did he say "go"?

844
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:09,091
Aren't you supposed
to say "go" in karate?

845
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,040
You're supposed
to say "go. "

846
00:45:10,092 --> 00:45:13,095
Hank,just keep your
distance from him.

847
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:15,624
Go to your tent.
Cool down.

848
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:17,890
He doesn't answer
my questions?

849
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:20,104
Why don't you
answer my questions?

850
00:45:20,156 --> 00:45:21,632
I fall into a hole.

851
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:23,056
I go up in a tree.

852
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:24,109
I swearto God,
I'll say "go. "

853
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:25,110
You bow,
and then you say "go. "

854
00:45:25,162 --> 00:45:26,059
As in
"go fuck yourself. "

855
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:29,115
Jesus. They're just
like children.

856
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,064
Yeah.

857
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:32,067
Oh, my God.

858
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:34,122
Are you all right?

859
00:45:34,174 --> 00:45:36,073
Yeah, I'm all right.

860
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,126
I've got something
for that.

861
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:38,127
I can fix that.

862
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:39,154
Yeah?

863
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,168
Yeah.

864
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,079
Ohh!

865
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:44,134
Ijust gotta pull it
a little tighter.

866
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:46,086
There we go.

867
00:45:46,138 --> 00:45:48,140
Who taughtyou
to be a nurse?

868
00:45:48,192 --> 00:45:49,089
Father's a surgeon.

869
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:51,092
I can even stitch
in a pinch...

870
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:53,146
...which probablywouldn't
be such a bad idea.

871
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:55,148
Uh, no,thanks.

872
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,099
Ok.

873
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,155
You should have seen
the look on your face...

874
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:03,160
...when that croc jumped out.

875
00:46:03,212 --> 00:46:04,109
Uh-huh.

876
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,163
You see the look
on the bear?

877
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:10,168
That was the look.

878
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,118
I don't know.

879
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,172
The laws of nature
could be changing,Jack.

880
00:46:14,224 --> 00:46:15,123
That thing out there,
that's-

881
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:19,179
You're having the best time
of your life, aren't you?

882
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:21,130
What?

883
00:46:21,182 --> 00:46:22,131
What? People
have been killed.

884
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:25,186
I hardly think I'm
having a good time.

885
00:46:25,238 --> 00:46:29,213
Why would you-

886
00:46:29,265 --> 00:46:33,187
Does it show?

887
00:46:35,201 --> 00:46:38,705
This is the first time
I've ever actually...

888
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:42,209
...you know, been in
the middle of anything.

889
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:43,158
Is that why you're here...

890
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:47,205
...to get in the middle
of something?

891
00:46:49,218 --> 00:46:52,170
Maybe.

892
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:54,224
I've always read
about what's happened.

893
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:58,220
I've never...

894
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:04,186
We should go to bed.

895
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,241
I mean we should
go to, uh...

896
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:08,190
...rest.

897
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,246
We should go to our
separate tents...

898
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:14,250
...and-here-
get some-go.

899
00:47:14,302 --> 00:47:18,244
I got it.

900
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:25,264
Thanks for the bandage.

901
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:28,289
Night.

902
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:31,261
Yeah.

903
00:47:40,283 --> 00:47:44,277
Cyr: It doesn't even see him.

904
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:49,242
There, he got it.

905
00:47:49,294 --> 00:47:51,298
He has one
natural enemy.

906
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:54,301
Only one.

907
00:47:54,353 --> 00:47:56,330
Man?

908
00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:58,255
Man.

909
00:47:58,307 --> 00:47:59,256
So you're
the big expert.

910
00:47:59,308 --> 00:48:02,260
You think ours is some
kind of mutantor-

911
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:05,315
Not necessarily.
There's a 30-footer in India.

912
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:08,319
Biggestone ever killed
on record was 27 feet.

913
00:48:08,371 --> 00:48:11,323
So why is he here?

914
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:15,317
Honestly...

915
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,325
I don't know.

916
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:43,312
Keep your eyes peeled.

917
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:46,369
You know how fast
these things can be.

918
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:47,896
I've got ticks,
I know it.

919
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:49,661
They're just
so drawn to me.

920
00:48:49,713 --> 00:48:52,045
I got a thing
about ticks.

921
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,327
Crawling
up your pant leg.

922
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:56,382
Put their heads
under your skin.

923
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,909
Look.

924
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:00,670
What?

925
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:03,379
Jack.

926
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:12,391
That's a pretty big print.

927
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,412
Gare: Seems like
we're getting lower.

928
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:22,415
That's what happens
when I land.

929
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,365
Why are we landing?

930
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:28,422
Because this is the cove
that he obviously lives in.

931
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:31,425
So why are we landing?

932
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:35,419
Hector!

933
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:42,440
We can lift it?

934
00:49:42,492 --> 00:49:44,391
Maybe.

935
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:45,444
Don't want
to mush it there.

936
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,394
I'm not mushing it.

937
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:50,945
You might mush it.
It's a little soft.

938
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:54,444
For Christ's sake,
I'm not mushing it!

939
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:58,960
Aah!

940
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:02,465
Oh, God.

941
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:04,416
Ok.

942
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,418
That is it!
That is it!

943
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,475
No, no, I keep
getting hit with heads!

944
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:10,502
Try to calm down.

945
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:11,425
You calm down!

946
00:50:11,477 --> 00:50:14,480
Calm down, ok?
Just keep breathing.

947
00:50:14,532 --> 00:50:17,485
I'm being very calm!
I am composed!

948
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:18,434
This is the second time...

949
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:19,488
I've been hit
with a severed head...

950
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:23,013
...and it upsets me!

951
00:50:23,065 --> 00:50:26,486
What the hell?

952
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:30,501
Aah!

953
00:50:30,553 --> 00:50:32,452
I...

954
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:35,509
I just want to go back
to my tent now.

955
00:50:35,561 --> 00:50:38,038
Can we please go back?

956
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,515
You gotta be kidding.

957
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:43,518
I'm not kidding!

958
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,468
Look.

959
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,469
The itsy-bitsy spider?

960
00:50:45,521 --> 00:50:47,524
Crawled up the water spout?

961
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:50,548
Down comes the rain?

962
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,520
To wash the spider out?

963
00:50:56,535 --> 00:50:58,537
Kelly:What is she doing?

964
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,540
Dum de dum de dum?

965
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,070
Kelly: Oh.

966
00:51:03,122 --> 00:51:04,494
Keough:What?

967
00:51:04,546 --> 00:51:08,551
Look 10 feet into the water.

968
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:18,563
Come and get it!

969
00:51:27,574 --> 00:51:30,527
Wow.

970
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:32,530
Disgusting.

971
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:34,083
I haven't broken any laws.

972
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:35,585
Oh, but you have,
ma'am.

973
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:36,534
You lied to us.

974
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:38,589
That can be
obstruction of justice.

975
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:39,538
A man has been killed...

976
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:41,592
...in part because
of your silence.

977
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:42,619
I could make out
a charge...

978
00:51:42,671 --> 00:51:43,542
...of reckless
endangerment.

979
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:44,596
And I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed...

980
00:51:44,648 --> 00:51:47,548
...at how you treat
your cows.

981
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,602
The reason I lied,
if I told you the truth...

982
00:51:49,654 --> 00:51:50,552
...you'd hunt it down
and kill it...

983
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:52,606
...which seems to be exactly
what you're trying to do.

984
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:54,608
How long have you
been feeding this thing?

985
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,636
6 years.

986
00:51:56,688 --> 00:51:58,562
6 years?

987
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:01,118
Well, Bernie
was outfishing...

988
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,396
...and it followed
him home.

989
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:05,571
So we threw it
some scraps...

990
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,573
...and,well, he didn't
seem to bother anybody.

991
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,630
He became kind of like a pet
who lives in the wild.

992
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:11,579
He just appeared?

993
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,635
You have no idea
how he arrived here?

994
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,585
No. Do you?

995
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:17,587
Your husband Bernie...

996
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:18,588
...you didn't,
by any chance...

997
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,643
...lead him to the lake
blind folded?

998
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:21,592
If I had a dick...

999
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:24,147
...this is where I'd
tell you to suck it.

1000
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:26,651
Did the crocodile
kill your husband?

1001
00:52:26,703 --> 00:52:29,655
Yes, but itwas all...

1002
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:30,656
...itwas a mistake.

1003
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,607
A mistake?

1004
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:35,662
One of our horses
got loose 2 years ago.

1005
00:52:35,714 --> 00:52:37,613
Went to the lake
to drink...

1006
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,667
...and the crocodile
started coming in...

1007
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,669
...and Bernie went
to intercede, and-

1008
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:43,621
...if I'd reported it...

1009
00:52:43,673 --> 00:52:46,175
...they'd have sent people
to kill it.

1010
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:48,678
Ma'am, how could you
not report this?

1011
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,206
It puts human life
at risk.

1012
00:52:50,258 --> 00:52:52,968
Nobody lives on this lake.

1013
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,677
It's really his lake now.

1014
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,692
Come on, Hector.
I know you're crazy...

1015
00:52:58,744 --> 00:52:59,641
...but you can't do this.

1016
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:01,696
I need to see his habitat
up close, Deputy Gare.

1017
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:03,646
...then watch Nova, ok?

1018
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:06,701
But don't go
in the water.

1019
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:07,651
Please.

1020
00:53:07,703 --> 00:53:09,204
I'll have sex
with you.

1021
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,706
Let's just
getoutof here.

1022
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:11,656
Darling...

1023
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:15,713
...he's not gonna hurt me.

1024
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:19,708
Don't.

1025
00:53:25,727 --> 00:53:29,720
Hector!

1026
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:32,735
Murders and rapes
in the cities.

1027
00:53:32,787 --> 00:53:34,685
People bomb planes.

1028
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:36,687
Can the police stop them?
No.

1029
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:38,741
Butfeed one little cow
to a crocodile-

1030
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:40,745
You stay right here
until the police show.

1031
00:53:40,797 --> 00:53:42,747
You're under
full house arrest.

1032
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:43,697
Thank you...

1033
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:45,699
Officer Fuckmeat.

1034
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:47,754
Gare on radio: Sheriff,
we gota problem with Hector.

1035
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:50,783
What problem?

1036
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:53,761
He went swimming.

1037
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,756
Check.

1038
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:07,857
Oh, my.

1039
00:55:12,863 --> 00:55:16,862
Suddenly I feel
a bit foolish here.

1040
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:20,863
You're different
from the others.

1041
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:25,880
Holy Spiritof Sobek.

1042
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,908
Holy Ghost.

1043
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,923
Holy shit.

1044
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:31,835
Hector!

1045
00:55:31,887 --> 00:55:35,386
Just turn the ignition.

1046
00:55:35,438 --> 00:55:38,886
It's fuel injected.

1047
00:55:40,899 --> 00:55:42,901
Come on!

1048
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:46,906
I know that under
the circumstances...

1049
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,434
...biting my head off...

1050
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:51,195
...might seem viable.

1051
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:53,905
Itwould cheapen you.

1052
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:57,921
I may geta shot!

1053
00:55:57,973 --> 00:55:58,870
No!

1054
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,924
Bullets might not
penetrate its hide.

1055
00:56:00,976 --> 00:56:02,927
Oh,Jesus. All right,
justa little further.

1056
00:56:02,979 --> 00:56:04,931
Just like that.

1057
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:23,943
Move over!

1058
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:28,908
Go!

1059
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,967
- Go!
- I'm trying!

1060
00:56:33,019 --> 00:56:34,969
Ahh! Jesus!

1061
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:03,005
That's your last little
stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

1062
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,955
You're grounded.

1063
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:06,008
This is some very
delicate equipment...

1064
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,958
...thatyou're
throwing around.

1065
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,012
I don't care.
You trying to kill yourself?

1066
00:57:09,064 --> 00:57:11,014
You want to meet
your maker, is that it?

1067
00:57:11,066 --> 00:57:12,542
You might think
they're godly...

1068
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:13,806
...you might get
some spiritual lift...

1069
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:14,967
...outof back stroking
with dragons...

1070
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:17,523
...butyou just put a deputy
at risk out there, sir.

1071
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:20,026
Let's not over look the fact
that he didn't eatme.

1072
00:57:20,078 --> 00:57:22,555
'Cause he justate
a cow, stupid.

1073
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:24,980
I'm a civilian.
I'm not a trout.

1074
00:57:25,032 --> 00:57:26,021
You have no authority
overme what so ever.

1075
00:57:27,035 --> 00:57:28,036
You have no authority
overme whatsoever.

1076
00:57:28,088 --> 00:57:29,025
Hey, hey,
I can arrestyou.

1077
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:31,990
Well,then do it.

1078
00:57:32,042 --> 00:57:33,992
You hurt his feelings.

1079
00:57:34,044 --> 00:57:36,046
I don't care.
Do you care?

1080
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:40,040
No. He's an asshole.

1081
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:55,072
Did you want
to be killed by it?

1082
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:57,074
You think I'm that nuts?

1083
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:58,023
Hector.

1084
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,026
What you just did...

1085
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:03,082
...there had to be at leastsome
sort of a death wish going on.

1086
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:05,032
In ancient Melanesia...

1087
00:58:05,084 --> 00:58:07,035
...people suspected
of crimes...

1088
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:10,090
...would be thrown
to the crocodiles.

1089
00:58:10,142 --> 00:58:11,618
Crocodiles would decide.

1090
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:13,043
They would be the judge.

1091
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:17,099
Oh, and so that was you
wanting to be judged out there?

1092
00:58:17,151 --> 00:58:19,127
Maybe I was,
and so what?

1093
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:21,053
Is that too arbitrary?

1094
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:23,608
Better to be measured
by my wealth?

1095
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,059
Betterforme
to getmy self-esteem...

1096
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,114
...looking in the eyes
of cheap sycophants...

1097
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:29,063
...craving a meal ticket?

1098
00:58:29,115 --> 00:58:31,117
There was more honesty
in those dragon's eyes.

1099
00:58:31,169 --> 00:58:33,120
There was more dignity
in those dragon's eyes.

1100
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:34,121
Jesus, Hector,
cutthe shit.

1101
00:58:34,173 --> 00:58:36,071
Aw,fuck it.

1102
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:40,128
So, can I tell them you won't
go back in the water?

1103
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,077
Oh,yeah, sure.

1104
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:42,632
I'm not going
back in the water.

1105
00:58:42,684 --> 00:58:44,134
No way I'm going
back in the water.

1106
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:47,158
Ok.

1107
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,131
Kelly.

1108
00:58:51,143 --> 00:58:55,137
We can't let'em kill it.

1109
00:59:02,157 --> 00:59:05,160
Wells:Yeah,
pull all the trucks in...

1110
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,163
...and start packing.

1111
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:08,164
Everything?

1112
00:59:08,216 --> 00:59:09,113
Yeah.

1113
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:10,115
All right.

1114
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:13,171
Just heard from Wildlife
and Florida Fish and Game.

1115
00:59:13,223 --> 00:59:14,172
They're gonna be here
in 3 hours.

1116
00:59:14,224 --> 00:59:16,123
Ok.

1117
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:18,177
So we might as well pack up.

1118
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:20,128
Good idea.

1119
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,183
Will they
try to trap him?

1120
00:59:23,235 --> 00:59:24,132
Sorry?

1121
00:59:24,184 --> 00:59:26,136
Florida Fish and Game.

1122
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:28,190
What'll they do
when they get here?

1123
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:32,143
Cyr:Tell her,Jack.

1124
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:35,198
Won't be able to snag him
in pitments, right?

1125
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:37,202
And you tranq him
in the water...

1126
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:38,151
...and he drowns.

1127
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:40,206
They could try
to tranq him on land.

1128
00:59:40,258 --> 00:59:42,208
Oh, sure,they could,
but they won't.

1129
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,158
He's taken human life.

1130
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,212
The mission will be
to put him down.

1131
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:46,162
Is that true?

1132
00:59:46,214 --> 00:59:50,219
They've never been able
to trap anything 30 feet.

1133
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:52,169
But they have
to try, right?

1134
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:54,224
Where are they gonna
take him, Florida?

1135
00:59:54,276 --> 00:59:55,174
Back to Asia?

1136
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:57,228
I got enough flaxidyl
with me to put him out-

1137
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,177
Forget it.

1138
00:59:58,229 --> 01:00:01,181
Jack, hearme out.

1139
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,182
I know I'm a fat,
rich, nut fuck,wacko...

1140
01:00:02,234 --> 01:00:04,236
...who's about as grounded
as a street pigeon...

1141
01:00:04,288 --> 01:00:06,186
Keep going.

1142
01:00:06,238 --> 01:00:08,242
Butthis thing...

1143
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:10,772
Here?

1144
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:12,537
Maine?

1145
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:14,198
30 feet?

1146
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:16,252
Don'tyou think
we're dealing...

1147
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:18,202
...with a bit
of a miracle?

1148
01:00:18,254 --> 01:00:20,257
Yeah. The miracle would be
to take him alive.

1149
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:22,260
Yeah, but if we could
neutralize him-

1150
01:00:22,312 --> 01:00:23,209
How are we gonna
neutralize him?

1151
01:00:23,261 --> 01:00:25,264
Lure him on land
and pump him full of drugs.

1152
01:00:25,316 --> 01:00:26,213
Oh, right.

1153
01:00:26,265 --> 01:00:28,267
I know of an empty
oil tank in Portland.

1154
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,269
Ifwe drugged him,we
could contain him there.

1155
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:32,220
He's 150 years old.

1156
01:00:32,272 --> 01:00:36,277
He probably swam here
from another continent.

1157
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:38,229
He's migrated to Maine.

1158
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:41,284
How the hell do we say
we just kill it?

1159
01:00:41,336 --> 01:00:43,235
Jack,
this thing being here...

1160
01:00:43,287 --> 01:00:45,289
...does have some
ecological significance.

1161
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,239
And you are
in the business...

1162
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,294
...of protecting things
against extinction.

1163
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,822
Including deputies.

1164
01:00:50,874 --> 01:00:52,246
I understand that...

1165
01:00:52,298 --> 01:00:54,300
...but if it's possible
to take him alive-

1166
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:55,250
No, it's not possible.

1167
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:57,804
Look, he follows anything
thatmoves, right?

1168
01:00:57,856 --> 01:01:00,307
We set a trap on the beach.
I got enough net-

1169
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:02,310
No. There's no net
that's gonna hold him.

1170
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:03,311
It'll keep him
tangled long enough...

1171
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:05,314
...forthe drugs
to kick in.

1172
01:01:05,366 --> 01:01:06,264
For God's sake,Jack...

1173
01:01:06,316 --> 01:01:08,819
...they've trapped crocs
bigger than 20 feet.

1174
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:11,322
This is not completely
out of the question.

1175
01:01:11,374 --> 01:01:12,272
It's possible,
and you know that.

1176
01:01:12,324 --> 01:01:14,326
And those fucks from
Florida won't even try...

1177
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:17,277
...and you know that,too.

1178
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:19,333
I gotthe drugs.
He's gota big cannon...

1179
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:22,284
...if anything goes wrong.

1180
01:01:22,336 --> 01:01:24,338
How do you get him
to the net?

1181
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,866
Ask Mrs. Bickerman
to call him?

1182
01:01:25,918 --> 01:01:27,342
You guys can be
in the trucks...

1183
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:28,292
...with the tranq guns.

1184
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:29,345
If he charges,
you take off.

1185
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:32,374
He's not that fast.

1186
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:35,888
We just have to try.

1187
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:39,348
One try.
Just one try.

1188
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,309
Like Hank says...

1189
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:44,365
...how would we lure him in?

1190
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:45,892
I'll sue you!

1191
01:01:45,944 --> 01:01:47,368
Go ahead.

1192
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,374
You can'ttake a cow
by eminent domain!

1193
01:01:51,426 --> 01:01:52,323
We just did!

1194
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,379
We won't let her
get hurt, ma'am.

1195
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:57,329
You're all cocksuckers!

1196
01:01:57,381 --> 01:02:00,385
I knew atfirst.
I just didn't want to say it.

1197
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:02,389
We know
what we're doing.

1198
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:07,384
We gota cow hanging
from a helicopter.

1199
01:02:08,396 --> 01:02:09,345
Not much drag.

1200
01:02:09,397 --> 01:02:13,391
As long as I can keep her
from swinging,we're ok.

1201
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,361
We're doing
the rightthing.

1202
01:02:22,413 --> 01:02:24,416
You might feel different
if you get eaten.

1203
01:02:24,468 --> 01:02:28,410
Yeah,thanks.

1204
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:41,385
Tranq gun with every rifle.

1205
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:45,431
That's as far back
as it goes, right?

1206
01:02:53,452 --> 01:02:55,456
Hector, keep enough
tension to hold her up.

1207
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:57,458
We don't know
how well she can swim.

1208
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:01,453
Right.

1209
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:08,420
I hate to say it.

1210
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:11,475
The more she thrashes,
the better.

1211
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:13,426
Cyr:You ready
on shore?

1212
01:03:13,478 --> 01:03:15,481
Wells:Yeah,
we're all right. We're ready.

1213
01:03:15,533 --> 01:03:19,434
Woman: Ok.

1214
01:03:19,487 --> 01:03:23,492
If she gets tired,
pull her out.

1215
01:03:24,494 --> 01:03:26,496
Jack:
What's she doing now?

1216
01:03:26,548 --> 01:03:30,522
She's trying to fly.

1217
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:34,495
This is nota happy cow.

1218
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,458
I'm rooting
for the crocodile.

1219
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,512
I hope he swallows
your friends whole.

1220
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:41,514
You might want to arrest
me for that,too.

1221
01:03:41,566 --> 01:03:43,466
Is that a crime-

1222
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:46,521
To wish the chewing
of law enforcement?

1223
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:49,525
I'm notsure, ma'am.

1224
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,477
Man:You got'em?

1225
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:53,530
Second Man:
Yeah, over here.

1226
01:03:53,582 --> 01:03:55,558
Little battery!

1227
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,574
What's the deal?

1228
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,486
Well,we tried.

1229
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:02,041
Justa little
longer, please.

1230
01:04:02,093 --> 01:04:04,544
She doesn'tseem
to be swimming.

1231
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:06,495
No, she's floating.

1232
01:04:06,547 --> 01:04:08,549
She looks like
a giant tea bag.

1233
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:10,499
Ok, Hector.

1234
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:13,556
Good plan, bad bait.
Game's up.

1235
01:04:13,608 --> 01:04:16,559
The cow disappoints me.

1236
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,513
Hold on.

1237
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,566
I got something
on the screen.

1238
01:04:21,618 --> 01:04:23,094
What do you got?

1239
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:24,570
He's coming.

1240
01:04:24,622 --> 01:04:26,521
Where?

1241
01:04:26,573 --> 01:04:28,074
How far out?

1242
01:04:28,126 --> 01:04:29,524
30 meters or so.

1243
01:04:29,576 --> 01:04:31,579
He's moving slow,
but he's definitely coming.

1244
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:34,582
Can you confirm visually
or just radar?

1245
01:04:34,634 --> 01:04:35,531
Radar.

1246
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,085
He's underwater...

1247
01:04:37,137 --> 01:04:38,535
...but he is coming!

1248
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:40,590
All right, everybody
back in the trucks!

1249
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:42,118
Move, move, move!

1250
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,594
Let's go, let's go!

1251
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:44,621
Let's go!

1252
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:47,132
Lead him in.

1253
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:49,591
On ourway.

1254
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:56,611
Remember to aim
for the stomach and the sides!

1255
01:04:56,663 --> 01:05:00,141
These darts
won't pierce his back!

1256
01:05:00,193 --> 01:05:03,619
He's surfacing.
There's his snout.

1257
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:05,569
Gare:
There he is!

1258
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:07,624
We've spotted him, Hector.

1259
01:05:07,676 --> 01:05:10,576
You little snacker.

1260
01:05:10,628 --> 01:05:12,632
If he gets near her,
pull up.

1261
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:14,635
She's worried
about the cow now.

1262
01:05:14,687 --> 01:05:18,629
Nice and slow, Hector.

1263
01:05:20,642 --> 01:05:22,644
This net thing better work.

1264
01:05:22,696 --> 01:05:23,646
He got you with it.

1265
01:05:25,649 --> 01:05:28,652
We're in about 4 feet
of water now.

1266
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:31,604
She's mooing.

1267
01:05:31,656 --> 01:05:33,658
Wells:
You wouldn't?

1268
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,660
She's also kicking.

1269
01:05:37,663 --> 01:05:38,665
A little closer, Hector.

1270
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:52,683
Oh, shit.

1271
01:05:55,687 --> 01:05:57,689
Watch out!

1272
01:06:04,697 --> 01:06:08,693
Mother fucker!

1273
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:11,656
Shit!

1274
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:12,657
Where is he?

1275
01:06:12,709 --> 01:06:16,702
We gotta getto him.

1276
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:19,665
Back us up.

1277
01:06:19,717 --> 01:06:21,720
Lose the tranq guns.
go to the rifles.

1278
01:06:21,772 --> 01:06:23,723
Man: Get the rifles!

1279
01:06:41,746 --> 01:06:42,747
Where'd he go?

1280
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:43,696
Hold up.

1281
01:06:43,748 --> 01:06:46,251
Don't go back
into the water.

1282
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,754
If you geta safe shot,
take it.

1283
01:06:48,806 --> 01:06:52,748
Do not move, Hector!

1284
01:06:55,763 --> 01:06:57,765
Can you see anything
from out there?

1285
01:06:57,817 --> 01:06:59,716
Nothing!

1286
01:06:59,768 --> 01:07:03,763
Maybe he swam back out!

1287
01:07:04,776 --> 01:07:06,778
Jesus!

1288
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:08,306
Hector!

1289
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,730
Hey!

1290
01:07:09,782 --> 01:07:10,783
Get back
in the truck!

1291
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:14,777
I got him covered.

1292
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:20,796
Where is he?

1293
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:23,319
I don't know.

1294
01:07:23,371 --> 01:07:25,791
He's gone under.

1295
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:36,806
Ijust have this feeling
everything's totally safe.

1296
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:42,772
There!

1297
01:07:42,824 --> 01:07:43,825
He's swimming out!

1298
01:07:43,877 --> 01:07:44,774
I think I see him!

1299
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:48,821
I think I see his tail!

1300
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:04,852
Shit! Kelly!

1301
01:08:04,904 --> 01:08:06,855
Aah!

1302
01:08:20,872 --> 01:08:24,878
Wells: Kelly!

1303
01:08:33,889 --> 01:08:35,892
Kelly, swim, swim to me!

1304
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:39,885
Swim to me, Kelly!

1305
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:44,396
Shoot the fucking thing!

1306
01:08:44,448 --> 01:08:46,894
I don't have
a clean shot.

1307
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:50,404
Dive under!

1308
01:08:50,456 --> 01:08:52,902
Go under!

1309
01:08:53,915 --> 01:08:57,909
Fuck.

1310
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:17,894
"Let's save him. "

1311
01:09:17,946 --> 01:09:21,940
What a fucking
great idea.

1312
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:48,985
Come on.

1313
01:09:49,037 --> 01:09:51,514
Cyr: Here.

1314
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:53,780
Here we go.

1315
01:09:53,832 --> 01:09:55,413
Where is he?

1316
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:57,232
I don't know.

1317
01:09:57,284 --> 01:09:58,998
We can't see him.

1318
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:02,992
What-What?

1319
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:11,002
Hector!

1320
01:10:23,029 --> 01:10:25,532
All right.

1321
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:28,035
Game over.

1322
01:10:28,087 --> 01:10:28,985
Look.

1323
01:10:29,037 --> 01:10:31,539
He's suffering.

1324
01:10:31,591 --> 01:10:34,042
I getto be humane.

1325
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:35,993
No, no!

1326
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:38,047
No, no, no, look,
he's trapped!

1327
01:10:38,099 --> 01:10:41,000
We've done it!

1328
01:10:41,052 --> 01:10:43,055
So what? It's not a net,
but he's trapped.

1329
01:10:43,107 --> 01:10:44,582
Mission accomplished.

1330
01:10:44,634 --> 01:10:46,006
Wells: Shoot him.

1331
01:10:46,058 --> 01:10:47,061
I got more drugs.
He's half dead.

1332
01:10:47,113 --> 01:10:51,054
He's half alive.
Shoot him!

1333
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:07,074
The drugs are kicking in.

1334
01:11:29,114 --> 01:11:31,116
Look at him.

1335
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:33,118
He's done.

1336
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,067
Hank.

1337
01:11:34,119 --> 01:11:36,623
All right, stand back.

1338
01:11:36,675 --> 01:11:39,127
No, no, no, Sheriff!.

1339
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:40,076
Look.

1340
01:11:40,128 --> 01:11:42,079
Look, look.

1341
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,080
He's got nothing left.

1342
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:47,126
Wells: Go ahead.
Shoot him.

1343
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:55,095
Really?

1344
01:11:55,147 --> 01:11:56,648
- Jack,we don't-
- Kelly.

1345
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,422
We don't have to destroy him!

1346
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:02,144
God damn it, look at him!

1347
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,110
Letme have that.

1348
01:12:06,162 --> 01:12:07,663
Kelly:
He's been neutralized.

1349
01:12:07,715 --> 01:12:09,165
Cyr: Come on,Jack,
he's trapped!

1350
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:10,166
Look at him!
He can'tmove!

1351
01:12:10,218 --> 01:12:11,116
What's the point?

1352
01:12:11,168 --> 01:12:12,117
We don't have to do this.

1353
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:16,162
Jack,you don't have to.
Please!

1354
01:12:30,191 --> 01:12:32,194
Oh, God!

1355
01:12:32,246 --> 01:12:34,196
He's gotme!

1356
01:12:34,248 --> 01:12:35,147
Jesus!

1357
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,148
Jesus Christ!

1358
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,204
Are there 2?
I think there's 2.

1359
01:12:39,256 --> 01:12:41,207
I can see that.

1360
01:12:41,259 --> 01:12:42,156
He bitme!

1361
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:44,210
He bitme!
There's 2,there's 2!

1362
01:12:44,262 --> 01:12:48,235
I can count.

1363
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:52,209
Cyr: No!

1364
01:12:56,225 --> 01:13:00,220
Back to one.

1365
01:13:01,232 --> 01:13:04,231
Go ahead.

1366
01:13:04,283 --> 01:13:07,229
Flax him.

1367
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:16,198
Oh, here they are.

1368
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:20,245
Just in time.
Nice to see you.

1369
01:13:27,265 --> 01:13:29,268
We're gonna need
to get this reptile...

1370
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,270
...some medical attention.

1371
01:13:31,322 --> 01:13:33,221
We, uh...

1372
01:13:33,273 --> 01:13:37,278
...trapped him
with our chopper.

1373
01:13:52,296 --> 01:13:53,246
Portland?

1374
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:54,248
Yes, Portland.

1375
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,302
They'll tank him there
until we figure out...

1376
01:13:56,354 --> 01:13:58,330
...something better to do.

1377
01:13:58,382 --> 01:14:00,255
So, Sheriff, Sheriff...

1378
01:14:00,307 --> 01:14:02,310
...you got to fire
your big gun finally.

1379
01:14:02,362 --> 01:14:04,338
Was it fun?

1380
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,263
Over rated.

1381
01:14:06,315 --> 01:14:07,264
What'd Bickerman say?

1382
01:14:07,316 --> 01:14:09,318
Well, she didn't
want to tell us...

1383
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,269
...about the second croc...

1384
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:13,323
'cause she was afraid
we'd blow its head off.

1385
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,277
Women's intuition.

1386
01:14:17,329 --> 01:14:18,278
We got room
for one more.

1387
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,332
Someone should
probably go with him.

1388
01:14:20,384 --> 01:14:21,282
...uh...

1389
01:14:21,334 --> 01:14:24,338
I'm still packing
up some stuff...

1390
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,867
...but, uh...

1391
01:14:26,919 --> 01:14:29,293
I'll go.

1392
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:31,348
So, I imagine
you're gonna have...

1393
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,299
...a few reports to do.

1394
01:14:34,351 --> 01:14:37,355
If you need anything,
letme know.

1395
01:14:37,407 --> 01:14:40,307
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

1396
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:44,364
Gee, Hank,
don't get all choked up.

1397
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:46,315
With you,
I'm still mixed.

1398
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:50,361
Oh,well,then,just to
offend you on principle,then.

1399
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:56,379
See you.

1400
01:15:03,388 --> 01:15:04,338
Well...

1401
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,392
You wanta ride
in my truck?

1402
01:15:06,444 --> 01:15:07,341
Oh,we just finished...

1403
01:15:07,393 --> 01:15:08,895
...loading up the front
of the truck.

1404
01:15:08,947 --> 01:15:10,397
Do you want us to
take some stuff out?

1405
01:15:10,449 --> 01:15:12,348
No, no,that's all right.

1406
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,901
I'm gonna be
a little while anyway.

1407
01:15:13,953 --> 01:15:15,403
I want to go say
good-bye to the lake.

1408
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:18,356
You sure, because
I don'tmind-

1409
01:15:18,408 --> 01:15:21,411
No. I actually want
to stay a little longer.

1410
01:15:21,463 --> 01:15:26,406
All right.

1411
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:29,422
If I'm ever
in New York, I'll...

1412
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:33,415
Yeah.

1413
01:15:35,429 --> 01:15:39,422
Yeah.

1414
01:15:54,453 --> 01:15:58,448
So, does nobody ever
make a move in Maine?

1415
01:16:01,462 --> 01:16:03,464
That's it?
You slide your duffel bag?

1416
01:16:03,516 --> 01:16:05,415
Just...

1417
01:16:05,467 --> 01:16:06,968
...get in the truck.

1418
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,418
Go for a beer.

1419
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,474
There's a good bar
in town.

1420
01:16:10,526 --> 01:16:12,002
Bet that's charming.

1421
01:16:12,054 --> 01:16:13,478
Are the glasses clean?

1422
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:15,428
Mostly.

1423
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,484
You gonna complain
the whole time?

1424
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:19,433
Jack.

1425
01:16:19,485 --> 01:16:23,480
Start the truck.

1426
01:16:27,496 --> 01:16:31,490
I already miss
the crocodile.

1427
01:17:07,548 --> 01:17:10,552
Bob Marley:
I wanna love ya?

1428
01:17:10,604 --> 01:17:13,080
And treat you right?

1429
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:15,505
I wanna love ya?

1430
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:18,561
Cute little buttons.
Oh, ho ho.

1431
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:21,565
Oh, mama loves you.

1432
01:17:21,617 --> 01:17:22,515
Come on.

1433
01:17:22,567 --> 01:17:24,569
Eat your supper.

1434
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:26,571
Nibble mommy's toes.

1435
01:17:26,623 --> 01:17:27,520
Yes.

1436
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:28,573
Roof rightover our heads?

1437
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:33,580
We'll share the shelter?

1438
01:17:33,632 --> 01:17:36,533
Of my single bed?

1439
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:38,587
We'll share the same room?

1440
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:41,539
Yeah?

1441
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:45,543
Jah provide the bread?

1442
01:17:45,595 --> 01:17:47,546
Is this love, is this love?

1443
01:17:47,598 --> 01:17:51,592
Is this love
that I'm feeling?

1444
01:17:52,605 --> 01:17:54,607
Is this love, is this love?

1445
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:57,610
Is this love,
is this love?

1446
01:17:57,662 --> 01:18:01,605
That I'm feeling?

1447
01:18:05,622 --> 01:18:07,624
Oh,yes, I know,yes, I know?

1448
01:18:07,676 --> 01:18:11,618
Yes, I know now?

1449
01:18:13,632 --> 01:18:15,634
Oh,yes, I know,yes, I know?

1450
01:18:15,686 --> 01:18:16,636
Yes, I know now?

1451
01:18:16,688 --> 01:18:19,588
I?

1452
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,634
Am willing and able?

1453
01:18:24,646 --> 01:18:25,595
So I?

1454
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:29,642
Throw my cards on your table?

1455
01:18:30,654 --> 01:18:32,604
See, I wanna love ya?

1456
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:36,161
I wanna love and treat ya?

1457
01:18:36,213 --> 01:18:39,665
Love and treat ya right?

1458
01:18:39,717 --> 01:18:41,616
I wanna love ya?

1459
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:44,671
Every day and every night?

1460
01:18:44,723 --> 01:18:48,666
We'll be together?

1461
01:18:49,678 --> 01:18:52,682
With a roof
right over our heads?

1462
01:18:52,734 --> 01:18:56,676
We'll share the shelter?

1463
01:18:57,688 --> 01:19:00,640
Of my single bed?

1464
01:19:00,692 --> 01:19:03,696
We'll share the same room?

1465
01:19:03,748 --> 01:19:05,647
Yeah?

1466
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:09,197
Jah provides the bread?

1467
01:19:09,249 --> 01:19:12,696
We'll share the shelter?
