00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:02,349
Y'all come and eat!

2
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:38,124
Let us pray.

3
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,692
Dear Lord...

4
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,552
...we thank you for this meal...

5
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:56,718
...and for bringing me these friends
and our daily bread...

6
00:00:56,886 --> 00:00:59,733
...and all the animals
and all the beast in the field.

7
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:01,487
Amen.

8
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,227
You live alone?

9
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:19,245
l've got a son that comes and sees me
every month and brings me food.

10
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:22,677
But it's been six months
since he was here.

11
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,709
What do you live on?

12
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:31,184
l got some things stored away.

13
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:43,574
Thank you.

14
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,737
-l'd like to ask you a favor.
-Anything you want.

15
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:48,504
l wanted to ask you...

16
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:52,249
...if you can shoot me.

17
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:58,866
My son ain't coming back.

18
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,336
Oh, he'll come back.

19
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:07,638
No, he told me he had cancer.

20
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,729
And he told me to
go back to town with him.

21
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,952
But l don't wanna go,
because l've always lived here.

22
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,287
Well, we can't do it.

23
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:23,445
l don't wanna offend God
by killing myself.

24
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,554
lt's a problem.

25
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:30,619
We don't wanna offend God either.

26
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,433
lt would be the best thing to do.

27
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:40,212
You're good people.

28
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:45,083
You need to go ahead
and shoot me.

29
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:50,038
You know, l'm innocent actually.

30
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,334
l didn't mean
to kill your friend, man.

31
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:57,302
He shot at me, all right?

32
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:01,433
And l swear to God,
really, if l could....

33
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:09,499
You let me go and l promise--

34
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:11,508
l swear.

35
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:14,100
l promise l will not press charges.

36
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:17,592
Where's that son of a bitch at?

37
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,035
l don't know.

38
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,752
You ought to,
you've been fucking him.

39
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:28,119
We don't talk a lot.

40
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:55,647
God almighty.

41
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,482
Get this horse off of me.

42
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:02,007
Get up, Bill, get up.

43
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:03,836
Come on.

44
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:06,430
Come on, come on, come on. Up.

45
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:15,201
Goddamn, Bill, get up.

46
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:17,692
Whoa, Bill.

47
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,244
Fucking motherfuck!

48
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:37,768
Shit!

49
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,172
Help!

50
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:50,761
Help!

51
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,574
Help!

52
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,492
-Good afternoon, sir.
-How do you do?

53
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,347
Sir, have you seen anyone
coming through this area...

54
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:33,551
...or in this general area
on horseback?

55
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:36,175
Like, maybe two men? Horseback?

56
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,061
Maybe with a couple
pack horses or mules?

57
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,493
l ain't seen anybody in 30 years.

58
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,790
All right. l am sorry, sir.

59
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,262
Have you heard anyone come this way
in the past few days or hours?

60
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:50,807
Are y'all cops?

61
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:53,335
No, sir, we're actually
with the Border Patrol.

62
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,662
Ain't no Mexicans
come through here.

63
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,483
We're not looking for Mexicans.

64
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:03,541
-No one come through.
-Are you sure?

65
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:06,039
Hell, no, l'm not sure.

66
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,445
But l don't think so.

67
00:10:07,609 --> 00:10:09,998
Okay. Do you need anything?

68
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,127
No.

69
00:10:15,386 --> 00:10:17,295
All right, we're moving out.

70
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,402
This way, hurry up!

71
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:43,672
Watch out.
That's a rattlesnake.

72
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,876
He's not gonna bite anybody.

73
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:48,280
A dead guy!

74
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:21,587
He's still breathing.

75
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:24,407
-l think that snake bit him.
-He sure did.

76
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:27,608
-ls he a gringo?
-He looks too fucked up to be a gringo.

77
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,116
Has he got money?

78
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,172
l think it's too late.

79
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,810
Take it easy. l'm a friend.

80
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,840
-We didn't do nothing, mister.
-l know it.

81
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,626
-What happened to him?
-He was bite by a snake.

82
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:47,797
He's dying.

83
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,172
You know where
we can get some help?

84
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:55,126
l know a girl who is good with herbs.
Maybe she can cure him.

85
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:57,052
But she lives across the border.

86
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,071
ls it far?

87
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,858
The border is not far.

88
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,293
<i>But la Migra is all around.</i>

89
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,319
<i>They are looking for a gringo
who kidnap a Migra agent.</i>

90
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,098
You're the gringo.

91
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:16,699
Yes.

92
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,512
Can you help me get him across?
l don't want him to die.

93
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:29,918
Tomas, keep going with them.
l'll take the gringo to get cured.

94
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,674
l'm leaving.

95
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:50,781
You're leaving.

96
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,866
Yes.

97
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,868
l hate this place.

98
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,435
Maybe he'll come back.

99
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:00,157
l don't care.

100
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,269
He'll come back, honey.

101
00:13:02,661 --> 00:13:04,286
l don't care.

102
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,227
The son of a bitch
is beyond redemption.

103
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:23,839
l'm leaving him.

104
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:33,316
-Can you get us across?
-Yes.

105
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,675
But l've never crossed people
from this side to that side.

106
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,445
-Much less on horses.
-Okay, take us.

107
00:13:40,614 --> 00:13:42,437
-What about the price?
-What price?

108
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,388
The price to cross you.

109
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,493
lt's 1 000 a person.

110
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,021
l don't have $ 1 000.

111
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:53,347
Three-thousand dollars.
A thousand for you.

112
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:56,414
And 1 000 for the gringo.
And 1 000 for the dead guy.

113
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,013
Shit.

114
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,119
l'll find a way to get across.

115
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,018
Okay, let's make a deal.

116
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:07,711
Give me your rifle...

117
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,790
...and your horse.

118
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:12,513
No.

119
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:28,103
All right, l'll give you the horse.
But not my horse.

120
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,240
-The other horse.
-And the rifle.

121
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:31,844
Just the horse.

122
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,430
Okay, done deal.

123
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,881
Okay.

124
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,450
This is where we cross.

125
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:56,514
-ls the water deep?
-A little.

126
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,569
No! No, goddamn it! No!

Fuck you, sons of bitches!

00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:17,763
What the hell is this on me?

131
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,788
You sons of bitches!

132
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,160

Fuck!

137
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:20,427
-Dona Adriana, is Mariana at home?
-Yes, she is.

138
00:16:23,505 --> 00:16:25,164
What's going on?

139
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,533
ls this the one that got snakebit?

140
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,904
Get this gringo out of here.
He's the one that broke my nose.

141
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,114
You sure?

142
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:41,169
Hell yes,
he's got a face like a white rat.

143
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,021
-He'll probably die.
-Let him die.

144
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:45,421
Please...

145
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:51,050
...heal him.

146
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:52,974
Why?

147
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:55,144
Because...

148
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:58,258
...l need him alive.

149
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,250
Will he get well?

150
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:25,173
From the poison, yes.

151
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,909
But if he gets gangrene,
we'll have to cut his foot off.

152
00:20:23,317 --> 00:20:25,226
Your call is ready.

153
00:20:40,565 --> 00:20:42,954

What's Belmont doing?

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,372
He went on vacation. He said he
had nothing to do with this.

161
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:04,429
Said it's between you and the Border

166
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,974
Be my wife.

167
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:26,512
Are you crazy? l can't do that.

168
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,774
<i>Why not?</i>

169
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,818
Because l love Bob, Pete.

170
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:37,717
You said l was the only you loved.

171
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:43,991
Pete, you don't understand.
l have to go. Take care.

172
00:23:26,048 --> 00:23:30,041
We'll get you home pretty soon,
Melquiades.

173
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,148
Any day now.

174
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:41,727
You look like hell, son.

175
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,711
Good morning.

176
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,150
Where am l?

177
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,011
Mexico. Shit.

178
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:40,226
-Who are you, man?
-Your private 91 1 , dude.

179
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:43,394
The gringo asshole woke up.

180
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,487
She's gonna check you up.

181
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:52,095
Easy. Easy.

182
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:55,617
Drink.

183
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:58,148
-ls there hot coffee?
-Fresh made.

184
00:24:58,342 --> 00:24:59,903
Bring me the pot.

185
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,993
Now we're even, asshole.

186
00:25:42,024 --> 00:25:43,617
You want to help us?

187
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,604
We'll have to walk it from here.

188
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,231
Shit.

189
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:13,899
Come here.

190
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:59,756
You try to run away again, l'll kill you.
l guess you know that by now.

191
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:00,870
Yes, sir.

192
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:14,962
<i>Do you even know how much
new tires cost?</i>

193
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:18,319
<i>Do you even know what the mileage
on your little foreign car is?</i>

194
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:21,832
<i>Do you know when the oil change
is due? Tell me. I want you to tell me.</i>

195
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:24,588
<i>Johnny, is there someone else?</i>

196
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:26,992
<i>What do you mean?
Someone else what?</i>

197
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,294
<i>Someone else putting
a roof over your head?</i>

198
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,248
<i>-Someone paying the bills--?
-Johnny.</i>

199
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:34,576
<i>You've been so distant,
so far away. I cook. I clean house.</i>

200
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,845
<i>I wonder what your mother
would say. I do.</i>

201
00:28:37,012 --> 00:28:38,703
<i>My mother has no say.</i>

202
00:28:38,868 --> 00:28:42,184
<i>Do you think she cares about me?
You think she cares about you?</i>

203
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,123
<i>No, it's not.</i>

204
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:49,652
<i>She is addicted to vodka
and Valium, and she is....</i>

205
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,879
-You want some coffee?
-Yes, sir. Please.

206
00:28:56,757 --> 00:29:00,205
<i>No, she is not. She is not.</i>

207
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:01,551
<i>Oh, yes, I do care.</i>

208
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:06,292
Sit down.

209
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:11,116
<i>I gave up a scholarship
to State University to take this job--</i>

210
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:12,879
Can you sell us some food?

211
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,218
l'll give it to you.

212
00:29:15,926 --> 00:29:17,682
We have fresh meat.

213
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:20,823
Take what you want.

214
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:25,196
We had to kill him.

215
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,117
This fucking bear was killing
too many goats.

216
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,182
<i>No, it's not.
It's that girl from the....</i>

217
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:34,962
-ls this Coahuila?
-Yes, you're right here in Coahuila.

218
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:38,958
Do you know how to get to El Toston?

219
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:42,959
Twenty kilometers that way.

220
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,902
<i>I'm not stupid, Johnny.
I've got eyes in my head.</i>

221
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:49,684
When you hit the sierra,
head south and you'll get there.

222
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:53,746
<i>You're throwing your life away,
Johnny.</i>

223
00:29:53,913 --> 00:29:55,701
<i>Don't do it. Please don't do it.</i>

224
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:58,833
l've seen that. l know this one.

225
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:01,555
<i>Please. Please. Please.</i>

226
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:04,275
<i>You see, that's it.
That's exactly it, right there.</i>

227
00:30:04,442 --> 00:30:08,086
<i>That's what I'm talking about. It's
always the same, always the same.</i>

228
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,905
<i>Johnny.</i>

229
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,343
What'd the guy on TV say?

230
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:14,197
<i>We used to be so happy.</i>

231
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,370
Let's go.

232
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,199
Take it...

233
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,704
...for your troubles.

234
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,167
<i>We were happy then.</i>

235
00:30:26,331 --> 00:30:27,924
<i>And we'll be happy again.</i>

236
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,400
<i>I know it.</i>

237
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:32,531
<i>Please, don't cry.</i>

238
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,409
<i>There will always be
a River Valley for us.</i>

239
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,380
<i>I hope so, Johnny.</i>

240
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,686
<i>I hope so.</i>

241
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,041
-Yes, it's $2.
-You speak English.

242
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:41,110
Yeah, everyone here speak English.

243
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,451
We were worked on the other side.

244
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,161
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for a town called Jiménez.

245
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:49,183
Jiménez?

246
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:53,309
No, there's no place like that here.

247
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:56,251
Do you know of a place
called Jimenez?

248
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,370
Manuel...

249
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:04,251
...you ever hear of Jimenez?

250
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:06,330
Jiménez?

251
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:09,306
No, not around here.

252
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:17,921
They said it was a little village
about 1 0 kilometers away.

253
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,717
No, the only village around
here is called Los Chilicotes.

254
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:29,250
Do you know this woman?

255
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,161
Her name is Evelia Camargo.

256
00:32:33,091 --> 00:32:35,230
Yeah, l know her.

257
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,103
But her name's not Evelia.

258
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:40,478
lt's Rosa.

259
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:43,453
Do you know that man?

260
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:48,415
He's the one lived in Jiménez.
His name is Melquiades Estrada.

261
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:51,167
No, we don't him.

262
00:32:54,116 --> 00:32:56,059
What's he doing with that woman?

263
00:32:57,988 --> 00:32:59,712
l don't know.

264
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,155
Why you don't ask her?

265
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:07,199
She lives around the corner.

266
00:33:21,414 --> 00:33:22,592
You speak English?

267
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:31,014
Well, señora...

268
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:36,006
...Melquiades was a good friend.
l'm sorry to tell you he's passed away.

269
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:39,878
Who is Melquiades?

270
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,691
Melquiades, your husband.

271
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:45,792
He's passed away and l've brought
his body back from Texas.

272
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,895
l don't know anyone
named Melquiades.

273
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,238
Well, this is you and that's him.

274
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,823
What are you doing
with a photo of me and my kids?

275
00:33:58,984 --> 00:34:00,773
Melquiades gave it to me.

276
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:06,659
Please, señora,
you can tell me the truth.

277
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:08,767
He was a good friend of mine.

278
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:10,497
You were married to him,
weren't you?

279
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,770
Don't talk foolishness.

280
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:15,807
Because you'll get me in trouble
with my husband, Javier Martinez...

281
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:17,439
...and we don't know any Melquiades.

282
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,985
Excuse me, ma'am.
l didn't want to offend you.

283
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:25,762
But Melquiades was my friend.

284
00:34:28,586 --> 00:34:30,147
Go see Don Casimiro.

285
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:33,449
He knows everybody
that comes through town.

286
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:35,685
Maybe he can help you.

287
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,376
No.

288
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,093
l don't know him.

289
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,723
You know anything about
a little town called Jiménez?

290
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,444
No.

291
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,678
lt doesn't exist around here.

292
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:04,739
l know for sure.

293
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:07,878
lt doesn't exist.

294
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:09,735
Why?

295
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:22,985
Your friend lied to you.

296
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,867
-No, he didn't.
-Sure he did.

297
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,399
There's no Jiménez, man.

298
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,258
Wake up.

299
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:12,207
-That place doesn't exist.
-Yes, it does.

300
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:20,464
There is no fucking Jiménez, man!

301
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:24,966
Don't you see? There's no Jiménez!

302
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:26,894
lt exists.

303
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:30,058
Jimenez is a beautiful fucking place.

304
00:36:31,218 --> 00:36:33,454
lt sits between two hills.

305
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:37,456
The air is so clear there...

306
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:40,685
...you feel like you can hug
the mountains with your arms.

307
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:46,095
A stream of clear clean fresh water
bubbles up right out of the rocks there.

308
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,328
lf you go to Jimenez...

309
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,857
...l swear to you your heart will break
with so much beauty.

310
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,587
This is Jimenez.

311
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,577
lt's just like Mel said it was.

312
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,271
Got good water.

313
00:37:56,248 --> 00:37:57,710
And...

314
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:01,038
...that's the house.

315
00:38:04,728 --> 00:38:06,900
Store's right over yonder.

316
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:14,355
Graveyard.

317
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:25,689
Garden.

318
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,508
Right there.

319
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:30,008
See?

320
00:38:32,794 --> 00:38:35,063
Just like that right there.

321
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,004
See?

322
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,420
Yeah.

323
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:46,353
This is it.

324
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:50,450
You found it, Pete.

325
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:54,490
Well...

326
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:57,979
