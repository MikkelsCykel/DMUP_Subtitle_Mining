<i>Hey, Mowgli!</i>

2
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:10,279
<i>Hush. It's starting.</i>

3
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:13,677
<i>Come, children. Come watch.</i>

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:16,645
<i>Mowgli, tell us your story.</i>

5
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:24,516
I never knew where I came from.

6
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,599
But I always knew where I belonged.

7
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:36,557
This is me and Bagheera, the panther
who found me in the jungle.

8
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:38,478
He's a good friend.

9
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:42,719
But my best friend of all
was good ol' Papa Bear.

10
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:48,041
Man, we had
some crazy times together.

11
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:53,678
And when the monkeys grabbed me,
things got really crazy.

12
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,837
<i>Monkeys!</i>

13
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:58,843
Bad monkeys! Bad!

14
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,956
Go, Papa Bear!

15
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:06,721
<i>Then I came face to face</i>

16
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:11,278
with the meanest,
scariest tiger in the whole jungle,

17
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,483
Shere Khan.

18
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:18,486
You stay away from Mowgli,
you mean old tiger,

19
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:22,958
or I'll tie some fire to your tail
and burn your butt!

20
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:43,000
I got him, Mowgli. Did you see?

21
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:44,645
You sure did, Ranjan.

22
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,560
But it's gonna be hard
to finish the story now.

23
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,922
But we all know how it ends.

24
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:55,001
Shanti blinks her big,
beautiful brown eyes at you,

25
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:58,557
and you follow her into our village.

26
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:02,162
- I did not.
- Did so!

27
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:06,080
- Something was in my eye.
- Both of them?

28
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, you were so ugly,
you made my eyes water.

29
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,236
Well, you...

30
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:14,718
Now, now, we give thanks
for Shanti's beautiful brown eyes.

31
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:19,278
Without them, Mowgli would never
have come into our lives.

32
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,677
Come to think of it,
you used the same trick on me.

33
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,281
And you still fall for it.

34
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,644
Thank you for a wonderful story,
Mowgli.

35
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:37,165
- Goodnight, Mowgli.
- Night, Shanti.

36
00:02:37,247 --> 00:02:40,284
Watch out for Shere Khan
on your way home.

37
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,085
You and your stories.

38
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,842
Everyone knows tigers
don't come into the village.

39
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:49,681
Tigers go wherever they want!

40
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:53,439
Goodnight, boys.

41
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:59,326
Tomorrow's gonna be so great.

42
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,443
Erm... nothing.

43
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:07,477
Uh-huh. Well, you'll need plenty
of rest for doing nothing tomorrow.

44
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,046
Off to bed.

45
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:12,756
<i>We never get to stay up late.</i>

46
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,481
Even wild beasts need their sleep.

47
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,718
<i>Help! Ferocious tiger!</i>

48
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,838
Goodnight, my little wild thing.

49
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,598
Goodnight, Mowgli.

50
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:37,076
Happy dreams.

51
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,395
Erm...

52
00:03:38,487 --> 00:03:41,445
Goodnight, sir.

53
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:45,966
Why do you always call him "sir"?
His name's Pop.

54
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,126
Hmm!

55
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,805
Come on, Mowgli, wake up!
It's morning.

56
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,320
You said we'd go to...

57
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:31,556
Ranjan.

58
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:35,799
You want to wake the whole village?
When does the tiger roar?

59
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:37,636
I don't know.

60
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:41,197
After he catches his prey.

61
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,001
His prey.

62
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:48,318
Let's go get our prey.

63
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,644
- Boys?
- Huh!

64
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,558
Where are you going so early?

65
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:10,525
To... do our chores?

66
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,245
Not without breakfast.

67
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,281
- That's OK. We're not hungry.
- Got to go!

68
00:05:22,207 --> 00:05:23,959
Boys! Where are you going?

69
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:26,845
- To do our chores!
- Bye, Pop! See you later.

70
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,805
Remember, don't cross the river.

71
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:34,280
You can take the boy
out of the jungle.

72
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,325
But you can't take the jungle
out of the boy.

73
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,522
Yes.

74
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:41,440
That's what worries me.

75
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,839
- Hey, Shanti!
- Ah!

76
00:05:57,927 --> 00:05:59,485
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,240
Getting water.
What are you doing here?

78
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:05,922
Oh, I'm on the lookout...
for danger.

79
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,998
Danger? Please.

80
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,203
There's no danger around here.

81
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:14,081
Well, keep this just between us.

82
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,681
Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks.

83
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,235
Tiger tracks? Right.

84
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:21,522
It's Shere Khan.

85
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,325
I hear he's looking for me.

86
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:26,843
Seeking his bloodthirsty revenge.

87
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:30,966
So keep your ears open,
and always watch your back,

88
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,119
or the last thing
you'll ever hear is...

89
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,003
When does the tiger roar?

90
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,525
You're horrible!
Horrible, stinky boys.

91
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:52,405
Come on, Ranjan.
He's a bad influence.

92
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,886
Now, don't move.

93
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,765
That wasn't very nice, you know.

94
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:08,160
Stop that. You're not a jungle boy.

95
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:10,477
Why are you so scared of the jungle?

96
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:15,525
- Because it's dangerous.
- Dangerous? But Mowgli says...

97
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:18,485
You shouldn't listen
to everything Mowgli says.

98
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,797
But I thought you liked Mowgli.

99
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,845
Well, I do. I like Mowgli.

100
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,485
But I have... oh.

101
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,961
Er, you left this at the river.

102
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,883
Thank you.

103
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,561
She's in a bad mood.

104
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,361
Hey, Ranjan.

105
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:44,122
You want to see a little trick
I learned in the jungle?

106
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,364
That's a pretty good trick.

107
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:55,440
Well, here's a little trick
I learned right here at home.

108
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:01,876
Wow.

109
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,923
That's a neater trick.

110
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:07,445
Like I said, Ranjan,
don't listen to him.

111
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,798
She's right, Ranjan.
Don't listen to me.

112
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:13,447
Listen to the jungle.

113
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,880
Can you hear it?

114
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:16,844
Yeah.

115
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,679
The jungle.

116
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:22,079
Yeah, man.

117
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:26,285
And when you hear that rhythm,
you get a crazy feeling inside.

118
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,766
<i>That morning sun
peeks over the mountains</i>

119
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:32,964
<i>And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear</i>

120
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:33,843
Hear what?

121
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:35,963
<i>Hear the jungle rhythm</i>

122
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,766
<i>Those birds
are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks</i>

123
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:42,806
<i>The busy bee hums as he flies
Loud and clear</i>

124
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:45,447
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

125
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,916
<i>Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle</i>

126
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:50,157
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

127
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,715
<i>First you feel that beat
start bubbling under</i>

128
00:08:52,807 --> 00:08:55,275
<i>Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder</i>

129
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,882
<i>It's moving me
Sounds a lot like being free</i>

130
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:00,844
<i>When you feel</i>

131
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,963
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

132
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,124
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

133
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,767
Come on, Shanti.

134
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,202
<i>Can't do without rhythm</i>

135
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:16,599
<i>And when it fills the air
Animals everywhere</i>

136
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,837
<i>Join in the dance</i>

137
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:23,842
<i>You'll dance along with 'em
Feeling it steal your soul</i>

138
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:26,646
<i>- We'll stomp our paws
- Flap our wings</i>

139
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:30,242
<i>Maybe do one or two crazy things</i>

140
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,158
- Khan khan.
- Yeah, that's it.

141
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,324
Shanti, try this.

142
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,125
Not quite.

143
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,560
There we go.

144
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:01,682
No.

145
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,042
Take a look. Perfect.

146
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:08,999
<i>Check out those chattering
monkeys</i>

147
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,043
<i>Swinging through the banyan trees</i>

148
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:15,279
<i>Two by two
To the jungle rhythm</i>

149
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:18,086
<i>Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance</i>

150
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:22,160
<i>Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo</i>

151
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,045
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

152
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:26,802
That's it!

153
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,355
<i>Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle</i>

154
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:31,677
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

155
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,281
<i>First you feel that beat
start bubbling under</i>

156
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,835
<i>Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder</i>

157
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,363
<i>It's moving me!
Sounds a lot like being free</i>

158
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:44,759
<i>- When I feel
- When I feel, when I feel</i>

159
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:48,157
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

160
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:52,646
Wait. Wait stop.
You're crossing the river.

161
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:56,083
Mowgli, you can't go in the jungle.
It's dangerous.

162
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,123
Mowgli! Stop!

163
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,645
Shanti, what is it?

164
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,924
Children, come inside this instant.
All of you.

165
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,200
Mowgli.

166
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,562
That includes you.

167
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,203
I am very disappointed in you.

168
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:20,323
You put everyone in danger.

169
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:25,322
You know you're not allowed to cross
the river, yet you disobeyed me.

170
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:27,318
- But...
- No, Mowgli.

171
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:31,404
The jungle is a dangerous place.

172
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,761
I should know.

173
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,639
You are confined to your room
without dinner.

174
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:46,037
That should give you time to think
about what you've done.

175
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:56,559
Mowgli, I was only trying to...

176
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:20,882
<i>Oh, you can hightail it
out of the jungle</i>

177
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,522
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

178
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:46,998
Oh, Baloo.

179
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:00,845
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

180
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:03,122
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

181
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:06,119
<i>Forget about your worries
and your strife</i>

182
00:13:06,207 --> 00:13:09,802
<i>Oh, yeah! I mean the...
Do bah badda dadda de da dah</i>

183
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,843
<i>Rum pah patta reet ta dah</i>

184
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:14,885
<i>That bring
the bare necessities of life</i>

185
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:17,242
Now, that's more like it!

186
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:21,036
Look at you.
Growing like the proverbial weed.

187
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,799
Let's see if you still got it.

188
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,119
Take it away, Little Britches.

189
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:30,366
Poor fellow.

190
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:32,802
I said, take it away!

191
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:41,123
Well, this ain't gonna work.
You just ain't Mowgli.

192
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:47,286
I guess I got to get used
to singing solo.

193
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:53,198
<i>He's just not getting over that...</i>

194
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:57,167
Oh, no. Not again.

195
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,646
Baloo?

196
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,164
Mowgli.

197
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,203
Get out of here. Shoo!

198
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:02,676
Now, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

199
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,396
Baloo?

200
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,485
Baloo?

201
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:13,716
Oh, man.

202
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:17,917
Bagheera. How's it wagging?

203
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,599
This has to stop.

204
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,759
You can't take Mowgli
from the man village.

205
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:26,123
The boy's future
lies with his own kind.

206
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,846
Aw, his future can wait.

207
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,758
I miss my bear cub.

208
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,083
It's not safe for him in the jungle.

209
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,317
Shere Khan is looking for Mowgli.

210
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:40,685
Let Shere Khan try something.
We handled him once, we will again.

211
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:43,964
- Baloo, don't push your luck.
- Out of the way, Baggy.

212
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:46,766
You're not going near the village.

213
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,081
Later, Baggy.

214
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:59,238
That's it! Hathi, plan B!

215
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:06,638
Hup, two, three, four.
Keep it up, two, three, four.

216
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:10,515
Remember, men, our objective
is full and complete containment.

217
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:13,440
Prepare for Operation... Operation...

218
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:15,518
Er, "Stop That Bear"?

219
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,484
Very good, son.

220
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,877
Prepare for Operation Stop That Bear!

221
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:26,047
<i>By the ranks or single file</i>

222
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,277
<i>Over every jungle mile</i>

223
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,325
<i>Oh, we stamp and crush
Through the underbrush</i>

224
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,161
Will you please stop?

225
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:37,557
Brigade, halt!

226
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,556
Huh?

227
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,480
I told you, Baloo,

228
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,639
there's no way we're letting you
near the man village.

229
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:50,878
You ain't gonna stop me now, Baggy!
Look out below!

230
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:55,881
- Search the water!
- This way.

231
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,485
Nothing here, sir.

232
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,281
Baloo.

233
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,277
I've got him, Colonel!

234
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:24,165
Confound it, soldier. That's a fish!

235
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,236
Whoopsie.

236
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,045
Disgrace to the uniform.

237
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:34,037
Colonel! This log can't possibly
support your weight!

238
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,959
Balderdash!
Why, my dear boy, back in '88,

239
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,040
- in service to the Crown...
- Oh, no. Not again.

240
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:55,884
They don't make trees
like they used to.

241
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,125
Got him!

242
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,596
Got him right here!

243
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,201
Disguised as a panther, Baloo?

244
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:06,085
It's me, Hathi. Put me down

245
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,316
Sorry.

246
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:12,079
Keep searching, men.
He couldn't have gone far.

247
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:16,046
- My toes are getting pruney!
- Who are we looking for again?

248
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:19,676
Confound it, man.
We're looking for the elusive...

249
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:28,083
Don't turn me in, little guy.
I just want to see my bear cub.

250
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:32,763
I won't. I miss Mowgli, too.
This way, quick!

251
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:36,326
Hey, thanks, kid. You're alright.

252
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,199
Say, fellas, look who's coming.

253
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,925
That's Shere Khan.

254
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,726
- What'll we do?
- Don't start that again.

255
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:01,241
Lucky. Hey, Lucky.

256
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:02,643
Yeah?

257
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:05,799
That's the one we told you about.
Shere Khan.

258
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,036
Mmm!

259
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,687
Shere Khan. You don't say.

260
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:12,281
Hey, watch this. I got one for you.

261
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,358
Oi, look at me! Look at me!

262
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:19,966
I'm Shere Khan
and my tiger tushie's been torched!

263
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:25,960
Ask me if I can whup that tiger.
Go on.

264
00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:27,446
Can you whup that tiger?

265
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,882
I Shere Khan!

266
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:35,124
Do you get it? Save me! Save me!

267
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:40,645
I've been outwitted by 40 pounds
of scrawny man cub! Help!

268
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:46,197
I'm cracking myself up here.
I don't know how I do it.

269
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,360
Hi, kid. Mind if I drop in?

270
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,916
Baloo?

271
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,201
Oh, Baloo...

272
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:10,281
Shhh!

273
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,997
Papa Bear! Am I glad to see you.
What are you doing here?

274
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:19,236
What am I doing here?

275
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:22,876
Feeling right for the first time
in a while, that's what.

276
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,039
Hey, kid. Show me
you can still fight like a bear.

277
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:29,525
Oh, Little Britches,
you lost your touch.

278
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:37,922
Mowgli, I've got something for you.

279
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:42,443
Mowgli, it's me.

280
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,757
I get grounded all the time.

281
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,680
<i>Ah.</i>

282
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,645
I'm sorry you got in trouble.

283
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:58,966
Come on, man cub. Show yourself.

284
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,478
<i>- Come on!
- Whoa!</i>

285
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:07,556
Mowgli?

286
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,280
Come on. Stick and move.

287
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,964
Help! Wild animal!

288
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:24,720
Wild animal? Where?
Let's get out of here.

289
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,160
Help!

290
00:22:27,127 --> 00:22:29,516
What's that bear doing here?

291
00:22:29,607 --> 00:22:31,723
There's a wild animal in the village!

292
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:33,035
What's the matter?

293
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,004
There he is.

294
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,045
Where are you going? No!

295
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:39,402
Come back!
You're going the wrong way!

296
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,282
Whoa! A tiger!

297
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,243
Don't let him get away.

298
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,315
<i>- No!
- Get outta here!</i>

299
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:58,482
- Shanti, get indoors.
- No, no. He's over... No!

300
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:05,236
Shanti!

301
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,758
Shanti, wait for me.

302
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:12,000
A tiger.

303
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,199
Come on, follow me!

304
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,598
- Whoa!
- Mowgli!

305
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,084
Hold on, Mowgli.

306
00:24:13,847 --> 00:24:15,041
Mowgli!

307
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:22,242
<i>Mowgli, where are you?</i>

308
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,646
- Mowgli!
- They must be in the jungle.

309
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:27,843
<i>Ah!</i>

310
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:30,718
The jungle!

311
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:34,958
What a weird scene.
Is that place always like that?

312
00:24:35,087 --> 00:24:38,318
You don't know the half of it.
That village was terrible.

313
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:42,241
All you hear is rules, rules, rules
and work, work, work.

314
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:44,318
Kid, watch your language.

315
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:48,923
That's all they do! Washing,
dressing, fetching, cleaning...

316
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,599
I'm tired just listening to it.

317
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:53,155
Sounds like they're screwy
over there.

318
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:56,523
I don't want to talk about it.
Especially Shanti.

319
00:24:57,367 --> 00:25:00,962
- Who's Shanti?
- Just a girl from the village.

320
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:06,440
Hold on. Not the one that lured you
into that village in the first place?

321
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:09,166
Yup. That's the one.

322
00:25:09,247 --> 00:25:12,478
I knew it! I knew she was trouble!

323
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,957
I tried bringing her to the jungle
and she got me in trouble.

324
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,116
Say again?

325
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:19,767
I wanted her to see what fun we have.

326
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:21,803
And she got you into trouble?

327
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,286
- Yep!
- Ooh, man.

328
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:26,040
She thinks the jungle is scary.

329
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:29,164
- Where'd she get that crazy idea?
- You got me.

330
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:34,276
Do my snake eyes deceive me?

331
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:39,444
It's the succulent man cub.

332
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:43,399
You're with me now, kid.
Forget that girl.

333
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:47,321
You're better off without her.
You got everything you need here.

334
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:50,843
And me?
I got my old singing partner back.

335
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,205
Then hit it, Papa Bear!

336
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:59,006
<i>Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities</i>

337
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:02,523
<i>Forget about your worries
and your strife</i>

338
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:05,405
<i>I mean the bare necessities</i>

339
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,637
<i>Old Mother Nature's recipes</i>

340
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:11,561
<i>That bring
the bare necessities of life</i>

341
00:26:11,647 --> 00:26:13,922
<i>- Wherever I wander
- Where you going?</i>

342
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,838
<i>- Wherever I roam
- Oh, yeah.</i>

343
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:20,159
<i>I couldn't be fonder
Of my big home</i>

344
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:25,321
<i>The bees are buzzing in the tree
To make some honey just for me</i>

345
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:27,875
<i>When you look under
The rocks and plants</i>

346
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,878
<i>Take a glance at the fancy ants</i>

347
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:31,685
<i>And maybe try a few</i>

348
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,200
Thanks, Baloo.

349
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:40,163
<i>The bare necessities of life
will come to you</i>

350
00:26:40,247 --> 00:26:42,522
<i>They'll come to you</i>

351
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:43,756
Oh, Baloo!

352
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:47,760
I don't want ever to see that girl
or that village again.

353
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:51,886
Well, of course you don't.
It's just us bears from here on in.

354
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,559
Yeah, man.

355
00:26:53,647 --> 00:26:56,286
Hey. You remember everything
I learned you?

356
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,676
You bet I do, Papa Bear.

357
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,246
- Nah-uh!
- Huh?

358
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,363
<i>When you pick a pawpaw</i>

359
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:04,597
<i>Or a prickly pear</i>

360
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:09,158
<i>And you pick a raw paw
Well, next time, beware</i>

361
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:11,442
<i>Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw</i>

362
00:27:11,527 --> 00:27:13,995
<i>When you pick a pear
Try to use a claw</i>

363
00:27:14,087 --> 00:27:16,282
<i>But you don't need to use a claw</i>

364
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,961
<i>When you pick a pair
of the big pawpaw</i>

365
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,197
Have I given you a clue?

366
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:28,965
<i>The bare necessities of life
will come to you</i>

367
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,958
<i>- They'll come to you
- To me?</i>

368
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:36,405
I so despise
these song-and-dance routines.

369
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,438
Mowgli?

370
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,206
Mowgli? Is that you?

371
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:54,521
Mowgli?

372
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,957
He's gotta be here somewhere.

373
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,046
I swear...

374
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:21,523
...I shall never again associate...

375
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:25,687
with man cubs.

376
00:28:31,647 --> 00:28:33,205
Where could he be?

377
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,479
Why, the little...

378
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,517
...snack.

379
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:56,036
Who is it?

380
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:00,156
<i>Who's there?</i>

381
00:29:00,247 --> 00:29:03,603
Excuse me.

382
00:29:03,687 --> 00:29:09,239
Might I be of some assistance?

383
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:15,046
Are you lost, little one?

384
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:20,284
Are you hungry?

385
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,764
I'm starved.

386
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,037
Bad snake! Bad, bad snake!

387
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:38,641
Ranjan? What are you doing here?

388
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:42,037
You leave Shanti alone!

389
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:50,002
OK, Ranjan, I think he's had enough.

390
00:29:59,607 --> 00:30:02,360
You're not getting away that easy.

391
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:05,245
Ranjan,
you're not supposed to be here.

392
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:06,680
We have to get you home.

393
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:10,396
No! Mowgli's in trouble
and we're gonna find him.

394
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:14,205
I can smell him.

395
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:16,806
He's this way!

396
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:19,685
Oh, OK.

397
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:21,678
But stay close.

398
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:24,486
We don't want to run
into any more scary animals.

399
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:27,684
<i>Oh, stop that!</i>

400
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:34,320
Oh, mercy.

401
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:41,077
Shere Khan?

402
00:30:44,487 --> 00:30:46,000
Anyone I know?

403
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,326
I wish.

404
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,884
Stupid man cub.

405
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:53,719
Man cub?

406
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:57,361
Did I say man cub?

407
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,517
Well, you know...

408
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:04,076
...I'd love to stay
and shoot the breeze and all, but...

409
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,246
What's your hurry?

410
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,600
No reason. I, I...

411
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,439
Where is he?

412
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:18,236
- Who he?
- The man cub, Mowgli.

413
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:20,477
I know you know.

414
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,717
But I, I don't.

415
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:27,039
Please don't insult my intelligence.
It makes me irritable.

416
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:29,561
Oh. He's not in the village.

417
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:32,797
I know where he isn't.

418
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:36,880
Now tell me where he is.

419
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,401
Well, he's, he's...

420
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:41,435
The swamp!

421
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,041
He's at the swamp.

422
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,721
- The swamp, eh?
- Yes.

423
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:50,685
Trust in me.

424
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:55,804
He'd better be... for your sake.

425
00:31:55,887 --> 00:31:57,605
He is. He is.

426
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:02,283
I'd take you there myself,
but I'm afraid I'd slow you down.

427
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:04,164
Indigestion and all.

428
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,717
<i>Mowgli!</i>

429
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:09,445
<i>Ranjan!</i>

430
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,363
What is it? What on earth?

431
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:33,278
Retreat!

432
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,675
- Colonel Hathi.
- Take cover!

433
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,759
Oh, no. Not again.

434
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,439
Excuse me.

435
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,118
Pardon.

436
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:02,916
Colonel Hathi,
what is the meaning of this?

437
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:05,646
Man is in the jungle.

438
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:07,843
What does he want?

439
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,037
Mowgli!

440
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:22,438
Perhaps I was too harsh with the boy.

441
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:28,319
Don't worry. We'll find them.

442
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:32,681
Mowgli!

443
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:33,916
Ranjan!

444
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:37,316
Baloo.

445
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:40,397
Uh! Almost got it, Baloo.

446
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:42,125
Whoa!

447
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:48,037
Them primo mangoes,
always the hardest to get.

448
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,480
Got 'em.

449
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,478
This is the life.

450
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:57,046
Heads up.

451
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:01,758
Delicious.

452
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:03,599
Hey, check this out.

453
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:19,640
Hey. Not bad.
Where'd you learn that?

454
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:23,037
- Shanti showed me.
- Shanti?

455
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:25,883
No. I, I said wanti.

456
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:28,720
I wanti another mango.

457
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:32,163
No, that's not what you said.
You said Shanti.

458
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:33,202
No, I didn't.

459
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:34,959
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

460
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,878
- Did.
- Didn't.

461
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,320
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-uh.

462
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:41,080
- I heard it.
- Who cares about Shanti?

463
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,601
It's just a stupid trick, right?

464
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:46,679
Yeah, right.
You don't need her, kid.

465
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:48,917
You're with old Baloo now.

466
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:01,401
What are you laughing at?

467
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,518
What're you doing here, Baggy?

468
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,279
Haven't you heard?

469
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,483
Man is in the jungle.

470
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:14,197
What do they want?

471
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:16,403
They're searching for Mowgli.

472
00:35:16,487 --> 00:35:17,761
Mowgli?

473
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,486
Perhaps maybe you
have seen the boy.

474
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,444
Me? Uh, no.

475
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:26,076
Well, you know
his future is in that village.

476
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:27,962
Yes.

477
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:31,840
I just wish I knew where he was.

478
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:36,045
Yeah. Sorry.
I wish I could help you out, Baggy.

479
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:38,925
Enough games, Baloo!
Give me the boy.

480
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,646
Baggy, Baggy, Baggy.
I can explain.

481
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:43,479
I can explain. I...

482
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:46,717
I can explain, but I don't have to.

483
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:52,677
As you can plainly see,
Mowgli is not here. I'm all alone.

484
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:59,919
I know he's around here somewhere.
And he can't hide forever.

485
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,362
Well, he won't get past you, Baggy.

486
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:07,996
Kid?

487
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:10,679
Kid, where'd you go?

488
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:16,924
You trying to scare the tick
out of my ticker?

489
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:22,639
Wow.
The whole village, looking for me?

490
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:25,924
- We can't let nobody see you.
- I thought they were mad.

491
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:27,759
We got to lay low.

492
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:34,244
They must really miss me.

493
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:37,319
I wonder if Shanti's with them.

494
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:38,556
Shanti?

495
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:42,161
You definitely don't want her
to find you.

496
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,605
Do you?

497
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:52,757
No. We can't let anyone find us,
especially that girl.

498
00:36:52,847 --> 00:36:56,203
Come on, Baloo, we gotta get
moving. Lay low. Hunker down.

499
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:57,686
Hibernate, like.

500
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:02,803
Now, Mowgli,
what if that girl tracks us down?

501
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,003
What are you going to do?

502
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:07,203
Then you'll have to scare her.

503
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:10,324
Scare her?
Has the milk run out of your coconut?

504
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:14,002
No, she's terrified of wild animals.

505
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:17,716
In case you haven't noticed, kid,
I'm no wild animal.

506
00:37:17,807 --> 00:37:19,718
Except at parties.

507
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:22,924
I suppose I'm more of a honey bear.

508
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:26,795
You can do it, Baloo.
You taught me, remember?

509
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:29,082
You scrunch up your eyes like this.

510
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:31,362
And show your teeth like this.

511
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:35,520
<i>And roar like this.</i>

512
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:37,404
Roar?

513
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:40,160
No, no. Like you mean it!

514
00:37:40,247 --> 00:37:43,319
Do you want that girl to take me back
to the village?

515
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:50,441
Yeah, man. That was great.

516
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:52,006
Well, I don't know.

517
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,645
Trust me, that'll do it.

518
00:37:53,727 --> 00:37:58,243
In that case, Mowgli,
consider that girl scarified.

519
00:37:58,327 --> 00:38:01,399
- Thanks, Papa Bear.
- Anything for my Little Britches.

520
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,886
OK, let's skedaddle.

521
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,845
Now don't worry.
I got a place downriver.

522
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:08,646
- It's the perfect hideout.
- Real quiet, huh?

523
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:09,557
Quiet?

524
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:14,926
You want quiet, go back to the
man village. This place is happening.

525
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:18,441
OK, here's the village.

526
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:21,325
<i>We cross the river and...</i>

527
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:23,716
Ranjan, be careful!

528
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:28,485
OK, we went right.

529
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,035
No, no, no, left. Left, I mean.

530
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:33,925
Right. No, left, then right.

531
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,520
Oh!

532
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:38,326
This jungle all looks the same!

533
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:41,604
<i>Ranjan, what's that?</i>

534
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:46,685
Mowgli? He must have been here!

535
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:52,922
Or some animal
with really sharp claws.

536
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:15,597
That snake lied to me.

537
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,886
Now, don't take it out on the water

538
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,765
just because
you don't like the reflection.

539
00:39:23,647 --> 00:39:28,516
I mean, not everyone
can be born with such great looks.

540
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:31,167
You let that tiger
get his claws on you

541
00:39:31,247 --> 00:39:33,636
and you won't be so good-looking.

542
00:39:33,727 --> 00:39:37,959
What? That pussycat?
He's harmless. Watch this.

543
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:39,275
Oh, no.

544
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,759
What's the matter, Stripes?

545
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,441
Man cub got your tongue?

546
00:39:45,527 --> 00:39:48,758
Lucky, let's find something to do
somewhere else.

547
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:51,441
No, no. Hang on, fellas.
I got another one.

548
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:55,645
How many men does it take
to whup a tiger?

549
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,280
Surprise me.

550
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:01,086
None. A little kid can do it
all by himself.

551
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,605
- Come on, Lucky, let's go.
- Come on.

552
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:10,043
In fact, we heard that kid
is right here in the jungle.

553
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:13,676
Right under your whiskers.

554
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,325
Interesting.

555
00:40:15,407 --> 00:40:18,046
I heard he's headed
back to the village.

556
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:19,958
Wrong again, kitty.

557
00:40:20,047 --> 00:40:22,515
No, Lucky, keep your gob shut.

558
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:26,122
They say he's headed downriver,
with a bear.

559
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:28,926
Downriver, you say?

560
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:30,679
Don't listen to him.

561
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,964
Yeah. He's new around here.
He don't know anything

562
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:37,323
On the contrary,
he seems to know quite a lot.

563
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:42,202
Hold on, hot pants! Where's the fire?

564
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:49,640
Isn't it ironic
that your name is Lucky?

565
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:53,396
Come on, lads, this way!

566
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:15,916
This is the perfect hideout?
This is King Louie's place.

567
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:19,682
Was, kid, was. He's splitsville.

568
00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:23,919
Me and the monkeys turned it into
the greatest secret hideout ever.

569
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:29,604
Coming through. Hey, Baloo.
Good to see you back again, man.

570
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:35,045
- Everybody knows about it.
- Then how can it be a secret?

571
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:37,163
I mean, everybody who's anybody.

572
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:40,239
Nobody who's nobody don't know
nothing about no place

573
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:44,036
that everybody who's anybody
knows about. You dig?

574
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,719
My head hurts.

575
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:49,800
Turn the thinker off a minute
and just dive in.

576
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:54,278
Step aside, and I'll show you
what a real rug-cutter can do.

577
00:41:55,447 --> 00:42:00,726
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

578
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:03,162
the boss of bop, the jack of jive,

579
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,920
the jungle cat
who's really gonna keep it alive.

580
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,077
Get ready to stir it up
and serve it up.

581
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:12,285
I'm talking about
Baloo is in the house!

582
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:13,800
Hey, cats, alright!

583
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:21,006
<i>When we start to move
Hey, honey, it ain't no joke</i>

584
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:24,045
<i>We got a savage groove
We didn't learn from human folk</i>

585
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,879
<i>No human folk</i>

586
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:29,960
<i>Excuse our incivility
We're W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

587
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,801
<i>When the music plays
All the people stomp their feet</i>

588
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:38,563
<i>But a stomping paw
Can lay down a better beat</i>

589
00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:40,683
<i>Tell me we ain't naturally</i>

590
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,076
<i>W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

591
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,806
<i>It's a snap
To bring out the beast in you</i>

592
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,196
<i>You're free like the bird it's true</i>

593
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,245
<i>Or a frog or a hog or...
Oh, man, whatever!</i>

594
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:55,639
<i>From the baddest cat
To the sweetest little deer</i>

595
00:42:55,727 --> 00:43:00,278
<i>Tonight's the night
We're gonna get our tails in gear</i>

596
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,039
<i>Show me your ferocity</i>

597
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:04,277
<i>Go W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

598
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:06,358
<i>We snort, we squeak</i>

599
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:08,597
<i>Up high or deep underground</i>

600
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,996
<i>We snarl, we shriek</i>

601
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:13,123
<i>We fly round and round and round</i>

602
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:17,405
Ah, go, you sweet thing.
That's inhuman, baby.

603
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:19,637
<i>The old mongoose
Gets good and loose</i>

604
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,638
<i>The ocelot gives it all he's got</i>

605
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,922
<i>The parakeet
Goes, "Twiddlee-deet"</i>

606
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:26,316
<i>The red macaque
Shouts "Hang on, Jack!"</i>

607
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:28,363
<i>- The tiny worm
- The pachyderm</i>

608
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:30,278
<i>- The spotted cat
- The water rat</i>

609
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,562
<i>- The great cuckoo
- The bear Baloo</i>

610
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:34,399
<i>Are W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

611
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:35,602
<i>Here's the thing!</i>

612
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:37,643
<i>If we're broke, we never squawk</i>

613
00:43:37,727 --> 00:43:41,083
<i>We don't need to check no clock
To know what time it is</i>

614
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,839
<i>It's time to rock</i>

615
00:43:42,927 --> 00:43:45,999
<i>When you dance like that
Hey, honey, it sure is hip</i>

616
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:47,566
I can't stand it!

617
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:50,605
<i>I want to tip my hat
But I got no hat to tip</i>

618
00:43:50,687 --> 00:43:51,881
I don't need no hat.

619
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,117
<i>Ask me why and I won't lie</i>

620
00:43:54,207 --> 00:43:56,118
<i>I'm W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

621
00:43:56,207 --> 00:44:00,200
<i>We grunt, we growl
Up high or deep underground</i>

622
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:02,437
<i>We hoot, we howl</i>

623
00:44:02,527 --> 00:44:04,836
<i>We fly round and round and round</i>

624
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:06,838
<i>My oh me, it's plain to see</i>

625
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,236
<i>We're W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

626
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:11,238
<i>He, she, me, uniquely</i>

627
00:44:11,327 --> 00:44:13,443
<i>W-I-I-I-L-D</i>

628
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,722
<i>Every beastie running free</i>

629
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:19,197
<i>W-I-I-I-I-I</i>

630
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:20,720
<i>L- D!</i>

631
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,520
Whoo-hoo. That's my boy.

632
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:34,997
They don't swing like that
in your man village, do they kid?

633
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:38,204
Well, no.

634
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:41,245
Big fat no.
Say, what that village like, anyway?

635
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:47,562
Whoa, don't bother the kid.
He told me all about that scene.

636
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:51,640
Let me lay it out for you.
Those people are crazy.

637
00:44:51,727 --> 00:44:54,958
Everybody works and nobody plays.

638
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:56,082
Oh, man!

639
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:58,840
They got nothing
but rules, rules, rules.

640
00:44:58,927 --> 00:45:04,718
And there's even this girl who thinks
the jungle is a scary place.

641
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:09,276
But, you know, it doesn't matter,

642
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:14,157
cos Mowgli will never see that
village or that crazy girl again.

643
00:45:14,247 --> 00:45:15,760
Ain't that so, kid?

644
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,965
Mowgli? Mowgli?

645
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:23,238
Mowgli?

646
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:35,598
Mowgli?

647
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,675
<i>That morning sun</i>

648
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:57,840
<i>Peeks over the mountains</i>

649
00:45:57,927 --> 00:46:02,478
<i>And all the rhinos rub their eyes</i>

650
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:06,318
<i>When they hear</i>

651
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:10,955
<i>Hear the jungle rhythm</i>

652
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:20,836
Did we find Mowgli yet?

653
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,519
Are you tired?

654
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:26,040
A little.

655
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:27,924
I'm sure we'll find him soon.

656
00:46:29,327 --> 00:46:31,522
Come on. Hop up.

657
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,120
You OK up there?

658
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,444
<i>How could it be</i>

659
00:46:40,527 --> 00:46:44,918
<i>Half as good as being free?</i>

660
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:48,362
<i>Part of me</i>

661
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:53,756
<i>Like the jungle rhythm</i>

662
00:46:57,207 --> 00:47:00,677
<i>Like the jungle rhythm</i>

663
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:02,917
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

664
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:04,804
It sounded like Mowgli.

665
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,083
- Mowgli!
- Ranjan, wait!

666
00:47:17,327 --> 00:47:18,726
Mowgli!

667
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:21,116
Shanti? Whoa!

668
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:22,162
Are you OK?

669
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:24,238
Oh, I feel "vine".

670
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,885
What are you doing up there?

671
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:27,923
Hold on. I'll be right...

672
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:32,876
- I can't believe I found you.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

673
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:35,162
You out here, kid?

674
00:47:35,247 --> 00:47:36,999
Hey, Little Britches!

675
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,725
Mowgli?

676
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,796
You're not really helping.

677
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:49,720
- Ranjan, stop pulling.
- It's her.

678
00:47:54,767 --> 00:47:57,122
That wild bear that carried you off.

679
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,925
<i>What wild...</i>

680
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:06,523
Baloo, don't! No!

681
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:11,238
Roar.

682
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:16,403
My poor sneezer. That hurt.

683
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:20,446
You come anywhere near Ranjan
and I'll really show you hurt.

684
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,119
- Wait!
- Don't make me do it.

685
00:48:22,207 --> 00:48:24,926
Wait. Calm down. It's OK.

686
00:48:25,007 --> 00:48:26,520
But he's attacking us.

687
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:29,326
Attacking? I'm the one
socked in the schnozzle.

688
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,398
That's because you scared her.

689
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,684
But, you told me to scarify her.

690
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:36,881
- What?
- No.

691
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:41,802
Wait a minute.
Mowgli, you planned this?

692
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:43,479
Well, I...

693
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,922
- Come on, Ranjan.
- Shanti, I can explain!

694
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,884
Don't even bother.

695
00:48:50,647 --> 00:48:51,796
Shanti, wait!

696
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,964
Man, you weren't kidding about her.
She's bad news.

697
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:59,005
No, she's not. She was helping
and you scared her.

698
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:00,440
Man alive!

699
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:03,644
First, you tell me to scare her,
then, you tell me not to.

700
00:49:03,727 --> 00:49:07,800
Kid, I only got so much room in this
noggin, and it's filling up fast.

701
00:49:07,887 --> 00:49:10,321
You just don't understand.

702
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:13,205
Alright,
how's about laying it out for me?

703
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,687
Read you loud and clear, kid.

704
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:25,122
You wanted that girl to find you.

705
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:30,996
Oh!

706
00:49:34,727 --> 00:49:37,719
Shanti! Shanti!

707
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:39,726
Where are you?

708
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,165
Come on!

709
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:48,760
There you are.

710
00:49:48,847 --> 00:49:52,476
I'm so sorry.
Will you let me explain?

711
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:55,525
Come on, at least talk to me.

712
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:04,959
You seem surprised to see me,
man cub.

713
00:50:06,327 --> 00:50:08,204
I can't imagine why.

714
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:12,876
I wasn't going to let you get away
with what you did to me.

715
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:17,402
You see, you humiliated me, man cub.

716
00:50:17,487 --> 00:50:20,638
Surely you do realise
I simply can't let you live.

717
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,236
Run.

718
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:33,084
Oh, you're going to try
and outrun me.

719
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,885
How droll.

720
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,039
Come on. This way!

721
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:51,243
Alright. Stay here.

722
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,200
Mowgli, no!

723
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:59,083
Wait here.
I have to help Mowgli.

724
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,123
But I want to help Mowgli, too!

725
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:05,200
No, I'll be right back, I promise.
Don't move.

726
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,757
Whoa. Hold still. Calm down, kid.
Where's Mowgli?

727
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:24,836
Shere Khan.

728
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:25,837
Shere Khan?

729
00:51:26,087 --> 00:51:27,315
Hold on!

730
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:28,476
Whoa!

731
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:36,761
Whoa!

732
00:51:54,687 --> 00:51:57,326
No matter how fast you run,

733
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,682
no matter where you hide,

734
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:02,281
I will catch you.

735
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:12,006
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

736
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:16,442
Hurry! Hurry!

737
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:18,677
Faster! Faster!

738
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:21,042
Not another man cub.

739
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:22,924
Can't you go any faster?

740
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,317
Baloo!

741
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:27,045
What is the meaning of this?

742
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,436
- Mowgli's in trouble!
- Shanti, too!

743
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:31,677
Who's Shanti?

744
00:52:52,087 --> 00:52:54,521
Take the kid! I'll help Mowgli.

745
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:57,356
Baloo!

746
00:52:57,447 --> 00:52:58,766
Be careful.

747
00:53:04,567 --> 00:53:06,398
Hmm? Mowgli?

748
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:12,280
Mowgli, is that you?

749
00:53:14,447 --> 00:53:16,244
Mowgli?

750
00:53:20,727 --> 00:53:22,046
Uh!

751
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:26,366
- You! Stay away from me!
- You! Why are you here?

752
00:53:26,447 --> 00:53:29,803
- One of my den has a problem.
- I spent a night in the jungle.

753
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,196
I was attacked by a snake.
But I don't care.

754
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,120
- I'm here to help Mowgli!
- I'm here to help Mowgli!

755
00:53:35,207 --> 00:53:36,879
- You what?
- You are?

756
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:39,640
I guess we're on the same side.

757
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:40,921
I guess so.

758
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:43,475
- OK.
- OK.

759
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:46,286
You go that way. I'll cover you.

760
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:51,280
Oh, no.

761
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:57,595
Well, isn't this a delightful turn
of events?

762
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:02,963
So, what's it going to be, man cub?

763
00:55:03,047 --> 00:55:07,120
You or your adorable
little girlfriend?

764
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:10,846
I'm waiting.

765
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:12,716
One.

766
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:15,757
- Two.
- No, don't!

767
00:55:15,847 --> 00:55:17,280
Thr...

768
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:22,764
No more games, man cub.

769
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:32,081
- Mowgli!
- Come on!

770
00:55:35,927 --> 00:55:37,519
Mowgli, look out!

771
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:44,398
- Oh, no!
- We can do it. Jump!

772
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:54,522
Come on!

773
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,676
Mowgli.

774
00:56:23,607 --> 00:56:28,362
Hello, Stripes. You're looking a bit
down in the mouth today.

775
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:31,204
Oh, no.

776
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,643
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

777
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:39,596
I always said you had a good head
on your shoulders Khanny, me boy.

778
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:45,803
This is fantastic, playing to a
captive audience. I just love it.

779
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:50,242
- Bagheera.
- Mowgli.

780
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,835
It's awfully good to see you,
man cub.

781
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:56,441
Come on, follow me!

782
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,677
Bagheera, this is Shanti,

783
00:56:58,767 --> 00:57:00,917
my best friend from the village.

784
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:03,237
<i>Ranjan!</i>

785
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:04,840
Shanti!

786
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:06,599
There they are!

787
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:09,406
- Papa! Who-hoo!
- Come on, Mowgli!

788
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:14,606
<i>Mowgli!</i>

789
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:29,604
Mowgli, I have to go.

790
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,356
<i>Shanti.</i>

791
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:47,924
Well? Come on, Mowgli.

792
00:57:49,927 --> 00:57:51,360
Er...

793
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:57,164
Come on, Ranjan.

794
00:58:15,767 --> 00:58:16,995
Oh, Baloo.

795
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:19,600
It's OK, kid.

796
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:23,518
That girl isn't so bad after all,
is she?

797
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:30,360
Go on, Mowgli.

798
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:36,282
Really?

799
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:38,801
Really. Don't let her get away.

800
00:58:40,087 --> 00:58:41,202
Come with me.

801
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:44,560
Now you know I can't do that.

802
00:58:45,927 --> 00:58:48,521
I'm gonna miss you, Papa Bear.

803
00:58:49,687 --> 00:58:52,884
Me, too, Little Britches. Me, too.

804
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,998
Alright. There, come on, now.

805
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:05,396
You'd better hurry up.

806
00:59:28,447 --> 00:59:30,483
<i>Hey, wait!</i>

807
00:59:31,727 --> 00:59:33,718
Mowgli!

808
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:36,996
What took you so long?

809
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:42,563
- Race you back!
- Come on, Ranjan.

810
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:43,875
Wait! Wait!

811
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,846
- Shanti!
- We've found the children.

812
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:49,885
- Ranjan!
- Mummy!

813
00:59:49,967 --> 00:59:52,197
You gave us quite a scare.

814
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:54,642
Shanti, I was so worried about you.

815
00:59:54,727 --> 01:00:00,518
I'm OK. I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help Mowgli.

816
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:04,039
I'm sorry, sir. It's just that...

817
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:06,721
No, Mowgli. I'm sorry.

818
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:12,359
I should have understood that
the jungle is a part of who you are.

819
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:19,846
I'm just glad you're safe.

820
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:22,443
- Ranjan.
- You won't believe it.

821
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:25,564
There was a big old snake
and I beat him up.

822
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:27,365
Of course you did.

823
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:34,477
I'm proud of you, Baloo.
That was very brave...

824
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:35,966
Now, Baggy.

825
01:00:36,047 --> 01:00:39,437
Don't get any ideas
about running after him

826
01:00:39,527 --> 01:00:42,758
and trying to talk him
into staying with us.

827
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:45,486
He belongs in that village,
and you know it.

828
01:00:45,567 --> 01:00:47,080
Oh, really?

829
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:50,557
Yes, really.
He's got his whole future there.

830
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:55,726
I'm sorry, Baloo.
You're absolutely right.

831
01:00:57,167 --> 01:01:00,045
I'm really gonna miss that kid.

832
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:02,038
Me, too.

833
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,683
Wait a minute.

834
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:09,520
I'm having myself an idea.

835
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:12,917
Baloo?

836
01:01:20,207 --> 01:01:22,277
Come on, Mowgli. We'll be late.

837
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:26,360
OK. I'm right behind you.

838
01:01:27,007 --> 01:01:29,441
Just getting some water.

839
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:33,315
- Alright. Be careful, son.
- I will. See you, Pop.

840
01:01:34,327 --> 01:01:38,206
Let's see if he remembers to actually
bring back some water this time.

841
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:43,235
Hey, Shanti, let's remember to
actually bring back water this time.

842
01:01:57,207 --> 01:01:59,038
Yeah, man!

843
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:02,041
Man, that beat is chillin' me.

844
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:04,721
- Hi, Papa Bear.
- Hey there, Little Britches.

845
01:02:04,807 --> 01:02:05,922
Shanti!

846
01:02:09,287 --> 01:02:10,356
Ranjan?

847
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:12,125
Ow!

848
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:22,285
<i>Look for the bare necessities</i>

849
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:24,562
<i>The simple bare necessities</i>

850
01:02:24,647 --> 01:02:27,480
<i>Forget about your worries
and your strife</i>

851
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:28,477
Yeah, man.

852
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:31,320
<i>I mean, the bare necessities</i>

853
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:33,796
<i>That's why us bears
can rest at ease</i>

854
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:36,845
<i>With just the bare necessities
of life</i>

855
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:37,996
Oh, yeah.

856
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,920
<i>With just
the bare necessities of life</i>

857
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,486
One more time!

858
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:45,559
<i>With just the bare necessities
of life</i>

859
01:02:45,647 --> 01:02:47,046
<i>Yeah, man!</i>

860
01:02:57,047 --> 01:02:58,321
Can you hear it?

861
01:02:59,687 --> 01:03:02,076
Yeah, man.

862
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,365
<i>Now, I'm the king of the swingers</i>

863
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:11,802
<i>The jungle VIP</i>

864
01:03:11,887 --> 01:03:14,924
<i>I reached the top and had to stop</i>

865
01:03:15,007 --> 01:03:17,441
<i>And that's what's bothering me</i>

866
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,280
<i>I want to be a man, man cub</i>

867
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,040
<i>And stroll right into town</i>

868
01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:25,800
<i>And be just like the other men</i>

869
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:28,196
<i>I'm tired of monkeying around</i>

870
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:30,278
<i>Oh, oobee doo</i>

871
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:33,040
<i>I wanna be like you</i>

872
01:03:33,327 --> 01:03:35,204
<i>I wanna walk like you</i>

873
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:38,085
<i>Talk like you, too</i>

874
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,806
<i>You'll see it's true</i>

875
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:43,879
<i>An ape like me</i>

876
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:47,801
<i>Can learn to be human, too</i>

877
01:03:47,887 --> 01:03:49,605
Whoo, baby!

878
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:52,798
Yeah, take it away!

879
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:57,196
Crazy man, crazy.

880
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:58,686
Let's go.

881
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:00,965
Here we go.

882
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:02,761
Come on.

883
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,725
<i>Bop te roonee!</i>

884
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:15,039
- Check this out.
- This place is happening!

885
01:04:15,127 --> 01:04:16,276
Can you hear it?

886
01:04:16,367 --> 01:04:17,482
Oh yeah.

887
01:04:21,887 --> 01:04:24,196
Step, step, step, step aside.

888
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:27,245
And I'll show you
what a real rug cutter can do.

889
01:04:29,087 --> 01:04:31,203
Anything for my Little Britches.

890
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:32,276
Hit it, Papa Bear.

891
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:34,198
<i>Yeah, you</i>

892
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,926
<i>I wanna be like you</i>

893
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:38,998
<i>I wanna walk like you</i>

894
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:42,045
<i>Talk like you, too</i>

895
01:04:42,127 --> 01:04:44,687
<i>You'll see it's true</i>

896
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,043
<i>Someone like me</i>

897
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:52,040
<i>Can learn to be someone like me</i>

898
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:57,320
<i>Can learn to be someone like you</i>

899
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:02,326
<i>Can learn to be someone like me</i>

900
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:05,679
Yeah, man.

901
01:05:05,767 --> 01:05:07,678
Hey, not bad.

902
01:05:17,727 --> 01:05:23,324
<i>Sometimes when night has come</i>

903
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:28,322
<i>The river sings a song</i>

904
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:33,925
<i>In my dreams it seems to leave me</i>

905
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:38,125
<i>Right where I belong</i>

906
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:44,446
<i>Wandering everywhere</i>

907
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:48,566
<i>Each way I turn is wrong</i>

908
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:54,807
<i>How I'm wishing I could be there</i>

909
01:05:54,887 --> 01:05:59,085
<i>Right where I belong</i>

910
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:02,767
<i>Smiles that have warmed me</i>

911
01:06:02,847 --> 01:06:05,441
<i>Arms that have held me</i>

912
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:10,362
<i>Are all a part of who I am.</i>

913
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:16,522
<i>It's never easy
leaving your friends behind</i>

914
01:06:17,247 --> 01:06:23,038
<i>Missing them, loving them</i>

915
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:28,326
<i>Someplace was meant for me</i>

916
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:34,596
<i>And that's what keeps me strong</i>

917
01:06:36,447 --> 01:06:42,238
<i>Somehow knowing I'll be going</i>

918
01:06:42,327 --> 01:06:47,003
<i>Right where I belong</i>

919
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:50,806
<i>Right where I</i>

920
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:58,805
<i>Home where I belong</i>

921
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:06,124
<i>Check out those
chattering monkeys</i>

922
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:08,084
<i>Swinging
through the banyan trees</i>

923
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:12,365
<i>Two by two
To the jungle rhythm</i>

924
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:15,484
<i>Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance</i>

925
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:19,242
<i>Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo</i>

926
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,841
<i>To the jungle rhythm</i>

927
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,405
<i>Now you can hightail it
out of the jungle</i>

928
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:28,637
<i>But it never leaves your heart</i>

929
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:31,241
<i>First you feel that beat
start bubbling under</i>

930
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:33,716
<i>Then you hear the tom-toms
loud as thunder</i>

931
01:08:33,807 --> 01:08:37,402
<i>It's moving me!
Sounds a lot like being free</i>

932
01:08:37,487 --> 01:08:41,765
<i>- When I feel
- When I feel, when I feel</i>

933
01:08:41,847 --> 01:08:44,600
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

934
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,557
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

935
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:54,197
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>

936
01:08:55,207 --> 01:08:57,880
<i>Feel the jungle rhythm</i>
