1
00:01:17,374 --> 00:01:18,839
Astonishing truth?

2
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:22,963
The people think about me as something environmental.

3
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:25,164
And when I go down to see them, they say:

4
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:27,724
Mother Nature, you are a female dog
destructive.

5
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,427
Ok, which you see is disaster.

6
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:33,331
While I see the growth for the
following generation.

7
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:36,862
You want to grow without food, without
animal.

8
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,454
And from the small ones, until the humans,

9
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,722
that be very grateful.

10
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:44,388
And everything worked well.

11
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:48,085
Until that a generation arrived.

12
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,954
The spoiled babies

13
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,889
and these dwarfs of diapers.

14
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,979
They thought could make everything that you/they wanted
when quizessem.

15
00:01:58,455 --> 00:01:59,442
For instance:

16
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,844
When he/she enters her in war

17
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:05,675
that is to demonstrate his/her force.

18
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,216
However these boys say:

19
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,739
I don't like this war.

20
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,376
I believe that will stay home.

21
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,106
The hour that you/they stop looking doesn't arrive
in turn and have.

22
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:17,635
They say, our careers come first.

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,234
The babies can wait.

24
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:21,470
They want to be happy with money and

25
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:23,766
to accumulate ownerships without serventia.

26
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:27,264
And they think that can pick the resources
natural.

27
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:28,772
And to contaminate the water.

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,862
And to build buildings until the sky.

29
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,736
However I have the power.

30
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:34,961
Yes, yes, because now

31
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:36,732
They will age.

32
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:38,923
And they won't like.

33
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:41,230
And they will say: Oh, I don't want a double chin!

34
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:44,391
They will remove them a piece of the behind for
to put him/it in the face.

35
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,421
That is not natural.

36
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,362
It is not natural.

37
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,955
And they will say, no, we don't want to age.

38
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:51,587
I want to be young forever.

39
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:53,287
For always and forever.

40
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,088
And they know what think.

41
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,649
Pure shit.

42
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,247
IT COULD NEVER BE HIS/HER

43
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:29,118
Hello mom, where were they?

44
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:32,445
We went to see Sara in his/her house

45
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,244
and soon we were Beverly Hills.

46
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:37,439
However they said that you/they wanted their own children.

47
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,969
I forgot of who was each son.

48
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,772
That such he/she sees himself each boy with each dad, that
it is good.

49
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:48,972
What did in his/her head pass?

50
00:04:49,575 --> 00:04:51,665
They turned me a little

51
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,762
because my hair grew inside of my head.

52
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,465
Instead of out.

53
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:57,368
What does make with that?

54
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,560
What?

55
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:01,331
That is mine, I bought him/it

56
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,357
in the again.

57
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:03,394
And he/she didn't have his/her wallet, as always.

58
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:04,229
As soon as I bought him/it.

59
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,858
Because he/she didn't have my pants, for that.

60
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,821
Although he/she never trains. He/she always walks with
sweater.

61
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:13,455
If at least it, he/she would stay in
form.

62
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:16,859
He/she believes that to use creams me he/she will make to seem as
adolescent.

63
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,588
And you think that to use his/her cap behind

64
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,387
will he/she do him/her riper?

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,187
He/she thinks that to use that shirt does to seem him/her
more serious.

66
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,981
In other words, that he/she has state writing the whole end
of week

67
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:31,986
without encounters?

68
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,782
Didn't any handout arrive?

69
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:35,250
No.

70
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,376
He/she will want to jump on me.

71
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:38,179
Only human being.

72
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,206
Does he/she know about a thing?

73
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,045
Deberia to leave.

74
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,480
I will mark him/her an encounter with somebody.

75
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:46,311
You have luck.

76
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,068
What did mom, happen with the good arrivals?

77
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,744
Lindsay, love you.

78
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,800
Thank you, Orlando.

79
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:59,400
Ei, you said that he/she loved me.

80
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:03,405
He/she never said that. Still dressed of bride no
he/she would change of idea.

81
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:06,061
However you love me, I know that yes.

82
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,900
Orlando, we go!

83
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,698
Go, he is mine!

84
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,792
And you have an ugly body.

85
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,630
It is igualzinho to yours.

86
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:17,155
And that dress is so out!

87
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,291
What does mean he/she?

88
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,524
When in the school something is old-fashioned
we called him/it out.

89
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,825
However affection, that is to deceive somebody.

90
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:28,022
As the one that uses the ugliest clothes of the
neighborhood.

91
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:29,152
I will already reward him.

92
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,489
Leave my man or he/she dies.

93
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,354
Do I believe that you are very beautiful, does he/she want to swim?

94
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,587
Why suddenly is happy?

95
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:36,954
It is maniac depressive.

96
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:39,849
Mom, and as he/she knows when true love is?

97
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,843
He/she usually listens the highest music and

98
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:46,580
sometimes seedling with him, sometimes included space
higher.

99
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:48,711
Not in television, but in the real life.

100
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,182
Real life?

101
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,481
Of where removes that?

102
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:02,272
He/she knows, no longer they import me so much Barbie.

103
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,367
However they newly are beginning.

104
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:05,468
He/she has a jeep,

105
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,772
a horse, a fourth of recordings.

106
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,002
Yes, but no longer it satisfies me.

107
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,367
God!

108
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:26,834
The people still God says?

109
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:31,355
Clear, nowadays it is said, God, I am dying from hunger.

110
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:37,390
Dog, don't behave as if he/she didn't know.

111
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:40,257
He/she should know how to hold.

112
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:41,521
He/she knows that he/she only wants to annoy him/her.

113
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,719
I believe that he/she needs to stand back of that.

114
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,224
Only remember every time to see a tree!

115
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,382
He/she won't have this man of the trees that
have.

116
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,078
Wait!

117
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:57,044
He/she is right, I went dizzy.

118
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,382
No there is other tree that quizesse to see.

119
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:06,973
Cut!

120
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:11,546
Did I go too emotional?

121
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,909
He/she enchanted me that of the trees.

122
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,967
You were well, he/she gave me a lot.

123
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,101
You were well, he/she gave him/her a lot.

124
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:21,506
It was emotional, so brilliant!

125
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,938
That is beautiful, of where removed him/it?

126
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,063
Ei Rosie, there is a meeting.

127
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:31,694
Good-bye!

128
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:33,897
Let us find the mom!

129
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:42,562
And these balls are so weighed!

130
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:44,622
Where?

131
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:46,527
The balls are very weighed!

132
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,627
The one of the bowling.

133
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:49,627
It is an organ!

134
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,583
They seem the man's testicles.

135
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,184
And that is stupid.

136
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:56,384
Only play her.

137
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:57,451
It is Gena!

138
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:58,479
My secretary.

139
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:00,413
That is enough for me.

140
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:04,478
He made a lot of games for will Grace.

141
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:06,646
It is besides you never support him.

142
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:07,676
Everything is a game.

143
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,448
Is he/she making another show of talents?

144
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:11,179
Where?

145
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,410
What has of 2006.

146
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,574
He/she makes my plastic surgery show.

147
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,273
It is astonishing what do.

148
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:19,781
Fact is had the eyes.

149
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,508
He/she seems a 28 year-old man.

150
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,704
He/she thinks that suddenly can if for in a
young picture.

151
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:29,869
Unless it maintains his/her form, mute.

152
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:33,101
He/she can run, to jump from top to bottom.

153
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:35,868
However inside it continues envelhencendo.

154
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,964
Ei, there is something new to redo.

155
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,769
Internal organs.

156
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:43,228
Now he/she can make him/it.

157
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:45,202
A reduction of the stomach or

158
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,894
a piling of straight.

159
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:51,161
If he/she does them baby, it will seem younger than yours
former-wife.

160
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:01,056
He/she is with that of Cameron Diaz and Justin
Timbarlake.

161
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:04,184
I am the one that is behind that and who me
pay.

162
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:07,555
I don't want that his/her wife if it completes, nor the
whole people.

163
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,149
I call soon, mom.

164
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:11,889
Did anybody call?

165
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:13,854
See what did Rhiana!

166
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:15,778
He/she already made that to Tom.

167
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:16,685
It is so comic!

168
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:22,051
We have to do some changes in the episode.

169
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,448
The part that left in the bowling was cut.

170
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,575
He/she has to do what is better for the show.

171
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:30,047
He/she was the censor, they thought was very sexy.

172
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,043
Do I feel a lot of tá?  Forget!

173
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:36,511
If somebody needs of me, I am alone.

174
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:37,340
Clear!

175
00:10:39,845 --> 00:10:40,469
Speak to me girl!

176
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:41,304
Is Rosie?

177
00:10:41,343 --> 00:10:42,331
No, has just left.

178
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,766
He/she had to do an emergency botox.

179
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:45,569
You are bad!

180
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:01,357
No, no sobreatue, be only nice.

181
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:06,891
Quite so, speak to the girls.

182
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:10,987
Female dogs!

183
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:17,653
Good-bye Dilan!

184
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:20,987
Hello!

185
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:21,887
Hello mom!

186
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,253
What does the one know happened today?

187
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,256
What?

188
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,155
I went to the bathroom

189
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,415
and he/she had blood and I was not nervous.

190
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,442
Wanted, that is his/her period.

191
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:39,539
Happinesses, you are a woman!

192
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,580
That the game begins!

193
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:47,042
Mom, which is better? Maxi with brims or

194
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,977
these super absorbent?

195
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,872
I like these other ones.

196
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,671
Wanted, he/she doesn't need these whole ones.

197
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:55,569
Can I use these? Yes.

198
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:02,005
Ops, had a career

199
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,663
moving my trazeiro

200
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,163
and to do me the good.

201
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,896
Oh, baby, baby!

202
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,957
Ops will see more

203
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:15,862
and to dance as prostitute.

204
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,524
It is that I don't have talent.

205
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:20,291
Ei, see what found!

206
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,452
They gave me in the sixth year.

207
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:24,657
Is he/she seeing?

208
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:26,793
It is my period!

209
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:29,053
Kaki is cleaning.

210
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:30,388
He/she is eating well.

211
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,754
And that is having here?

212
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,553
It is protected, nobody knows what happens
enter their feet.

213
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,550
When can I have sex?

214
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,447
When you...

215
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:42,747
He/she obtains his/her title.

216
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:43,878
No, we go, really!

217
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,180
When it goes for the University to the 18.

218
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:47,979
Mom, to the 15!

219
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:49,209
In way none!

220
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:51,681
Maybe to the 17.

221
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,180
Mom, 15 are the new ones 17.

222
00:12:54,215 --> 00:13:01,509
The adolescents should see this with yours
parents.

223
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,870
Brilliant, call his/her mother!

224
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:12,505
That!

225
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:17,300
This sound is leaving me crazy!

226
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,391
Mom, I should play to have something in common.

227
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,365
He/she seems as a good relationship.

228
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,888
Now go home!

229
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:27,795
I have to sleep here.

230
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:30,330
My father was today the some prizes.

231
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:33,454
Only make something in silence, to finish mine
task.

232
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:45,049
How devils only obtained two points?

233
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,920
From now on, anything of problems.

234
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,114
No clubs, no adolescent pregnancy.

235
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,882
Anything of homosexuals.

236
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:53,114
What does have if he dances with the promotion?

237
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,981
Anything of homosexuals.

238
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,712
Maybe a lesbian kiss.

239
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,681
However, without nutritious disorders.

240
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,773
Anything of problems racists.

241
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:06,474
We go, anything of shows yankis.

242
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,177
Did they never listen to her, not?

243
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:15,903
We always used her/it in the 80.

244
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,872
Ok, removed the dance, when the boy kisses
the other.

245
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:23,339
No, that was only a badly itinerary.

246
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:24,270
The reconstructions are big.

247
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,998
The reconstructions are in the fashion.

248
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:29,934
They want them if they make them, we want
also.

249
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,298
Everything is said on that.

250
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:34,459
He/she can make him/it.

251
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,864
Let us make this show well.

252
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,455
And the part, I want that incorporates this in the
show.

253
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,859
He/she knows that cannot supply the show of cellular.

254
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:51,952
They are new, the boys sent more
messages than...

255
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,754
He/she seems very clear that yes.

256
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:58,883
Oh, and put that thing of I and it is like this how they say
then.

257
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:05,417
I never saw so many men in only one place.

258
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,974
It is for it that you/they wrote last.

259
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:15,774
Maybe what gave me did me badly and clear

260
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:20,269
My head is not prepared for the baths.

261
00:15:20,813 --> 00:15:22,711
Worse than one day

262
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,767
I will be like this.

263
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:32,404
And I hurt.

264
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:37,097
And my head is not ready for the baths of the
third floor.

265
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:40,363
Thank you very much, it was brilliant.

266
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,132
I don't see none!

267
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,429
And that there is of this boy Shan?

268
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,795
Maybe if we call him/it again...

269
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,128
Let to try me a thing.

270
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:52,459
He is Adan.

271
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,021
No, wait, feel one second.

272
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:56,992
How did he/she make that?

273
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,521
I hope are proud of you.

274
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:09,815
I hope you/they have a real feeling of
success.

275
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,287
Because one day they know, no longer I will be in the
school.

276
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,185
And in a close future.

277
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:18,277
However one day they will open the newspaper or they will attend
the tv

278
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,783
and they will see me

279
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:24,344
or the some other magician

280
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,507
that he/she makes something spectacular.

281
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:31,178
And they will remember that you/they treated him badly.

282
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:33,202
Drian, would like to be so good
like you, boy.

283
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:35,573
Because now ríem.

284
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,504
Because they say that we have something that us
contaminate.

285
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:42,406
Ok, have of that now in my pants.

286
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:46,597
However you have something very worser

287
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:48,598
in their souls.

288
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:50,900
It is what want.

289
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:52,966
Was I well?

290
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:55,524
Thank you very much. He/she was brilliant.

291
00:16:56,135 --> 00:16:57,101
He/she was brilliant, thank you very much.

292
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,532
Very well, thank you.

293
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:07,487
It is something good.

294
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,686
Not even he/she thinks him.

295
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:31,517
Ready? Yes!

296
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,415
What Dilan does the one know did yesterday?

297
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:39,779
It used his/her mug of milk in his/her mouth and the
he/she bounced for yours.

298
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,878
Actually I underestimated them.

299
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,510
I will do better.

300
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:46,341
In mathematics the one what is pi?

301
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,000
3.

302
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,033
3.14. Last night he/she knew him/it.

303
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,633
Ok, see each other.

304
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,700
3.14, don't forget.

305
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:10,132
I take out, because I think that was very sexy, already
he/she waited for him.

306
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,589
Yes, is it that?

307
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,991
Of the money what is there?

308
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:16,392
I call in a little while.

309
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,753
Is Rosie?

310
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,194
He/she is changing his/her hair.

311
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:22,227
He/she told me that collected my schedule.

312
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:23,383
Wait!

313
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,086
It is that there, direct in the eye.

314
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,414
The larger boys write down without that.

315
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:53,907
We already lost the lunch.

316
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,411
And it continues with that.

317
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,637
I feel, but no longer I kiss his/her trazeiro never
plus.

318
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:02,642
In English he/she would say, no longer I carry their things.

319
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,004
We go, she has a perfect body.

320
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:08,532
With those thighs!

321
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,595
When it was the last time that obtained one
magazine?

322
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:13,433
Lindasy, Paris, the girls of TV.

323
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:14,527
It is what I say.

324
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,297
Tired, it is what say.

325
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,690
We go, he/she has to have attitude!

326
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,622
No, I don't want him to get dressed as the other ones
boys.

327
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,129
He/she has to dress something to whitewash him/her well.

328
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:33,194
A shirt that enhances the green of their eyes and...

329
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,589
Maintain the jacket for if maybe...

330
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,180
That light it doesn't seat.

331
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,077
That their emphasis eyes!

332
00:20:01,216 --> 00:20:03,374
It is not what seek.

333
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:21,864
Oh, by God!

334
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,098
Oh, I am beautiful!

335
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:25,769
I am beautiful!

336
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,561
Actually I am very well.

337
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,760
It is not for so much.

338
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:36,160
We go, I never saw myself with un good look.

339
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,560
Why not?

340
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:41,754
Because they never saw me beautiful, I make to laugh them
to call his/her attention.

341
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,184
Wait one second!

342
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:47,483
It uses the comedy to hide their feelings.

343
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:49,885
I believe that he/she has something here.

344
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:54,079
Wait one minute!

345
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,719
What?

346
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,783
You are very beautiful!

347
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:08,715
What did the one find?

348
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:12,971
Not even he/she needs to arrest the hair!

349
00:21:13,715 --> 00:21:14,772
How does it get that look?

350
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:16,007
Hurried!

351
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,577
I cannot make miracles!

352
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,008
Excuse.

353
00:21:25,676 --> 00:21:28,106
He is Adam yes, hello!

354
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:29,038
Hello!

355
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,165
I see you soon.

356
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:32,602
Ok.

357
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,360
I know that you/they said things on me.

358
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,262
I cannot get up to 7:00 a.m for the
make-up,

359
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,561
to do exercise.

360
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:47,793
Therefore when arresting my lines

361
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:48,593
and to shine at 16 o'clock.

362
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:50,491
I cannot make him/it.

363
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:51,689
He/she is well.

364
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:53,196
All want something of me.

365
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,956
There is much more than can offer.

366
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:58,789
I promise him/her that we will make something more

367
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:01,683
so that it can be better.

368
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:02,383
Thank you.

369
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,287
It is that when I am tired

370
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,313
I don't make my best work.

371
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,582
Nobody wants that.

372
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:10,877
He/she is only tired. Yes.

373
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,605
Fortune-teller? What?

374
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,075
The life is good.

375
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,475
I know what wants to say.

376
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,102
Do I pose to eat these?

377
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,645
They are delicious magicamente.

378
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,268
Tecnicamnte is not magic.

379
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:35,200
It is sugar.

380
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:37,898
What does the one know happened today?

381
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:41,906
My friend and I invited Zack and Dilan to the
movies on Wednesday.

382
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:44,461
We asked the zack wants to go and he/she said ok.

383
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:46,267
And Zack said, I will be with Melanie.

384
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:47,498
And Dilan with Izi.

385
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:49,298
And what Dilan does the one know said? What?

386
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,364
He/she said, I suppose.

387
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,698
Serious?

388
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:56,294
He/she still has shampoo.

389
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,160
However this is soft.

390
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:01,187
And I have to seem better.

391
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:06,223
I cannot believe that goes the an encounter in group

392
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:07,460
with the boy that you like.

393
00:23:07,496 --> 00:23:09,687
Don't worry mom, their parents will be there.

394
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:17,279
Ei, see how I was!

395
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,414
And that finds of this itinerary?

396
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:24,582
Yes, it would be better.

397
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:26,512
Take one.

398
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,879
Did Quiem put this ketchup there?

399
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:35,979
Action!

400
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:47,638
I need to know that will do for the festival of
talents.

401
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:51,901
You like.

402
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:53,732
That he/she is speaking?

403
00:23:54,606 --> 00:23:57,400
What does make he/she?

404
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,196
Something of surprise?

405
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,396
I already read my lines.

406
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:02,626
It is exactly the same.

407
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:05,990
I won't make this of all the forms.

408
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:13,757
I know that doesn't fall him/her well.

409
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,285
He/she seems shit!

410
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,090
However this boy could be next Ben
Stiller.

411
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:20,926
It is never known.

412
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:24,982
And it could be good for you to have
a good relationship.

413
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,587
Ok, return.

414
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:35,981
Thank you.

415
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,508
Moni said that we will work to the 8.

416
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:40,074
Probably yes, until that he/she leaves.

417
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:42,945
His/her husband allows to work him/her
until so late?

418
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:43,950
I AM NOT MARRIED!

419
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:44,847
And his/her boyfriend?

420
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,506
I don't have.

421
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:50,239
Will there be a musical one for the show, not?

422
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:52,972
He/she will be in the supervision yes.

423
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,636
He/she looks, there is a boy among my companions of
room that

424
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:59,733
he/she plays in a band, and equal will tell him/her.

425
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:01,465
Maybe you can.

426
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:03,497
Do let to wonder a thing? Clear!

427
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,172
Most of the students in this show

428
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,193
he/she has wives, children...

429
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:11,703
Ok, are not exactly adolescents.

430
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,235
And you got the work.

431
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:16,392
However how many years he/she has

432
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:17,825
in the reality?

433
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:19,396
In the reality?

434
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,194
Well, 32.

435
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:22,887
For qué? How old are you?

436
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:26,928
He/she is super!

437
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:29,318
Then, what says?

438
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:32,751
Ok.

439
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:33,725
On Friday?

440
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:34,452
He/she is well.

441
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:37,617
We will make something to kill the diet.

442
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:40,384
Something type Lindsay or Hillary.

443
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,150
I don't know. It is something like that.

444
00:25:46,222 --> 00:25:47,209
He/she seems beautiful.

445
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,048
We will meet in the palm trees.

446
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:50,882
Oh yes!

447
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,179
You know where it is that.

448
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,513
However I can catch him/her.

449
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,243
Brilliant.

450
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,043
Ok, about the 9?

451
00:25:58,115 --> 00:25:59,273
Well, ok.

452
00:25:59,315 --> 00:26:00,610
See through where goes.

453
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:02,440
He/she is well.

454
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,402
Oh for God, as he/she should love this!

455
00:26:06,045 --> 00:26:07,806
We see each other.

456
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,369
Ok, is a little younger.

457
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,204
Estaría well if I went a man.

458
00:26:12,908 --> 00:26:15,567
Because he/she doesn't notice in the intelligent things,

459
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:16,903
instead of the brutes?

460
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:26,098
What did talk him/her about jumping in this?

461
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:29,064
Only in the kati house.

462
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:30,293
He/she is well.

463
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,593
Speak to me about the school.

464
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,689
Moli had an idea today.

465
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:37,254
Since she goes out with the best friend
of Dylan

466
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:38,956
and he/she will tell him/her that he/she speaks to Dylan that I like him.

467
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:39,654
And to know that said.

468
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:41,389
No, don't allow him to know that likes him.

469
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,189
Act as if it didn't exist.

470
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:45,716
Seem busy the whole time.

471
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:48,623
He/she has to act as if he/she didn't care.

472
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:52,620
Hello?

473
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:56,415
It is happy with his/her service of long
distance?

474
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,151
I am learning a lot on acting
normal.

475
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:21,576
What such? I like.

476
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,938
However see that happens when I make this.

477
00:27:24,942 --> 00:27:26,202
Don't make that!

478
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:31,596
Oh it goes!

479
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:32,797
He/she already comes.

480
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:33,929
Is it brilliant, not?

481
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:36,133
Can he/she give me his/her shelter?

482
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:37,998
Oh thank you!

483
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:39,758
Who is?

484
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:42,699
He/she is a prisoner.

485
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:43,965
Very functional.

486
00:27:53,262 --> 00:27:56,421
Ei, his/her mother uses the same medicine.

487
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,323
He/she seems as a great relationship.

488
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,650
I am in the middle of a dance game, if
he/she wants to go...

489
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:04,747
Ei, knows the secret to arrive to the
following level?

490
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:06,844
Is there a secret?

491
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:07,945
Can it become trained?

492
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,612
He/she is well.

493
00:28:23,814 --> 00:28:26,779
Izzi, please, lowers that!

494
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:30,300
I cannot ponder with that stupid music.

495
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:31,640
Mom, see how I moved forward!

496
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,335
Devils!

497
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:37,738
Thank you.

498
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,523
Is he/she with cold?

499
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,089
No, I am well.

500
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:54,724
Take!

501
00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,624
Feel his/her identification.

502
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:21,747
He/she will be the largest there inside.

503
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,877
I can handle him/it.

504
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,145
It is not better to return to the house
and to do something calm?

505
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:32,907
Ok, you are ridiculous.

506
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,904
He/she seems that the old wants to call the attention.

507
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:48,599
What does make that lady?

508
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:51,669
Something of drinking?

509
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,467
Ok.

510
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:53,835
I will look for a beer. Does some want thing?

511
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:54,893
No, thank you.

512
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:03,428
It seems that he/she needs a drag.

513
00:30:04,234 --> 00:30:05,494
Serious?

514
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,126
Let to guess me. A martini, not?

515
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,788
I feel, I cannot listen to him/it.

516
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,219
What such?

517
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:24,386
Does he/she want to dance?

518
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:26,913
I don't know who is you.

519
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:30,382
I will try, but he/she doesn't make to stop her.

520
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:48,210
He/she is crazy!

521
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:49,547
It is Friday night!

522
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:50,947
I have to do him/it.

523
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,409
Thank you for this.

524
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:01,506
I believe that was everything.

525
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:03,801
I will be good.

526
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:06,635
I want him to listen a thing.

527
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,867
Greenday!

528
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:09,205
They lent me.

529
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:11,206
Ricky Martin?

530
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:14,297
It is not mine.

531
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:19,403
Actually I don't have 37.

532
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,196
What age does he/she have?

533
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:24,599
Actually I have 31.

534
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:25,790
Ok.

535
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,396
I need my keys.

536
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:40,852
He/she is well.

537
00:32:40,894 --> 00:32:41,689
I am well, I already have them.

538
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,515
I need my wallet.

539
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,412
What is making he/she?

540
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,211
It is the form of finding him/it.

541
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:22,903
What do happen with that de30?

542
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:25,097
He/she wanted to say 39. I thought that he/she had something as 30.

543
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:26,399
Either you.

544
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,795
Because he/she knows what say: Never trust in
nobody with more than 30.

545
00:33:33,902 --> 00:33:34,925
Then it can trust me.

546
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:49,351
Ei, you are super.

547
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:50,053
Thank you.

548
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,050
What has been making he/she?

549
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:53,322
Anything.

550
00:33:54,727 --> 00:33:55,522
Yes, clear!

551
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:03,920
See, he/she obtained his/her money of turn.
He/she worked well.

552
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,212
See the tests.

553
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:08,114
Boys give him/her 30.

554
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,706
In girls, 22%.

555
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,278
We saw the same numbers when Scritch
he/she left in the...

556
00:34:15,317 --> 00:34:18,281
Those were the safe number for the
campaign.

557
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,303
It is like this, see the new boy.

558
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:21,973
Ei, taste of these numbers.

559
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:24,138
The rest of the writers approves him/it.

560
00:34:24,212 --> 00:34:25,405
Why does want to continue with him?

561
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:26,741
Because he is amusing,

562
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:27,834
it is nice

563
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:28,604
and it can act.

564
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:30,006
The girls will love him.

565
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:35,001
I don't need more words.

566
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,897
I believe that this boy should continue.

567
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:41,902
Ok, but we lowered a point and he/she leaves.

568
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:43,026
He/she won't pass.

569
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:43,661
I promise!

570
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:51,392
Ei, cut her!

571
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:52,797
She is a girl!

572
00:34:52,832 --> 00:34:55,161
It insulted me and he/she will do again.

573
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:57,021
Why was all this?

574
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,822
He/she said that my mother makes a show of three points.

575
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:05,693
Ei, didn't listen that Brad Pit

576
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,850
he/she dismissed his/her father.

577
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:13,548
They already gorged and they leave.

578
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:16,017
And they will go well.

579
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:17,680
Oh, what is happening?

580
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:23,151
They are without clothes, in the pure skin. We have that
to dress them.

581
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:25,248
That is depressing!

582
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:29,306
What did happen in the films?

583
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:31,740
Did Dilan put his/her arm in turn of you?

584
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:33,711
No.

585
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:38,142
Did they join their arms when they were close?

586
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,574
First I put him/it in him.

587
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,439
And I put his/her hand with mine.

588
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:44,338
And he removed her.

589
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,340
And if it put like this.

590
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,168
He/she is not ready for relationships.

591
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:49,162
He/she had bride last year.

592
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:50,570
Then he/she doesn't have good taste.

593
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:52,661
Mom, I love him!

594
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:54,566
Ok, feel a lot.

595
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,565
Is it safe what wants to undo of them?

596
00:35:57,635 --> 00:35:58,396
Yes!

597
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:01,332
It is so sad when it finishes the season.

598
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,454
Everything leaves.

599
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,364
Does he/she want to play a last one?

600
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:07,523
Mom, I am big for Barbie!

601
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,223
Yes, but me not.

602
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:14,224
Ok, will be the last episode.

603
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:16,451
Let us see.

604
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:18,149
Is he/she without admission or the one what?

605
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,088
He/she wants Adam to leave.

606
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,090
I am not badly.

607
00:36:22,124 --> 00:36:22,987
I am redrafting.

608
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:23,819
This is good.

609
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:25,250
Encounters.

610
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:27,481
And not to act as idiot.

611
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:29,748
I consulted and it means penises.

612
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,012
If he/she allows to tell us penises.

613
00:36:31,053 --> 00:36:32,484
Yes, they can see penises, but...

614
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,007
This ó the bad penises.

615
00:36:34,618 --> 00:36:35,447
As violation.

616
00:36:35,518 --> 00:36:38,312
And that is exactly the good penises?

617
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:39,705
See him/it!

618
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:47,441
Why only tell ourselves, that is well.

619
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,774
It is an interrogation type.

620
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:50,867
However all understand him/it.

621
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,340
Ok all, hour of eating lunch.

622
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:57,930
They go and don't throw me this.

623
00:37:01,072 --> 00:37:01,561
I see him/it.

624
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,764
He/she is an actor.

625
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:15,122
Ei, retreat young lady bulimia.

626
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:19,730
Hello Scritch!

627
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:22,854
He/she knows, I believe that should take care.

628
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:23,826
Why?

629
00:37:23,862 --> 00:37:25,054
They speak that is very white.

630
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:26,951
Me?

631
00:37:28,926 --> 00:37:29,619
I caught you!

632
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:33,122
However with Rhiana it only falls him/her well the pesssoas that
say

633
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:35,321
the as she is beautiful.

634
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:39,244
Rose wants actually that
feel well with her.

635
00:37:39,954 --> 00:37:40,942
Is it it what wants, not?

636
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:42,747
He/she cannot tell him/her. Go and he/she catches Rhiana.

637
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:45,741
Unless he/she has something sexual in that.

638
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:57,837
Ei, should not smoke that thing.

639
00:37:58,346 --> 00:37:59,243
It is not marijuana.

640
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,869
It is Shiton, oh it goes!

641
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,359
Oh, as it got that work?

642
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:20,923
What is that?

643
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:25,829
In case they feel well, both can be better.

644
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:29,760
I like the quality of the volume.

645
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:31,160
He/she seems that Adam likes.

646
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:32,355
This is not well.

647
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,458
I am fed up with reading on Misha.

648
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:37,653
Mindsay and Katy.

649
00:38:37,727 --> 00:38:39,716
Now all have better papers.

650
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,950
Therefore, all will be there.

651
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:43,922
And that kills me.

652
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:46,253
I went a young girl a lot before them.

653
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,652
They are seeking him/her for the scene of the beach.

654
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:51,154
I will put my biquine.

655
00:38:56,352 --> 00:38:58,681
He/she already told him/her that you have
a body of a girl of 29?

656
00:38:59,351 --> 00:38:59,941
Serious?

657
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,040
It is besides has that big one...

658
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:03,877
I have to go.

659
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,641
I cannot let to go her.

660
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:07,544
However he/she should make him/it.

661
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:09,339
However I cannot make him/it

662
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:11,509
But he/she has to go.

663
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:12,805
However I cannot leave him/her.

664
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:13,832
However, he/she should make him/it.

665
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:16,434
His/her work is larger than we.

666
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,873
After all those episodes that there is
produced.

667
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:19,930
I have to go.

668
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:21,667
We will go to the movies later.

669
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,568
Should he/she move actually?

670
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,229
My car is not still ready.

671
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:25,930
He/she takes mine.

672
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:30,258
I will bring him/it before he/she leaves.

673
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:34,930
We are going girl!

674
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:42,160
You are auspicious. He/she goes out with a boy.

675
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:44,458
It causes many problems for you.

676
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:47,824
It is an accelerated thing.

677
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:52,921
Can I help them?

678
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,455
We looked to scenery.

679
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:58,051
Ok, is something new at this time.

680
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:00,449
Ok.

681
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,251
He/she walks and averigüa that seek.

682
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,875
Y is same to C and C equal to V.

683
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:17,178
I had my first writer work

684
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:18,611
and he was born.

685
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:20,504
Oh, by God!

686
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:24,736
In 1977, they made this show,

687
00:40:24,811 --> 00:40:28,333
dark Amdona appeared.

688
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,431
However now it is the new.

689
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:36,597
He/she thought that I was born with the old age.

690
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,396
As he/she does that a positive number

691
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:43,226
do turn negative?

692
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:45,660
It removes him/her the positive remaining him/her

693
00:40:45,967 --> 00:40:47,557
larger numbers.

694
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,017
This won't work.

695
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,887
Yes, because it is a maxim.

696
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,448
No, I want to say this.

697
00:41:07,824 --> 00:41:10,312
You and me.

698
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:11,910
Why? What did I make?

699
00:41:12,655 --> 00:41:13,950
No, anything.

700
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:16,949
You are wonderful.

701
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,416
Did we pass the sixth well?

702
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:22,110
Yes, Friday was brilliant.

703
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:23,705
Then the one what?

704
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,239
He/she remembers when we spoke on that he/she had him/it...

705
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:31,302
I don't stop thinking in as...

706
00:41:31,347 --> 00:41:33,312
Young.

707
00:41:33,912 --> 00:41:34,502
Quite so.

708
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:36,937
I plan to be old.

709
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,734
Well, I don't plan to be young.

710
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,002
That is yours.

711
00:41:44,874 --> 00:41:52,962
What does think he/she am a dizzy boy, not?

712
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:53,661
No.

713
00:41:54,336 --> 00:41:55,233
Of course no!

714
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:58,025
You are what is. Young.

715
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,259
Youth is superior to be old.

716
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:01,423
And that?

717
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:02,931
And everything.

718
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,156
Oh yes?

719
00:42:04,664 --> 00:42:07,822
And who is like this?

720
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:10,859
That is a fear example.

721
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,416
He/she knows that in our society,

722
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,619
youth is better than old age.

723
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:17,285
To be high is better than lower.

724
00:42:17,325 --> 00:42:19,154
Beautiful it is better than smart.

725
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:22,216
I only want...

726
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:24,319
If we commit ourselves,

727
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:29,408
somebody will result wounded and

728
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:32,109
Because I am older

729
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:35,007
I have to be the responsible.

730
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,745
However we can be friends.

731
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,074
Can we be friends, not?

732
00:42:52,142 --> 00:42:54,334
Yes, he/she knows that will be here for you.

733
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,435
He/she doesn't have sense of humor.

734
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:00,935
Ok, now this!

735
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:08,391
Hello!

736
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:09,865
Hello!

737
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:13,530
An is not little low, hey?

738
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:15,419
Hello!

739
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:22,424
He/she is so punished!

740
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:23,926
Oh for God!

741
00:43:24,626 --> 00:43:25,421
I already arrived.

742
00:43:27,826 --> 00:43:28,916
What are making?

743
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:29,719
Anything.

744
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:31,722
How did it arrive so early?

745
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:32,981
Where is Adam?

746
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:34,954
We decided not to leave more.

747
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:36,248
Why, liked him.

748
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:38,784
I tried to be ripens.

749
00:43:38,821 --> 00:43:40,513
It is not his/her style.

750
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,514
I know.

751
00:43:42,552 --> 00:43:44,483
Why does still have encounters?

752
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,346
Be not stupid!

753
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,438
The oldest people don't have encounters.

754
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:50,038
Good night.

755
00:43:53,447 --> 00:43:54,878
I told the truth.

756
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:02,631
Where is Rosie?

757
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,834
He/she is with academical.

758
00:44:04,874 --> 00:44:05,737
What hour does the one return?

759
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:06,671
I don't know.

760
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:08,865
He/she had to seem well.

761
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,302
He/she told me that he/she caught Glo of his/her office

762
00:44:12,338 --> 00:44:13,167
However no havía nobody there.

763
00:44:13,638 --> 00:44:17,863
That allowed to remove me this
when there was not anybody.

764
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:19,958
And you come everyday.

765
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:20,931
It is so hard.

766
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:22,125
It is for you.

767
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,461
He/she decided to give him/her this.

768
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:25,798
What is?

769
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,160
It is what obtains sleeping
with the producer.

770
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:31,293
Did she write?

771
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,057
Yes.

772
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,321
He/she has three more episodes.

773
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:36,793
It seems that will continue a time.

774
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:39,223
Maybe we can go for a coffee.

775
00:44:41,824 --> 00:44:43,846
And which his/her opinion? Can we use this in the show?

776
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:44,979
No.

777
00:44:45,056 --> 00:44:46,885
He/she thinks about these cellular ones.

778
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:50,644
Hello.

779
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:53,149
I see that he/she already has the new episodes.

780
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:54,048
Yes.

781
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:55,839
And?

782
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:56,872
I have good news.

783
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:57,917
Serious?

784
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:59,848
After doing a lot of investigation,

785
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:03,572
I will give him/her other opportunity.

786
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:08,138
That is a sample.

787
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:10,037
I believe that is good for the show.

788
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:12,007
It is what you think.

789
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,508
However his/her subconciente is finding
ways of

790
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:15,064
to stay to my side.

791
00:45:15,142 --> 00:45:19,334
Surprisingly they want him/her here.

792
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:21,133
This is not anything!

793
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:22,331
However I need that says him/it.

794
00:45:22,939 --> 00:45:24,927
I don't believe that Michi sees go-girls.

795
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:27,932
Maybe yes.

796
00:46:56,061 --> 00:46:57,253
I believe that likes a lot.

797
00:46:57,294 --> 00:46:58,759
Why does that find?

798
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:01,383
Because he/she gave him/her a musical cd.

799
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:04,821
His/her voice saying what speaks his/her heart.

800
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:06,947
That is not a good lesson.

801
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:09,253
Only listen to him/it.

802
00:47:30,778 --> 00:47:31,436
Where is his/her car?

803
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:34,574
Oh, I sold him/it. I am in the bankruptcy.

804
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:37,432
He/she knows that

805
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:40,338
he/she wanted to see him/her.

806
00:47:40,374 --> 00:47:41,634
Thank you.

807
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:43,663
Ei, are here.

808
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,192
Do see?

809
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:50,564
He/she seems younger.

810
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:51,660
I know.

811
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:53,165
I don't see in that way.

812
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:55,632
Actually it seems his/her nephew.

813
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:56,962
Nephew? He/she is wanting brother to say.

814
00:47:57,566 --> 00:47:58,190
How many years he/she has?

815
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:00,494
And do how many think I have?

816
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:02,363
49?

817
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:03,793
Yes.

818
00:48:03,864 --> 00:48:05,295
However do I seem to have how many?

819
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:07,150
Well, he/she would say...

820
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:09,160
Give 32 or he/she will never stop.

821
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:13,256
Thank you.

822
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,455
I operated the eyes.

823
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:27,211
No, this is not allowed.

824
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:28,842
And go down then!

825
00:48:32,649 --> 00:48:34,638
After this whole time,

826
00:48:34,682 --> 00:48:37,442
Y and Zack came.

827
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,809
As soon as don't stop them.

828
00:48:38,847 --> 00:48:40,040
Did he/she make you to laugh?

829
00:48:40,646 --> 00:48:41,111
I have faith that yes.

830
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:42,009
Is it brilliant, not?

831
00:48:42,046 --> 00:48:43,908
Did Rhiana already arrive? Not yet.

832
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:45,505
However does it come?

833
00:48:45,577 --> 00:48:46,634
Probably.

834
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:47,574
Let us go!

835
00:48:50,008 --> 00:48:52,472
Men!

836
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:57,661
Continuing, go-girls comes.

837
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:05,992
Silence all, my part comes.

838
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,557
Can I remove an extra mechanical pencil?

839
00:49:09,266 --> 00:49:15,196
Cwow, see that skate board!

840
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:17,355
I am me that swallow them.

841
00:49:37,553 --> 00:49:38,348
Nathan!

842
00:49:39,752 --> 00:49:40,342
Leave that!

843
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:48,751
Well done!

844
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:49,942
Thank you.

845
00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:50,883
Good I work there.

846
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:53,581
Serious?

847
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:54,344
And you?

848
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,445
I see you soon.

849
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:00,172
I thought that would go my house.

850
00:51:00,248 --> 00:51:01,577
I already have a, thank you.

851
00:51:01,647 --> 00:51:02,577
Excuse me one second.

852
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:06,435
Stupid!

853
00:51:08,577 --> 00:51:11,235
And that seeks now?

854
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:15,029
I am writing a reality on mine
life.

855
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,970
On that.

856
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,266
How reality can be if you write him/it?

857
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:23,630
You are adorable. Good show and good night.

858
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:25,759
Thank you, Rosie.

859
00:51:25,835 --> 00:51:26,823
Thank you for having come.

860
00:51:28,135 --> 00:51:29,929
Brena, excellent episode.

861
00:51:30,566 --> 00:51:32,031
Am I concerned for qué?

862
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:35,553
I believe that that humor has a great writer.

863
00:51:36,864 --> 00:51:37,659
Think about that.

864
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:40,828
Pleasure in knowing him/her.

865
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:42,951
Big!

866
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:44,182
He/she is Joe.

867
00:51:44,694 --> 00:51:45,954
Now,

868
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:47,651
remove this.

869
00:51:48,258 --> 00:51:48,883
I feel nude.

870
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:51,446
He/she shows some skin alí inside.

871
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:53,887
Not to me, show to him.

872
00:51:54,555 --> 00:51:55,077
Good luck.

873
00:51:58,187 --> 00:52:00,084
He/she takes mom.

874
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,281
I didn't feel bill.

875
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:09,747
Did Jena already leave?

876
00:52:09,782 --> 00:52:10,645
All already left.

877
00:52:11,848 --> 00:52:15,040
He/she has one "that" of my grandmother's house.

878
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:20,739
Does he/she want berber some thing?

879
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:23,431
Ok.

880
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:31,861
It is strange, in one moment it is trying
to lose weight

881
00:52:31,938 --> 00:52:34,835
and later,

882
00:52:36,536 --> 00:52:37,432
very heavy things.

883
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:45,227
He/she seems that Izi is busy.

884
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,093
He/she is not here. He/she went to see his/her father.

885
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:49,060
And when does it return?

886
00:52:50,063 --> 00:52:50,993
On Sunday.

887
00:52:52,361 --> 00:52:53,156
Then we are alone.

888
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,447
Only you and me.

889
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:03,489
It seems that is trying to seduce me.

890
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,953
Would it like that seduced him/her?

891
00:53:06,456 --> 00:53:07,046
Yes.

892
00:53:24,547 --> 00:53:25,842
I felt his/her lack.

893
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:27,541
And me her yours.

894
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:28,279
Don't answer. He/she is my mother.

895
00:54:28,984 --> 00:54:29,677
I feel... hello mom.

896
00:54:31,882 --> 00:54:32,439
Can I tie him/her in a little while?

897
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:06,761
Oh shit, I left my condones in the car.

898
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:08,160
Wait here.

899
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:16,059
He/she seems that the boy doesn't want to make pregnant him/her.

900
00:55:16,662 --> 00:55:17,524
And?

901
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,253
When it arrives the time,

902
00:55:19,293 --> 00:55:22,780
he/she cannot have
those children.

903
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:24,653
He/she would love to have a baby.

904
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:26,383
He/she is only using you.

905
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,853
That is not true.

906
00:55:28,455 --> 00:55:29,943
He/she already has the work.

907
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:31,849
He/she opens, I forgot my keys.

908
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:35,179
It would lose his/her head if it was not arrested.

909
00:55:51,511 --> 00:55:53,374
Give this to Adam.

910
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:54,499
What is?

911
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:58,473
It was collected by an extra. I feel a lot.

912
00:55:58,508 --> 00:55:59,269
Ok, calm.

913
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:24,125
Ok, have an evaluation of 22.

914
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,185
However on Thursday we had twice more.

915
00:56:26,662 --> 00:56:28,854
Yes, but he/she has to look the balance.

916
00:56:28,894 --> 00:56:30,916
He/she sees, still knowing

917
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,754
that the numbers seem high,

918
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,485
we should go up some.

919
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,814
Does he/she understand that should see now?

920
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:38,845
Yes, all understood.

921
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:41,418
He/she forgot of that.

922
00:56:42,721 --> 00:56:43,914
Independent of we go up the points,

923
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,112
we should be happy for that.

924
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:47,575
What is the one what more loves in me?

925
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:50,577
He/she never said that he/she loved her.

926
00:56:51,184 --> 00:56:52,115
Let us go!

927
00:56:53,616 --> 00:56:54,979
He/she never said.

928
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:56,478
First...

929
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,308
Oh, by God!

930
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,640
Didn't he/she leave in go-giris this week?

931
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:01,974
He/she was so amusing.

932
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,471
That of hiding was so amusing.

933
00:57:06,509 --> 00:57:07,066
Thank you.

934
00:57:07,676 --> 00:57:09,300
I want to say, I hardly ever see him/it.

935
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,772
Because he/she upsets me.

936
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:11,796
He/she didn't know about that.

937
00:57:12,574 --> 00:57:14,902
However that episode was the best in months.

938
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,598
Does he/she have card?

939
00:57:16,672 --> 00:57:17,466
Can I give him/her this?

940
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:18,861
Yes, clear!

941
00:57:20,903 --> 00:57:21,766
She is well.

942
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:25,565
Does he/she know Martin Green? The one of the comedy?

943
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:26,692
Yes, I know who is.

944
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:28,664
He/she wants that goes with him in the Friday night

945
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:30,595
to his/her show.

946
00:57:31,065 --> 00:57:31,463
I don't know...

947
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:34,658
It was so brilliant to know him/it.

948
00:57:35,396 --> 00:57:37,293
I hope he/she doesn't think badly of me.

949
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:38,850
However it would enchant me to give him/her my picture.

950
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,490
He/she also has my number.

951
00:57:41,993 --> 00:57:45,220
I had some small papers.

952
00:57:46,391 --> 00:57:48,117
Maybe it can take him/it with us of the go-girls.

953
00:57:51,022 --> 00:57:52,715
Maybe not.

954
00:57:54,088 --> 00:57:54,984
Thank you.

955
00:57:58,586 --> 00:58:01,982
Now he/she will see what can obtain with his/her fame.

956
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:03,879
He/she is not interested.

957
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:06,373
Let to show him/her to me a thing.

958
00:58:09,814 --> 00:58:12,404
His/her note great curve here.

959
00:58:12,479 --> 00:58:13,739
It is not his/her type.

960
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:16,868
This is the style of all wants if he/she gives bill or not.

961
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:18,501
This point

962
00:58:18,577 --> 00:58:20,269
He/she gives him/her more something.

963
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:23,103
Without mentioning his/her hair and his/her face.

964
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:24,733
She can die from hunger.

965
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:28,931
She can disappear here, but he sees the
signs.

966
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:30,766
He/she sees the signs that his/her body is eliminating.

967
00:58:30,804 --> 00:58:32,462
Without importing him/it as it preserves him/it.

968
00:58:33,069 --> 00:58:35,159
That is for animals, not for us.

969
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:37,158
He/she doesn't have medicine.

970
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:39,094
Is a good thing?

971
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,731
The coffee came fast.

972
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:49,925
It is had 10 dollars, as it would be yours
porcentajem?

973
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:52,084
I don't know not even as he/she treats him.

974
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:57,422
Sr. Mir said that won't get him/it in the way
correct.

975
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,354
I hate the mathematics.

976
00:58:58,391 --> 00:59:00,084
It is eaten three cookies

977
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,678
and 50 lost calories

978
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:04,085
and he/she has 140 calories,

979
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:05,775
in each cookie how much is there?

980
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:09,713
And why do make him/it so difficult?

981
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:12,873
Adam called. Creo that will come.

982
00:59:12,918 --> 00:59:15,576
I believe that he/she forgot.

983
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:18,976
His/her telephone!

984
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,407
That hot!

985
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,968
It is the new go-girl poster.

986
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:28,075
No, and Briana in the room.

987
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,166
With somebody.

988
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:32,570
I won't leave that is upset.

989
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:34,369
Somebody sent her.

990
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,305
If somebody had sent her,

991
00:59:36,374 --> 00:59:39,304
he/she would not be in a place of messages.

992
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:41,564
Because he/she has to be there when does he/she arrest him?

993
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:43,957
Because Tivo knows that likes.

994
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,393
How will they know him/it what that does there?

995
00:59:47,902 --> 00:59:50,162
I won't reach conclusions. I will speak to him first.

996
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:51,757
Mami?

997
00:59:58,163 --> 01:00:02,059
It is a smile without expression.

998
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:03,185
Like her

999
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:05,158
in this house,

1000
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:08,451
after some long vacations

1001
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,850
My telephone!

1002
01:00:13,389 --> 01:00:14,150
I was seeking.

1003
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:18,581
When did they make this?

1004
01:00:19,187 --> 01:00:21,345
He/she is right, he/she doesn't deceive me.

1005
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:22,579
What did he/she/you tell him/her?

1006
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,947
He/she is not such good actor.

1007
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:29,943
Boys, can we continue?

1008
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,841
Boys, can we finish this?

1009
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,072
So that?

1010
01:00:36,645 --> 01:00:37,735
We can improve like this the show.

1011
01:00:39,943 --> 01:00:41,465
We gave some ideas.

1012
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:46,200
Nobody appreciates the band of it Draws and he knows.

1013
01:00:47,507 --> 01:00:48,938
Where are they?

1014
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:50,495
Mail.

1015
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:51,662
I have an encounter later.

1016
01:00:58,602 --> 01:01:01,066
Oh, see!

1017
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,154
It seems that you/they gave one of these pictures of the
show.

1018
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:13,353
Are Ei, you and Adam if sells?

1019
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:14,849
No.

1020
01:01:15,393 --> 01:01:16,256
Is it it what uses?

1021
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:17,258
Yes.

1022
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:20,155
Not even they are going as friends to places,

1023
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:21,383
or they leave.

1024
01:01:21,457 --> 01:01:22,752
Rosie,

1025
01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:23,847
is he/she safe?

1026
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:27,353
I am a lot of things but no liar.

1027
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,541
He/she takes one.

1028
01:01:35,684 --> 01:01:38,672
Never in mi life he/she would smoke.

1029
01:01:38,749 --> 01:01:40,976
Cut! Ok, see!

1030
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,006
He/she will see in one minute.

1031
01:01:47,278 --> 01:01:50,334
Sharon Stone?

1032
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:51,035
Busy.

1033
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:51,872
Alice Davis? Hung.

1034
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,000
River? Hung.

1035
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:54,264
Kim Basinger? Hung.

1036
01:01:54,676 --> 01:01:56,106
Emma Thompson? Broken hand.

1037
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:58,900
Susan Sarandon? He/she is super operated.

1038
01:01:58,973 --> 01:02:01,234
Meg Ryan? Too much plastic surgery.

1039
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:02,067
Naomi Griphit?

1040
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:03,797
A lot of plastic surgery.

1041
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:07,227
Cher?

1042
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:09,756
She is the queen of the surgeries.

1043
01:02:10,368 --> 01:02:12,798
Listen, small pervert.

1044
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:15,059
How does he/she dare to insult these women?

1045
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:18,063
How many oscar does he/she have?

1046
01:02:18,564 --> 01:02:21,290
Does he/she see her well on them or to Tom Hampson?

1047
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,758
Not even he/she would see himself well beside yours
trazeiros.

1048
01:02:25,295 --> 01:02:26,157
He/she will see her now.

1049
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,950
Ei, is brilliant.

1050
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,484
How is Izzi?

1051
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:35,048
He/she didn't call me to ask for my children.

1052
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:38,148
Ok, will be honest.

1053
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:41,245
After the transcriptions of the show

1054
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:43,048
and many presupostos,

1055
01:02:43,086 --> 01:02:44,073
to anybody it matters.

1056
01:02:44,685 --> 01:02:45,548
Two and Half Man?

1057
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:50,277
Nor all the ones that have children want to see them.

1058
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:51,338
We want to change.

1059
01:02:51,382 --> 01:02:53,075
That means, to include music.

1060
01:02:53,115 --> 01:02:55,205
He/she continues cutting our projects.

1061
01:02:55,281 --> 01:02:59,075
You face him/it. Go-giris is occupying
too much.

1062
01:02:59,578 --> 01:03:01,873
I was advised by some friends and...

1063
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,671
As soon as it substitutes me for a show reality.

1064
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:08,099
Actually we have a comedy to pass.

1065
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:11,664
Two writers wrote an itinerary

1066
01:03:11,906 --> 01:03:13,667
for a very amusing boy.

1067
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:14,863
Wait for him, you know him/it.

1068
01:03:15,404 --> 01:03:16,097
Adam Prole

1069
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:19,062
He/she calls himself Shizol.

1070
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:21,166
Shizol?

1071
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:22,858
Shizol.

1072
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:25,298
That means the new thing cool.

1073
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,763
No, it doesn't mean that.

1074
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,264
He/she means shit.

1075
01:03:28,365 --> 01:03:31,455
Anything and you cannot say
he/she substitutes with shit.

1076
01:03:31,997 --> 01:03:33,087
Does he/she like that?

1077
01:03:34,196 --> 01:03:35,854
Good luck. I hope he/she understands the name.

1078
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:37,190
Thank you for his/her support.

1079
01:03:42,892 --> 01:03:44,187
Rosie!

1080
01:03:44,224 --> 01:03:46,086
Hello!

1081
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:51,319
Happinesses in his/her show. It is very amusing.

1082
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:53,083
Thank you, and the other also.

1083
01:03:53,586 --> 01:03:54,710
Oh, if he/she spoke about his/her boy.

1084
01:03:54,786 --> 01:03:58,080
I believe that we gave him/her some calls

1085
01:03:58,117 --> 01:03:59,413
did he/she know?

1086
01:03:59,483 --> 01:04:01,471
Yes, and it doesn't import me.

1087
01:04:01,516 --> 01:04:03,981
Ero calls herself the executive. He doesn't have
sense of humor.

1088
01:04:04,015 --> 01:04:05,173
I feel so much, Ian.

1089
01:04:05,214 --> 01:04:07,145
No, it will happen again.

1090
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,804
I understand, but it is already in their 20.

1091
01:04:10,712 --> 01:04:11,609
Happinesses to you also.

1092
01:04:12,178 --> 01:04:13,802
He/she seems brilliant. Thank you.

1093
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,806
I cannot believe that you/they have made that.

1094
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:20,703
Did they think the one what?

1095
01:04:21,273 --> 01:04:22,068
Anything.

1096
01:04:22,106 --> 01:04:25,003
To who more they called?

1097
01:04:25,072 --> 01:04:25,867
To anybody more.

1098
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:27,859
To who more?

1099
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,962
Angie Jake, Jason Papen,

1100
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:32,967
Heather Grant.

1101
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,591
Don't forget the other.

1102
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,331
Jhony Noxver.

1103
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:39,762
Noi, believe that should go home now.

1104
01:04:40,364 --> 01:04:40,796
I feel a lot.

1105
01:04:45,295 --> 01:04:47,590
This makes to resemble as an idiot.

1106
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:51,420
If they give me his/her telephone number is because
they trust

1107
01:04:51,493 --> 01:04:52,788
in protecting his/her privacy.

1108
01:04:53,892 --> 01:04:55,686
Now I seem antiprofissional totally.

1109
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:56,712
I feel a lot.

1110
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:58,186
What do make with you?

1111
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,178
I can punish myself.

1112
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:03,187
As escever an excuse to all
the ones what called?

1113
01:05:03,221 --> 01:05:04,709
And not to use the telephone for one week.

1114
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:07,584
One month.

1115
01:05:08,185 --> 01:05:09,774
It is too much.

1116
01:05:10,284 --> 01:05:10,976
Two weeks.

1117
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:11,981
Ok.

1118
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:17,070
All the one that entrusted were disappointed.

1119
01:05:53,031 --> 01:05:57,961
Forces of the darkness, listen to us.

1120
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,187
What are making girls?

1121
01:06:01,893 --> 01:06:02,858
Using magic.

1122
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,051
We are witches.

1123
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,217
That sad!

1124
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:10,086
Don't worry, we don't make sacrifices
human.

1125
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:12,077
Or with blood.

1126
01:06:12,122 --> 01:06:12,917
As in the graph.

1127
01:06:12,988 --> 01:06:16,850
This proven that the adolescents only
they owe

1128
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:17,476
to be anorexic or

1129
01:06:18,186 --> 01:06:18,879
witches.

1130
01:06:19,984 --> 01:06:21,506
How do they make this?

1131
01:06:22,184 --> 01:06:23,843
One want to show true love,

1132
01:06:23,883 --> 01:06:28,404
light some candles and ask for him/it.

1133
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:29,276
And does the love come?

1134
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,708
It can use him/it.

1135
01:06:32,212 --> 01:06:32,802
I am hungry.

1136
01:06:33,379 --> 01:06:35,502
I think I have some here cookies.

1137
01:06:43,407 --> 01:06:46,929
He/she should join. Leave that the fire...

1138
01:06:51,804 --> 01:06:54,563
What does make he/she? I call him/it, I write...

1139
01:06:54,601 --> 01:06:57,725
I believe that should tell him/her something that in it owes him/it
to wait.

1140
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:58,958
Marti?

1141
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,692
Yes?

1142
01:07:00,732 --> 01:07:01,720
What?

1143
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:04,229
Am I upsetting myself because the show finished?

1144
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:05,422
I don't know.

1145
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:06,960
Incredible!

1146
01:07:06,996 --> 01:07:07,586
Ei, listen!

1147
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:12,183
They want him to make a pilot.

1148
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:15,486
And because he/she has to tell me?

1149
01:07:15,526 --> 01:07:16,287
Everything is.

1150
01:07:16,326 --> 01:07:17,291
It is what want to tell him/her.

1151
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:18,914
And that there is of Briana?

1152
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,183
What?

1153
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,019
Don't make to resemble as idiot.

1154
01:07:22,588 --> 01:07:23,485
I know what is having.

1155
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:25,849
If you have some thing,

1156
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:29,080
don't stand back for my cause.

1157
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,379
What? Why does tell me this?

1158
01:07:34,883 --> 01:07:35,974
This arrived for email.

1159
01:07:37,282 --> 01:07:40,713
It is madness, somebody wants to play with you.

1160
01:07:41,147 --> 01:07:41,908
It was what thought.

1161
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:44,810
Somebody tried to upset me, playing with
his/her cellular one.

1162
01:07:44,845 --> 01:07:49,707
It is also tried to leave me disgusted with this.

1163
01:07:49,743 --> 01:07:51,605
And when it was coqueteando with Briana...

1164
01:07:51,642 --> 01:07:53,868
Coqueteando, that is saying?

1165
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,032
He/she flirted with her.

1166
01:07:55,607 --> 01:07:56,594
Tell me that he/she made him/it.

1167
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,036
Why would make that?

1168
01:07:58,105 --> 01:08:00,729
Because he/she said that all should make her to think

1169
01:08:00,771 --> 01:08:01,203
that are crazy for her.

1170
01:08:01,238 --> 01:08:02,168
He/she never said that.

1171
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,498
It was not what listened.

1172
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:05,524
I already know what listened.

1173
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:06,034
Voce is a star. Of these of TV,

1174
01:08:06,102 --> 01:08:10,589
he/she wants to have all of the girls that it can.

1175
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:13,530
As soon as he/she can have all.

1176
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,325
I don't want beautiful girls jóvens.

1177
01:08:15,398 --> 01:08:16,022
I want you.

1178
01:08:18,196 --> 01:08:18,889
Ok, understood.

1179
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,087
I am very old for these school things.

1180
01:08:22,128 --> 01:08:23,491
Listen!

1181
01:08:24,294 --> 01:08:25,725
What such what make?

1182
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,551
Please, tell me that uses shorts under that.

1183
01:08:28,592 --> 01:08:31,351
Yes, healthy very small.

1184
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:34,082
They make to resemble to have a great trazeiro.

1185
01:08:34,589 --> 01:08:37,247
If it is what all say.

1186
01:08:37,288 --> 01:08:38,310
What such trazeiro?

1187
01:08:39,387 --> 01:08:40,409
Don't let to interrupt me them.

1188
01:08:40,452 --> 01:08:41,247
He already left.

1189
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:41,943
No, it didn't go.

1190
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:42,848
Leave!

1191
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:44,610
It is the end of the discussion.

1192
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:48,506
When it is very displeased, his/her voice is sharp.

1193
01:08:48,915 --> 01:08:52,368
I will see what happens, I was never in a car with
Briana.

1194
01:08:52,414 --> 01:08:54,674
Actually he/she has problems in trusting.

1195
01:08:55,312 --> 01:08:56,675
Exact, I agree.

1196
01:08:57,212 --> 01:08:58,972
What does have to do with this?

1197
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:00,340
Everything!

1198
01:09:00,843 --> 01:09:02,502
He/she is the first boy with el that I have been leaving
in 10 years.

1199
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:04,200
And he/she can go out with me.

1200
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:07,797
And I don't want that commits the same mistake
with me.

1201
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:13,731
Then I will be like Ashton.

1202
01:09:15,603 --> 01:09:17,295
And she would be like Demi.

1203
01:09:17,801 --> 01:09:21,755
And he/she wants to know, we could leave.

1204
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:24,287
She is beautiful.

1205
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,724
That devils are speaking?

1206
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:31,024
I am not Demi.

1207
01:09:31,096 --> 01:09:35,788
You are not Ashton and you are not Bruce.

1208
01:09:35,827 --> 01:09:37,883
Is he/she seeing as it is upset?

1209
01:09:37,926 --> 01:09:40,084
In my bachelor party nobody can come.

1210
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:43,146
That is crazy ok?

1211
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:44,587
Only calm down and leave.

1212
01:09:44,623 --> 01:09:45,213
No.

1213
01:09:46,822 --> 01:09:47,809
Ok, have to leave.

1214
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:49,977
However, when he/she knows, I will call him/it.

1215
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:52,517
Ei, not!

1216
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:54,708
You are well of all the forms.

1217
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:56,078
Ok.

1218
01:09:57,882 --> 01:09:59,370
Izzi, go!

1219
01:09:59,982 --> 01:10:02,776
I don't have boyfriend, I don't work.

1220
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:04,870
I will only be with a boy.

1221
01:10:05,379 --> 01:10:05,970
Is he/she happy now?

1222
01:10:06,512 --> 01:10:08,272
I am looking at the show.

1223
01:10:08,777 --> 01:10:10,504
This does very sense.

1224
01:10:10,977 --> 01:10:13,669
She is refined and beautiful.

1225
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:16,706
He/she gave for that boy the best sex of his/her life.

1226
01:10:16,774 --> 01:10:18,602
Without waiting anything.

1227
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:23,103
And she thinks is an I show.

1228
01:10:25,903 --> 01:10:28,391
He/she cannot leave crumbs in all of the sides.

1229
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:30,233
What?

1230
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,290
It is not that he/she leaves them the a side of the bed.

1231
01:10:50,592 --> 01:10:51,114
What is having he/she?

1232
01:10:51,191 --> 01:10:53,020
Why does always something have to be badly?

1233
01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:55,019
Ok.

1234
01:10:57,488 --> 01:11:01,282
Kati is a prostitute.

1235
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,680
It ordered a card for Dilan.

1236
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:06,183
And he/she said all that he/she knew what did.

1237
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:09,183
And he/she knows that the master because they told him/her.

1238
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:15,579
I know that he/she said that the fact of Izzi to like of him, not
it turns them a couple.

1239
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:17,373
Can he/she believe?

1240
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:20,775
Not even it likes him. He/she only wants to upset me.

1241
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,467
He/she wants is to make fun of.

1242
01:11:22,977 --> 01:11:25,703
And it criticized his/her show.

1243
01:11:26,175 --> 01:11:27,470
Did he/she say for kati as he/she sits down?

1244
01:11:28,374 --> 01:11:28,805
No.

1245
01:11:29,574 --> 01:11:32,266
And if it changed my name for Drew?

1246
01:11:32,805 --> 01:11:33,793
What does have of badly, Izzi?

1247
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:36,961
Anything, only that can call myself
Drew from now on?

1248
01:11:43,134 --> 01:11:45,564
I hate this place. Because we have to come?

1249
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:48,291
Because it cannot use the
same jeans every day.

1250
01:11:48,431 --> 01:11:49,397
Because we didn't buy him/it only?

1251
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:52,884
Because they are not him/her badly.

1252
01:11:55,029 --> 01:11:57,391
I seem with a cow.

1253
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:58,926
Is he/she well?

1254
01:11:59,393 --> 01:12:02,222
I only want to see.

1255
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:03,450
If it presses him/her...

1256
01:12:03,491 --> 01:12:04,683
Mom, is not me...

1257
01:12:10,454 --> 01:12:11,181
I like that.

1258
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:11,948
He/she seems well.

1259
01:12:11,987 --> 01:12:13,384
They don't close.

1260
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,042
Which is the mark?

1261
01:12:15,085 --> 01:12:16,675
They are tight mamçae, forget.

1262
01:12:17,285 --> 01:12:18,080
I am so fat!

1263
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:21,074
I am ugly and he/she doesn't understand me

1264
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,877
He/she has flat stomach and it is beautiful.

1265
01:12:23,915 --> 01:12:26,039
No, wanted. My face is falling.

1266
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,568
And everything is also falling.

1267
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:31,203
Little by little I get older.

1268
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:32,175
You are young.

1269
01:12:32,677 --> 01:12:34,370
It is as a new peach.

1270
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,407
Izzi, are you beautiful, doesn't he/she see?

1271
01:12:38,475 --> 01:12:41,133
I am not beautiful, not even beautiful.

1272
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:42,536
And I am not a peach.

1273
01:12:47,603 --> 01:12:50,228
See!

1274
01:12:50,936 --> 01:12:51,798
Can I be with her?

1275
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:54,589
Yes.

1276
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,190
Adam ordered them.

1277
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:03,821
Ok, that is having? In the set what is there?

1278
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,688
That is shit!

1279
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:08,420
He/she told me that he/she would feel the writers
of go-girls.

1280
01:13:08,494 --> 01:13:09,289
However he/she didn't give me Rosie.

1281
01:13:09,327 --> 01:13:12,019
That is a producing extra, he/she doesn't need her.

1282
01:13:12,092 --> 01:13:13,614
When he/she gave me this show promised me.

1283
01:13:14,025 --> 01:13:15,081
To the whole group.

1284
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,087
He/she already has two writers.

1285
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,420
Yes, but it is not the whole group.

1286
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:21,582
It is that don't feel complete.

1287
01:13:22,088 --> 01:13:23,882
Ei boy, it is ignoring one

1288
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,150
enormous opportunity.

1289
01:13:25,186 --> 01:13:28,208
It thinks should be loyal and that group.

1290
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:29,477
It is not what wants to say.

1291
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:31,346
In effect, gentleman.

1292
01:13:31,383 --> 01:13:32,508
It is what I want to do.

1293
01:13:33,582 --> 01:13:35,104
I will return when he/she obtains her.

1294
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:39,037
Ei, let to feel him/her a piece of advice.

1295
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,545
He/she has to leave of that,

1296
01:13:41,112 --> 01:13:43,043
or else he/she won't be a real man.

1297
01:13:43,811 --> 01:13:45,140
I don't need to be it.

1298
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:46,300
I am an actor.

1299
01:13:48,009 --> 01:13:49,803
Mom?

1300
01:13:52,406 --> 01:13:53,701
Ei, doesn't want to do me

1301
01:13:53,906 --> 01:13:54,997
a birthday breakfast?

1302
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:57,800
When did we eat that?

1303
01:14:15,696 --> 01:14:17,423
Hello?

1304
01:14:19,827 --> 01:14:22,291
That good to know that is there.

1305
01:14:22,326 --> 01:14:23,485
Of the one what is speaking he/she?

1306
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:26,613
That boy Adam wants the writers.

1307
01:14:26,691 --> 01:14:29,679
He/she told me that doesn't trust in anybody more than you.

1308
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:32,686
He/she knows that I was thinking

1309
01:14:32,788 --> 01:14:36,616
that was able to supevisionar this boy.

1310
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:39,680
Leaning that maybe not.

1311
01:14:40,151 --> 01:14:41,810
What does think he/she maybe not?

1312
01:14:42,317 --> 01:14:43,805
Maybe not?

1313
01:14:44,616 --> 01:14:46,104
Because I think about shit.

1314
01:15:15,102 --> 01:15:16,294
As soon as it is that there.

1315
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:19,594
The most powerful man gets the woman.

1316
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:20,722
He/she is right.

1317
01:15:21,932 --> 01:15:25,260
And that there is if he/she has a beautiful man or a...

1318
01:15:25,297 --> 01:15:27,887
A girl that shows sign of leading him/it?

1319
01:15:27,929 --> 01:15:31,155
He/she looks, there is an agreement

1320
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,489
for this.

1321
01:15:32,526 --> 01:15:33,991
Why cannot change the things?

1322
01:15:34,592 --> 01:15:39,716
He/she is not able to, it is not natural.

1323
01:15:39,757 --> 01:15:41,154
And that is brilliant of the natural?

1324
01:15:41,823 --> 01:15:42,311
What?

1325
01:15:42,355 --> 01:15:42,911
Think!

1326
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,579
The alluvia are natural, the hurricanes
also.

1327
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,915
The earthquakes are natural.

1328
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:49,446
The natural stinks.

1329
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:52,978
It is not for a test.

1330
01:15:53,017 --> 01:15:54,915
His/her task arrives late.

1331
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:56,505
His/her language is horrible.

1332
01:15:57,215 --> 01:16:00,408
Besides talking a lot with the ones that they are in turn.

1333
01:16:00,914 --> 01:16:02,606
I know that he/she is a woman that works.

1334
01:16:03,113 --> 01:16:06,907
However I wait for a more little of discipline home.

1335
01:16:06,944 --> 01:16:08,102
See, the thing is...

1336
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:10,504
Izi newly had his/her period

1337
01:16:10,543 --> 01:16:14,166
and he/she had strange things.

1338
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,229
He/she enters in the puberty.

1339
01:16:18,705 --> 01:16:21,033
A girl can obtain better notes

1340
01:16:21,637 --> 01:16:23,398
for his/her cycle.

1341
01:16:23,903 --> 01:16:26,595
Without mentioning that still teachers

1342
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:29,727
they begin to see them different,

1343
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,431
As they grow.

1344
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:30,828
That is another thing.

1345
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:32,390
Why would the teachers make that?

1346
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:33,329
You tell me!

1347
01:16:33,398 --> 01:16:35,522
Why did obtain this?

1348
01:16:35,597 --> 01:16:38,289
And these other questions badly

1349
01:16:38,329 --> 01:16:39,419
when are the answers well?

1350
01:16:41,228 --> 01:16:43,419
Why didn't show his/her work correctly.

1351
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:45,222
However he/she was right.

1352
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,520
I need the solution to arrive

1353
01:16:48,758 --> 01:16:49,780
to a good answer.

1354
01:16:49,824 --> 01:16:51,812
However she works in a different way.

1355
01:16:52,123 --> 01:16:54,815
My work is that these students

1356
01:16:55,221 --> 01:16:56,550
make him/it well

1357
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:57,911
and demonstrate him/it in exams.

1358
01:16:57,953 --> 01:16:59,918
And it would not be better to support the girls

1359
01:17:00,219 --> 01:17:01,206
for they feel

1360
01:17:01,252 --> 01:17:02,218
mathematical,

1361
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:04,815
in the place of doing them to believe that are stupid?

1362
01:17:05,216 --> 01:17:06,113
I have an idéa!

1363
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:08,206
Why don't you teach as to be better

1364
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:10,975
and does he/she let to become trained my class?

1365
01:17:11,014 --> 01:17:11,979
I have a better idea!

1366
01:17:12,013 --> 01:17:14,410
Why doesn't catch the exams

1367
01:17:14,712 --> 01:17:15,905
and does it put them in the trazeiro?

1368
01:17:17,644 --> 01:17:20,336
I already know from where that language comes.

1369
01:17:20,842 --> 01:17:22,205
Affection!

1370
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:25,000
You are the best mother of the world.

1371
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:27,895
Let us leave of here.

1372
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:57,351
Izi, when he/she sang that part in the car,

1373
01:17:57,426 --> 01:17:59,084
actually he/she surrendered.

1374
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:00,385
Yes, it is the part of screaming.

1375
01:18:00,424 --> 01:18:02,185
However I thought about singing her/it to regulate.

1376
01:18:02,224 --> 01:18:03,019
Why?

1377
01:18:03,556 --> 01:18:05,986
Because all will be in the show.

1378
01:18:06,022 --> 01:18:06,817
Dilan will be there.

1379
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:07,952
And?

1380
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:10,384
I don't sometimes do well.

1381
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,907
And I don't want to run any risk.

1382
01:18:14,618 --> 01:18:16,515
Which is the problem if he/she notices him/it or not?

1383
01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:19,341
Make him/it well.

1384
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:23,970
While it shows what has,

1385
01:18:24,014 --> 01:18:25,740
nobody will care.

1386
01:18:28,212 --> 01:18:30,200
The key? Yes.

1387
01:18:31,709 --> 01:18:33,231
He/she takes risks.

1388
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:55,925
He/she was brilliant.

1389
01:19:00,763 --> 01:19:03,319
Ei Rosie, feel not to have given him/her

1390
01:19:03,562 --> 01:19:04,357
before the sad news.

1391
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,024
However I obtained work in Shizzle.

1392
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:10,388
Hello?

1393
01:19:10,425 --> 01:19:12,821
They offered him/her a good agreement.

1394
01:19:13,824 --> 01:19:15,948
I don't want to do this!

1395
01:19:16,022 --> 01:19:18,613
We are not able to is to return soon.

1396
01:19:34,513 --> 01:19:39,808
When somebody beats in a weak boy, I will be
lá.í

1397
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:45,434
Every time that somebody is badly, I will be lá.í

1398
01:19:51,806 --> 01:19:54,033
Ok, can use that.

1399
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:58,501
Can I see the videos of the beach?

1400
01:20:02,034 --> 01:20:05,896
I feel a lot, I can make him/it again.

1401
01:20:34,086 --> 01:20:36,176
You told me that he/she wanted that Briana

1402
01:20:36,385 --> 01:20:37,179
he/she thought that he/she cared.

1403
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:43,040
And she is aggressive.

1404
01:20:47,013 --> 01:20:50,136
It is when it doesn't please the people and he/she does
jokes,

1405
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:50,801
as Jena.

1406
01:20:51,911 --> 01:20:53,342
I already made one of Briana and John.

1407
01:20:53,411 --> 01:20:54,740
It is so comic!

1408
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,531
Ei, raisin!

1409
01:21:16,099 --> 01:21:19,495
And that is it what has with this boy?

1410
01:21:20,031 --> 01:21:23,087
I have faith in him and I know him/it.

1411
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:25,526
Yes, I like that.

1412
01:21:25,995 --> 01:21:27,187
You are an idiot!

1413
01:21:27,694 --> 01:21:29,216
However it is wanted him to make him/it,

1414
01:21:29,494 --> 01:21:30,322
he/she has to do something first.

1415
01:21:30,626 --> 01:21:31,557
Any thing!

1416
01:21:31,593 --> 01:21:33,784
Give up Jena, my old secretary.

1417
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:35,281
That will be something hard!

1418
01:21:38,589 --> 01:21:39,179
I don't like to dismiss the people.

1419
01:21:39,222 --> 01:21:43,119
From when does he/she care with the secretaries?

1420
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:44,707
I am me or her!

1421
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,207
Ok.

1422
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,547
What?

1423
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:51,107
Listen, I will count everything to his/her wife.

1424
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:51,911
Oh we go!

1425
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:55,539
I will show what does with the fotografías.

1426
01:21:58,246 --> 01:21:59,711
You imagined all this, female dog.

1427
01:21:59,746 --> 01:22:02,404
Because he/she doesn't tell him/her as if it holds

1428
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:03,309
with talents jóvens?

1429
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,403
And from when it seduces the

1430
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,836
are producers a talent?

1431
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:09,072
See!

1432
01:22:09,108 --> 01:22:09,903
Don't say anything!

1433
01:22:09,941 --> 01:22:10,929
Where will I work?

1434
01:22:11,407 --> 01:22:14,201
It could get a corner in Hollywood.

1435
01:22:33,897 --> 01:22:36,089
We will speak!

1436
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:43,616
That was entertaining.

1437
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:53,050
He/she always knew that Jan was psychotic.

1438
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,708
Actually it should like me.

1439
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:57,807
I cannot blame her.

1440
01:22:58,518 --> 01:22:59,449
Poor.

1441
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:05,638
I feel a lot.

1442
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:07,902
I acted as an immature child.

1443
01:23:11,212 --> 01:23:13,769
It is good to see that.

1444
01:23:13,812 --> 01:23:16,708
Only that he/she didn't want that me

1445
01:23:17,143 --> 01:23:18,937
he/she left for being older.

1446
01:23:19,709 --> 01:23:20,935
I am not so superficial.

1447
01:23:21,008 --> 01:23:22,064
It doesn't import me his/her age!

1448
01:23:22,107 --> 01:23:24,595
Serious? It only imports me his/her weight.

1449
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:29,831
Oh that beautiful!

1450
01:23:30,637 --> 01:23:31,500
What is that?

1451
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,856
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of an Emy!

1452
01:23:41,732 --> 01:23:43,720
Benvindos to the fair of talents.

1453
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:46,821
The spring is jóvens time.

1454
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:54,820
All are family.

1455
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:59,153
Without more the than to say, I present them Dylan
Nicolson!

1456
01:24:03,155 --> 01:24:05,813
I am Dilan and I have things for saying.

1457
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,416
He/she would like to present to the adorable ones

1458
01:24:10,852 --> 01:24:12,908
Melani, Izi and Kati!

1459
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:06,562
It was brilliant!

1460
01:26:06,631 --> 01:26:08,187
What such the voice?

1461
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:09,286
It removed her/it of me.

1462
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:10,226
What did with his/her face happen?

1463
01:26:10,263 --> 01:26:12,955
I made a chin implant.

1464
01:26:13,628 --> 01:26:16,422
They can make him/it to seem better.

1465
01:26:17,759 --> 01:26:18,746
Where is she?

1466
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,482
I will congratulate her!

1467
01:26:25,522 --> 01:26:26,351
No, leave her alone!

1468
01:26:26,954 --> 01:26:27,715
Does he/she see him/it what is happening?

1469
01:26:29,354 --> 01:26:31,444
Does Izi, want to walk?

1470
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:33,315
Ok.

1471
01:26:34,118 --> 01:26:35,105
We see each other.

1472
01:26:35,717 --> 01:26:38,648
How did he/she know that that will happen?

1473
01:26:39,182 --> 01:26:40,148
I am his/her mother.

1474
01:26:50,943 --> 01:26:52,533
Be not moved a lot for him.

1475
01:26:52,576 --> 01:26:54,040
Now which his/her problem is?

1476
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:58,094
Remember that is very young.

1477
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:01,071
Therefore it will be substituted.

1478
01:27:01,738 --> 01:27:04,259
In addition it can like any other.

1479
01:27:04,337 --> 01:27:06,859
Besides he/she was not looking at him.

1480
01:27:09,734 --> 01:27:10,961
Only taste of you.

1481
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:12,459
Serious?

1482
01:27:12,967 --> 01:27:13,727
Yes.

1483
01:27:14,465 --> 01:27:16,726
I like his/her beginning.

1484
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:20,321
Would he/she like to play a vídeogame?

1485
01:27:20,929 --> 01:27:22,053
Clear!

1486
01:27:22,661 --> 01:27:25,218
Some time played Face Scape?

1487
01:27:26,627 --> 01:27:32,318
Na, but maybe it can become trained.

1488
01:27:53,347 --> 01:27:54,744
Oh for God! Look at her!

1489
01:27:56,046 --> 01:27:58,170
It is a thing that never happened with me.

1490
01:27:58,245 --> 01:28:02,642
He/she kissed him and it still continues happy.

1491
01:28:03,343 --> 01:28:04,467
Hello?

1492
01:28:05,075 --> 01:28:07,233
How does it think the things are like this?

1493
01:28:07,874 --> 01:28:09,805
His/her body is brilliant!

1494
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,169
And he/she has style!

1495
01:28:12,839 --> 01:28:14,736
See what got!

1496
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:18,066
Ok, when it puts him/it of that sorts things out...

1497
01:28:18,736 --> 01:28:19,667
That is good.

1498
01:28:19,736 --> 01:28:22,326
Now it can be calm and to ripen.

1499
01:28:22,367 --> 01:28:23,798
However what does mean that?

1500
01:28:23,834 --> 01:28:26,492
To change the shoes or to continue like this?

1501
01:28:26,532 --> 01:28:27,895
They don't seem good things.

1502
01:28:27,932 --> 01:28:29,124
I don't want to do that.

1503
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:30,523
I want to stay passionate.

1504
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,555
I want to scream in rock concerts.

1505
01:28:32,829 --> 01:28:34,056
And to upset me with the news.

1506
01:28:34,361 --> 01:28:35,553
I want to use minifraldas.

1507
01:28:36,128 --> 01:28:37,024
He/she will seem ridiculous!

1508
01:28:37,626 --> 01:28:39,955
Ok, a lot of people seem ridiculous.

1509
01:28:40,592 --> 01:28:41,682
He/she begins to seem normal.

1510
01:28:42,682 --> 01:28:52,682
