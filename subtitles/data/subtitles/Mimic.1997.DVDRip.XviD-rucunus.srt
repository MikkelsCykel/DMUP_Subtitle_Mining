1
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,515
An eight-year-old boy
from Manhattan

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,160
was delivered
dead on arrival today...

3
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,514
- The Centers for Disease Control...
- Are we dealing with an epidemic?

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,797
Whatever the carrier,
we that know it's not the water.

5
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,235
We don't believe that it's airborne.

6
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,518
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

7
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,673
Strickler's disease
was first diagnosed two years ago.

8
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,071
We're no better off now.

9
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,674
I needed you to see this
for yourself, Dr Tyler.

10
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,079
It's the same
at every hospital in the city.

11
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,914
For the lucky ones,
it's a lifetime in leg braces.

12
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,435
Most of these kids won't make it.

13
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,432
We need your help.

14
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,839
Strickler's disease came to New York
like a thief in the night,

15
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,151
threatening to steal
an entire generation of our children

16
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,596
- from before our eyes.
...Centers for Disease Control...

17
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,275
The killer was cunning.
It was deadly.

18
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,399
Neither a cure
nor a vaccine could be found.

19
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,436
We at the CDC had to contain it

20
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,273
before it could spread
beyond Manhattan Island.

21
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,557
So we went after its carrier,
the common cockroach.

22
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,790
Or rather she did.

23
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,713
Dr Susan Tyler is the reason
that there hasn't been

24
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,429
a new case of Strickler's
in this city for six months.

25
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,794
Dr Susan Tyler,

26
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,668
Professor of Entomology at the
New York State University...

27
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,716
Thank you, Peter.

28
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,399
I don't need to tell you New Yorkers
just how resilient cockroaches are.

29
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,995
Since it has proven to be
virtually immune to chemical control,

30
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,196
we had to find
a new avenue of attack.

31
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,035
So, with the aid of genetics labs
across the country,

32
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,036
we recombined termite and mantid DNA
to create a biological counteragent,

33
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,588
a new species
to be our six-legged ally

34
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,240
in wiping out the roach population.

35
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,755
We call it the Judas breed.

36
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,352
Once in contact with
the Judas's secretions,

37
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,831
an enzyme caused the common roach's
metabolism to go into overdrive.

38
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,391
- Susan! You're missing it.
- No matter what the roaches ate,

39
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,473
every last member of the nest
starved to death within hours.

40
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,029
I hope someone's taping this.

41
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,839
This announcement's
been a long time coming.

42
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,833
The Strickler's outbreak
has officially been contained.

43
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,516
- The epidemic is over.
- Hey, Susan. Honey.

44
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,478
Dr Mann, what did this victory
mean to you personally?

45
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,199
I can move on to other projects...

46
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,555
Our 15 minutes are gone.

47
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,315
...and personally,
it's where I met my wife.

48
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,992
What is this? Is this
some kind of Catholic guilt thing?

49
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,038
We don't even know
what the impact is of what we did.

50
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,111
The impact is that a lot of kids

51
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,510
will be running around next year
because of you.

52
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,033
A lot of kids.

53
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,037
Maybe we get lucky.

54
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,710
Maybe a couple
of them'll be ours someday.

55
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,997
Oh, a couple, huh?
Oh, OK. We're not rushing things.

56
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,675
I didn't want to overtax you.
It's been a hard year.

57
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,433
It's been a great year.

58
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,514
Oxfords. Seven and a half.
Black. Leather soles.

59
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,950
Funny, funny shoes.

60
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,476
Funny, funny shoes.

61
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,116
Funny, funny shoes.
Funny, funny shoes.

62
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,155
Funny...

63
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,908
- CDC.
- CDC?

64
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,637
Hey, Boss, welcome to disease land.

65
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,598
- Tuck it in.
- All right. All right.

66
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,352
Are you sure this is yellow fever?

67
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,556
Are you ignoring your pages now?

68
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,677
These cops saw the broken scaffold
and then the paint here,

69
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,912
then they looked into the cellar.
Go ahead. Take a look.

70
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,954
Pleasant, isn't it?

71
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,793
Couldn't let 'em out
until you gave me the OK, so...

72
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,474
There were three dozen people
in here.

73
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,950
Bacterial readings are off
the scale, though nothing's airborne.

74
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,635
We got a Reverend Harry Ping -
preacher, if you can imagine that.

75
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,439
He ran this place.
There's no sign of him.

76
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,239
Oh, have you had lunch?

77
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,158
Try to keep it down
when you see this, OK?

78
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,434
Piece of shit on the ceiling.

79
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,074
- Figure that one out.
- Here, Josh.

80
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,835
- The subway?
- This is what I love about my job.

81
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,072
I get to travel, see the world
and meet new exotic cultures.

82
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,550
It's all bacterial but hey,
what the fuck, right?

83
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,154
- Thanks a lot.
- Board up every exit.

84
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,357
If this leads to the subways,
I don't want anything to spread.

85
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,396
Quarantine everything.

86
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,274
What's going on, Remy?

87
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,273
I'm just commemorating
my sad moments.

88
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,434
We're at this great restaurant.
I'm thinking, finally, a gentleman.

89
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,636
I go to the ladies', I come back,

90
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,518
I catch the schmuck
slipping sedatives into my drink.

91
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,435
- What a pervert!
- This city is full of perverts.

92
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,592
You don't know
who anybody is any more.

93
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,398
Jesus, I look like shit.

94
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,552
- Hey, guys.
- You the bug lady, right?

95
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,392
We're here to deal.

96
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,753
You should pick 'em up by
this front vein on the wing

97
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,877
cos it's the strongest part -
that way you don't break it.

98
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,748
Now, let's see what else you have.
Ah, look.

99
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,752
- What do we have here?
- Swallowtail?

100
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,478
Excellent.

101
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,154
How come you like bugs so much?

102
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,236
Lmagine that you're one of them.

103
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,788
Eating furniture and stuff?
That's gotta suck.

104
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,111
Don't judge them too quickly.
These guys were building castles

105
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,351
while dinosaurs were still
wimpy little lizards.

106
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,832
Now, say you're him.
He's what we call a soldier.

107
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,434
There is no way
you would ever quit fighting,

108
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,750
no matter how badly injured
you were.

109
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,195
It would be a battle to the death.

110
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,635
But most insects don't kill
unless their territory is invaded.

111
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,954
You'd just stun your prey up here

112
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,953
and then you'd drag it all
the way down through here to there,

113
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,677
into what is kind of like a pantry.

114
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,108
- They eat it alive?
- Yeah.

115
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,431
They're not really squeamish
about those kind of things.

116
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,830
This is the nest. It's the heart of
the colony, the big enchilada.

117
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,148
Why?

118
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,153
If anything happened to the nest,
the entire colony would die out.

119
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,915
- I'd just bail and start my own.
- Well, you couldn't do that.

120
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,276
See that big guy there?
Next to the queen?

121
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,231
Wait. Look over there.

122
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,154
He's the king. And out of all
the nest, he's the only fertile male.

123
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,836
He got a good deal.

124
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,633
It's a simple structure
designed for survival -

125
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,234
perfectly balanced
and very beautiful.

126
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,237
Whatever peels your banana, lady.

127
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,153
You wanna buy the butterflies,
or what?

128
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,069
You guys have done a really good job,
so how about five bucks?

129
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,355
- That's your best?
- Show her the weird bug.

130
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,955
- Costs a dollar just to look.
- Got it on the subway.

131
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,077
- We kind of broke it a little.
- OK. My best offer.

132
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,675
Ten bucks for everything, plus
a specimen jar, tweezers and mounts.

133
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,716
Deal.

134
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,759
Are you crazy? This is the best.
This is our meal ticket.

135
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,718
Come on. Bug's almost dead anyway.

136
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,519
It's yours.

137
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,637
- You gave 'em ten bucks.
- They're from Alphabet City.

138
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,359
There's worse things
they could be selling.

139
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,156
Oh, no. Your papers.
Help me get the window.

140
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,396
Susan. Push.

141
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,074
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, I hate this window.

142
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,594
OK, on three. One, two, three.

143
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,317
Who are you
to put my officers on quarantine?

144
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,551
Listen, Captain.
Those two, they go home,

145
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,474
kiss their wives and kids
and I've got a full-blown epidemic...

146
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,711
- Chuy, we have to make dinner.
- Dinner.

147
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,349
- I don't care.
- I do! Jesus, I hate cops.

148
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,998
They make the worst coffee.

149
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,470
- Shiny wire.
- Giving you a hard time?

150
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,790
Don't stare.
People look back if you stare.

151
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,075
It's not polite.

152
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,508
- I can't believe this.
- What?

153
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,956
I spend an hour in the field.
I get a weekend's worth of crap.

154
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,999
Oh, speaking of that.
That turd that I took to the lab?

155
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,476
I found these in it.

156
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,191
- What are they?
- Buttons.

157
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,796
Maybe they needed fibre.

158
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,831
Sorry.

159
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,560
Oh, my God. You're just a baby.

160
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,991
Oh, my God.

161
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,430
The transfer of recombinant genetic
material from termites and mantids

162
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,557
into Judas breed
will allow rapid enzymatic change...

163
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,477
...ensuring 100% sterility
in all Judas females...

164
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,433
...utilization of suicide gene...

165
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,350
...leading to a life expectancy
of 120 to 180 days.

166
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,589
Not too little...

167
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,830
and not too much.

168
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,515
You rub it in.

169
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,431
Around and around.

170
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,397
Like this.

171
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,630
Let the leather take it.

172
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,350
Funny shoes.

173
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,156
Mr Funny Shoes.

174
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,910
No one is there. Is empty.

175
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,950
Chuy, listen to me.

176
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,638
They have Jesus on the cross
but that is not a holy place.

177
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,555
Can you call me back tonight?
Thanks, Officer.

178
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,114
- Cops are on it.
- Good.

179
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,031
Well, they said...

180
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,676
Can you do me a favour and hold off
working at night for a while?

181
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,910
I can't do that.
I have to get back...

182
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,958
Someone broke into your office, OK?

183
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,597
- I'm sorry you lost a specimen...
- This is not just a specimen.

184
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,835
I did a pH test and there are only
two species that match what I found.

185
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,388
One of them is a leafcutter ant
in the Amazon.

186
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,189
The other one
we released here three years ago.

187
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,312
You said...

188
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,829
You said the ones we released
only had a lifespan of six months.

189
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,675
We engineered sterile adults. They
were supposed to last one generation.

190
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,753
- So what happened?
- The one I saw today was a baby.

191
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,798
They were designed to die.
They are breeding.

192
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,910
I shine them good.

193
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,396
Chuy, Black Lincoln.

194
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,996
Black Lincoln. This one.

195
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,877
Pay attention, please.

196
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,029
- Is this where you found the bug?
- Yeah. But they changed the lock.

197
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,198
- You haven't seen one of those?
- No. What is it?

198
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,637
It's an ootheca. It's kind of
a fancy name for an egg case.

199
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,553
There's probably more,
like, weird bugs inside.

200
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,438
No way! I see one of those, I puke.

201
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,476
Here you go.

202
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,394
Hold on. Is there money to be made
on this egg thing?

203
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,836
- Sorry.
- Dealing days are over. Vamonos.

204
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,512
These egg things look nasty.

205
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,670
Thought you liked
finding nasty things.

206
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,274
If we find these,
she'll pay us, right?

207
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,590
Is that all you think about?

208
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,352
Come on.

209
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,075
This bug. What does it look like?

210
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,752
Did you hear that?

211
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,317
- How deep does this go?
- Let's see.

212
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,236
Let's take a look.

213
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,470
- You see anything?
- Not yet.

214
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,797
Shit! I dropped it.

215
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,032
I can't reach it.

216
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,236
Let me try. My hands are smaller.

217
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,957
- Just leave it.
- No, wait. I'm almost there.

218
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,874
How much do you think we'll get
for this egg?

219
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,678
At least a twenty-spot.

220
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,393
Jesus!

221
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,474
Fucking moles!

222
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,790
- Got any change?
- Get a job, scag.

223
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,195
Kid! Get the hell off the tracks!

224
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,589
- How about a quarter?
- Get off my tracks!

225
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,190
- That's where he is. Long John.
- Slow down, hot shot!

226
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,795
Don't be talking to the moles.
They messed up.

227
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,758
Hey, moles! Eat my long john!

228
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,400
Look, I already told you
this is CDC business.

229
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,109
And I'm telling you
those lockers are MTA business.

230
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,590
We'll pay for the lock we broke,
Officer. I mean...

231
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,470
- Who am I talking to? You or him?
- You're talking to me, OK?

232
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,516
- All we wanna see is...
- See what?

233
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,115
- That's the old maintenance bridge.
- This insect we're looking for...

234
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,839
Your lady want a bug or its eggs,

235
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,388
or whatever she wants,
that's fine by me.

236
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,789
But it's like Swiss cheese
down there.

237
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,713
Tunnels in, tunnels out, old tracks.

238
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,679
You go messin' around, break your
neck and it's my ass on the line.

239
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,634
Lace-up shoes. Black. Nine West.

240
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,713
Chuy, finish your sandwich.
It's good. It's chicken.

241
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,792
Penny loafers. Eleven. Double E.

242
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,919
- He's really good at that.
- Oh, yes.

243
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,639
He imitates anything.

244
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,676
Doesn't he go to school?

245
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,156
He doesn't need school. He's special.

246
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,629
What you making there?
Is that a superhero?

247
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,355
Mr Funny Shoes.

248
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,749
He knows everything about shoes.

249
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,718
- I'm talking to you.
- No, you talking at me!

250
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,792
Come back with the permits,
we'll have a conversation.

251
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,998
- Great. We'll do lunch.
- Yeah, I look forward to it.

252
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,718
- Uptown.
- What happened?

253
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,076
Napoleon is alive and well
and working for the MTA.

254
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,673
We have to get down there.

255
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,354
He wants a permit?
I'll give him a special one.

256
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,996
What's that?

257
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,836
Is that the egg thing?

258
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,436
Give me a hand.

259
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,516
Man, that smells.

260
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,271
I can hear the bugs.

261
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,148
Come on. Cut it. She's gotta give us
at least 40 bucks.

262
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,078
- What's up?
- I think there's a guy down there.

263
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,310
Oh, shit! It's got me!

264
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,957
Help! Oh, God, please!
Please, help me!

265
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,558
Alex!

266
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,116
A philosopher named Hobbes
once wrote that

267
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,352
"Life, by its very nature,
is nasty, brutish and short."

268
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,908
An ant would put it more succinctly:

269
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,956
"Can I eat it or will it eat me?"

270
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,795
It's this kind of simplicity
that governs the phylum Insecta.

271
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,755
- Hello?
- I got the permits.

272
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,308
- You did?
- We're going down tomorrow.

273
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,188
OK, that's great. Listen,
I gotta go, I'll call you later.

274
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,637
...or of cellular phones, as my
distinguished colleague can tell you.

275
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,237
So, you think your Frankenstein
has got the better of you?

276
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,550
I was hoping you could tell me.

277
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,110
I really need to find
some answers, Walter.

278
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,191
Dear Susan...

279
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,955
is it answers you want from me,
or is it absolution?

280
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,396
You still think
making the Judases was wrong?

281
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,756
Three years ago,
I would've called it unforgivable.

282
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,950
But I have two grandchildren who are
alive today probably because of you.

283
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,069
It would be a tad hypocritical
for me to pass judgement.

284
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,116
That's not an answer, Walter.

285
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,233
It's not an easy question.

286
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,880
But as to the Judases,

287
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,315
I think it's likely some survived.

288
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,910
Evolution has a way
of keeping things alive.

289
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,277
But they all died in the lab.

290
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,798
Yes, Susan.
But you let them out into the world.

291
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,355
The world's a much bigger lab.

292
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,551
Funny shoes.

293
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,149
- Yeah.
- Hi, Peter. It's Remy.

294
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,912
Yeah, hi.

295
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,309
Is Susan there?
I need to talk to her.

296
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,436
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

297
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,954
- It's really important.
- Yeah, sure.

298
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,472
What are you doing?

299
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,516
What have you got there?

300
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,511
- Where?
- Right there. In your hand.

301
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,388
- Nothing.
- Are we testing it?

302
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,038
Maybe.

303
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,470
- Are we testing it?
- Maybe. I don't know. Could be.

304
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,949
- It's Remy.
- Good. So give me the phone.

305
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,315
Give me the phone.

306
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,231
- Are we testing it?
- Yes.

307
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,276
Can you hold on, Remy?

308
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,440
Hey. What's up?

309
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,600
- They found what?
- At the water filtration plant.

310
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,717
- What's going on?
- I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

311
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,756
OK. Bye.

312
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,272
How long you got?

313
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,998
Patience.

314
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,430
We'll just try again.

315
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,516
Try again.

316
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,318
You know, sometimes these things
can be wrong.

317
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,000
That's OK.
I gotta go, OK? Bye, babe.

318
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,596
Susan, we got
the subway thing today.

319
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,070
I know. I'm gonna have
to meet you there when I'm done.

320
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,912
Wait.

321
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,196
Done from what?

322
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,078
Boots, toys, beer bottles,

323
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,837
body parts, cocaine-filled condoms,
little baby alligators...

324
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,992
Shit, you wouldn't believe
the stuff I've seen.

325
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,834
Yep. They flush 'em down.
We fish 'em out.

326
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,832
But this thing.
We didn't know what this was.

327
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,309
We nearly threw it away
but then I remembered Remy.

328
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,755
Jeremy plays bass in my band.

329
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,232
Anyway. So...

330
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,116
Yep. I remember Remy says to me,

331
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,954
"If it's got more than four legs,
it's not a mammal."

332
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,630
It's a lobster, right?

333
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,390
My father saw me stay in bed,

334
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,111
he go get the pitcher
of cold water and whoosh!

335
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,598
I tell you, that's some alarm clock.

336
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,273
- How big did you say these bugs are?
- Hurry up.

337
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,794
My shift's almost over.
I need my beauty sleep.

338
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,838
If I'm blowing off my Saturday,
then so are you.

339
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,629
Yeah. It looks like somebody
requested you for overtime.

340
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,832
Come on. Hurry up.
Let's find these things.

341
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,956
We've got a long way to go.

342
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,671
All right. Watch your step there.

343
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,399
We've got burrows going
down seven storeys here.

344
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,278
- No shit?
- Oh, yeah.

345
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,751
It's five storeys down, partner.
You fall, I don't wanna pick you up.

346
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,674
OK, it's all yours. Go ahead.

347
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,671
- It's 48 hours.
- I can't wait that long.

348
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,034
You got a pen?

349
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,680
- I write it.
- You gotta write this down.

350
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,591
The case number is two, seven...

351
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,154
What you say? Two, seven.
Yes, two, seven...

352
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,800
...eight, three.
...eight, three.

353
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,156
- All right. You got that?
- What does this mean, case number?

354
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,789
It means I deal with you
in 48 hours, OK?

355
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,515
Hijos de puta!

356
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,155
Mr Funny Shoes.

357
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,194
Hi, Doc.
Susan sent you some homework.

358
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,755
- People actually do live down here?
- Yeah, man. The mole people.

359
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,071
This section was pretty popular
all the way to Fulton Street.

360
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,675
Tweaked-out crackheads,
dopeheads, shitheads, mental cases.

361
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,558
Then suddenly, poof! All gone.

362
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,030
Rumours got started.
Someone found a couple of stiffs.

363
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,588
Yeah, they make up
some crap about a killer.

364
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,477
Overcoat Slim, Long John.

365
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,190
Down here is the land of talk.

366
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,635
The wildest version
goes the farthest.

367
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,793
Hold it right here.
You got it? I see...

368
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,956
But this... Look!

369
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,918
The organs are perfectly formed.

370
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,877
They were functional.

371
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,509
I'm guessing here, and, of course,

372
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,593
they don't have
a complete specimen, but...

373
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,079
What do you think it is?

374
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,472
This thing is not just
some random mutation.

375
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,475
It's a highly evolved soldier caste -
a formidable killer.

376
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,472
It couldn't have developed
in a vacuum.

377
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,390
It's part of a colony.

378
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,193
All right! Hold it!
Check the other end, will ya?

379
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,078
This way, this way.

380
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,594
Should have stayed at the office.

381
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,148
- How much longer?
- Keep looking.

382
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,878
It's the size of your palm.

383
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,916
Aw, man. Take a whiff.

384
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,992
- God, it smells like acid.
- No. It's ammonia.

385
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,557
Hey, guys.

386
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,955
- There's some weird shit here.
- What kind of weird shit?

387
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,836
Lots of it.

388
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,912
God!

389
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,872
Man!

390
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,514
Go ahead and ask him. Ask.

391
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,353
You seen anything like this before?

392
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,432
Why you askin' me if I've ever seen
some shit like this before?

393
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,192
Do I look like I have?

394
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,317
Hell, no, I ain't never seen
no shit like this before!

395
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,598
Who the fuck would wanna climb up
these walls and hang one of these?

396
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,389
Must've been a big elephant-ass
motherfucker. I don't know.

397
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,352
The Delancey Street station
will close in five minutes.

398
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,716
Please find alternate routes
to your destination.

399
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,989
- Carlito?
- Yeah?

400
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,036
Aqui mismo estoy!

401
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,911
Come on, Peter. Hurry up.

402
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,476
Do you have the time?

403
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,912
Sir, the time?

404
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,555
You know, my father always
wanted me to become a dentist.

405
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,312
I said, "No way.

406
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,996
"I'm not gonna spend my life
looking into people's open mouths."

407
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,594
What could be worse
than that, right?

408
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,393
Oh, man, I've never been this deep.

409
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,630
This is the old Armory Station.

410
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,352
They built it turn of the century.
It's been closed for decades.

411
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,193
Yeah, I guess we covered everything.

412
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,670
Look. You got your shit.
I'm happy for you.

413
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,910
Let's get the hell outta here.

414
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,309
Josh, I want a full team
here by six tonight.

415
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,992
Right.

416
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,754
- Oh, shit! What the fuck?
- No, don't!

417
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,314
- Look what the fuck you did, man!
- You see the size of that thing?

418
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,677
Peter, are you all right?

419
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,830
It's OK, Josh.

420
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,758
It's OK. I think I'm OK.

421
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,517
- Get the hell off me.
- Yeah, I think he's OK too.

422
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,556
How am I gonna get you back up?

423
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,631
I don't know.

424
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,960
- See a way up?
- No.

425
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,235
- Shit.
- There is no way up.

426
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,995
- Oh, man, that's gonna work!
- Do you know a better way up?

427
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,910
Show that to the station manager.

428
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,719
Tell him Leonard said
he's gonna have his butt

429
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,870
if he don't have someone down here...

430
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,076
Wait, I can't find
my way back alone.

431
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,072
Look, look, look.
Just go back the same way we came.

432
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,912
Wait, wait.

433
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,271
Take the first tunnel to the left,
then go to the fork, right?

434
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,716
- Then right, right, left.
- Left... Can I stay here

435
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:02,271
- and help you guys back up?
- Toss the glow-sticks down and go.

436
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,237
Keep headin' up. You'll get there.

437
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,390
- Hurry!
- All right! I got it.

438
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,476
Help me!

439
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,075
Help! Please, help!

440
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,038
Help! Please!

441
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,311
Please! Somebody, please help me!

442
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,236
Piece of shit.

443
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,673
This is really weird. We should've
seen some track bunnies by now.

444
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,355
- What are they?
- Track bunnies. Rats.

445
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,271
They're usually around.

446
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,033
- They big?
- You damn right.

447
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,271
Could you just knock it off, please?
Knock it off.

448
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,874
Hey, I sing when I'm nervous.

449
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,477
- Turn these lights back on.
- What?

450
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,949
You said the cables
are still live.

451
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,270
- Oh, man.
- Maybe we can rewire them.

452
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,670
- There you go again.
- What?

453
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,877
How are you gonna rewire all of this?
You need a whole crew.

454
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,871
What is your problem, man?

455
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,520
Do you need a memo
every time you take a shit?

456
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,352
Don't go there.

457
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,159
You better be careful
how you speak to people.

458
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,350
- Josh?
- He wouldn't be comin' from there.

459
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,079
Manny, what the hell
are you doin' here?

460
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,154
Hurry. The lady needs help.

461
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,834
Honey, we're coming!

462
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:15,478
Oh, Jesus, please hurry.
Please. Come on!

463
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,556
- No! It's coming!
- What the fuck is that?

464
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,350
Come on. Get her, man! Get her!
What the fuck is that?

465
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,590
- What the fuck...
- Go!

466
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,197
Look there! There! There!
The car! The car!

467
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,313
Close the door!
Close the fuckin' door!

468
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,709
What the fuck was that?

469
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,039
- Come on. Here, here!
- Just wait a minute!

470
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,953
- You wait! I wanna make sure!
- It's not dead.

471
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,838
Well, it's gonna be very soon, lady!

472
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,552
- There it is.
- Drag it out.

473
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,558
You better tell me what the hell's
goin' on around here.

474
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,476
Oh, man.

475
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:02,638
OK, Leonard. OK. It's gonna be fine.
You'll be fine.

476
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,471
OK. You just stay calm.

477
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,357
OK, there we go.

478
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,194
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Ah, Christ.

479
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:23,069
- Josh will be here soon with help.
- You're dreamin', man.

480
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,475
If your boy was comin',
he'd be here now.

481
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,869
- They ate his ass.
- We don't know that.

482
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,195
If there's more of them out there...

483
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,670
What's been puttin'
that shit all over the walls?

484
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,876
If you keep on
screaming like that,

485
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,315
we're gonna meet
the rest of its family.

486
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,155
Manny? Manny, be careful.

487
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,390
- It's dead.
- No, no, no.

488
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,471
I emptied two clips
and it kept comin'.

489
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,596
Wait a second. Help me turn it over.

490
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,678
- Peter, these are lungs.
- What the hell is she talkin' about?

491
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,909
Biology 101.
You know, insects don't have lungs.

492
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,709
- That's what limits their size.
- The secretions are the same.

493
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,628
When I increased its metabolism,
I sped up its breeding cycle.

494
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,314
We're talking hundreds
of thousands of generations,

495
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,868
- who knows how many mutations!
- Listen, I...

496
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,713
I just don't fuckin' get this.
How could the...

497
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,394
How could the Judas evolve into this?

498
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,196
Think generations, not years.

499
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,670
It took only 40,000 generations
for apes to turn into humans.

500
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,988
So?

501
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,311
We changed its DNA, Peter.
We don't know what we did!

502
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,550
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Hold on!

503
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,997
If that thing has been around,
how come nobody's ever seen it?

504
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,439
I think we have.

505
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,229
Sometimes an insect will evolve
to mimic its predator.

506
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,148
A fly can look like a spider.

507
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,674
A caterpillar can look like a snake.

508
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,512
The Judas evolved
to mimic its predator.

509
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,638
Us.

510
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,754
- Nobody knows about this?
- Nobody would until it's too late.

511
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,796
These things can imitate us,

512
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,759
they can infiltrate us and breed
before anyone would even notice.

513
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,436
How could you do this?
How could you do this?!

514
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,798
You take something
and you make it like a man.

515
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,429
A man who's not a man, he's a...
He's a thing!

516
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,953
That steals my child!

517
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,191
Manny, you tell her,
cos she don't give a goddamn.

518
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:49,952
- Your kid's gone.
- Shut up.

519
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,079
My leg's chewed up! And they're
talkin' about insects with lungs!

520
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,311
Oh, shit! They're everywhere!

521
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,636
Manny, get over here!

522
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,993
It's the blood! The smell of
the blood is driving them crazy!

523
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,035
Shit!

524
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,155
We have to cover the scent!

525
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,515
Manny, give me your razor!

526
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,796
Here. Take it. Rub it on the windows.
Anywhere there's cracks.

527
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,110
- Just do it!
- Come on.

528
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,078
- What is it?
- Scent glands.

529
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,789
Insects use them to identify
themselves. Rub it all over yourself.

530
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,839
They won't attack you
if they think you're one of them.

531
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,433
Manny!

532
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,311
It worked.

533
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,679
- Do you mind if...?
- Go ahead.

534
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,751
Manny, give me your lighter.

535
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:09,557
Look. This is where we are. These
tunnels may lead to the surface.

536
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,231
If we can get this car moving,
we might be able to make it.

537
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,548
What...

538
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,870
What do you mean, might?

539
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,353
I mean, probably.

540
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,158
But even if they do,

541
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,711
this thing's been down here
rotting for half a century.

542
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,990
- How do you know it'll move?
- Listen to me.

543
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,389
This car is a CR-17
from Coney Island.

544
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,835
Believe me, it was made to last.

545
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:47,431
Now, Manny, there's a track relay
switch in this room here.

546
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,954
Switch the tracks.
That'll get us going.

547
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,598
Yes, I'll try. I'll try.

548
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,035
Do. There's a fuse box
down the tracks.

549
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,715
If I can rewire it,
I can juice up the whole system.

550
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,429
Leonard, man. Look at yourself.

551
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,195
I'll do it. If you talk me
through it, I'll go out there.

552
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,114
- All you've gotta do is...
- No, no, no, no. I'll go. I'll go.

553
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,478
Why? I know much more about
what's out there than you do.

554
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,396
You're right.

555
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,200
You understand the creature,
and, uh...

556
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,473
Leonard knows the subway, so...

557
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,953
This is the way it's gotta be.
Whatever happens, it's Manny and me.

558
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,598
Why?

559
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,274
You two have gotta stay on this car.

560
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,880
You gotta get back up.

561
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,590
You gotta undo this.

562
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,073
So, I'll go.

563
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,312
We'll go.

564
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,555
I have to put this on you now.

565
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,237
They mimic us. We mimic them.

566
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,430
Peter, Peter. Peter, look.

567
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,274
You'll find two wires...

568
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,874
one green, the other blue.

569
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,033
OK.

570
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:53,192
Man, this shit can't be sanitary.

571
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,236
Take it off.

572
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,073
No, man. Leave it on. Leave it on.

573
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,990
Don't touch it.

574
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,230
Try not to sweat.

575
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:24,550
They sense chemical changes.

576
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,835
OK, I'll try not to sweat.

577
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,151
Chuy!

578
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,230
Susan, he's in.

579
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,515
He just needs to find the switch.

580
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,631
Green. Blue.

581
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,950
Green, blue. Green, blue.

582
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,357
Shit.

583
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,276
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

584
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,352
Chuy!

585
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,276
Chuy, it's me.

586
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,190
Come on, Manny.
What's takin' you so long?

587
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,794
Do these subway tracks
lead to the train tunnels

588
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,075
at Grand Central and Penn Station?

589
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,151
Yeah.

590
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,516
Well, they'll use them
to migrate out of the city.

591
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,036
After that, they'll set up
colonies anywhere they can.

592
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,713
Every specimen
we've seen has been female.

593
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,712
A male would be a lighter colour
and would have no wings.

594
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,076
If they follow
the Judas's spawning pattern,

595
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,470
the nest will have
only one fertile male.

596
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:57,109
Now if we could catch
that male and kill him,

597
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,668
then the females
won't be able to breed

598
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,433
and the whole generation
could die out.

599
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,397
Where the hell is the male?

600
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,397
Come here. Come here. Come here.

601
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,318
- Friends.
- Come here, please.

602
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,840
Oh, goddammit! He must be in trouble!

603
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,512
- He must be in trouble!
- Wait. Listen.

604
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,957
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm goin' out there.

605
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,156
You stay here.

606
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,152
Listen. If the car starts...

607
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:02,993
I'll meet you
at the end of the platform.

608
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,752
Oh, my God.

609
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,832
Oh, Manny.

610
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,036
Yes! Yes! CR-17
from Coney Island, goddammit!

611
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,995
Shit!

612
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,798
Goddammit!

613
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,068
Goddamn! Shit!

614
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,473
Leonard!

615
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,159
Get away! Go away! I'm bleeding!

616
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,919
- I found a way out on a dumbwaiter.
- Go away!

617
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,470
Peter, I'm bleeding.
Go away! I can't stop it.

618
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,677
I can't stop it.
They'll be here soon.

619
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,957
Where's my wife? Where's Susan?

620
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,235
- Where's Susan?
- She went to get Manny.

621
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,713
They haven't seen us yet. Don't move.

622
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,876
Peter, go!

623
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,352
My God.

624
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,871
Leonard?

625
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:24,870
Come on, Chuy. Come on.
That's all right. That's a good boy.

626
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,548
Stop it. It's OK. It's OK.
All right, Peter.

627
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,871
Come on. Get in. Get in, Peter.
Come on. Chuy, shh! Stop it!

628
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,712
Stop it!

629
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,715
Get in, get in, get in.

630
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,712
- Peter, what are you doing?
- I gotta stop them here.

631
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,075
Oh, no. Peter, don't do this!

632
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,629
Chuy! Stop it. Stop it.

633
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,591
Train!

634
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,592
We're here! Help!

635
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:59,114
Watch it. Got it. Go on.
Get out! Hurry! Go!

636
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,713
Fuck you!

637
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,638
Chuy?

638
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,635
My God.

639
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,756
It's the male.

640
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,396
You will not hurt him!
No! Turn around!

641
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,756
Turn around!

642
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,756
Come on.

643
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,474
Police and emergency crews
continue to work

644
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,075
in the aftermath of tonight's
explosion on the Lower East Side.

645
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,590
Hustle up! Team leader!

646
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,590
We swept the area twice. It's burnt.

647
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:46,717
Nothing could have survived
down there.

648
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,395
What about one of us?

649
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,991
I'm sorry, Susan.

650
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,637
I really am.

651
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,756
Shiny wire.

652
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,519
Mountain boots. Ten. Brown.

653
