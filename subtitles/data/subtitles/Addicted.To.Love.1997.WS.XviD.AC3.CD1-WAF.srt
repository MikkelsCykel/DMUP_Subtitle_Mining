00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,101
We're getting straight gammas...

2
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:18,809
...every half pulse at irregular intervals.

3
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:22,776
Let's move to right ascension 23 hours,
5 minutes.

4
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:25,029
What the hell is going on out here?

5
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,116
Alpha Orionis is going supernova.

6
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,616
Sometime in the next 100 million years.

7
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,081
-Thursday.
-Excuse me?

8
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,704
Thursday. lt's going supernova Thursday.

9
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,128
lf Alpha Orionis
Were about to go supernova...

10
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,465
...there would be silicon flashes...

11
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:42,006
...neutrino emissions....

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,218
Even in daylight,
We would be able to see....

13
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,221
You predicted this?

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,352
Excuse me, Sam, l know you're busy...

15
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:54,106
...but it's almost noon.

16
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:54,854
lt's almost noon.

17
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,107
lt's noon, everybody. Let's go!

18
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:57,983
Get in position! Let's go!

19
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,445
What?

20
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:07,077
What are you doing?

21
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:13,209
You're pointing the damn thing down!

22
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:16,338
Professor,
there's this other phenomenon...

23
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:18,714
...that Sam gives his priority to at noon.

24
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:20,385
Other priority? Now?

25
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:22,970
Every day.

26
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:24,391
What could be more important?

27
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:28,186
Actually, this event isn't strictly celestial.

28
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:22,831
"l love you

29
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:23,917
"He loved me

30
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,003
"Said the little blue man

31
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:29,131
"And scared me right out of my wits"

32
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,934
What is it?

33
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,315
Remember l told you they were
going to pick a teacher...

34
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,234
...to represent the district
at the school in New York?

35
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,196
New York? You?

36
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,280
That's great.

37
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,076
Don't look at me like that.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,411
lt's only two months.

39
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,497
lt's not like l'm going to the moon.

40
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,583
Two months is a long time.

41
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,043
You could come.

42
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:02,752
You know l can't.

43
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:03,962
You could take off work.

44
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:06,132
You just never
Want to get out of this town...

45
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:07,718
...and see the possibilities.

46
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,304
Everything l want to see is right here.

47
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:12,557
You, the sky.

48
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,478
l went to school
in that building right there.

49
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:19,983
l hung upside down on this jungle gym.

50
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:23,402
ln 20 years, l haven't moved an inch.

51
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:26,071
l fell in love with you on this junglegym.

52
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:33,372
You know how much l want to do this,
but l love you...

53
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:36,208
...so if you tell me to stay, l'll stay.

54
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,251
Stay.

55
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:42,535
Hey, Joe, hoist it up!

56
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,288
lt's got to be higher.

57
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,666
Much higher.

58
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:48,040
Higher.

59
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,495
Mr. Green, what are you doing here?

60
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:21,497
l was just on my way to the airport.

61
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,873
Come here, Sam.

62
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,169
ls Linda all right?

63
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:27,294
Listen to me.

64
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:30,632
Love can sometimes be
a very difficult thing.

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,218
Listen up.

66
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:35,595
"Dear Sam, this is the most difficult thing
l've ever done.

67
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:37,519
"l'm sorry l don't have the courage...

68
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,855
"...to do it face-to-face.

69
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:39,857
"l never planned this, Sam."

70
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,313
Mr. Green, what is this?

71
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:43,812
She left you. l'm reading her Dear John.

72
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:48,195
"lt's not you, Sam.
How can l make you understand?

73
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:49,864
"Your life is set.

74
00:05:49,946 --> 00:05:53,533
"You have your stars
and your friends and the town, but...

75
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,620
"...l feel like l'm just finding out...

76
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,455
"...What mine is all about.

77
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:02,085
"Oh, Sam, so many emotions
are surfacing as l write this."

78
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:03,879
Where is she, Mr. Green?

79
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,799
She thought it would be best
if you didn't talk for a while.

80
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:09,719
Let me finish this off.

81
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,013
"You're my best friend in the world, Sam...

82
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,433
"...so you must know
that this is the way l am.

83
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:16,268
"l can't help it. lt's my nature."

84
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,564
lt's true, son. She's nuts.

85
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,023
Where're you going? l'm not finished.

86
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,151
The best part's coming up.

87
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,480
Would you mind just checking?

88
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,323
Two blocks down and to the left.

89
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:04,366
Thanks.

90
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,076
l hope l'm doing the right thing.

91
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,953
l'm sure you are.

92
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,885
Honey!

93
00:07:57,968 --> 00:08:00,054
What is it?

94
00:08:00,138 --> 00:08:01,808
Can you get that?

95
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,141
l'm taking a nap.

96
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,602
l'm in the bath.

97
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,479
All right.

98
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,775
l hear you, God damn it!

99
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,860
Are you OK?

100
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,985
What's this table doing here?

101
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,988
This better be goddamn good!

102
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,286
You're ruining my beauty sleep!

103
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:19,994
Damn you! Lay off the buzzer!

104
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:22,296
Who is it?

105
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:25,963
No problem here.

106
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,007
Who is it?

107
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:32,649
Morning, everybody.

108
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,986
Morning, Linda. Morning, Tarzan.

109
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:39,031
We are...

110
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,826
...six minutes later than yesterday.

111
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:45,499
That's six, carry the two. Good.

112
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,506
Ah, there.

113
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:53,758
See that?

114
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:56,761
Medium smile, no teeth.

115
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:01,141
Don't forget the vase.

116
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:02,892
Got to get it perfectly centered.

117
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,438
There? No.

118
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,605
There? No.

119
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:11,693
One more. Why not?

120
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:17,741
Annoying, isn't it, honey?

121
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,828
Grin all you want, monkey man.

122
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,581
All you are is a passing meteor shower.

123
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,000
You'll be gone soon enough.

124
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:29,884
l feel sorry for you, you poor bastard.

125
00:11:48,946 --> 00:11:50,740
Carl, it's me, Sam.

126
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:52,074
Calm down. l'm fine.

127
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,785
l'm still in New York.

128
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:57,454
We're great. Linda's very happy.

129
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:00,625
We may stay a while. We're very busy.

130
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,294
There's lots to do.

131
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:07,592
Listen, Carl, l need you to sell my truck.

132
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,387
Whatever you can get for it.

133
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:12,847
l'm just a little short of cash right now.

134
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,027
l'm still here.

135
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,571
Listen, Carl,
there's something else l need...

136
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,741
...and Professor Wells
doesn't have to know about it.

137
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,181
Hey, Linda. How you doing?

138
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:28,478
You want to hear something funny?

139
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:31,858
l saw this on the news before l came out.

140
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:34,484
Fainting goats. l'm not making this up.

141
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:36,027
There's this breed of goats.

142
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,906
l don't know why, but...

143
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:41,326
...they faint at the slightest thing.

144
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:45,538
lf they hear a loud noise
or a gun goes off...

145
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,629
...they black out, fall right over,
one after the other.

146
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:58,763
l thought you'd like that.

147
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:19,190
Get off.

148
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,463
l don't even have a chart for that.

149
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,097
Get over here.

150
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:49,474
Gotcha!

151
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:03,838
Get away from here!

152
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:11,692
l'm warning you! l have a gun!

153
00:17:12,694 --> 00:17:13,776
Oh, shit.

154
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,675
What the hell are you?

155
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,404
What do you want? Who are you?

156
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:52,657
Excuse me. l asked a question.

157
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:55,203
l live here. What do you want?

158
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,583
l asked you a question.

159
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:08,091
Don't touch that.

160
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:10,136
Get away from that.

161
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,894
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

162
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,313
They'll hear you.

163
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:20,732
What are you talking about?

164
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,778
Your little Goldilocks and my ex-fiancé.

165
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:33,330
Hold it.

166
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:37,543
Are you saying that guy,
that thing over there...?

167
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,799
-What's your name?
-Mike.

168
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:46,804
-What's your name, Mike?
-Sam.

169
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:48,973
l'm Maggie.

170
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,059
l'll be staying here a while.

171
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:08,080
l sleep naked.
lt's the only way l'm comfortable.

172
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,247
So don't think of it as a come-on...

173
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,208
...because if you so much as breathe
in my direction...

174
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,626
...Will nail your Willy to that beam.

175
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:18,258
Don't mess with my stuff,
don't get in my way...

176
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,469
...and l'm sure we'll get along fine.

177
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:23,097
Nighty-night.

178
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:29,465
What is all this stuff?

179
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:31,634
Bugging equipment, cactus.

180
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,637
Like listening bugging?

181
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,387
Bugging who?

182
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,517
Take a wild guess.

183
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:43,189
Why would anyone want to do that?

184
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:44,857
'Cause l want to hear
What goes on in there.

185
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,068
Don't you want to hear
What goes on in there?

186
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:48,110
No, l do not.

187
00:20:48,195 --> 00:20:49,237
Why not?

188
00:20:49,737 --> 00:20:52,865
'Cause that would be
an invasion of her privacy.

189
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,994
Excuse me, Mr. Video.

190
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,581
That's not a video.

191
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,246
lt's a camera obscura.

192
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,667
lt's pure light.

193
00:20:59,834 --> 00:21:01,293
l'm not spying.

194
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,338
l just want to be with her.

195
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:05,674
That's completely different.

196
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,216
l know how you feel.

197
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,720
You want him back so badly
that you can't stand it.

198
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,637
lt's like your guts
are twisting around inside.

199
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,599
But bugging their apartment....

200
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,641
What?

201
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:18,729
l don't want him back.
l want him vaporized.

202
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:21,065
Extinguished!

203
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,650
When l'm done with him...

204
00:21:22,736 --> 00:21:25,612
...he'll be a twitchy little stain on the floor.

205
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:31,787
ls that what you're doing?

206
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:34,497
You're waiting
for her to leave him for you?

207
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:35,667
Absolutely.

208
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,126
Have you seen him?

209
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,919
He is irrelevant.
Linda and l are soul mates.

210
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:41,963
This is just a passing phase.

211
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,927
They're going to break up tonight.
l know it.

212
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:46,344
l'm listening.

213
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,847
l'm an astronomer.

214
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:50,975
lt's my job to find patterns in things...

215
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:53,603
...that seem completely random.

216
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,398
l found a pattern.

217
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,400
lt's all in the data.

218
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,611
The data.

219
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,529
This data.

220
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,908
"Mutual feeding activity."

221
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:07,243
lt's the number of times
that Linda and what's-his-name...

222
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,370
...feed each other.

223
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:09,122
You're counting.

224
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:11,040
Not just that. Everything.

225
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,129
Kisses, hugs, smiles, fights.

226
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,377
They fight?

227
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,588
Not yet.

228
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,883
Long looks, whispering, shouting.

229
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:20,050
They shout?

230
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:21,886
You're missing the point.

231
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,971
Tonight there's going to be a fight.

232
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:25,640
They are going to break up...

233
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,936
...and l'm going to be right here for her.

234
00:22:28,017 --> 00:22:30,101
Tonight this will all be over...

235
00:22:30,187 --> 00:22:33,105
...so you might as well start packing
your bags.

236
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:38,154
That is the most pathetic thing
l've ever heard.

237
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:40,239
l don't mean that trivially.

238
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:42,242
l'm a photographer.
l've seen a lot of things.

239
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:45,412
l once took pictures
of a man who ate his own legs...

240
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:47,251
...and you would be the black sheep
of that family.

241
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,378
What's your evil plan?
Squirt him with squirt guns?

242
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,088
Throw rotten strawberries at him?

243
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,588
You looked in my satchel?

244
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,094
Yeah. Call a cop.

245
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,971
You are a strange, tragic little man.

246
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:01,597
Say what you want.
Linda and l are in love.

247
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:03,351
Except for her boning my boyfriend...

248
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:04,685
...you guys are the perfect couple.

249
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,355
Listen, Catwoman, at the end of the day...

250
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:10,276
...she is coming back to me,
and we're going to be happy.

251
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,443
And where are you going to be?

252
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:14,864
All alone somewhere,
hatching some little revenge scheme.

253
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:19,870
Let me tell you something, Sam.

254
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:22,665
Listen very carefully. Are you listening?

255
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,210
The only way that girl
is coming back to you...

256
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,127
...is if a blast of semen catapults her...

257
00:23:27,212 --> 00:23:29,841
...across the street
and through the window.

258
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:34,054
l want you out.

259
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,056
Not going to happen.

260
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:37,390
l was here first.

261
00:23:37,474 --> 00:23:40,810
Put me down for half the rent
and get out of my face.

262
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:47,485
l wouldn't do that if l were you.

263
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:48,569
Why not?

264
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:50,071
You paid for it.

265
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:55,829
You stole my money.

266
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,873
You took everything l had to buy this crap?

267
00:23:57,956 --> 00:23:59,791
That was everything you had?

268
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:02,794
What the hell is that for, anyway?

269
00:24:04,003 --> 00:24:06,632
lt's pretty, Sam.

270
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:21,441
There we go.

271
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,696
You can hear them?

272
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:28,824
Are they talking?

273
00:24:31,201 --> 00:24:32,288
What about?

274
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,289
You wouldn't be interested.

275
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,126
Let me hear.

276
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:38,584
lt's wrong, Sam.

277
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,463
Just for a second.

278
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,591
l just want to hear her sweet voice.

279
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:43,675
Beg me.

280
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:44,802
Please.

281
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:47,764
Excuse me. Did you say something?

282
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:49,350
Please let me hear.

283
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,604
Oh, my God.

284
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:56,358
He's killing her.

285
00:24:56,522 --> 00:24:57,940
He's killing her, all right...

286
00:24:58,024 --> 00:24:59,902
...and she's loving every minute of it.

287
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:01,529
She's not like that.

288
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:05,288
She likes to make love quiet
and slow and gentle.

289
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:07,372
That girl of yours is a carnival ride.

290
00:25:07,454 --> 00:25:08,874
This is horrible.

291
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,123
This is worse than l'd imagined.

292
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:12,292
Want me to turn it off?

293
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:14,126
No. l need to hear it.

294
00:25:14,585 --> 00:25:16,385
How very brave.

295
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,145
He's making love to her in French.

296
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:31,354
You know, Sam,
French men are very small.

297
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:32,981
But not this guy.

298
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:34,318
lt's like Godzilla's tail.

299
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,944
He could take down Tokyo with that thing.

300
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:40,240
This has got to be
the longest orgasm l've heard.

301
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:42,283
You want your charts?

302
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:45,542
You enjoy making me suffer.

303
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:49,292
Help me get him, Sam.

304
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,134
Take the road less traveled.

305
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:52,629
lt'll make all the difference.

306
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,589
Forget it.

307
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,759
l will not get sucked into your nightmare.

308
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:59,179
Whatever.

309
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:02,143
l think l can get this in stereo.

310
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:09,190
Welcome to New York, spy-boy.

311
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,346
Slim Jim?

312
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:39,019
Let's see what Ken and Barbie
are having tonight.

313
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:42,772
Squab.

314
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:46,359
He marinates it for half a day
in a lemon-wine sauce...

315
00:26:46,444 --> 00:26:48,070
...and he braises it with sugar.

316
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:50,240
Please be quiet. l have to concentrate.

317
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:52,117
lt's happening tonight.

318
00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:53,868
Smells delicious.

319
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:55,745
l'll tell you a secret.

320
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:57,414
lt's not my recipe.

321
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,210
l met an old man, and he said...

322
00:27:02,503 --> 00:27:04,673
...only prepare it for the woman you love.

323
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,383
Later l found out he made it
for a party he catered.

324
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:10,055
Five hundred people.
He's just bursting with love.

325
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,099
You should go to his restaurant sometime.

326
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:13,640
Good food, good people.

327
00:27:13,726 --> 00:27:16,519
Wait. Take the spoon like this.

328
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:19,146
Just let her eat it, you maggot!

329
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:26,739
lt's the best thing l've ever eaten.

330
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:29,327
Will you shut up?

331
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:31,371
l love to watch you eat.

332
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:35,583
She hates having people watch her eat.

333
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:37,419
He's going down in flames.

334
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:38,838
Here it comes.

335
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:42,674
Oh, you know,
l heard the most amusing story.

336
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:46,011
There is this...What are they called?

337
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,556
Sheep.

338
00:27:47,638 --> 00:27:49,348
Yeah. A breed of goats.

339
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:52,102
And when they hear a sharp sound,
they fall over.

340
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:53,310
A sharp sound?

341
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:54,729
Yeah. Anything.

342
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,441
You clap your hands, and they fall over.

343
00:27:58,528 --> 00:27:59,986
That's my story.

344
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:02,070
They pass out
When they hear a sharp sound.

345
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:03,824
lt's true.

346
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:06,662
They just fall over on the ground.

347
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:08,664
That's my kiss.

348
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:11,499
That's my....

349
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:20,136
Oh, not the food.

350
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,937
l'll do it.

351
00:28:28,102 --> 00:28:29,980
l'll do whatever you want.

352
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:31,523
This has to stop.

353
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:33,941
l don't care about right or wrong anymore.

354
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,236
This must stop.

355
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:43,244
All you gotta do is nudge him.

356
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:45,540
Just graze him like that.

357
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:06,730
Sorry.

358
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:12,612
You're sorry?
You should be goddamned sorry.

359
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:15,658
You think you can trample
a person and say you're sorry?

360
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,159
Well, you can't.

361
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:20,495
You can't trample on somebody's
life and say, "l'm sorry."

362
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:23,124
There ought to be
something more you can say...

363
00:29:23,206 --> 00:29:25,419
...When you walk all over somebody.

364
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:28,295
And you're throwing food everywhere!

365
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:44,064
l think we took a detour
from the plan there.

366
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:45,817
l really hit him, didn't l?

367
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:48,110
You smacked him one, all right!

368
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:49,153
How'd it feel?

369
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:50,239
Great!

370
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:53,660
What is your plan?
What do you want to do?

371
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:56,078
l just want his dignity, that's all.

372
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:59,250
l want him penniless, hopeless,
loveless, finished off.

373
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,876
l just wish him very, very ill.

374
00:30:02,046 --> 00:30:03,504
How ill are we talking here?

375
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,675
l'm not saying l want him dead.

376
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,133
But, should that occur,
people die all the time.

377
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,261
Why should he be any different?

378
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:11,763
Just thinking on my feet, though.

379
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:13,434
l don't have to decide
the death part right now.

380
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:15,478
l can wait and see how l feel...

381
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,729
...once his dignity's a thing of the past.

382
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:18,979
Am l boring you?

383
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:20,857
Thank you, Anton.

384
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:26,071
Maybe l shouldn't have hit him.

385
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:28,366
He's just in love.

386
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,869
He's just in love, the same as me.

387
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,537
Define love.

388
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:34,582
Why?

389
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,544
Because every other word
out of you mouth is "love."

390
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,836
l'd like to know what it is...

391
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:40,633
...this magical ideal of yours. Define it.

392
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,717
Well, it's like, l don't know.

393
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,886
lt's like all your life you walk around...

394
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,889
...With this feeling of emptiness
in your stomach.

395
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,892
You feel completely hollow.

396
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:53,354
And when you're in love, you feel...

397
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:55,607
...not hollow.

398
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,486
lt's like without it, there's nothing.

399
00:31:00,655 --> 00:31:03,447
A shell. A cavernous emptiness.

400
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,076
Forget it. You can't define it.

401
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,664
When l was a kid, my father had this dog.

402
00:31:09,747 --> 00:31:12,710
lt started to get weak and sickly
so he took it to the vet.

403
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,502
The doctor examines it and says...

404
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:16,921
...a maggot must've laid eggs
in the dog's butt.

405
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:19,091
He says there's not much they can do.

406
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:22,597
The baby maggots have crawled up
and started to grow...

407
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,475
...and eventually they're going to eat
the dog alive from the inside out.

408
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,437
He says it should be put to sleep
because it's an old dog, anyway.

409
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,940
But Father won't do it.

410
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,441
He takes it home.

411
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,860
He puts it on the bed.

412
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,696
He starts to reach up into the dog...

413
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,991
...picking out the maggots with his fingers,
one by one.

414
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:43,911
lt takes him all night,
but he gets every last one.

415
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,332
That dog outlived my father.

416
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,837
That's love, Sam.

417
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:57,011
You're not that tough, Maggie.

418
00:31:57,177 --> 00:31:59,304
l can tell you're not that tough.

419
00:31:59,388 --> 00:32:02,850
And you can forget
about a career with Hallmark.

420
00:32:08,106 --> 00:32:09,357
Won't he miss the card?

421
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:11,109
He won't know what hit him
till the bill comes...

422
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:13,446
...'cause he only uses his platinum.

423
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:22,206
l'll just take everything in this whole area.

424
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:24,959
You know Anton's having an affair?

425
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:25,837
He is?

426
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,046
That's what Linda's going to think.

427
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,172
Where are you sending them?

428
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:30,424
To my Nana.

429
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,885
The old battle-ax
should get a kick out of this.

430
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,599
How much to put lipstick on the monkey?

431
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,057
ls that for you or for him?

432
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:39,603
l don't touch the monkey.

433
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:42,395
l don't want to have anything
to do with the monkey.

434
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,817
How's 40?

435
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:48,028
For 50 l'd strap on a garter
and wax her legs.

436
00:32:49,112 --> 00:32:50,196
Lovely lipstick, darling.

437
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,281
Honey, you can't be treating me this way.

438
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:54,118
We've known each other too long.

439
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,370
You can't even look me in the eye.

440
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:59,040
What? You're in love?

441
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:02,962
You're in love with that man?

442
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:05,884
That man could never make you happy.

443
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,680
What the hell is that? Shit!

444
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,512
Good God! Kiss him, baby!

445
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:15,059
Get this goddamned monkey off my back!

446
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:23,826
Give that man a hand!

447
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:25,696
OK, that's fine.

448
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,612
No problem.

449
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:31,878
Greta thanks you. l thank you.

450
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:47,984
Hello, sweetheart.

451
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:50,188
Here we go. The target's home.

452
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:52,393
You know bankers.

453
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,398
They want to know every little thing.

454
00:33:55,478 --> 00:33:57,603
What do they know
about the restaurant business?

455
00:33:57,685 --> 00:33:59,486
Are we packed?

456
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:02,532
Hey, why don't we forget
about the Hamptons...

457
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:04,416
...and spend the weekend in bed?

458
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:05,778
There, that look!

459
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,201
She sees it.

460
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,748
Stay with her.

461
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:13,078
Go back to her, Sam!

462
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,596
Stick to her.

463
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:15,718
Relax.

464
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:18,251
Anything you wanted to tell me?

465
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:20,255
What?

466
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,855
What's that on your collar?

467
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,430
Turn it up. l can't hear them.

468
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,270
Oh, that.

469
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,316
You'll never believe this.

470
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:33,198
l'm walking through washington Square...

471
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,485
...and there's this stupid man.

472
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,981
You know, some guy with a monkey.

473
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,195
A street performer?

474
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,739
That son of a bitch, yeah.

475
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,866
The monkey jumps on me
and won't get off my back.

476
00:34:41,948 --> 00:34:43,542
You're kidding.

477
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:47,246
The people all around, they are laughing.

478
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,127
And the monkey is kissing me, kissing me.

479
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,336
l think it peed on me. lt stinks.

480
00:34:52,502 --> 00:34:54,971
What is she laughing at?

481
00:34:55,756 --> 00:34:56,970
l don't know.

482
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,972
What do you think of the story?
l'll show you what l think.

483
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
l'll get you.

484
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:15,908
Let's forget about the Hamptons.

485
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,869
lt's going very well, don't you think?

486
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:21,956
Drink up, buddy,
'cause tonight we're going in.

487
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,790
There they go.

488
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,753
We want to go to the Long lsland railroad.

489
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:32,718
ldiot never even changed the lock.

490
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:39,060
Close it.

491
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:47,485
lt's so much smaller than it looks on TV.

492
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:15,727
ln the couch.

493
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:16,602
What?

494
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:18,314
ln the couch. Don't make it obvious.

495
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:20,273
-You're kidding.
-Just do it.

496
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,735
Why were you wearing them?

497
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:25,321
Authenticity.

498
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:47,554
What are you going to do?

499
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,806
Receipts.

500
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,850
Why are we whispering?

501
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,393
l don't know.

502
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,719
Mine.

503
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:55,926
Mine.

504
00:38:05,936 --> 00:38:07,065
Mine.

505
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,815
Mine.

506
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:13,112
Perfection, yes?

507
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:16,408
Voilà.

508
00:38:22,497 --> 00:38:24,040
This is comfortable.

509
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:32,342
This is what you wear to walk about...

510
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,636
...With everything swinging freely.

511
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,685
Look at me. l am so fabulous.

512
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,312
l am so beautiful.

513
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:44,441
Witness my matted chest hairs.

514
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:46,318
They are nice, no?

515
00:38:55,786 --> 00:38:57,498
What do you think?

516
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:03,378
You look....

517
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,990
Look at this.

518
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:43,411
l love you, Linda.

519
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,539
l hate you, Anton.

520
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,298
l got to make the bed.

521
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,641
Sure. Right.

522
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:19,245
Can you clean the kitchen?

523
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:21,121
We should get out of here.

524
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,667
l think we should talk.

525
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:27,086
Nothing to talk about.

526
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:30,674
Yes, there is. Something happened.
l would like to talk about it.

527
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:32,384
Nothing happened, Sam.

528
00:41:32,593 --> 00:41:34,595
OK? Nothing happened.

529
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:36,513
l know what you're going through.

530
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:38,098
l'm going through the same thing.

531
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:40,436
Get this straight, pal. l'm not like you.

532
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,937
l don't care what you're going through.

533
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:44,524
lf l thought you and l were alike
in the most trivial way...

534
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:46,943
...l would tie a rope around my neck.

535
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:21,983
l'm sorry.

536
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:43,717
Last night wasn't us, Maggie.

537
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:46,683
l know. l'm glad you know.

538
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:50,516
Maybe we should just,
l don't know, call it a day.

539
00:42:57,731 --> 00:43:01,074
You know what's going to happen to her,
Sam?

540
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:05,286
He's going to make her feel
like she's the only woman in the world.

541
00:43:05,368 --> 00:43:07,912
When he looks at her,
it'll be just like a kid...

542
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:11,920
...looks at a Christmas tree
all lit up and shiny.

543
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:17,005
For the first time,
she'll feel like she's really been seen...

544
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:18,678
...and really loved.

545
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:21,010
And then...

546
00:43:23,597 --> 00:43:25,934
...and then three weeks later...

547
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,020
...she'll find a pair of panties in the couch.

548
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,773
Then she'll learn that she was
just a steppingstone.

549
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:33,777
That he was just using her to get a visa.

550
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,745
lt'll change her, Sam.

551
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,507
l understand.

552
00:43:54,593 --> 00:43:57,178
You know what's always bothered me?

553
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,891
l can't see the side of her face.

554
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,560
l can never see the left side of her face...

555
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,772
...When she's standing here
in the kitchen...

556
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:07,939
...because of these things in the window.

557
00:44:08,024 --> 00:44:10,735
So help me move this over a little bit.

558
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:15,575
Good?

559
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:17,159
A little more.

560
00:44:19,577 --> 00:44:20,579
Good.

561
00:44:37,682 --> 00:44:38,600
What?

562
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:41,147
l saw the sign about the job.

563
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,815
l don't want a half salt shaker on the table.

564
00:44:43,899 --> 00:44:45,568
You go and refill it immediately.

565
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,902
Pardon.

566
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:49,778
ll faut tout leur apprendre!

567
00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:51,909
Nothing here for you. Go.

568
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:53,491
Why?

569
00:44:58,122 --> 00:45:00,207
Do l need a reason in my own restaurant?

570
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:01,502
Of course not.

571
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,170
l don't like your face, that's why.

572
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:04,630
Just go.

573
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:19,814
Wait.

574
00:45:21,274 --> 00:45:22,944
Why did you do that?

575
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,696
Why did l do what?

576
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,905
The flowers.
Why did you move it like that?

577
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:29,284
l wanted them to be
in the middle of the table.

578
00:45:29,366 --> 00:45:30,538
Why?

579
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:32,746
Because it was...

580
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:35,417
...it was just something that l had to do.

581
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:39,504
Perhaps at heart you seek perfection, no?

582
00:45:39,713 --> 00:45:41,841
Yes, perhaps l do.

583
00:46:00,111 --> 00:46:01,696
Almost done?

584
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:07,370
Almost.

585
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,623
Good work.

586
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:14,085
Why don't you stop for a moment?

587
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:24,055
l know who you are.

588
00:46:24,223 --> 00:46:27,643
lt took me a little while, but l figure it out.

589
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,982
Dry off your hands.

590
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:39,281
lt was you who attacked me that day.

591
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:41,618
Couldn't see your eyes,
but l don't forget a face.

592
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:44,704
You didn't put an address down
on your application.

593
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,207
You are homeless, aren't you?

594
00:46:48,332 --> 00:46:49,500
That's OK. Don't be ashamed.

595
00:46:49,585 --> 00:46:51,253
You know, l was hungry myself once.

596
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:53,464
l would see a rich man, a man l envied...

597
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:55,675
...l would want to strangle him.

598
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:58,010
But that's not the way l found.

599
00:46:58,096 --> 00:46:59,848
You must better yourself.

600
00:47:00,012 --> 00:47:01,515
Don't be ashamed.

601
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:04,311
Give me your hand. Come on.

602
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:08,524
l like a man who fights for what he wants.

603
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:10,610
But if you ever mess with me again...

604
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,989
...l'll rip out your eyes and rape your skull.

605
00:47:14,488 --> 00:47:16,324
Excuse my French.

606
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:18,493
Was a good punch, huh?

607
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,121
Solid.

608
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:21,873
lt was nice.

609
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:24,584
So you did all his dishes
and got punched in the face.

610
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:25,792
What was your thinking there?

611
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,589
l'm missing something.
What was your plan?

612
00:47:29,048 --> 00:47:31,717
No plan. l just wanted to face him.

613
00:47:32,093 --> 00:47:34,262
l wanted to be
in the same room with him...

614
00:47:34,346 --> 00:47:35,805
...to talk to him.

615
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:38,433
ln my mind, he was like a god.

616
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:40,519
Now what do you think?

617
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:43,106
Well, it's not like he's God God anymore.

618
00:47:43,187 --> 00:47:47,026
He's more like a volcano god or a sea god.

619
00:47:47,402 --> 00:47:49,446
One of those sub-gods.

620
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:52,283
Maggie, l think he likes me.

621
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:56,830
One thing, though.

622
00:47:57,372 --> 00:48:00,584
He said something
about having sex with my skull.

623
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:02,084
He says that to everybody.

624
00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:03,921
Don't worry about it.

625
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,382
Sorry.

626
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,301
l don't like the sound of it.

627
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,303
l don't like the image that it conjures.

628
00:48:11,387 --> 00:48:13,892
l can't honestly say l blame you, Sam.

629
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,900
So l let go with my hands...

630
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,945
...and l fell off the top
of the junglegym face-first...

631
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,322
...and l broke this tooth in half.

632
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:30,159
l'm laying on my back,
blood all over my face...

633
00:48:30,243 --> 00:48:32,705
...the kids are yelling,
the teachers are freaking out...

634
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:35,124
...and l look up, and there she is.

635
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:36,875
She's just looking down at me...

636
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,546
...With this worried little smile on her face.

637
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:43,551
l swear to God, when l saw her,
the pain just went away.

638
00:48:43,925 --> 00:48:45,678
Once l took pictures
of a bunch of ducklings...

639
00:48:45,762 --> 00:48:47,513
...Who imprinted on a gardener.

640
00:48:47,598 --> 00:48:49,348
They thought he was Mama...

641
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:51,226
...and they used to chase him around
all day...

642
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:54,187
...While he drove around
on his lawn mower.

643
00:48:54,773 --> 00:48:55,982
That's exactly what it feels like.

644
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:58,233
lt's like she's branded on my brain.

645
00:48:58,318 --> 00:48:59,986
What happened to this guy...

646
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:02,280
...is that one day he forgot
the ducks were there.

647
00:49:02,363 --> 00:49:05,785
He put the mower in reverse,
chewed them to pieces.

648
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,371
Don't you know any happy stories?

649
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:12,626
There he is.

650
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:18,215
That's him!

651
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:20,341
Let's get him!

652
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,227
Our work is done.

653
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:39,908
Midgets coming out of the blue.

654
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,534
l had to protect myself with one of them.

655
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,286
Midgets coming out of the blue?

656
00:49:44,369 --> 00:49:47,709
Yeah.
Little children shooting perfume at me.

657
00:49:48,796 --> 00:49:50,252
From their guns.

658
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,170
Perfume from their guns?

659
00:49:52,337 --> 00:49:54,174
Yeah. Water guns?

660
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,423
Squirt guns?

661
00:49:55,507 --> 00:49:57,259
Yeah, l think. Squirt guns.

662
00:49:57,343 --> 00:49:58,553
Spooky, huh?

663
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:00,852
Wait, the loaf, l think it's burning.

664
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:03,391
Look at him trying
to weasel his way out of it.

665
00:50:03,473 --> 00:50:04,686
He didn't do anything, Sam.

666
00:50:04,773 --> 00:50:08,026
Anton,
don't you think it's a little peculiar...

667
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:11,358
...that little children would be shooting
perfume at you?

668
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,279
l thought it was something
American kids do.

669
00:50:14,362 --> 00:50:16,530
A fad, l don't know.
We should have some salad.

670
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,875
lt's very expensive perfume, Anton.

671
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:20,919
l used to wear that perfume.

672
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,372
Good call, Sam!

673
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:34,372
