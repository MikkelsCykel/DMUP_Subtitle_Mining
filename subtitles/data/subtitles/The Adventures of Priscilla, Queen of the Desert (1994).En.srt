<i>Hey lady</i>

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,800
<i>You lady,
cursing at your life</i>

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,640
<i>You're a discontented mother</i>

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,440
<i>and a regimented wife</i>

5
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,760
<i>I've no doubt you dream about</i>

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>the things you'll never do</i>

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,400
<i>But, I wish someone had've talked to me</i>

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,840
<i>like I wanna talk to you...</i>

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>Ooh, I've been to Georgia and California</i>

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,600
<i>and anywhere I could run</i>

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,440
<i>I took the hand of a preacher man</i>

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>and we made love in the sun</i>

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>But I ran out of places
and friendly faces</i>

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,840
<i>because I had to be free</i>

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,840
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

16
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,640
<i>but I've never been to me</i>

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,160
<i>Please lady, please lady,</i>

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,680
<i>don't just walk away</i>

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,760
<i>'Cause I have this need to tell you</i>

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,160
<i>you why I'm all alone today</i>

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,960
<i>I can see so much of me</i>

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>still living in your eyes</i>

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>won't you share a part
of a weary heart</i>

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,200
<i>that has lived million lies...</i>

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,600
<i>Oh, I've been to Nice
and the Isle of Greece</i>

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,560
<i>while I've sipped champagne on a yacht</i>

27
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,480
<i>I moved like Harlow
in Monte Carlo</i>

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
<i>and showed 'em what I've got</i>

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>I've been undressed by kings</i>

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>and I've seen some things
that a woman ain't supposed to see...</i>

31
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:24,181
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

32
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:34,282
<i>but I've never been to me</i>

33
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:41,283
<i>I've been to paradise</i>

34
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,284
More!

35
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:51,385
- Lace!
- Put it away, sweetie...

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,960
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,720
Oh, that was fucking charming,
you gutless pack of dickheads!

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
- Oh fuck off you talentless dog!
- What was that?

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,720
- Show us your pink bits.
- No, I don't think I will.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
- Now do you know why this
microphone has such a long cord?
- Why?

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,600
So it's easily retrieved after
I've shoved it up your arse!

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,720
Christ almighty!

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,480
What the fuck's going on
out there tonight?

44
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,880
Are you hurt?

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,400
Alright, which one of you
bitches shat on my dress?

46
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,840
Oh Tick darling, it's for you.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,200
- Hello?
- Ding dong!

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,200
Avon calling.
Howdy sunshine.

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,320
Long time no hear.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
- Where?
- Emergency Ward A

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,580
- Mr Belrose?
- Yes?

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,120
So, how about it?

53
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,521
Yeah?

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,160
Bernadette, it's Tick.

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,840
Sorry to call you so late, but I...

56
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,520
Hey, are you okay?

57
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,800
No, I'm not.

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
What's the matter?

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,920
Trumpet just died.

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,960
The Lord is my shepherd;

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,000
I shall not want.

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,720
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures:

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,440
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,880
He restoreth my soul:

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,760
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for His name's sake.

66
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death;

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,040
I will fear no evil:
for Thou art with me;

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,480
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

69
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

70
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,360
Thou anointest my head with oil;
my cup runneth over.

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life;

72
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,360
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
It's not fair.

74
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
I've spent half my life
and all my savings

75
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,680
trying to snag a
sympathetic husband

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,360
and the selfish little shit
goes and dies on me.

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,720
Twenty-five years old

78
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,120
and he goes and
slips over in a bathroom.

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,200
He didn't slip.

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,000
He was peroxiding his hair at home again
and he asphyxiated on the fumes.

81
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,680
I've got to get some space.

82
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,240
I've been asked to do
a show out of town...

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,120
- That's nice.
- Why don't you come with me?

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,440
I'll need some help, and I think
we could both use the break.

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,200
You're not wrong.  Where is it?

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Alice Springs.

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,000
You've got to be fucking joking.

88
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,480
Wo-man is a

89
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,360
unique range of
speciality facial products

90
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,280
designed for the more...
heavy-duty woman in us all.

91
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,880
Now, this week... excuse me.

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,280
Hello.

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
How long is the run?

94
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,640
Four weeks.

95
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,120
Equity Minimum, two shows a night,
accommodation included.

96
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,040
I can't just sit around here
crying all the time.

97
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,880
Jesus. My mascara keeps running;
I look like a raccoon.

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,560
Good girl. That's the spirit.

99
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Here's hoping the desert's
big enough for the two of us...

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,400
Umm... three of us.

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,840
A desert holiday,
Let's pack the drag away.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,200
You take the lunch and tea,
I'll take the ecstasy.

103
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Fuck off, you silly queer!
I'm getting outta here.

104
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,240
A desert holiday
Hip hip hip hip hooray!

105
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,760
Why?

106
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,640
Why not?  Look, he's turned into
a bloody good little performer.

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
That's right.
A bloody good little performer.

108
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,960
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

109
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,200
I thought we were getting
away from all this shit!

110
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,040
Two's company, three's a party,
Bernadette my sweet.

111
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,960
We're unplugging our curling
wands and going bush, Felicia.

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,120
Why would you possibly want to leave all this
glamour for a hike into the middle of nowhere?

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
- Do you really want to know?
- Desperately.

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, ever since I was a lad,
I've had this dream.

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,680
A dream that I now, finally,

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,720
have a chance to fulfil.

117
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,640
- And that is?
- To travel to the centre of Australia,

118
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,240
climb King's Canyon,
as a queen,

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,200
in a full length Gautier sequin,
heels and a tiara.

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Great, that's just what
this country needs.

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,240
A cock in a frock on a rock.

122
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,120
Oh, get back in your kennels,
both of you!

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,280
Now, the first thing
we have to work out

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
is how the hell
we're going to get there.

125
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,561
Ta daaaa!

126
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,040
What do you think?

127
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,760
When do we have to
return it to the school?

128
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,720
- We don't. We own it.
- What?

129
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,000
I met some nice Swedish tourists

130
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,600
called Lars, Lars and Lars,

131
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
and coaxed it out of them
for ten thousand bucks.

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,720
- But we can't afford it.
- Well, that's right.

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,720
Mummy, maybe a trip
to the outback

134
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,160
would help me get over this
little phase I'm going through.

135
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,680
And you never know, I might meet
some lovely country girl.

136
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,400
I hereby Christen this
budget Barbie camper...

137
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,360
"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert."

138
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,760
That's got to be the
understatement of the century.

139
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,760
<i>Together</i>

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,800
<i>We will go our way</i>

141
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:34,801
<i>Together</i>

142
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,360
<i>We will leave some day</i>

143
00:09:37,361 --> 00:09:38,261
<i>Together</i>

144
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,240
Mum!

145
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,141
<i>Your hand in my hands</i>

146
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:42,642
<i>Together</i>

147
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
<i>We will make the plans</i>

148
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,520
We are here today to see
off a very brave woman

149
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,400
who will attempt to
cross the continent alone.

150
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,760
On behalf of all our sponsors...

151
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:55,761
<i>Together</i>

152
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,840
<i>This is what we'll do</i>

153
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,520
<i>Go west</i>

154
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,460
<i>Life is peaceful there</i>

155
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,061
<i>Go west</i>

156
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,240
<i>Lots of open air</i>

157
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,341
<i>Go west</i>

158
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,640
<i>Where the skies are blue</i>

159
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,120
Ladies...

160
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,040
start your engines!

161
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,041
<i>Go west</i>

162
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,520
<i>Sun in wintertime</i>

163
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:17,521
<i>Go west</i>

164
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,520
<i>We will do just fine</i>

165
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:21,521
<i>Go west</i>

166
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,360
<i>Where the skies are blue</i>

167
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,361
<i>Go west</i>

168
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,120
<i>this is what we'll do</i>

169
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:28,121
<i>Together</i>

170
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
<i>We will love the beach</i>

171
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:32,601
<i>Together</i>

172
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>We will learn and teach</i>

173
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,201
<i>Together</i>

174
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,720
<i>Change our pace of life</i>

175
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:39,721
<i>Together</i>

176
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,920
nick nack paddywack, give the dog a bone
this ol' man came rolling home

177
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:46,321
This old man, he played two,
he played nick nack with my shoe

178
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:50,722
- with a nick nack paddywack...
- Oooh, please. Oh, Gimme a break.

179
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Four fat trannies
working on the wall.

180
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,160
And if one fat tranny
should accidentally fall.

181
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, my darling, Clementine.

182
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,880
How long have we been on the road?

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,160
Four-and-a-half hours.

184
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, I've got a splitting
headache already...

185
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,000
Happy hour!

186
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,720
- 'Mother's Ruin' pour moi!
- Long Island tea.

187
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,760
And a Stoli and tonic for me.

188
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,360
- Ha, ha, ha, ha. 'Ol Stupid cow.
- Yeah, well listen to this one!

189
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,480
After we did the Abba show,
Kevin had one of those

190
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,400
- liposuction penis enlargements.
- He didn't?

191
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
You know what they do?

192
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,200
They syphon all the fat
out of your love handles

193
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,720
and actually inject it
into your wing wang.

194
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,721
Er, yucky, ter.

195
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,880
I suppose it gives a whole new meaning
to "cracking a fat" though, doesn't it?

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,720
Oh, listen to yourselves.

197
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,480
You sound like two fat slags
at a pie bake off.

198
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
Well, your contribution to the conversation

199
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,240
hasn't exactly made headlines, Bernice.

200
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Gee, poor Kevin's dick.

201
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,840
There can't be much room down there with
his brain taking up so much space already.
Hee, hee, hee, hee

202
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,720
No. I'll join this conversation
on the proviso

203
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,160
that we stop bitching
about people,

204
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,000
talking about wigs,
dresses, bust sizes,

205
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,840
penises, drugs, night clubs,
and bloody Abba.

206
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,680
Doesn't give us much to talk
about then, does it?

207
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,560
Hey, can you confirm a rumour for me?

208
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,580
Is it true that her
real name's Ralph?

209
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:30,881
Ssshhh!

210
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,920
How do you like your
little boys, girls?

211
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,680
You don't have to answer
that if you don't want to.

212
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,480
Oh, My God!

213
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,840
What is this? Outback
with Benny Hill?

214
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,400
Just leave mine outside
the door at about 8 a.m.

215
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,360
along with orange juice
and toast please.

216
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,200
Oh, why certainly Madame! And would
you like vegemite or jam with that?

217
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,480
Ah, knock knock.
Room service.

218
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Can't you read the sign? Do Not Disturb!
Please come back in the morning.

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh ha ha girls.
Open the door.

220
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,440
- Goodnight Bernice.
- Goodnight Mitzi.

221
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Open the fuckin' door!

222
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,840
Okay, if you don't open
the door I'm going to sing.

223
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,400
Fine, you asked for it.

224
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,280
I don't care if the sun don't shine

225
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,640
I get my lovin' in the evenin' time,

226
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
When I'm with my baby

227
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
It's no fun when there's sun aroun',

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Cause I get goin'
when the sun goes down

229
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,320
And I meet my baby

230
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,400
That's when we kiss
and kiss and kiss

231
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,360
And then we kiss some more

232
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Don't ask how many times we kiss...
- Night John boy.

233
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm seriously falling asleep.

234
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
No, it's your shift and
you're going to stick to it.

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,240
Serves you right for
staying out all night. Slut.

236
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, I'm not going to make it.

237
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,000
- I don't care if the sun don't shine...
- Oh, fuck off grandma.
- Are you alright?

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,400
Me? Yeah. I'm fine.
I'm just thinking.

239
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,240
Sorry. SHIT!

240
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,360
What is it?

241
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,520
Perhaps we should have flown.

242
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
Bzzz! Wrong, but thanks for playing.
Anyone else?

243
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,560
No. Witchety grub. Your turn.

244
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,360
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with 'R'.

245
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
- Rectum.
- No.

246
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,200
- Ring pirate?
- No.

247
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
Road?

248
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,840
Alright. That's it! What's the matter with you?

249
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,200
- Nothing darling.
- Don't 'darling' me, darling.

250
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Look at you. You've got
a face like a cat's arse.

251
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
- Come on. Fess up.
- Just worried about the show, that's all.

252
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,200
- Like, we haven't done any rehearsals yet and...
- We've got two weeks for Christ's sake.

253
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,360
That's plenty of time to rehearse.
Now what is your problem?

254
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,000
It's not a problem. I just want this show
to be good. That's all. It's got to be good.

255
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,440
How the fuck did you get
this job Mitzi, my darling?

256
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,760
I mean, who is this fish who runs this bloody
hotel in the middle of nowhere anyway?

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,480
- Your mother?
- No, my wife.

258
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,040
Ooooh! Don't tell me you've got an ex-boyfriend
tucked away out here somewhere.

259
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,280
No. My wife. I'm married.

260
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,440
And when the joint bank account
ran dry after a couple of years

261
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
I guess I preferred her
wedding ring to mine.

262
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,560
So no drama.

263
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,760
We swapped and
called it a day.

264
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,920
This is getting too weird.

265
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,880
You and a woman.

266
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
I mean, what did she used to do for kicks?

267
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Put a bucket on your head
and swing off the handle?

268
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,880
You know there are two things I don't like
about you Felicia... Your face.

269
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,320
So how about shutting both of them.

270
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,680
Well at least this explains
your abysmal batting average, Mitz.

271
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,200
I often wondered why your
dance card was so empty.

272
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,800
I take it you never
got a divorce then?

273
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,680
Well girls, what can I say?

274
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,760
Here's to a secret very well kept.

275
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,360
- Shame it's not going to
stay that way, isn't it?
- Mmmm.

276
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,640
Got any more little surprises
you'd like to share with us?

277
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,840
Haven't got any kids stashed away
out there as well have you?

278
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,480
Look. I haven't lied about anything.

279
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,600
After six years I get a phone call
out of nowhere screaming for help.

280
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,480
And Christ knows I owe her a couple of favours.

281
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,680
I'm sorry that I never told you.

282
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm not sorry that you're here.

283
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
Don't worry about it, dolls.

284
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,080
I'm as jealous as all hell.

285
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
What?

286
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,360
So, was it a big wedding?

287
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
Get lots of prezzies, did you?

288
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,640
- I just wish I was old enough to have
been there.
- Oh ha ha!

289
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,520
I would have bought you a lovely matching set
of hers and hers bath mats, or something.

290
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,000
- Oh, Give it a rest!
- Not on your life!

291
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,960
Oh, imagine! Mitzi the magnificent
and her blushing bride.

292
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,520
Mowing those lawns must have been
murder on your heels though.

293
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,080
All right Felicia, that's enough.

294
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,120
Let's put some money in that
seething cesspool mouth of yours.

295
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,000
If I win this game, you will
never mention my wife,

296
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,520
ever, in my presence again. OK?

297
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,920
- And if I win?
- Name your price.

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,760
Well now, what would I like more than
anything else in the whole, wide world?

299
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,720
Snap, better be quick.

300
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
What the fuck am I doing?

301
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,640
Take that bloody frock off, Felicia!
Don't make it any worse than it is.

302
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,800
You think I'm going to let you walk away
with all the attention? No chance.

303
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,360
Come on girls,
let’s go shopping.

304
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,120
Oh, for Christ's sake...

305
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,520
I just adore these hats!

306
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,720
You have got to be kidding.

307
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,080
Welcome to Mario's Palace.
Come in. Come in.

308
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,800
What can I do for you?
Would you like a room, Madame?

309
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,000
Subtle.

310
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,760
Oh tackorama!

311
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,720
Who the hell does all the
painting around here?

312
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,520
Someone with no arms or right foot
by the look of things.

313
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,720
Oh, for goodness' sakes,
get down off that crucifix.

314
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
Someone needs the wood.

315
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,040
What have we here?

316
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,080
What fun!
Baby bottles of booze.

317
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,360
Oh! Gather round girls,
Let me show you a trick.

318
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
You drink the gin...

319
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,920
Fill the bottle up with water
and put it back in the fridge.

320
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,680
Va t'em vous.
What about the scotch?

321
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,560
That's where the complimentary tea bags
come in handy.

322
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,080
- Very clever.
- Cheers girls.

323
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,520
And congratulations, Mitzi darling.
You did it.

324
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,880
One lap of the Broken Hill
main drag in drag!

325
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,840
That'll teach you to take on the
Fairmont Boys School snap champion.

326
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Here's to being
off that fucking bus.

327
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Chookers!

328
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,680
So, all dolled up
and nowhere to go.

329
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,560
Well I sure as shit am not going to sit in here all evening.

330
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm in.

331
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,600
Oh, alright.

332
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,400
Here's hoping they have
a decent Cocktail Bar.

333
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,720
Hello.

334
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,640
Could I please have a Stoli and tonic,

335
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,240
a bloody Mary

336
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
and a lime Daiquiri please?

337
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,680
Well, look what the cat dragged in!

338
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,000
What've we got here, eh?

339
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,920
A couple of show girls, have we?

340
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,640
Where did you ladies
come in from?

341
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,160
Uranus?

342
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,520
Could I please have a...?

343
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,440
No! You can't have... you can't have nothing!

344
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,760
We got nothing here
for people like you. Nothin'!

345
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Now listen here you mullet.

346
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,960
Why don't you just light your tampon
and blow your box apart,

347
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,520
because it's the only bang
you're ever going to get sweetheart.

348
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,280
Now what could be more soothing

349
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,920
than coming home after
a hard day's work down the mine

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,680
to the woman in us all.

351
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,480
Now, don't send any money, okay...

352
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,400
Shit,

353
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,680
all I can see is
female impersonators.

354
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,960
This has got to be a first.
Nobody has ever out drunk old Shirl before.

355
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
Where did you learn to
throw 'em back like that?

356
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,000
That's our girl Bernadette.

357
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,840
I just knew that stumbling around the pub circuit
with 'Les Girls' for 200 years

358
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
must have taught her something.

359
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,240
- You're a bloody marvel, Bernie.
- Bernadette please.

360
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,800
- What was that?
- My name isn't Bernie.

361
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,080
She said her name isn't Bernie...

362
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
It's Ralph.

363
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,520
Come on.

364
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,120
What did you call me?

365
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,240
What did you call me what?

366
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,360
What did you call me
back there, in the bar?

367
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,920
Sorry. Ralph.

368
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,920
You fucking idiot!

369
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,360
Oh, the fuck!

370
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Oh, Fuck! Get off me! You fucking...

371
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,440
...a fucking thing.
It's only my fucking head.

372
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,840
At least the bump on your head
is bigger than your prick.

373
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,080
Why don't you just knick off,
you stupid old bitch?

374
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,200
Oh, piss off, you little faggot.

375
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,200
- ...if you're so bloody cool...
- If your mouth were as big as your dick

376
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,920
you wouldn't have any problem.

377
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,960
- Good morning.
- Morning.

378
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,160
It's funny, you know?

379
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
No matter how... tough
I think I'm getting...

380
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,560
it still hurts.

381
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
Hope it still works.

382
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,280
Don't have much call
for it out here.

383
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,280
- Where you blokes from?
- Uranus.

384
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh, good.

385
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,400
There.

386
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,120
- Left.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

387
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,400
If we stick to the sealed road,
we'll be at it for at least another two days.

388
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
Take the short cut.

389
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,400
One more push,
I'm gonna smack his face so hard

390
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,080
he'll have to stick his toothbrush
up his arse to clean his teeth.

391
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,640
Just lay off.

392
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,080
I told you not to use the R word
and what did you go and do?

393
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,320
I was only having a bit of fun.

394
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,520
Fun? What else do you do for amusement?
Slam your fingers in car doors?

395
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,400
- What's the point?
- I like seeing people get hot headed, okay?

396
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,640
- It gives me a kick.
- Is it true when you were born...

397
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,200
the doctor turned around
and slapped your mother?

398
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,880
What sort of bent childhood
did you have, Adam Whitely?

399
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:48,081
Adam, Adam...

400
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,680
Come in here, boy!

401
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,360
Come and sit over here.

402
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
Would you like to have some fun
with uncle Barry?

403
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,400
We're gonna play a special game,

404
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,600
but you can't tell anybody.

405
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,120
ever, ever, ever, okay?

406
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,280
Now what I want you to do
is put your hand down here

407
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,640
and pull very gently, okay?

408
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,080
Very gently.

409
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,320
That's good.

410
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
Jesus Christ, Adam!

411
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,160
Get help!

412
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:36,240
Adam, Uncle Barry's ping pongs
are caught in the drain.

413
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,200
- Get Mummy.
- No!

414
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,400
What do you mean "no"?

415
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,560
Never, ever, ever, ever.

416
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,760
You know the best part?
The best part, Mum was out playing golf

417
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,440
and the dirty old fuck
was stuck there for about seven hours.

418
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,280
And I thought they were small and wrinkled
before they got in the water.

419
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,920
Hey, I got a joke.
Who wants to hear a joke?

420
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,200
Come on Bernice. It's so funny,
you'll laugh so hard

421
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,440
your lashes will curl all by themselves.

422
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,880
Do tell us your hilarious joke.

423
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,520
Well, once upon a time, many moons ago, there was

424
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,160
a famous bunch of Indians
called the Fuckarwee Tribe.

425
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,720
And one day, the son of the great
Indian chief says to his father,

426
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,080
"Dad, why is my friend
Little Hawk called 'Little Hawk'?"

427
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,320
And his father says...

428
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,560
"Why do you ask, Two Dogs Fucking?"

429
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,200
That's not the end of the joke.
So anyway,

430
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,360
Back to me.

431
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
- Jesus!
- What's happening?

432
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,840
Umm, I don't know.

433
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,880
Oh my God...

434
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,600
Oh, Felicia... Where the Fuckarwee?

435
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,200
Shit, shit, shit!

436
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,680
Well, I've had a look around
and I think we can safely assume

437
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,680
that I now know less about motors
than I did when I first lifted

438
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,280
that... bonnety thing.

439
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,040
Now what?

440
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,320
Let's just not think
about it for the moment

441
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,800
and eat brekky, shall we?

442
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
Oh, that's a novel idea.

443
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,720
Let's stuff ourselves to death.

444
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,560
Imagine the headlines...

445
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,640
"Whales beach themselves in the outback."

446
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,440
- "Mystery Broomsticks Dead in Drag..."
- There's no point in walking back.

447
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,840
The only life I saw for the last million miles
were the hypnotised bunnies

448
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,320
- and most of them are now wedged in the tires.
- Well, somebody'll drive past for sure.

449
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,480
We'll keep the fire burning.

450
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,160
Yes, and toast marshmallows and chill
champagne for when they arrive.

451
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,080
What if they don't drive past?

452
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,040
Look, you're not helping here.
Just eat your hormones.

453
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,760
- Hell. Why didn't we stick to the main road?
- What difference does it make now?

454
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,400
You got us into this
Antony Belrose,

455
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,160
And I suggest you start thinking
about how to get us back

456
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,600
or I don't fancy your chances of
ever trying to be a husband again.

457
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,280
Jesus, what are
we gonna do?

458
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
We're gonna start off with a little facelift.

459
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,520
Nothing like a new frock
to brighten up your day.

460
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,120
Purple?

461
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,200
It's not purple, it's lavender.

462
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,560
- What do you think?
- It's nice...

463
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,760
in a hideous sort of a way.

464
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,680
Where are YOU going?

465
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,800
If you think I'm going to sit around
watching Picasso

466
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,200
take on the
public transport system,

467
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,120
you've got another thing coming.

468
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,720
I'll be back with the cavalry

469
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,360
in a couple of hours.

470
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,040
There goes a transsexual,
last seen heading south.

471
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,420
- We called her Bernie
but her real name was...
- Adam!

472
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,920
I was petrified

473
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,440
Kept thinking
I could never live

474
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,400
Without you by my side

475
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,440
But then I spent
so many nights

476
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Thinking how you did me wrong

477
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,960
I grew strong

478
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,520
I learned how to get along

479
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,080
And so now you're back

480
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,880
From outer space

481
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,280
I just walked in
to find you here

482
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,480
Help! Help!

483
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,520
- What's that Pa?
- What?

484
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,160
Up there, ya nong.
Looks like a woman.

485
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,600
Help!

486
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,200
Oh, thank God.

487
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,520
Thank you.

488
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,240
I can't tell you
how grateful I am.

489
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,840
...face, I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

490
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,320
I should have...

491
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,640
You fuckin' beauty!

492
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,480
Shit.

493
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,200
Bernie, I never thought
I'd be so glad to see you.

494
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,000
I can't say the same.

495
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,360
I was just drawing up the will.

496
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Come and meet our saviours.

497
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,880
Tony, Adam, this is
Mr and Mrs. Spencer.

498
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,320
Hello.

499
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,120
No! Stop!

500
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,160
Oh shit.

501
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,160
Oh, for goodness' sakes
look at yourself Mitz.

502
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,360
How many times do I have to tell you
green is not your colour?

503
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,080
Do you think about Trumpet much?

504
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:12,360
No. Trumpet was just a nice kid
who had a thing about transsexuals.

505
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,680
Lots of people do.
Sort of bent status symbol, you know.

506
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,840
"Did you know my girlfriend
used to be a boyfriend?"
That sort of thing.

507
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,760
Always good for a supper invite.

508
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,560
Still, it was better than nothing.

509
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,280
Nothing, nothing for miles.

510
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,720
Can you hear the drums Fernando?

511
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,200
I've said it before
and I'll say it again...

512
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,920
No more fucking Abba!

513
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,960
Okay, if we have the time,
we may as well put it to good use.

514
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,600
Come on girls. Off ya snatches.
Rehearsal time.

515
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,520
OK? Two bobs to start with, alright?.

516
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,480
Boring.

517
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,920
Ready?

518
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,680
No, I did this years ago.

519
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,080
You did it so beautifully and,
Darling, you do so well.

520
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,960
Come on.
Right, from the top.

521
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,360
One, two.

522
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Go on now, go

523
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,320
walk out the door

524
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,240
Just turn around now

525
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,760
You're not welcome anymore

526
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,320
Weren't you the one
who tried to break me with goodbye?

527
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Did you think I'd crumble?

528
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,720
Hello.

529
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,240
Nice night for it.

530
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
I think we just crashed a party.

531
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,280
No, come on. You'll be right.

532
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,800
Here, welcome to my office.
Have a seat.

533
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,000
Bernice, I don't know what could have
possibly possessed you to wear that to a corroboree.

534
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,440
Shut your face.

535
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,760
Bravo!

536
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,240
Fabulous!

537
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,160
Well girls,
I guess it's our turn.

538
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,040
<i>First I was afraid</i>

539
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,800
<i>I was petrified!</i>

540
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,560
<i>Kept thinkin'
I could never live</i>

541
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,640
<i>Without you by my side</i>

542
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
<i>But then I spent
so many nights</i>

543
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
<i>Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

544
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,720
<i>And I grew strong</i>

545
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,640
<i>And I learned how to get along</i>

546
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,600
<i>And so now you're back</i>

547
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,520
<i>From outer space</i>

548
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,880
<i>I just walked in
to find you here</i>

549
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,520
<i>With that sad look
upon your face</i>

550
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,720
<i>I should have changed
that stupid lock</i>

551
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,640
<i>I should have made you
leave your key</i>

552
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,000
<i>If I had known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me</i>

553
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,280
<i>Go on now go</i>

554
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,240
<i>Walk out the door</i>

555
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,280
<i>Just turn around now</i>

556
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,920
<i>'cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

557
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,960
<i>Weren't you the one who tried
to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

558
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,680
<i>Did you think I'd crumble?</i>

559
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,200
<i>Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no, not I!</i>

560
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,800
<i>I will survive!</i>

561
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,800
<i>For as long as I know how to love</i>

562
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,680
<i>I know I'll stay alive</i>

563
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,520
<i>I've got all my life to live</i>

564
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,440
<i>And I've got all my love to give</i>

565
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,160
<i>And I'll survive</i>

566
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:26,161
<i>I will survive</i>

567
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:28,062
<i>Hey hey!</i>

568
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,640
Hey, take a look at that.

569
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,880
I've got an idea...

570
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,080
<i>It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart</i>

571
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,920
<i>Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart</i>

572
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,920
<i>And I spent oh so many nights
just feelin' sorry for myself</i>

573
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,160
<i>I used to cry
but now I hold my head up high</i>

574
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,920
<i>And you see me</i>

575
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,760
<i>Somebody new</i>

576
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,000
<i>I'm not that chained up little person</i>

577
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,720
<i>still in love with you</i>

578
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,880
<i>And so you felt like dropping in
and just expect me to be free</i>

579
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,720
<i>Well, now I'm saving all my lovin'
for someone who's lovin' me</i>

580
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:18,221
<i>Go on now, go!
Walk out the door!</i>

581
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,840
So, you actually make money
by dressing up like a woman?

582
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,520
Oh sure. You can make a fine living
in a pair of heels.

583
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,440
Why, Alan? You wanna job?

584
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,680
Oh, if only THIS dress could talk.

585
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,400
You know, sometimes I wonder
where I get my taste from.

586
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,360
Definitely not my mother.  Oh well.

587
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,760
Serves me right for letting her buy me
all these awful clothes.

588
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,440
What's this?

589
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,800
That, my darling, is my most treasured possession
in the whole wide world.

590
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,520
But what is it?

591
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,880
Well, a few years ago,
I went on a pilgrimage backstage

592
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,960
to an Abba concert,
hoping to grab an audience

593
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,240
with Her Royal Highness, Agnetha.

594
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Well, when I saw her ducking into the ladies loo,
naturally I followed her in.

595
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,640
And after she'd finished her business
I ducked into the cubicle

596
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,960
only to find she'd left me a little gift,

597
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,880
sitting in the toilet bowl.

598
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,800
What are you telling me?

599
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,560
This is an Abba turd?

600
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,440
I know what we can do with this...

601
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,840
- Are you right?
- Hang on!

602
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
OK! Go!

603
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,400
There!

604
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,560
Afternoon,

605
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,400
what seems to be the problem?

606
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,400
What a nice dog.
What's its name?

607
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,960
Herpes.

608
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,800
If she's good,
she'll heal [heel].

609
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,680
Things get pretty quiet around here.
We're a bit starved for entertainment.

610
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,600
Glad we could oblige.
How does it look?

611
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,160
Well, your gas tank's
chock-a-block full of crud.

612
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,080
Travelling on a rough road
on a low tank

613
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
chucked it all up
into the motor.

614
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,360
- Your fuel line's blocked and your injectors are stuffed.
- So does that mean you can fix it?

615
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,880
In the short term.

616
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,600
What you blokes need
is a new gas tank.

617
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,680
I don't suppose you have one
lying around.

618
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,440
No. Sorry.

619
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,040
I could pick one up in Coober Pedy in about
a week. When do you have to be in Alice?

620
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,320
Six days.

621
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,840
Well, we can clean it out
and hope for the best.

622
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,880
It might make it. We won't know
unless you give it a try.

623
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,120
Refreshments!
Lemonade here I make.

624
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,120
That's very nice darling.
Please, go back inside.

625
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,000
Lemonade here I make.
Lemonade for guests.

626
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,520
No darling please.

627
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,600
I made chocolate crackle.

628
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,560
Thank you.

629
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,060
We put cream on?

630
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,080
No no, it's face cream.
For face.

631
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,480
Bob, Cynthia, thank you.

632
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,600
- I love lamb with meringue.
- Thank you for the company.

633
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,800
Like I said earlier, new faces are
pretty hard to come by out here.

634
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,560
- If you don't mind me asking, what are you doing
off the highway?
- Ah, now that's a bloody good question.

635
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,920
Glad you bothered.

636
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,480
Don't get your type
out here very often.

637
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,640
- Me like to sing too. Me like...
- Yeah, pretty damn quiet.

638
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,560
Thought of opening a video business for a while,
but I suppose we've got to wait to get television first.

639
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Me perform for you.
Me dance too.

640
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,680
My wife used to be in the
entertainment business.

641
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,000
- Yeah. You perform here?
- You're thinking of performing here?

642
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,200
I mean you've got to be here
at least another night.

643
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:50,080
Ummm, the thought hadn't
really crossed my mind.

644
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,920
Well why not? I could have
a word to Wally in the pub.

645
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,920
Everybody'd love it.

646
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,960
Well I'm not sure our show'd
go down too well out here.

647
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,560
If you don't mind me asking,
what kind of cabaret do you do?

648
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,520
We dress up in women's clothes

649
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,600
and parade around mouthing
the words to other people's songs.

650
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,240
You mean sort of like those...
what do they call 'em?  - 'Les Girls'?

651
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,760
Oh yeah, I've seen them. Way back in Sydney
when I was a young bloke. Fantastic.
Just terrific.

652
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,040
Bob, you are looking

653
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,080
at probably the most famous
'Les Girl' ever produced.

654
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,640
You're kidding me?

655
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,880
Give me a break!
I was never that famous.

656
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,240
- I'm not joking.
- What?

657
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,880
I wouldn't really have seen you.
That must have been 30 years back.

658
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,000
- Oh you'd be surprised.
- Me perform for you.

659
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,400
- Me sing.
- No Cynthia.  You no perform.

660
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
They perform not you.

661
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,200
Well, a real live 'Les Girls' show?

662
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,200
Right, this calls for a celebration.

663
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,360
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- Oh, shut ya twat.

664
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,920
Our frocks were the sensation
of Broken Hill, remember?

665
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,200
There was a K-Mart in Broken Hill.
At least they knew what a frock was.

666
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,480
Christ, you should see what this woman is wearing.
It's not a frock. It's a piece of corrugated iron.

667
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,520
- Can I come in?
- Only if you're single.

668
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,320
- Oh, you look incredible.
- Where did we find this guy?

669
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,480
Oh, you just keep dishing out the compliments, Bob.
Flattery will get you everywhere.

670
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,880
- Now where's that lovely wife of yours?
- She's at home.

671
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,680
- She's not allowed in the pub any more.
- Really? Why?

672
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,600
She's got a problem with alcohol.

673
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,320
Every time she gets in the pub she makes
a complete fool of herself.

674
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,360
Oh, I know how she feels.

675
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,160
Well, we're all waiting.
Are you ready?

676
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:55,240
Bob, we're having second thoughts.

677
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,120
You can't back out now.
Every man and his dog's out there.

678
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
They're not chained up
by any chance?

679
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,200
Oh, you blokes...
sorry. You girls.

680
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,680
Look, you'll be fine.
Take my word for it.

681
00:50:39,981 --> 00:50:43,081
<i>There's nothing more
than I'd like to do</i>

682
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:47,082
<i>than take the floor
and dance with you.</i>

683
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:55,083
<i>Keep dancing!
Let's keep dancing...</i>

684
00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:01,284
<i>Shake it, shake it!</i>

685
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:07,985
<i>Shake it, shake it!</i>

686
00:51:07,986 --> 00:51:11,986
<i>Shake ya cool thing,
shake ya cool thing, yeah yeah.</i>

687
00:51:13,187 --> 00:51:16,087
<i>Show 'em how you do it, now
show 'em how you do it now</i>

688
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:19,188
Yeeeaaah!!

689
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,040
What the hell's going on?

690
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,920
She's not, is she?

691
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,680
Oh, you can't do that
with a ping pong ball.

692
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,800
You wanna bet?

693
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,840
- I'm going!
- Darling, don't go, there's nothing we can't work out.

694
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,400
- You no good man.
- Don't be silly.

695
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,440
You want good wife,
you be good husband.

696
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,920
Darling don't go.

697
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,440
I no like you anyway.

698
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,800
You got little dingaling.

699
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,720
Some days you just
shouldn't get out of bed.

700
00:53:55,800 --> 00:54:00,200
In my opinion, you should wait here
until I get back from Coober Pedy with a new gas tank.

701
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,600
But then again, you listened
to my last opinion.

702
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,080
Forget it, Bob.
It's time we made a move.

703
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,480
I'm just a gifted amateur round here.

704
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,560
There's no way
a nice frock and a catchy tune

705
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,080
can compete with three ping pong balls,
two cigarettes and a pint of beer.

706
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,480
If we break down we break down.
I'll play it safe and stick to the main drag.

707
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,880
Pardon the pun.

708
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,440
Well, goodbye Bob.
Thanks for a very educational stay.

709
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,760
Yes I'd do anything to be able
to open a bottle like that.

710
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,800
Bernadette, it's certainly been an honour
meeting a member of 'Les Girls'.

711
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,720
And may I say it has been an honour
to meet a gentleman.

712
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,960
Believe me Bob, these days gentleman
are an endangered species.

713
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,640
Unlike bloody drag queens
who just keep breeding like rabbits.

714
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,280
Sayonara

715
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,160
Bob? Fancy a free ride to Coober Pedy?

716
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,520
Now listen Bob.
Let's get one thing straight.

717
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,360
We may wear the frocks around here,
but that doesn't mean you wear the pants.

718
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,480
Right, where'll I sleep?

719
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,840
Oh, anywhere that takes your fancy.

720
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,720
The roof'll do me fine.

721
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,280
Thank you, Bob,
I don't know what to say.

722
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,000
That's alright. I might as well
get there a few days earlier.

723
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,320
A bit of R and R.
God knows I need it.

724
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,480
May I ask you a personal question?
I mean if you don't mind.

725
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,920
Sure.

726
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,560
Why? Why do you...
You know...

727
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,320
You mean the $64.000 question?

728
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,720
That's the girl. Now,
don't tear the wrapping paper.

729
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,520
Just slide the ribbon off and
we can see what Santa’s brought you!

730
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Here it comes now.

731
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,720
What is it?

732
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,040
It's a... it's a...

733
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,160
cement mixer.

734
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,360
Have you been changing
the cards around again, Ralph?

735
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,360
So I guess I had
no choice in the matter

736
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,560
Oh for fuck's sake! Watch where
you're driving, you stupid bitch!

737
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,760
- What're you trying to do, fucking kill me
or something?
- My fault!

738
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,640
Sorry Bob.
I thought it was Bernadette.

739
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,280
One, two, three.
Two, two, three. Three, two, three.

740
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,240
Now you're getting it.

741
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,400
- Who taught you to waltz?
- My wife.

742
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,240
Oh, how sweet. You and the Mrs
down at Arthur Murray's

743
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,240
every Tuesday night practising
your little hearts out.

744
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,640
- Makes me want to sick up.
- Married?

745
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,520
Yes, married.

746
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,200
We have only recently discovered
young Anthony here bats for both teams.

747
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,680
I do not.

748
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,920
- Ah, so we're straight.
-No.

749
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,960
Oh, we're not! So we're
a doughnut puncher after all.

750
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,840
-No.
- Then what the Hell are we?
- I don't fucking know.

751
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,560
What the fuck's that?

752
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,240
Good evening.

753
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,120
Nice night for it.

754
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,000
Oh, ok. Goodnight then.

755
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,880
What a rude woman.

756
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,960
And that's the power steering pump,
and that's the radiator fan.

757
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,880
- How interesting.
- Simple.

758
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,680
Hey! Who wants first bath?

759
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,000
I won!

760
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,320
Can I help you, Maam?

761
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,600
Okay, turn 'er over.

762
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,600
<i>I don't care if the sun don't shine.</i>

763
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,360
<i>I get my lovin' in the evenin' time,</i>

764
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,240
<i>When I'm with my baby</i>

765
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,160
<i>It's no fun with the sun aroun',</i>

766
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,600
<i>But I get goin' when the sun goes down</i>

767
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,480
<i>And I meet</i>

768
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,440
<i>My baby</i>

769
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,240
<i>That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss</i>

770
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,960
<i>And then we kiss some more</i>

771
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,320
<i>Don't ask how many times we kiss</i>

772
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,200
<i>At a time like this, who keeps score?</i>

773
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,101
<i>So I don't care if the sun don't shine</i>

774
00:59:35,102 --> 00:59:37,902
<i>I'll get my lovin' in the evenin' time,</i>

775
00:59:37,903 --> 00:59:43,003
<i>When I'm with my baby.</i>

776
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,360
That's it over there.

777
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,240
It's an okay room with a shower.

778
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,960
- Bags first!
- Is hot water all you can ever think about?

779
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,680
No. A shower, a comfortable bed
and a nice meal will do me fine.

780
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,680
If you think I'm going to crawl
into the sack and watch television,
you've got another thing coming.

781
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,680
Now you blokes watch your back.
This is a pretty tough little town.

782
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,920
They get up in the morning, they go down a hole,
they blow things up and then they come up again.

783
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,040
- That just about sums it up.
- Oh fabulous.

784
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,600
You're welcome to hang out with us, Bob,
if you've got nothing better to do.

785
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,080
Yeah, I'm meeting some of the boys at
the old drive-in for a booze up, like the old days.

786
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,960
Wow, I want to go with Bob. I want to go to the boys' club.

787
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,680
You'll come and have supper with us, Adam Whitely,
or you'll stay in your room by yourself and watch TV.

788
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,240
He's a good man, our Bob.

789
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,520
Yeah, not my type though.

790
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,760
Oh, don't come the
raw prawn with me!

791
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,640
I can spot the fluttering
of a beaded lash from 300 paces.

792
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,600
Oh, get out!
He's far too old.

793
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,960
Mind you, so am I.

794
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,640
Did you catch that mail order bride?

795
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,500
Why did he marry her?
I'm dying to ask...

796
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,120
Oops! Sorry.

797
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,360
Don't worry about it.

798
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,760
You're the world's best husband

799
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,200
and given the chance you'd probably be

800
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,040
a perfectly good father too.

801
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,000
Do you really think so?

802
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,640
Why? Are you thinking
about children?

803
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,400
Yes, as a matter of fact.

804
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,600
Umm, do you have "The Texas Chainsaw Mascara"?

805
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,360
Ever wanted kids?

806
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,160
Sure, but I've learned
not to think about it.

807
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,480
Do you think an old queen's
capable of raising a child?

808
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,800
Well, Elizabeth did
a pretty good job.

809
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
Prince Charles is a wonderful boy.

810
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,000
Edward's still a bit of a worry.

811
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,000
And what happens
if they turn out like Adam?

812
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,760
You stuff them back in
and ask for a refund.

813
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,640
Stupid little shit.

814
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,880
I dread to think
what he's up to.

815
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,120
Hello,

816
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,120
I'm new in town.

817
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,400
No kidding.

818
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,760
Could I have a bloody Mary please.

819
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,960
It's a beer or nothing, sweetheart.

820
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,120
Well, I'd better have a beer then.

821
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,560
Cheers.

822
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,280
What are you all looking at?

823
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,400
I'm sorry.

824
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,480
Didn't mean to stare.

825
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,040
We don't usually
get women down here.

826
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,920
Oh, so what do women do around here
besides watching videos?

827
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,840
Well, well, well! Look who we have here...

828
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,840
You know that bloke do you?

829
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:21,920
No. So, who's going to
show me the sights?

830
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,080
It would be my pleasure.

831
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,200
So how about it?

832
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,040
Well, I suppose a fuck's
now out of the question...

833
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,960
Get her, Frank!

834
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,040
Come on boys. Who wants
to see my map of Tasmania?

835
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,520
So I never got a chance to tell my parents
what a wonderful childhood I'd had.

836
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:02,520
They never spoke to me again
after I'd had... the chop.

837
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,720
I think I have something to tell you.

838
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,120
Oh shit!

839
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,800
Get after her!

840
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,160
Okay fellas, let's not forget
how to treat a lady.

841
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,600
You fucking freak!

842
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,880
Hold him down.

843
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,120
- Spread his legs.
- No, please!

844
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,200
Frank, Stop!

845
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,200
- What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- You mean you do know this cocksucker?

846
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,480
Get off, him you mongrel!

847
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,360
He was joking, OK?
Now you leave the little bugger alone!

848
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,720
Get out of there, Bob!

849
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,240
Cut it out, Frank.

850
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,640
Put the faggot down and get the fuck
out of there, Bob, or you'll be next.

851
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,480
- Frank.
- Get out of there!

852
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,880
Stop flexing your muscles,
you big pile of budgie turd!

853
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,760
I'm sure your mates'd be much more
impressed if you just go back to the pub...

854
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,080
and fuck a couple of pigs on the bar.

855
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,280
Bernadette, please.

856
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:20,320
Bernadette! Well I'll be darned!
The whole circus is in town.

857
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,720
Well I suppose you want a fuck too, do ya?
Come on Bernadette.

858
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,560
Come and fuck me.
That's it.

859
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:31,020
Come on. Come and fuck me.
Come on.

860
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,200
There, now you're fucked.

861
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:47,800
You stupid bloody idiot.
Drugs for Christ's sake.
Well, well, three cheers for you.

862
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,360
I hope you're bloody well happy now.
Stupid fuckwit!

863
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,680
It's funny.

864
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,920
We all sit around
mindlessly slagging off...

865
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,080
that vile stink-hole
of a city.

866
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:10,400
But in some strange way
it takes care of us.

867
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,120
I don't know if that ugly wall
of suburbia has been put there to

868
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:18,400
stop them getting in
or us getting out.

869
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,720
Come on.

870
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,560
Don't let it drag you down.

871
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,440
Let it toughen you up.

872
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,280
I can only fight
because I've learnt to.

873
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,080
Being a man one day and a woman the next
is not an easy thing to do.

874
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,840
- Sorry, I can't help you.
- No worries, mate.

875
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,800
Well, are we bunny hopping
all the way to Alice?

876
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,000
No good. He says the man to help
is a fair way out of town.

877
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,360
- Like how fair?
- A couple of hundred clicks fair.

878
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,720
No matter. I got nothing
else to do today.

879
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,040
Let’s get out of here.
Come on, Adam.

880
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,080
We are out of here.

881
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,160
Some things are said
in the heat of the moment.

882
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,480
I'm sorry I got angry
with you last night,

883
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,360
although I dare say,
you deserved it.

884
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,200
Anyway, that's enough of that.

885
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,200
You know this is quite an experience,
sitting here with you now.

886
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,640
I can quite safely say...

887
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,840
that I think your taste in
clothing is absolutely terrible,

888
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,640
because you can't
say a word, can you?

889
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,600
Oh, this is great fun.

890
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,720
We're going to have a problem finding
this guy with a tank, aren't we?

891
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,480
- Why do you say that?
- Well, because he's not out here.

892
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,960
Oh, he's out here.
He's in Alice.

893
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,560
Well, I can't go back
to Coober Pedy for a while.

894
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,880
Not the most popular bloke
in the world back there anymore.

895
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,380
- Hello.
-Hello!

896
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,920
- Who are you?
- I your wife.

897
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,480
- Best I be going home then.
- No, you not going. I coming too.

898
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,920
I your wife. See, I your wife.

899
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,440
Silly girl.

900
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,440
Should have done her
homework better.

901
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,840
She thought I was from Sydney.

902
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,720
Why in God's name
did you bring her home?

903
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,000
- She was me wife.
- Couldn't you sell her off?

904
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,400
Oh, the party's over
everyone. It talks.

905
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,920
You can't keep a good bitch down.

906
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,120
What time do you reckon
we'll be in Alice Springs?

907
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,720
Late tomorrow arvo?

908
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,840
And how long do you think
you'll be staying?

909
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,520
I don't know.
A couple of days maybe.

910
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,000
Hey, a big day for you tomorrow, eh?.
We all get to meet the Mrs.

911
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,960
I saw that smile Felicia.
One word,...

912
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,640
one derogatory word and I'm
taking you back to your mate...

913
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,720
in Coober Pedy.

914
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,240
Look, please everyone.
Tomorrows going to be a little tough.

915
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,520
- Please don't make it any harder than it has to be.
- We're only teasing.

916
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,160
We won't open our mouths until you give
the word. Then it's open season.

917
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,240
Oh well, time for bed.

918
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,480
I gotta look good for the wife
in the morning. Come along Adam.

919
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,920
Time for your beauty sleep.
Come on.

920
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,600
Will you two be, umm, joining us?

921
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:09,760
Umm, I just thought I'd have one for
the road. How about you, Bob?

922
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,800
Sounds good to me.

923
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,280
All right then.
See you in the morning.

924
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,680
Goodnight.

925
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,880
-Another piece of cake, Bob?
- Ah, no.

926
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,120
So, tell me about you.

927
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,080
Can't complain.
Life's a lot simpler now.

928
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,000
Spent thirty years
wandering around the world...

929
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,880
only to find that I was better
off where I started.

930
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,640
Not much, but it's my turf.

931
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,320
Oh, shit!

932
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:05,321
Adam,
Adam...

933
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,240
- What?
- Guess who didn't come home last night?

934
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,520
I've waited all my life for this!

935
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,520
Bernice has left her cake
out in the rain.

936
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,520
My fucking back's killing me!

937
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,960
I need a crap.

938
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,680
- Look, do you want me to go in?
- No, I'll go.

939
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,000
Ah, excuse me, sir,
you can't park your bus here.

940
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,920
Are you planning
on staying at the hotel?

941
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,120
Ah sorry. Could you direct me
to Marion Barber please?

942
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,640
- We're the Cabaret act from Sydney.
- Oh right, right, yeah...

943
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,080
- ...well, just go in through to reception
and they'll take you right through.
- Thanks.

944
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,000
No worries. It's alright.
Lenny, these are the drag queens.

945
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,160
Come on Bob. Let's go
try on your new frock.

946
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,640
G'day.

947
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,600
Just over there by the back bar.

948
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,080
Thanks.

949
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,880
No, those three kegs
didn't arrive.

950
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,600
I need them today.
Not tomorrow, but today.

951
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,960
You're a doll.
What an arsehole.

952
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:58,680
Aaaaaaah, my God, husband, husband!

953
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,000
- It's so good to see you.
- Hiya wife.

954
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,600
- You're a day late; I was just gathering
the search party. Where are the others?
- Oh they're outside.

955
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,800
- You've lost weight, you rotten old queer.
- Well, it's about fucking time.

956
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,000
I can finally get into that old one-piece
of yours. You know, the one with the sun flowers.

957
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,480
- You still got that? What the hell do you do with it?
- Oh, the "Poseidon Adventure" routine...

958
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,880
You know, Shelley Winters.

959
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,440
Where is he?

960
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:46,320
Benj, do you remember Tick?

961
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,700
Hello Tick.

962
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:03,001
Hello.

963
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,360
Where is the bloody bar?

964
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,680
Mr Belrose?

965
01:15:12,681 --> 01:15:13,381
Yes?

966
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:16,760
Congratulations. It's a boy.

967
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,960
Shit!

968
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,360
- You OK?
- What's the matter?

969
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,080
- Help!
- Oh my God.

970
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,400
For Christ's sake, Mitzi,
why didn't you tell us?

971
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:32,240
Why the hell did you have
to shock me like that?

972
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,560
This lump on my head
is getting bigger by the second.

973
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,280
I'm about to make my
Northern Territory debut looking like

974
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:42,280
a fucking Warner Brothers cartoon character
has hit me over the head with an iron.

975
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:45,720
- I think you look more like a Disney witch myself.
- Oh shut your face, Felicia!

976
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,840
At least I don't look like somebody
has tried to open a can of beans with my face.

977
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,960
I'm sorry girls, I couldn't stand the thought
of you bagging me in the bus for two weeks.

978
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,800
- Anyway what difference does it make now?
- About two inches to my head for one.

979
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,520
Did you get a good look at him?
He's got my profile that's for sure.

980
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,960
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- I hate to be practical here...

981
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,640
but does he know who you are?
I mean, does he know what you do for a living?

982
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:08,480
Well, he knows he has a father in the
show business/cosmetics industry.

983
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,160
- Oh Lord, I don't understand.
- No, you DON'T understand...

984
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,040
- so stop trying to. It will be fine.
- It had better be.

985
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,800
Hello! Oh, stop wearing out that mirror.

986
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,160
- You always knock before you enter?
- Always! Why?

987
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,800
You haven't got anything
to hide in there have you? Ah ha ha.

988
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,440
Alright girls,
you're on in ten minutes.

989
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,800
Sweetheart, you've been on
ever since you were born.

990
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,560
- The word's out, we've got a big crowd.
- Like how big?

991
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,720
- A full house.
- Where's Benj?

992
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,240
Safe and sound asleep in bed.
Don't you worry about a thing.

993
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,240
Okay, my little powder puff?

994
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,600
- Can I come in?
- Now THERE'S a gentleman.

995
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,080
Of course you can, Bob.

996
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,040
My aunt Minnie in here?

997
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,200
Don't mean to barge in.
Just want to wish you luck.

998
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,160
- Thank you Bob.
- Thanks

999
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,320
To make up for
what happened last time.

1000
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:58,200
Thank you. That's so thoughtful.

1001
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,120
Alright girls. Let's get
this show on the road.

1002
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:04,680
You, out. That's a ten minute
curtain call. Good luck.

1003
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,360
That's quite a wife you've got there Mitz.
What does she do in her spare time?

1004
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,600
Sand back the hulls of
oil tankers with her tongue?

1005
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,280
She sure is something.

1006
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,600
- Chookers girls!
- Watch my jaw!

1007
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:21,440
- Be careful with my head.
- Aren't we fabulous?

1008
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

1009
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,240
Lasseter's Casino
in Alice Springs presents...

1010
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,920
Miss Mitzi Del Bra,
Miss Felicia Jollygoodfellow

1011
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,720
and Miss Bernadette Bassinger...

1012
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,920
The 'Sisters of the Simpson Desert'...

1013
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,040
<i>Meeting Mr Right,
the man of my dreams</i>

1014
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,880
<i>The one who shows me true love
(or at least it seems)</i>

1015
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,760
<i>With brown cocoa skin
and curly black hair</i>

1016
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,920
<i>It's just the way he looks at me
that gentle loving stare</i>

1017
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,440
<i>Finally you come along</i>

1018
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,320
<i>The way I feel about you
it just can't be wrong</i>

1019
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,800
<i>If you only knew the way
I feel about you</i>

1020
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:11,400
<i>I just can't describe it</i>

1021
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,320
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1022
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,440
<i>Right in front of my face</i>

1023
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,920
<i>My feelin's can't describe it</i>

1024
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:22,121
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1025
01:18:22,122 --> 01:18:23,922
<i>Right in front of my face</i>

1026
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,480
<i>And I just cannot hide it</i>

1027
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:30,081
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1028
01:18:30,082 --> 01:18:31,882
<i>Right in front of my face</i>

1029
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:34,683

1030
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:37,784
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1031
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:39,585
<i>Right in front of my face</i>

1032
01:18:39,686 --> 01:18:42,086
<i>And I just cannot hide it</i>

1033
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,440
<i>It seemed so many times
he seemed to be the one</i>

1034
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,240
<i>But all he ever wanted
was to have a little fun</i>

1035
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,280
<i>But now you've come along
and brightened up my world</i>

1036
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,960
<i>In my heart I feel it,
I'm that special kind of girl</i>

1037
01:18:57,861 --> 01:19:00,861
<i>Finally you come along</i>

1038
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:04,662
<i>The way I feel about you

I feel about you</i>

1040
01:19:09,664 --> 01:19:13,264
<i>I just can't describe it, oh no no </i>

1041
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:16,065
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1042

<i>And I just cannot hide it</i>

1053
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:53,140
<i>Finally...
Oh, finally....yeah, yeah</i>

1054
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,941
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1055
01:20:32,942 --> 01:20:34,742
<i>Right in front of my face</i>

1056
01:20:34,743 --> 01:20:37,143
<i>My feelin's can't describe it.</i>

1057
01:20:37,444 --> 01:20:40,244
<i>Finally it has happened to me</i>

1058
01:20:40,245 --> 01:20:42,345
<i>Right in front of my face</i>

1059
01:20:42,346 --> 01:20:44,746
<i>And I just cannot hide it</i>

1060
01:20:45,147 --> 01:20:57,947
<i>Finally, oh yeah, yeah</i>

1061
01:20:57,048 --> 01:21:00,348
<i>Finally, oh yeah!</i>

1062
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,960
- Come on. Snap out of it.
- Come on mate.

1063
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,880
You'll be fine.

1064
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,840
Come on love.

1065
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,600
That's it mate.

1066
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,080
You scared us all
for a minute.

1067
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,920
You just had to have that extra little bit
of attention, didn't you? Nice one lovey, nice one.

1068
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,400
Shit!

1069
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:03,840
What are you doing, Marion? You liar.
You told me he'd be in bed.

1070
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,480
- Oh Shoosh. Drink your daiquiri!
- I hate bloody daiquiri.

1071
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,520
No you don't.
You love bloody daiquiris.

1072
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,600
Least now I know why drag queens
drink from such big glasses.

1073
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,400
- To make their hands look smaller.
- Oh ha, ha, ha Marion.

1074
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,680
What am I meant
to say to the boy?

1075
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,320
- I've never been so embarrassed.
- I think you're over reacting.

1076
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,000
- Really?
- Yes. You're just being a drama queen.

1077
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,480
You're going to have to drop all that shit
if you're going to be a good father.

1078
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,920
Don't pretend to be surprised.
I've kept my end of the bargain.
Now it's your turn...

1079
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,640
- Not forever. Maybe just for a couple of months.
- Why now?

1080
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,160
Because I haven't had
a holiday in eight years.

1081
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:40,000
I need a rest, Tick.
I need some space.

1082
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,920
- Reminds me of something I said not so long ago.
- Well I do.

1083
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,320
And besides, it's time he knew
who his father was anyway.

1084
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,000
That's the problem. I mean,
I don't know what to tell him.

1085
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,080
What do you assume I do? Lie?

1086
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,480
Assumption, my dear Mitz,
is the mother of all fuck ups.

1087
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,080
- Don't bitch to me. Bitch to him.
- Thanks for the free advice.

1088
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,400
Who is it?

1089
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:08,960
It's me, Bob.

1090
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,200
Your flowers were being mangled.

1091
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,120
I thought I'd rescue
them for you.

1092
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,080
Good idea. Thanks.

1093
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,960
What's the matter?

1094
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,400
Nothing.

1095
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,860
- Do you know what your father
does for a living?
- Yeah.

1096
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,160
So I suppose you know
he doesn't really like girls then.

1097
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,400
- Does he have a boyfriend at the moment?
- No.

1098
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,240
Neither does Mum.

1099
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,120
She used to have a girlfriend
but she got over her.

1100
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,440
Do you want to come and play
in my room? I've got Lego.

1101
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,920
Sure.

1102
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:19,480
Come on, Butch. Get a move on!
We can't brand the cattle all by ourselves.

1103
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,600
Great show last night.
Do you always end a number like that?

1104
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,160
Always.

1105
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,160
- How would you like to
pick her up every night, Sundance?
- Be a pleasure.

1106
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,200
I think that might include taking the lady home
every evening and tucking her into bed, Jeff.

1107
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,280
What's the pay like, Marion?

1108
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,560
Ooh, that one's going to
get himself into trouble one day,

1109
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,240
and if you play your cards right,
you might just be the lucky fellow.

1110
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,000
Come on, all aboard.

1111
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,240
Just watch it with the innuendos, Marion.

1112
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,320
At least give me
a clear shot at this.

1113
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,680
You call dressing up like a Xanadu
production number a clear shot?

1114
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,520
Come on Tick.
Who's kidding who around here?

1115
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,480
He sure as shit isn't.

1116
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,040
- What are you doing?
- Swimming.

1117
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,520
Murray.

1118
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,960
Rock.

1119
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,440
Murray Rock.

1120
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,840
Oh, Rock Hudson.

1121
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,640
Oh, silly!

1122
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,320
My turn!

1123
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,680
Okay, smarty pants, You give it a go.

1124
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,120
Come on then.

1125
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,840
It's... a sexy woman. Famous woman.

1126
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,280
- Baby.
- Rocking.

1127
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,160
I know this one.

1128
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,720
- Race horse.
- Cat. Scary cat.

1129
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,680
Scary moose.

1130
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,080
- Scary dog.
- I know, I know.

1131
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,320
Lindy Chamberlain.

1132
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,840
That was appalling Benji.
Who taught you that?

1133
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,800
- Mum did.
- Lies! All lies.

1134
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,320
Sure.

1135
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,680
Come on, Adam. Up

1136
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:02,040
Time is against us...

1137
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,600
and WE have things to do.

1138
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,240
- Come on you butch thing, you.
- Oh no, come on.

1139
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,040
- All for one.
- Come on Tick.

1140
01:26:12,441 --> 01:26:13,341
No.

1141
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:21,040
Come on, Adam.
Let's get frocked.

1142
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:28,760
So, what’s it like...

1143
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,960
to finally have a father?

1144
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:33,640
It's okay.

1145
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,960
Sorry about last night.

1146
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:43,000
I don't always dress up
in women's cloths.

1147
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,440
I mean, don't get the wrong idea...

1148
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,360
I do lots of different stuff...
You know, like Elvis...

1149
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,280
and Garry Glitter and...

1150
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,720
Abba?

1151
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,840
I'm not supposed to know
about the Abba show...

1152
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,480
but I'd really like to see it.

1153
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,840
Would you do Abba for me?

1154
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,520
Sure.

1155
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,360
You know what I am, don't you?

1156
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,160
Mum says you're
the best in the business.

1157
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,000
Well, your mother was always
prone to exaggeration.

1158
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:33,040
Will you have a boyfriend
when we get back to Sydney?

1159
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,800
Maybe.

1160
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,960
That's good.

1161
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,240
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

1162
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,960
We're going to unleash
the best in the business.

1163
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,680
I had a dream.

1164
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,320
Well, we did it.

1165
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,240
It never ends, does it?

1166
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,080
All that space.

1167
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,720
So what now?

1168
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,680
I think I wanna go home.

1169
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,280
Me too.

1170
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:10,240
Well then. Let's finish
the shows and go home.

1171
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,240
Don't go without leaving me
your number, Sunshine!

1172
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,760
Already taken care of Jeff.
It's at the far end
of the men's cubicle.

1173
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,680
"For a good time, phone Felicia."

1174
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,720
- Hey, can we stop at McDonald's on the way back?
- Now that's a good idea.

1175
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,240
- I've had just about enough of this shitty food.
- I don't know.  Where the hell do you start?

1176
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:42,240
Lay it on the line husband.
Don't conceal a thing. That's the key.

1177
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,120
And if he doesn't like it, stiff bikkies.
He can always buy his own ticket back.

1178
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,360
And what happens when word gets out
that Mitzi's got a minor?

1179
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,040
That's your problem, not his.
He knows when and where to listen.

1180
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,760
Morals are a choice and he'll decide his own
when he's good and bloody well ready.

1181
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,160
Well, that's it. You're all packed.

1182
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:00,280
You've got to be joking. We haven't got
Bernadette's shoes upon board yet.

1183
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,720
Hate to say this; I wish I was going with you.

1184
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,440
Your gas tank'll be fine.
Your axle may be another matter.

1185
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,720
I'm sure the road home will just be
filled with bored mechanics

1186
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,480
waiting for a bus full of drag queens
to spirit them away to a better life.

1187
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,000
Oh I wish. We're not even going to
spirit gum at this rate.

1188
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,680
- Where the hell is Bernadette?
- Here.

1189
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,520
Come on Cabanossi tits.
Where are your bags?

1190
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,120
In my room.

1191
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,920
I'm not going. I've decided
to stay here for a while.

1192
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,400
Oh really.

1193
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,760
And you're choosing
to tell us about this now?

1194
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:33,720
Well she told me a few weeks back.

1195
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,600
Just when I was looking for somebody
to handle the guest entertainment while I'm away.

1196
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,000
Oh, I get it.

1197
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,720
Who's been playing
hide the sausage then?

1198
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,080
Oh well, that's it. Let's get out of here
before I throw up.

1199
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,280
Come on Benj.
Hope you can drive.

1200
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,200
Not without a hug. Wooow.

1201
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,240
You sure?

1202
01:31:57,240 --> 01:32:00,560
No, I'm not sure.

1203
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,480
But I'll never know
unless I give it a shot.

1204
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,320
I'm as jealous as all hell.

1205
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,680
Shit.

1206
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,120
Raccoon time again.

1207
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,760
Bye.

1208
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,160
- Don't forget to write.
- Wish I was staying!

1209
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:36,320
- Bye.
- Bye mom! Bye Ralph!

1210
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,400
Yeah, see you Ralph!

1211
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:45,280
<i>I've been cheated by you
since I don't know when</i>

1212
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:52,200
<i>So I made up my mind,
it must come to an end</i>

1213
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:58,080
<i>Look at me now,
will I ever learn?</i>

1214
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:03,480
<i>I don't know how
but I suddenly lose control</i>

1215
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,160
<i>There's a fire
within my soul</i>

1216
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,680
<i>Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring</i>

1217
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:14,000
<i>One more look
and I forget everything, woho oho,</i>

1218
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,440
<i>Mamma mia, here I go again</i>

1219
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:22,200
<i>My my, how can I resist you?</i>

1220
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,400
<i>Mamma mia, does it show again?</i>

1221
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,080
<i>My my, just how much I've missed you</i>

1222
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,120
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1223
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:35,440
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1224
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,840
<i>Why, why did I ever let you go?</i>

1225
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,880
<i>Mamma mia, now I really know,</i>

1226
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,320
<i>My my, I could never let you go.</i>

1227
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:56,440
<i>I've been angry and sad
about things that you do</i>

1228
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:02,400
<i>I can't count all the times
that I've told you we're through</i>

1229
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,840
<i>And when you go,
when you slam the door</i>

1230
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:14,240
<i>I think you know
that you won't be away too long</i>

1231
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:18,080
<i>You know that I'm not that strong.</i>

1232
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:21,681
<i>Just one look
and I can hear a bell ring</i>

1233
01:34:21,682 --> 01:34:25,382
<i>One more look
and I forget everything, woho oho,</i>

1234
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:29,183
<i>Mamma mia, here I go again</i>

1235
01:34:29,184 --> 01:34:32,584
<i>My my, how can I resist you?</i>

1236
01:34:32,885 --> 01:34:36,285
<i>Mamma mia, does it show again?</i>

1237
01:34:36,286 --> 01:34:39,986
<i>My my, just how much I've missed you</i>

1238
01:34:39,987 --> 01:34:42,987
<i>Yes, I've been broken-hearted</i>

1239
01:34:42,988 --> 01:34:46,188
<i>Blue since the day we parted</i>

1240
01:34:46,189 --> 01:34:49,589
<i>Why, why did I ever let you go?</i>

1241
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:53,190
<i>Mamma mia, now I really know,</i>

1242
01:34:53,191 --> 01:34:57,291
<i>My my, I could never let you go.</i>

1243
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,560
No, that's enough.
Oh, my tits are falling down.

1244
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,400
Jesus!

1245
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:25,560
Thank you, thank you!
It's good to be home.

1246

<i>Sometimes the snow comes down in June</i>

1247
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:52,440
<i>Sometimes the sun goes round the moon</i>

1248
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:57,240
<i>I see the passion in your eyes</i>

1249
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:01,720
<i>Sometimes it's all a big surprise</i>

1250
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:07,160
<i>Cause there was a time when all I did was wish</i>

1251
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:11,480
<i>You'd tell me this was love</i>

1252
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,360
<i>It's not the way I hoped</i>

1253
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:17,400
<i>or how I planned</i>

1254
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:21,240
<i>But somehow it's enough</i>

1255
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:26,040
<i>And now we're standing face to face</i>

1256
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:30,800
<i>Isn't this world a crazy place</i>

1257
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:35,480
<i>Just when I thought our chance had passed</i>

1258
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:41,080
<i>You go and save the best for last</i>

1259
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:52,240
<i>All of the nights you came to me</i>

1260
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:57,160
<i>When some silly girl had set you free</i>

1261
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:01,800
<i>I wondered how you'd make it through</i>

1262
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,440
<i>I wondered what was wrong with you</i>

1263
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:09,640
<i>Cause how could you give your love</i>

1264
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,040
<i>to someone else</i>

1265
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:16,360
<i>And share your dreams with me</i>

1266
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:21,960
<i>Sometimes the very thing you're looking for</i>

1267
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,960
<i>Is the one thing you can't see</i>

1268
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,800
<i>But now we're standing face to face</i>

1269
01:37:31,301 --> 01:37:35,801
<i>Isn't this world a crazy place</i>

1270

<i>Just when I thought our chance had passed</i>

1271
01:37:41,003 --> 01:37:45,703

1276

<i>You went and saved the best for last</i>

1277
01:38:24,909 --> 01:38:27,309
<i>Yeah.</i>
