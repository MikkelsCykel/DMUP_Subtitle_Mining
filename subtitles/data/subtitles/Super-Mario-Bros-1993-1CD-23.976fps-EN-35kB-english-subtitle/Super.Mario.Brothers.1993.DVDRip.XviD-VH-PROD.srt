1
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,080
<i>A long, long time ago,
the earth was ruled by dinosaurs.</i>

2
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,086
<i>They were big, so not a lot of people
went around hassling 'em.</i>

3
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,681
<i>Actually, no people went around hassling 'em
because there weren't any people yet.</i>

4
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:02,126
<i>Just the first tiny mammals.</i>

5
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,459
<i>Basically life was good.</i>

6
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:09,366
- You know, it just don't get no better'n this.
- Yeah.

7
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:21,171
<i>Then somethin'happened.
A giant meteorite struck the earth.</i>

8
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,343
<i>Good- bye, dinosaurs.</i>

9
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,182
<i>But what if the dinosaurs
weren't all destroyed?</i>

10
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,815
<i>What if the impact of that meteorite
created a parallel dimension...</i>

11
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,349
<i>where the dinosaurs continue to thrive
and evolve into intelligent...</i>

12
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,829
<i>vicious, aggressive beings, just like us?</i>

13
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,390
<i>And, hey!
What if they found a way back?</i>

14
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,704
<i>Hey, lady, what are you doing!</i>

15
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,790
Ohhh!

16
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,919
- Where's the rock?
- Koopa!

17
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,165
Aaah!

18
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,301
<i>Welcome to Miraculous World...</i>

19
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,900
<i>where each week
we ask unanswered questions.</i>

20
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,911
<i>Today on our Miraculous World,
another dimension...</i>

21
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,607
<i>the universe next door.</i>

22
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,242
<i>An alternate world separated
by time and space...</i>

23
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,878
and yet somehow joined
and contiguous with our own.

24
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,855
<i>Mario Brothers Plumbing,
no leak too small.</i>

25
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,586
<i>Uh- huh. Uh- hu... no, no, no.
Don't touch it. No, no...</i>

26
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,061
It's not a big problem.
Just leave it to the professionals.

27
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,325
<i>When I looked around,
I was somewhere else.</i>

28
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,459
- Another dimension, you mean?
- Sure.

29
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:06,130
<i>- Another dimension, the universe next door.
- Okay, we'll be right there.</i>

30
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,139
Luigi!

31
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,870
We got a broken dishwasher at the Riverfront Café.
You know what that means?

32
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,310
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We got work!

33
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,214
<i>Oh, Mario, Mario, right now on "Miraculous World,"
this guy just found out...</i>

34
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,650
<i>that he was in another dimension.</i>

35
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,814
The only thing miraculous I know
is that we're still eatin'...

36
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,827
<i>- while we're goin' broke.
- We ain't "goin" broke, Mario. We're already there.</i>

37
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,591
- Yeah?
- Ow! Oh!

38
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,690
<i>Are you spendin'money
on this stuff? Look at this!</i>

39
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,463
Yeah, but that's got the article about
the missing Brooklyn girls in it.

40
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,506
Oh, yeah? It's also got
one on the scientist...

41
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:44,009
- who turns brains into cheese.
- Yeah, well, you don't know. It could happen.

42
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,410
How could that possibly happen?

43
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,415
<i>Anything's possible, Mario.
You just gotta believe.</i>

44
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,044
I do believe. I believe
the rent is three months overdue.

45
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,850
That's what I believe.

46
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,415
<i>- Hey, turn left here.
- Fine, fine.</i>

47
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,428
Left! I said left!

48
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,521
- What are you doin'?
- I don't know, Mario.

49
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,590
Just trust me, I got a good feeling
about this alleyway. I don't know.

50
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,729
- What?
- My instincts tell me this would be faster...

51
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,638
Breathe in, big brother,
we'll get there.

52
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,642
Luigi!

53
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,272
You know, I read that sea turtles
navigate thousands of miles on instinct.

54
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,646
Not in New York traffic
they don't.

55
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,084
What're you complainin' about?
Come on, we're here, aren't we?

56
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,782
<i>- You're getting worse.
- I'm gettin' worse?</i>

57
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,258
How did we get into sea turtles?

58
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,025
- Faster. What'd I tell ya, huh?
- It's a miracle we made it alive.

59
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,931
I thought you didn't believe
in miracles, Mr. Tough Guy, huh?

60
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,774
Scapelli! They beat us to it again.
Another lost job!

61
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,867
<i>One of Brooklyn's
largest construction projects...</i>

62

<i>hoping to settle the dispute.</i>

66
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:13,122
Hey, Mr. Scapelli!

67
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,632
<i>- Who's in charge of this hole?
- It's him again.</i>

68
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:30,114
- I'm the boss here.
- I'm Anthony Scapelli. I'm the boss elsewhere.

69
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:34,483
My boys need to get back to work here.
How long are you gonna be diggin' up these bones?

70
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,853
As long as our court order lasts,
Mr. Scapelli.

71
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:41,155
The university has explained to you
how important this site is.

72
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,856
But we'd be done here a lot sooner
if your goons would stop harassing us.

73
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,959
You look like a smart girl.
I bet you'll be done by tonight.

74
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:53,836
I know a lot of girls who've been
going missing in Brooklyn lately.

75
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,340
I'd be careful.

76
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,304
James, I'm gonna find a phone
and call the university.

77
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,244
All right.

78
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,045
Keep everyone digging
'til I get back.

79
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,700
They say it's dog.

80
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,830
Don't blow it this time.

81
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,403
There she is.

82
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,916
<i>- Yeah, you sure?
- Two arms, one head, two legs.</i>

83
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,919
Koopa's gonna kill us
if we blow it again. Let's get her!

84
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,718
Luigi, I told you to check the radiator.
Take it easy, will ya?

85
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,054
Relax, it's been makin' that sound
all week.

86
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,425
Oh, come on, Luigi,
you didn't tell me...

87
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,397
Oh, man!

88
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,069
Be careful, it's hot. Be careful. Whoo!

89
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,900
- Aah! Here we go.
- I'll do this.

90
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,104
- Go check the messages. See if we got any work.
- All right. All right.

91
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,659
- I missed.
- Nice job!

92
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,761
Where're you goin'?

93
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,772
To get some water.

94
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,743
Hello, this is Al Bronsky...

95
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,911
from Al Bronsky's
Department Stores.

96
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,923
- I have a big flood over here. So get all your plumbers. Get extra plumbers.
- Thanks.

97
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,583
<i>Bring every plumber you...</i>

98
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,924
Everybody's got tap water!

99
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,260
Three bucks!

100
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,392
- Any jobs?
- No.

101
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,373
Thank you.

102
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,613
Hi, it's Daisy.

103
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,549
Listen, we're gonna need
more security down here.

104
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,385
I don't care about the money. Scapelli's
down here making threats, and I...

105
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,788
She's beautiful, huh?

106
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,156
- Who?
- Her.

107
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,491
Her?

108
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,866
- She's nice. Go talk to her. Go on!
- No. I can't. I can't.

109
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,027
- Come on, go talk to her. What's the matter with you?
- I don't know what to say.

110
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,298
Fine.

111
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:42,307
Bye.

112
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,951
- Here she comes. Here she comes.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

113
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,285
- For letting me use the phone.
- Oh, sure.

114
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,883
- And for the quarter.
- Are you okay?

115
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,157
I've got a few problems, but...

116
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,357
Well, you know, we got a van.

117
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,102
It's nice.

118
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,831
Yeah, well... No, no, I'm asking you
if you want a ride.

119
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,874
Oh, but, uh, it's broken.

120
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,545
<i>- Well...
- Your name's Daisy, isn't it?</i>

121
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,983
I overheard your name was Daisy.
You know, I haven't heard that name around here.

122
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,216
<i>It's really nice too. It's... No, I have
heard it, 'cause it's like the flower...</i>

123
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,223
and everything, but...

124
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,351
Not that I hang around the flower shops
or nothin' like that.

125
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,886
What my brother is trying to say
is he doesn't know what to say.

126
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,364
Doesn't even know
how to begin, but...

127
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,234
<i>he has offered you a ride, and
if it would help you out, please...</i>

128
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,068
step into the van.

129
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,202
<i>That might not be a bad idea.</i>

130
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
Okay. Thanks.

131
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,110
<i>- I thought it was broken.
- I fixed it.</i>

132
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,695
Oh, here.
This is as far as we can go.

133
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,568
- I'll have to walk the rest of the way.
- Wait. W- W- Wait.

134
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,540
- Ma'am.
- Oh! Why, thank you, sir.

135
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,306
- Well, thank you for the ride.
- It's a pleasure to meet me.

136
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,314
I mean, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

137
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:34,182
- Dinner.
- Do you eat?

138
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,153
Yeah.

139
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,588
- Dinner?
- Sure.

140
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,490
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

141
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,552
Oh. Okay.

142
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,497
- At 6:00, all right?
- Be here.

143
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,091
Great.

144
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,103
Bye.

145
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,264
<i>Bye.</i>

146
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,036
What would you do without
your big brother, huh?

147
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,043
Like to give it a shot
and find out.

148
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,204
- Ah, come on!
- I'm just about to ask her that.

149
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,716
<i>You weren't about to ask her nothin;
You was gonna let her go.</i>

150
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,776
<i>- Now she's gonna think I'm a complete idiot.
- You're gonna see her tonight.</i>

151
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,844
You'll impress her
with your manners.

152
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,857
Yeah, but why did you tell her
that I suck my thumb, huh?

153
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,621
<i>So, now, let me get this
perfectly clear here.</i>

154
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,326
What we're discussing is bones.

155
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,461
<i>- Not exactly.
- Okay, so Scapelli blasted...</i>

156
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,837
<i>- Hey!
- through the bone and rock and found what?</i>

157
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,967
- Iridium.
- Oh.

158
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,034
Well, that's, that's unbelievable.

159
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,981
<i>Well, it means that a meteorite hit here
a long time ago, and...</i>

160
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,680
well, we think it could be what
destroyed all the dinosaurs.

161
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,519
Wow, there were
dinosaurs in Brooklyn?

162
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,924
<i>Relax, Luigi.
There used to be Dodgers here too.</i>

163
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,928
<i>Hey, I got an idea.</i>

164
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,930
Why don't you come on down
to the tanning salon...

165
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,125
and I can hook you up
with some free tans.

166
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,728
<i>Bring a nice bathing suit.
Something strapless so you don't get a tan line.</i>

167
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,999
- And you want to take off that rock.
- Well, actually, you know...

168
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,440
I, I never take it off.

169
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,001
Well, I know it sounds weird,
but, I mean...

170
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,070
it's the only thing I have
from when I was found.

171
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,276
- Found?
- Oh, I was abandoned.

172
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,185
<i>- Ohh!
- I grew up at St. Theresa's on Fulton street.</i>

173
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,452
You mean, you don't know who
your mother and your father are neither?

174
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,187
No.
What do you mean "neither"?

175
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,197
'Cause Mario here brought me up.

176
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,530
<i>- He's been my mother my whole life.
- Hey!</i>

177
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,766
My father, my father! He's been my
father, my uncle, my brother, everybody.

178
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,116
Well, what are you two kids
gonna do tonight?

179
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,951
Well, we could take
the van back ourselves.

180
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,719
Um, if you're not doing
anything later tonight...

181
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,556
I would like to walk you home.

182
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,156
Okay.

183
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,805
- Spike! Spike!
- Iggy.

184
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,742
- Where're you going? That's not the girl.
- I'm goin' to get the girl.

185
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,786
<i>Yes, it is. She's wearing a disguise.
I can spot her a mile away.</i>

186
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,346
Of course she's wearing a disguise.
She thinks she can fool us.

187
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,257
<i>- I'm gonna go get her.
- I'm gonna go get her.</i>

188
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,852
Wait a minute. We'll follow her,
and then we'll both go get her.

189
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,694
- Good idea. I bag her, you grab her.
- No, I grab her, you bag her.

190
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,700
- That's what I said.
- Exactly.

191
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,737
<i>- This is the one.
- That's what you said about the last four girls.</i>

192
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,294
- I did?
- You did.

193
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,932
Outta my way!

194
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,136
You know, I just wanna say
one thing first.

195
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:50,113
I want to apologize right now, in case...
when I start to get talkin'...

196
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,946
and I start to say things
that sound really weird...

197
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:57,853
Uh, weird? Weird... Look, weird
is working in a bone pit all day.

198
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,882
And then spending your nights reading about
things that have been dead for 65 million years.

199
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,361
- I mean, that is weird.
- Well, I... I find that fascinating.

200
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,490
And I mean... You know what,
if you just wanna end this right now...

201
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,694
- I would understand.
- You know, I was gonna ask you the same thing.

202
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,829
If, if you wanna end this right now
and you feel bad about that...

203
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,433
but you wanna talk to somebody
about it, you could call me.

204
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,007
You really think what I do
is interesting?

205
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,140
I think it's incredible.

206
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,379
Well, you know...
if you want...

207
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,389
I could show you.

208
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:34,392
I'd love you to show me.
Show me.

209
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,429
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay. Good night, okay?

210
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,598
Drive carefully.

211
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:59,115
Mario!

212
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,846
<i>You don't stand a chance.</i>

213
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,945
I won.

214
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:08,258
That's what you think.

215
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,256
Oh, that was sneaky.

216
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,424
We don't even have
any security here.

217
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,434
That's what I was calling
about on the phone today.

218
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,902
You see, I can't get the university
to give me any extra money.

219
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,905
- Is that why you were talking about Scapelli?
- Yeah, well...

220
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:24,374
Scapelli was down here with his crew
blasting at the site...

221
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,809
and that's when
they found the fossils.

222
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,440
- Are you sure you know where you're goin'?
- It's just ahead.

223
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,485
Is this your office or somethin'?
Doesn't it give you the creeps?

224
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,716
Well, it's more like a home.
I feel comfortable down here.

225
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,724
Comfortable? Okay.

226
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:44,058
- Well, this is it. Have a look.
- Wow!

227
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:48,122
Awesome!
Oh, check this out!

228
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,363
<i>These are all strange new species.</i>

229
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,497
<i>Look at this one.
The way the bones fit here...</i>

230
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,734
and the opposable thumb.

231
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,745
<i>It's almost as if... he was a monster
trying to be a human being.</i>

232
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,315
It's beautiful.

233
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,458
You're beautiful.

234
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,000
- Oh, my... Hey! Hey!
- Hey, you guys!

235
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,506
<i>- It's the Scapellis!
- Oh, no!</i>

236
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,509
Well, what did they, they do?
What've you got down there?

237
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,341
They're destroying everything.
Is it the sump pump?

238
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,347
Thank God you're here! I mean...

239
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,883
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you're a plumber, right?

240
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,613
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

241
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,121
Well, I don't know exactly what to do.

242
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:47,716
- Mario, Scapelli's floodin' the site!
- We need your help.

243
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,820
- Scapelli?
- Yeah.

244
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,298
Strap your belt on, kid.
We're goin' in.

245
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,804
Scapelli's been trying to force us out
ever since we got here. It's sabotage.

246
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,399
Down here! Hurry!

247
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,410
- This way!
- Allow me. I'm a professional.

248
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,413
- Looks like the bottom one, right?
- Yeah.

249
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,489
- One and 1/16, open- ended.
- One and 1/16, open- ended.

250
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,771
Wrong again. How many times
have we got this wrong?

251
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,298
- You've gotten it wrong five times.
- "O" for five, "O" for five.

252
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:42,575
- What percent is that?
- I don't know. Let me think.

253
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,284
I don't know,
but it's not good.

254
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,049
If we get it wrong one more time,
he's gonna kill us.

255
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,717
He's not gonna kill us.
He's not that nice.

256
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,228
Up ahead. It's her.

257
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,594
I sense her.

258
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,929
I definitely know it's her.

259
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,235
Basin wrench.

260
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,866
- Basin wrench.
- Great.

261
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,640
- Here. Hand.
- Hand.

262
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,480
Now, does this guy know his stuff,
or does this guy know his stuff, huh?

263
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,918
- Okay, you ready?
- Say when.

264
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:26,446
Let's go... now.

265
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,255
<i>Scapelli's just an amateur.</i>

266
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,137
Aaah!

267
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:45,142
<i>Daisy? Daisy, where are you?</i>

268
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,805
Daisy! Answer me! Daisy, where are you?
Come on, let's go this way.

269
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,010
- No, no. No, it's this way.
- Come on, let's go this way.

270
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,019
- That's the echo.
- How do you know?

271
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,181
- I've been listening to pipes all my life. Come on.
- Okay, come on.

272
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,385
Daisy!

273
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,861
Luigi, this is a mistake. It's a dead end.
Come on, let's turn back.

274
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,262
- Okay, then you go back.
- Luigi, please.

275
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,563
Give me the light.
Come on, give me the light.

276
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,036
Daisy?

277
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,266
Luigi, you see how deep that is?
Get back.

278
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,774
- Aaah! Lean back!
- The light!

279
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,107
<i>Let it go!</i>

280
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,646
- Oh, God!
- Ahhh!

281
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,114
Hold on to me.

282
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:30,621
Daisy?

283
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,988
<i>- Watch it.
- Luigi!</i>

284
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,125
You see that?

285
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,029
Help me!

286
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,232
Daisy! Is that you?

287
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,501
Luigi!

288
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,736
- No!
- Luigi!

289
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,336
<i>- Daisy?
- Get off of me!</i>

290
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,474
No!

291
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,859
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, did you?

292
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,864
- Yeah.
- Oh.

293
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,765
That's solid rock!

294
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,634
- I got a feelin'.
- No, Luigi, forget it.

295
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:24,267
- I gotta go with it.
- Forget it, it's rock.

296
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,971
Look down there. Luigi!

297
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,013
Luigi!

298
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,675
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

299
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,086
- Mario!
- I disintegrated. Am I still here?

<i>What is this place?</i>

301
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,984
There she is, come on!
Come on, let's go, run!

302
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,225
<i>- Where are you taking me?
- Back to where you belong.</i>

303
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,323
<i>- No, you're hurting me!
- I'm gonna kill 'em!</i>

304
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,165
No, you're not gonna kill 'em.
Not if I get there first.

305
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,037
I'm gonna break every bone in their body,
and then I'm gonna kill 'em.

306
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,041
I'm really gonna kill 'em.

307
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,747
<i>- Help me!
- Daisy, I'm coming!</i>

308
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,182
<i>- Get off of me!
- Excuse me.</i>

309
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,584
- You better not hurt her!
- Help!

310
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:48,322
Grade- A Express
to Koopa Canyon!

311
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,361
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

312
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,363
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

313
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,490
<i>Gentlemen,
the Koopa Union is cancelled.</i>

314
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,831
<i>- Passengers transfer at Koopa Square.
- Get out of my way!</i>

315
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:22,525
<i>Where the hell are we?
This is crazy!</i>

316
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:26,928
<i>We went under the river, but this can't
be Manhattan. Where is this place?</i>

317
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,330
I don't know, I ain't been
to Manhattan in a couple of weeks.

318
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,393
Must've been
a bad couple of weeks.

319
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,406
<i>- No!
- There she is!</i>

320
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,965
- Daisy!
- Luigi?

321
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,511
- Daisy!
- Luigi!

322
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,740
<i>- Mario!
- We're coming!</i>

323
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,409
- You better not hurt her! Somebody, do something!
- Hey!

324
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,420
- No stalling up traffic. Move along!
- Somebody stop her! Daisy!

325
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,423
- Are you a cop, or what?
- Come on, get off me, man!

326
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,330
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay, yeah.

327
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:06,666
- You're the one without the patent.
- Yeah, well, you're the old one.

328
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,702
- Oh, my God! Look at that!
- Get outta here! Watch out!

329
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:17,407
Excuse me.

330
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,415
- This stuff's sticky.
- Yuck!

331
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:32,126
<i>- Hey.
- Get away from my baby! Get away from my baby!</i>

332
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,463

- I don't know.

333
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,368
<i>- Where are we?
- I don't know. Maybe we got knocked unconscious...</i>

334
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,201
<i>for a hundred years, and we woke up in
the Manhattan of the future.</i>

335
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,333
Maybe the Bronx of today.

336
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,038
<i>- No wonder they tell you never to come up here.
- Mario, I got a feelin;</i>

337
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:52,049
- I got a feelin' we're not in Brooklyn no more.
- Where're you goin'? Hey!

338
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:01,819
<i>Look at this place.
Pathetic. It gets worse every day.</i>

339
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,418
<i>- It's disgusting.
- The humans on the other side...</i>

340
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,432
<i>have a world full of resources ready
for the taking.</i>

341
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,664
<i>- Imagine an endless supply of food...
- I know.</i>

342
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,400
<i>- Clean air, water... and what are we stuck with?
- Mmmm.</i>

343
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,932
This... pit hole...

344
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,811
germs everywhere, fungus.

345
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,750
Sixty- five million years...
we've been exiled here...

346
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,617
after the meteorite struck...

347
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,586
while mammals roam free
in the other dimension.

348
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,458
Well... not for long.

349
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,456
When you get your rock.

350
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,365
When I get the princess.

351
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,303
<i>- Princess?
- I need the rock...</i>

352
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,341
and the Princess Daisy.

353
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,970
I'll finally be able to merge our world
with theirs and get rid of the mammals!

354
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,607
Yes, it's everything you've hoped for,
everything you've worked for.

355
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,219
<i>- Excuse me, cousin.
- Hello, morons.</i>

356
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,222
- Hello.
- Hello.

357
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,817
- I captured the princess. She's being de- fungused.
- Ah! Ah!

358
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,521
<i>- But I took her through the gateway.
- I recognized her.</i>

359
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,588
He couldn't tell
one mammal from another.

360
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:18,693
Good. Now... where's the rock?

361
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,740
- Rock, sir?
- Rock, sir?

362
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,675
The meteorite piece that
she wears around her neck...

363
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,679
and I told you not to forget it!

364
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,841
- That rock.
- I told you not to forget it!

365
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,851
And I told you to remind him!

366
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,979
<i>Without that piece
the meteorite lays dormant.</i>

367
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,547
I'll not be able
to merge the dimensions.

368
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,957
Where is it?

369
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,324
- The plumbers took it.
- Plumbers?

370
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,834
Plumber alert.

371
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,837
<i>Plumber alert.</i>

372
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,839
<i>That's right.</i>

373
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,432
<i>The Koopa man is looking
for a couple of plumbers.</i>

374
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,412
<i>And there's a big coin reward,
2,000 gold Koopa coins.</i>

375
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,449
<i>Guess he must have
a serious plumbing problem.</i>

376
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:10,918
<i>Fried tweeter, only 20 Koopas.
Enjoy your spiny burger here.</i>

377
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,492
Hey, fried tweeter, only 20 Koopas.
You like little wigglers?

378
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,997
Hey, listen. If we're gonna eat in this place,
we're gonna have to be very, very hungry.

379
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,158
Excuse me, excuse me, Miss Lady,
can you tell me where I am?

380
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,292
Yeah, you're in my way,
egg suckers.

381
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,098
Who are these people?

382
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,540
- Are you boys new here in town?
- Lady, we're lookin' for somebody...

383
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,371
- and we're from Brooklyn.
- Yeah.

384
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,277
You know, boys, it's very dangerous
here in this neighborhood.

385
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,144
- You shouldn't wander around without a weapon.
- Yeah.

386
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,447
- You got one?
- No.

387
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,784
All right.
Get 'em up, suckers!

388
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,222
Koopa coins! I need Koopa coins!

389
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,495
<i>- Well, this oughta do...
- D- D- Don't touch that!</i>

390
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,625
- Just fine!

391
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,228
<i>- Hey!

392

What are you d... Put me down!

393
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,678
Bats!

394
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:27,156
Um, you wanna give us
the rock back, lady?

395
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:31,532
Come and get it, big boy.

396
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,255
Hey! Hey, guys! Cheer up!

397

402
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,944
- Whoaah!
- You know the law, Toad.

403
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,889
Hey, wait a minute. You can't
arrest a guy for just singin' a song.

404
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,449
For anti- Koopa songs, we can.

405
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,587
<i>Ah- ha! Plumbers!</i>

406
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,827

- Get in the car!

407
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,734
Are you tellin' us that you can arrest a guy
for bein' a plumber? Get outta here!

408
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,171

<i>- What did we do?

414

There's this guy, his name is Koopa.

And he's lookin' for this princess.
I guess none of us here fit the bill.

Help these Marios around the side.

Stop pushin' me around.

449
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:29,062
# Thinkin' about my sur... ##

450
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,199
Say, what's another word
that rhymes with "dimension"?

451
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,403
- Yeah, "tension." And I'm full of it, so shut up.
- Wait a minute!

452
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,346
What did you mean "another dimension"?
Did you mean like...

453
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,873
- our worlds have crossed over or somethin' like that?
- Sure, kid.

454
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,217
You know, according to history,
a long time ago a big meteorite came...

455
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:47,917
- and blasted our universes into parallel dimensions.
- Yeah.

456
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,086
You know what else I think?
All that fungus out there.

457
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,997
That's our old king. It's true.
But he's been de- evolved.

458
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,627
That's right. He's been
de- evolved into fungus, and now...

459
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,968
<i>- he's wreaking his revenge on the city.
- Mario Brothers!</i>

460
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,340
Yeah, that's us! You better get a lawyer
and get us outta this chicken coop.

461
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,141
- Yeah, me too!
- You got one.

462
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,477
- Let's go. Come on.
- Just let me do the talking.

463
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,042
Shut up!

464
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:22,356
Boys, boys... sit down.

465
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,895
How's prison?

466
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:32,827
You look like hell. I'm, uh...

467
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,704
Larry Lazard, of Lazard, Lazard...

468
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,175
Conda, Dactyl, and Cohen.

469
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,771
<i>Who sent you?
Are you from the city?</i>

470
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,783
No, I'm from that,
uh, little part of all of us...

471
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,014
that can't stand to see
someone else in need or pain.

472
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,683
Yeah, I'll bet.
Wh- Who's this Koopa clown?

473
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,693
<i>We gotta talk
to that goofball now.</i>

474
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,195
I don't think
you wanna do that.

475
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,027
- Why?
- Why not?

476
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,434
<i>- That Koopa clown...
- Yeah?</i>

477
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:10,998
Is one evil,
egg- sucking son of a snake.

478
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,744
Now...

479
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:18,179
where is that
meteorite piece?

480
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,786
The what?

481
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,365
- You know what I'm talking about!
- Hey, hey, hey!

482
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,767
- Ow!
- No one touches President Koopa.

483
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,536
You're Koopa?
Well, you just said you were one...

484
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,908
One evil, egg- sucking
son of a snake.

485
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,743
Did I lie?

486
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,478
<i>Take these two plumbers...</i>

487
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,747
to the devo chamber.

488
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,055
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

489
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,618
<i>What a lousy chamber...</i>

490
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,994
<i>ever since Koopa took over.</i>

491
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:12,934
<i>And you, Koopa!
You're a lousy leader!</i>

492
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,997
<i>One thing I cannot stand
is naysaying.</i>

493
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:20,908
Simon, de- evolve him now.

494
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,708
<i>De- evolve.</i>

495
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,682
<i>- Cretaceous.
- Our old king!</i>

496
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,914
You tried to get rid of him,
but the king is everywhere.

497
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:33,388
- You can't get rid of him.
- See you later, alligator.

498
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,425
<i>Ever!</i>

499
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,359
You may think of evolution
as an upward process.

500
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,961
Things evolve from primeval slime...

501
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,836
up to single- cell organisms...

502
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:53,468
up to... intelligent life.

503
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,708
<i>De- evolution, of course,
works the opposite way.</i>

504
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,479
<i>Back to simpler forms. For instance...</i>

505
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,146
<i>even our musical friend, Toad...</i>

506
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:09,057
can become... a loyal child
of the royal family.

507
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,893
Goombas, ah!

508
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,462
- Why'd you do that to him?
- Hey, no, no!

509
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,267
Not now, not now.

510
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:27,302
What single- cell organism
did you evolve from?

511
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,872
Tyrannosaurus Rex, the lizard king,
thank you very much.

512
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:35,043
Goomba.

513
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,182
Whereas my evolution was wonderful
and sweet, your de- evolution...

514
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,783
<i>will be a living nightmare
if you don't tell me...</i>

515
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,794
<i>where that meteorite piece is.</i>

516
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,990
<i>That's Toad?</i>

517
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,057
Yes. Loyal...

518
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:54,901
lethal...

519
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,202
and stupid.

520
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,035
<i>Goomba, walk tall.</i>

521
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,948
Be proud. Go, Goomba!

522
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:10,613
<i>Join the Goombas.</i>

523
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,962
<i>Guards, guards,
arrest these plumbers!</i>

524
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,368
<i>- De- evolve.
- You're goin'back...</i>

525
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,274
- where you belong, lizard.
- Help me! Help me!

526
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,335
- Keep going. Got it?
- Got it.

527
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:40,013
Yeah! Let's get outta here!

528
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,416
I'll kill that plumber!

529
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,858
We're back in
the police station!

530
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,462
Hey, Mario, look at this. These little
mushroom things on the fungus.

531
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,738
<i>Great! A building
with athlete's foot!</i>

532
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:13,073
Hey, look at that.
What is that?

533
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,641
<i>Goombas!
Come on, let's go!</i>

534
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,382
Well, look! It was trying
to give us that thing.

535
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,852
- Swing. Keep swinging.
- Okay.

536
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,054
- I'm swinging, I'm swinging.
- Just keep hanging. Close your eyes.

537
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,996
Hey, hey, hey, look what he's doing!

538
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,556
- Yee- haw!
- Hang on.

539
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,862
Hey, man, this is fun!

540
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,471
Whoa!

541
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,569
- Get ready. Get ready.
- What was that?

542
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,910
- I'm ready, I'm ready!
- Whoo!

543
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,916
Ooh, yeh! Yeh, yeh!

544
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,084
Now!

545
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,252
All right, which door?

546
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,320
- Okay, my instinct tells me this one.
- Come on, come on.

547
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,765
- Let's go in this one.
- Oh!

548
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,893
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

549
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,667
- Let's get outta here!
- Here we... Okay.

550
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,437
- They got us! What're we gonna do?
- Number one.

551
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,605
- We steal this car. Number two. I'm driving.
- All right.

552
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,807
- Help me, man!
- Come on!

553
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,849
Hey, wait for me!
Don't take off!

554
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,447
- Okay.
- Let's see what I got over here.

555
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,255
Now where's the starter
on this thing?

556
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,090
I got a feeling about this,
Mario- rooni.

557
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,721
I can't believe
you can do that.

558
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,926
Comes from sittin' on my butt all day
playing video games.

559
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,469
Got it!

560
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,303
- Let's get outta here.
- Let's hit the bricks.

561
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,683
Hey!

562
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,632
<i>Security alert.
Stand by for special bulletin.</i>

563
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,636
<i>Mario, look!</i>

564
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:17,902
- You look terrible!
- You don't look so good yourself.

565
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,876
<i>Alien species
escaping from police detention.</i>

566
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,972
- Aliens? We gotta deal with aliens too?
- Luigi, we're the aliens.

567
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,813
We are? Whoa, cool!

568
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,899
<i>- Hey, Mario, you're going the wrong way!
- How would you know?</i>

569
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,801
<i>- Trust me.
- Huh!</i>

570
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,500
- You're driving like a maniac! Would you watch it?
- You wanna drive?

571
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,376
- I'm not riding with you anymore.
- Okay, you drive.

572
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,575
<i>No, what are you doing?</i>

573
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,286
- How're you steering this?
- I'm not.

574
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,399
I hope the guy downstairs
knows where we're going.

575
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,975
Yeah, hey!
This is drivin'!

576
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,807
Cool, Mario.

577
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,582
Brace yourself! Now!

578
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,430
<i>- All right!
- Ahhhh!</i>

579
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:00,435
Glug, glug, glug, glug!

580
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,447
Which way?

581
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,484
- Take the parkway.
- Right.

582
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,090
Perfect. Perfect.

583
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:17,321
- You said the parkway.
- I know, but I wanted the tunnel...

584
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:21,160
so I said parkway 'cause I knew
you'd go the opposite way I suggested.

585
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,609
Hey, watch it!
What're you doing?

586
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,807
<i>Warning.
Leaving power grid. Powering down.</i>

587
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,282
I can't stop this thing.
I can't see where I'm going!

588
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,286
Look out, Mario!

589
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,879
<i>- Hit the brakes! Do something!
- There are no brakes!</i>

590
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,017
- This fungus is gonna kill us!
- We're gonna hit the end of the tunnel! Look out!

591
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,649
Hey, was that superior
drivin' skills or what?

592
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,517
Let's get outta here before
this fungus stuff eats us alive!

593
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,921
Hey, the fungus just saved us.

594
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,256
What're you talkin' about?
It was my drivin' that saved us.

595
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,762
It wasn't your driving.
That tunnel just sneezed us out.

596
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,697
And then this giant booger caught us
in the air. That's what saved us.

597
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,100
Ah, come on!
Let's get outta here.

598
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,940
- Uh- huh! You there! Excuse me, sir.
- Sorry.

599
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:44,037
<i>Sir! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to disturb you.</i>

600
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:47,481
But the plumbers, they're in the tunnel.
They're on their way to the desert.

601
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:52,215
What are you doing here instead of
being in the desert heading them off?

602
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,690
That's exactly what I told him, sir.
Exactly what I told him.

603
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,661
Between you and me, Spike hasn't got
a thought in his brain, sir.

604
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,823
Huh, huh!
He's a liar, sir.

605
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,130
Between us, Iggy doesn't have
a brain in his head.

606
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,932
<i>- I agree.
- They're your relatives.</i>

607
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,940
<i>- Wait outside!
- We'll wait outside.</i>

608
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,772
- You blew it.
- You, Lena, bring me the princess.

609
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,870
And have her cleaned up.

610
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:20,439
Do you know
what I love about mud?

611
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:24,817
It's clean and it's dirty
at the same time.

612
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,725
The princess.

613
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:51,509
- Are you here to help us?
- Hardly.

614
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,951
Now let me guess
which one of you...

615
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,149
is Daisy.

616
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,663
Princess Daisy.

617
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,967
- Princess?
- What?

618
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,702
- Princess Daisy?
- This is gettin' weird.

619
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,038
Ah...

620
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,942
you have your mother's eyes.

621
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,218
Come with me.

622
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,291
Good- bye, Spike.
I'm gonna miss ya.

623
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:46,396
<i>Have a nice trip.
See ya next fall.</i>

624
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,736
<i>Evolve. Advanced.</i>

625
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:57,379
Good choice, cousin. I always thought
he'd make a great Goomba.

626
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,220
Bye, Spike.

627
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,998
Ah, our not- so- benevolent
dictator, as it were.

628
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:29,612
- Ignatius, do you know what the square root of 26,481 is?
- What are you talking about?

629
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,513
- One- hundred ninety- one.
- What?

630
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,778
What are you doing? Not me.
No, no, not me, cousin!

631
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,685
Not me! Spike!
Help me, Spike!

632
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:40,723
<i>Perhaps if I could just
make you idiots smarter...</i>

633
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:44,591
<i>- you won't screw up this time.
- Please, not me. Not me, cuz. No.</i>

634
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:47,596
<i>No- o- o!</i>

635
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,901
Oh, my.

636
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,932
How peculiar.

637
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,976
That's quite an agreeable
transmogrification.

638
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:03,979
- More like a... transfiguration.
- Ah! A super- metamorphosis.

639
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,038
<i>- Huh?
- Enough!</i>

640
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,607
- Both of you go to the desert!
- Excuse me, excuse me.

641
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,915
That hardly seems logical,
does it?

642
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,456
Perhaps we should stay
and formulate our own strategy.

643
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,424
Tete- a- tete, inner circle,
that sort of thing.

644
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:19,985
Here's what's logical to me.

645
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:24,227
If you do not return
with the plumbers and the rock...

646
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,563
I shall personally kill you.

647
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,338
- We're going.
- After you, Ignatius.

648
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:48,524
- It was your mother's.
- What do you know about my mother?

649
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:53,086
She was quite an inspiration...
to some.

650
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:58,157
When Koopa took over, she stole the rock
and smuggled you to the other side.

651
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,169
Then she died.

652
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,639
What about my father, is he alive?

653
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,302
It depends on what
you mean by living.

654
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,210
- What are you talking about?
- Listen to me.

655
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,683
I don't care
whose daughter you are.

656
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,188
Koopa thinks you're the only one
who can merge the dimensions.

657
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:23,818
I've waited too long
to let all this slip away.

658
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,372
- Well, you said the tunnel.
- I did not!

659
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,102
- I said parkway!
- But you meant the tunnel.

660
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,110
Go on, pick a direction.

661
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:42,476
Any direction you like.

662
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:46,916
Hey, that looks good. Over there, huh?
That's it. Let's die there.

663
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:50,682
Are the Goombas training with
the hand- held de- evolution gun?

664
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,724
- As we speak, sir.
- Excellent.

665
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:58,820
<i>After the merge it will be nice to see
the humans de- evolve, won't it?</i>

666
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:02,258
<i>What is it that they come from?
I keep forgetting.</i>

667
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,133
- It's mice or something.
- Apes, sir. Monkeys.

668
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:09,605
Disgusting mammals.

669
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,768
Your princess is here.

670
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:19,112
Well, my, my. Looks like you got up on
the wrong side of the nest this morning.

671
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,503
<i>- You're a...
- Go ahead and say it.</i>

672
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,029
Dinosaur.

673
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,544
Yoshi is a pet of the royal family.

674
00:51:20,612 --> 00:51:23,775
<i>You may pet him.
Just, uh...</i>

675
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:29,047
don't move your hands around
like a small wounded animal.

676
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,681
You must be the Great Koopa.

677
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,555
That I am.

678
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:38,357
Ruler of all that you see.

679
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:42,160
A few...
miserable streets and...

680
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,360
endless desert.

681
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:49,161
<i>You've done a lovely job.</i>

682
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,868
Well...

683
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:54,810
thank you.

684
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:57,575
Where's my father?

685
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:03,482
Um! Ah.

686
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,357
He's around.

687
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:12,362
You are so fresh.

688
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,888
And so clean.

689
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,561
Don't fight it.

690
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:23,767
You know you've always been
uncomfortable in the human world.

691
00:52:23,842 --> 00:52:28,506
And you've at least suspected
that you were...

692
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,571
different.

693
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,344
I've suspected a lot of things.
But not that I...

694
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:37,855
That you descended
from the dinosaurs.

695
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:40,447
And you know what they say...

696
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,584
about little girls, don't you?

697
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,720
- No.
- Hmm?

698
00:52:45,797 --> 00:52:48,527
They say they never forget...

699
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,092
the first time they're
kissed by a lizard.

700
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:59,400
Take her away.

701
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:03,277
<i>I'll need to... use her later.</i>

702
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:09,782
Throwback.

703
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,961
Plumbers. Affirmative!

704
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,331
Come, come, come, quickly!

705
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:27,971
- Quickly, after them, cousin!
- I'm with you, cousin.

706
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:32,305
Go forward!

707
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:34,311
That way, cuz!

708
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:39,049
Go right! Go right!

709
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:48,556
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- In the name of King Koopa.

710
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,924
- We arrest you!
- Surrender immediately!

711
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,692
If you two don't start talkin'...

712
00:53:54,766 --> 00:53:57,496
We gonna leave ya
to these guys... for lunch.

713
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,559
- Now, where's Daisy?
- No, no, no.

714
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:03,300
- Where's the rock, scalawag?
- Where's Daisy, butt breath?

715
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,308
Where's the rock,
overweening rogue?

716
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:08,004
- Not until you give us Daisy, biscuit head!
- Where is the rock?

717
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,206
Shut up!

718
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:15,219
Now, what's with this rock?

719
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,220
The rock is a piece
of a special meteorite...

720
00:54:17,288 --> 00:54:20,689
which was chipped off
upon impact 65 million years ago.

721
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:23,818
Once this rock is reinserted
into the meteorite...

722
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:26,455
our two dimensions will reunite
and we will become one.

723
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:29,329
And our cousin, Koopa, shall become
ruler of both our worlds.

724
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,334
I don't get it.

725
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:34,667
- Why didn't he come through before like you clowns?
- You fools!

726
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:38,368
It's been sealed off for years until
someone on your side blasted it open again.

727
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:42,136
Scapelli.

728
00:54:42,213 --> 00:54:44,875
What if we get you the rock?
Will you get us Daisy?

729
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:49,315
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yes...

730
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,855
I think that proposal would
mutually benefit both our parties.

731
00:54:51,923 --> 00:54:55,415
- Okay, now, hand over the rock.
- Someone took it.

732
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:58,826
By the bar. That lady with
the red spikes who mugged us...

733
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:02,525
- Was she corpulent? Very corpulent?
- No, she's just really round.

734
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,731
Ah- ha! Big Bertha,
the bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar!

735
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:32,620
Hey. Don't do that.
You'll hurt yourself.

736
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,594
Oh.

737
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:50,979
I guess we're both
prisoners here, huh?

738
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:57,646
<i>Look!
We'll hijack a sludge gulper...</i>

739
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:59,713
- and drive into the city!
- Then what?

740
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:02,589
First we get the rock, then
we'll take ya to Daisy in the tower.

741
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,489
Get your wrench.

742
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:11,762
Oh, man,
I lost all my tools!

743
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,600
Ah! Come on, let's go.

744
00:56:30,288 --> 00:56:33,223
Come on! What are you waitin' for?

745
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,216
It's clear.

746
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:06,279
- We did it! We did it!
- Yeah!

747
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:10,817
- I'm brilliant!
- For mammals, you guys are quite acceptable.

748
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:23,005
- Isn't this a little bit feminine?
- It was my ex- wife's.

749
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:25,008
But you wear this stuff?

750
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:28,170
- Yes, on occasion we have a date.
- Who do ya date, a canary?

751
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:34,847
<i># 'Tain't no big thing #</i>

752
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:39,720
<i># To wait for the bell to ring #</i>

Really? I am very disappointed

871
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:15,191
- Fascist!

872
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,961

Eat it.

01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:55,382
<i>Lena, look, I know
you don't want me here.</i>

905
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:57,984
So maybe...

906
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:02,455
I like this room, don't you?

907
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:06,798
It used to be my office until I...
got promoted.

908
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,930
<i>Koopa needed me close by,
you see.</i>

909
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:14,176
Lena, will you help me
get out of here?

910
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:18,442
Well, I think yes.

911
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:21,245
I'd love to get you out of here!

912
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,445
<i>- Why are you doing this?
- Because everyone...</i>

913
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,114
deserves what they've earned.

914
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:29,954
- And I've earned this.
- Ahh!

915
01:10:30,027 --> 01:10:32,257
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

916
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:21,540
Ten- hut!

917
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,040
Forward, march!

918
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:38,693
Vegetables.

919
01:11:44,234 --> 01:11:46,964
<i>- You!
- Yes, it's us!</i>

920
01:11:47,037 --> 01:11:48,971
Your Most Royal Highness, please!

921
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:51,371
<i>- Is it possible you could assist us in escaping?
- Help!</i>

922
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,409
- Help!
- We're on your side! Please, princess!

923
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:59,179
Help!

924
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:03,218
<i>Spikeasaurous, follow me!</i>

925
01:12:05,122 --> 01:12:08,148
- Where are you going?
- I have to help him.

926
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,729
Stand still.

927
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:17,893
- You stay, I'll go.
- Okay, I'll stay, you go.

928
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:19,902
- You stay, and I'll go.
- Okay, I'll go.

929
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:23,098
- Allow me.
- I hope he's all right.

930
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:26,336
Princess Daisy, we've always been
your "loyalest" supporters.

931
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,935
- We've been with your father since his demise.
- My father?

932
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:32,072
- What do you know about my father?
- Come with us!

933
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:40,222
- You tell her.
- No, I think you should tell her.

934
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:42,224
All right, we'll both tell her.

935
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:45,193
Daisy, I think this may come
as something of a shock.

936
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:49,995
Daisy, may I present to you...
your father.

937
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:56,070
- The fungus.
- Koopa's first victim of...

938
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:58,107
de- evolution.

939
01:12:58,175 --> 01:13:00,143
This is my father?

940
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,111
<i>Yes.</i>

941
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:08,311
- Perhaps at this moment of delicacy...
- A delicate moment.

942
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:10,853
- A retreat is in order.
- An ordered retreat.

943
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:15,690
- Those that fight and run away...
- Live to fight...

944
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:18,819
another day.

945
01:13:22,599 --> 01:13:24,533
<i>How did you know
they'd do that?</i>

946
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,796
'Cause everybody
loves to dance, that's why.

947
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:30,499
A dancin' lizard's like
dancin' crocodiles... Oh!

948
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:34,010
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Oh, man.</i>

949
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:37,308
Oh. Oh, I hate heights.

950
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,314
How we gonna get across?

951
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:42,317
- I can make it. I got a good feelin'.
- You're not gonna jump?

952
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:45,218
Come on, somebody's gotta do it.
We don't got no other choice, right?

953
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:47,950
<i>- Luigi, this is curtains for us. This is
not Miraculous World! - I- I gotta go for it!</i>

954
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:49,958
<i>- Luigi!
- Ahhh!</i>

955
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:58,126
<i>I'm flyin; Mario, I'm flyin;!</i>

956
01:13:58,201 --> 01:14:02,103
<i>Come on, come on, I told you.
All you had to do was trust. Come on.</i>

957
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:04,333
Just do it, come on.
Just have faith. Jump.

958
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:05,874
You're flyin'.

959
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,467
Come on, Mario, come on.
Just trust. Jump! Come on.

960
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,708
<i>- Okay, okay, I ju... just... yeah, okay.
- Come on, come on.</i>

961
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:16,478
No, no, wait, Mario.
Don't jump, no! It's not...

962
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:19,021
- I'm not flyin'! It's just a... hook.
- Ahhh!

963
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:22,991
<i>Mario!</i>

964
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:26,551
<i>- Luig...
- Oops. Sorry.</i>

965
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,497
<i>- Mario, I gotcha!
- Luigi!</i>

966
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:31,932
Ah! Luigi, I'm alive!

967
01:14:32,002 --> 01:14:35,028
<i>Good catch, huh, Mario?
I should try out for the Yankees!</i>

968
01:14:35,105 --> 01:14:39,371
I'd high- five ya,
but then you'd be an only child.

969
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:41,273
Come on,
let's go get Daisy.

970
01:14:41,344 --> 01:14:45,110
- Let's swing it over there. Yeah. Okay.
- Pull with me.

971
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,755
My father?

972
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:57,725
<i>What have they done to you?</i>

973
01:14:57,794 --> 01:15:01,525
Can you even hear me?

974
01:15:11,942 --> 01:15:14,467
Yoshi!

975
01:15:16,046 --> 01:15:18,241
Oh, look what she did to you.

976
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,414
Ah!

977
01:15:57,487 --> 01:15:59,421
<i>- Mario?
- Daisy?</i>

978
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:02,788
Luigi? Mario?

979
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:05,419
It's Daisy!
Daisy, we're comin'!

980
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:11,496
Let's get ya outta this.

981
01:16:11,568 --> 01:16:13,968
<i>Luigi? Mario?
Can you hear me?</i>

982
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:19,100
- Daisy, where are you?
- I'm in Devo Four.

983
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,939
Daisy.

984
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:29,179
- Oh, man, it's cold.
- It's workin'. It's freezin' up.

985
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,516
- Great.
- Boy.

986
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,751
- Hey, M- Mario, did you see that?
- What?

987
01:16:35,825 --> 01:16:40,489
It's tryin' to communicate.

988
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,727
Luigi, it's a mushroom.
Come on.

989
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:01,041
<i>Luigi! Here! Come back!</i>

990
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:04,746
<i>- There she is.
- In here! This way!</i>

991
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,855
<i>Good news, sir. The troops are in place,
ready to de- evolve the mammals.</i>

992
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:15,387
In place ready to what? Now?
Who ordered their deployment?

993
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:19,731
You did, sir. Lena relayed the command.
We carried it out immediately.

994
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:23,102
Lena.

995
01:17:23,173 --> 01:17:27,200
She has the rock.
Arrest her!

996
01:17:27,277 --> 01:17:29,211
- Daisy!
- Luigi, oh!

997
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:31,304
Later, let's get outta here.
This place is crawling alive...

998
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:33,747
- with giant lizards, come on!
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Listen.

999
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:36,911
I know this is gonna sound
a little strange, but...

1000
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,581
<i>I want you to meet...</i>

1001
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:43,353
my father.

1002
01:17:46,296 --> 01:17:48,856
Come on. Dad!

1003
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:56,605
<i>- Oh, man.
- Well, at least he was my father.</i>

1004
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:59,767
He used to be the leader here
until Koopa turned him into...

1005
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:02,778
all this... fungus.

1006
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:06,043
- Oh, man.
- It's an honor to meet you, sir...

1007
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:10,815
and a pleasure, and I just, just wanna
thank you for all your help.

1008
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:14,414
<i>Come on, Luigi, you be talkin'
to the mildew in the shower next.</i>

1009
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:17,016
But, Mario, don't you see, it's been
tryin' to help us all along.

1010
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:19,789
Giving us the little things
when we were hanging.

1011
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:21,990
Come on, he wants
to clobber Koopa too.

1012
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:26,058
- Oh, how's Daniella? Is she all right?
- Daniella?

1013
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:28,229
I promised to take her
to Wrestlemania.

1014
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:31,137
You mean, you don't know?

1015
01:18:32,142 --> 01:18:34,133
What?

1016
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:38,146
<i>She's in the Goomba barracks
on the 51 st floor.</i>

1017
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:47,914
<i>- Come on, Daisy, come on!
- Hi- de- ho, mammals!</i>

1018
01:18:47,991 --> 01:18:49,925
Goomba!

1019
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:52,325
<i>If you touch her I'll kill you!</i>

1020
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:55,091
I'll meet you in the playground
after school.

1021
01:18:55,165 --> 01:18:57,360
You murderer!

1022
01:18:57,434 --> 01:19:01,962
Now, your father's still...
hanging around, isn't he?

1023
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:04,598
<i>Prepare for the invasion!</i>

1024
01:19:04,674 --> 01:19:09,043
And ready the troops.
We're going down.

1025
01:19:09,112 --> 01:19:18,616
<i>Station closing.
Military personnel only.</i>

1026
01:19:18,688 --> 01:19:24,217
Hey, you. Open up!

1027
01:19:24,294 --> 01:19:27,730
<i>Restricted area.
No unauthorized personnel.</i>

1028
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,731
<i>Restricted area.</i>

1029
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:33,064
<i>No unauthorized personnel.</i>

1030
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:44,109
- Hello, Lena!
- Ah!

1031
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,149
- Greetings from Koopa!
- Ah!

1032
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:49,212
Ah, the rock.

1033
01:19:49,886 --> 01:19:52,548
<i>- Yeah, we get some blankets.
- Yeah, we're freezin' our, our...</i>

1034
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:55,249
<i>Look, the point is
we're freezin'here.</i>

1035
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:57,259
They are not gonna believe
this at work.

1036
01:19:57,327 --> 01:19:59,386
This is a violation
of our civil liberties.

1037
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:03,023
<i>Can't you get somebody
to fix the heating?</i>

1038
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:21,675
<i>- Hmpf!
- How can they let us suffer like this?</i>

1039
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:25,346
<i>- What are they, completely cold- blooded?
- Yes, moron. They're reptiles.</i>

1040
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:28,515
<i>Well, just because they're
reptiles, doesn't mean...</i>

1041
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,525
<i>They can't show some
basic human decency.</i>

1042
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:43,538
- Angelica, come here.
- What?

1043
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:47,633
Okay, don't say anything, but
my boyfriend, Mario, is right up there.

1044
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:50,042
- What?
- Shh!

1045
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:52,445
Hi, Mario!

1046
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,608
<i>He'll get us outta here!</i>

1047
01:20:58,121 --> 01:21:01,386
He- e- e- e- e- y, ya!

1048
01:21:01,457 --> 01:21:04,483
<i>- Oh, Mario, I knew you'd come for me!
- You betcha.</i>

1049
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:06,495
- Yes! You did it!
- Honey, listen.

1050
01:21:06,563 --> 01:21:09,088
Get that mattress, the Goomba mattress.
Take it over there.

1051
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:12,430
Come on, girls, get the Goomba mattress.
Pick it up, get that side.

1052
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:17,230
Move it, move it! Hey! Hey!

1053
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:19,241
<i>- It's heavy.
- Come on, bring it over here.</i>

1054
01:21:19,309 --> 01:21:21,402
<i>Very good!</i>

1055
01:21:21,477 --> 01:21:25,573
- Hurry!
- Hey, you must be the girls, the missing girls from Brooklyn!

1056
01:21:25,648 --> 01:21:27,639
Yeah, except for Angelica.
She's from Queens but she's all right.

1057
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:31,517
I'm freezin' my butt off here. There's
cold air comin' from that air vent.

1058
01:21:31,588 --> 01:21:34,751
Yeah, we froze the pipes.
We're goin' for a little ride.

1059
01:21:34,824 --> 01:21:36,849
Hail Koopa.

1060
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:46,693
Sir, I believe
you were looking for this.

1061
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:56,611
Excellent. Release Lena.

1062
01:21:56,679 --> 01:21:59,978
Princess! Ready to help me
destroy humankind?

1063
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:02,483
Muster the Goombas!

1064
01:22:02,552 --> 01:22:07,387
<i>Hand out the de- evolution guns.
Prepare for destiny!</i>

1065
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:11,626
Where's my pizza?

1066
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:54,035
- Goombas!
- Goombas!

1067
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:02,133
Down! Duck! Now!

1068
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,226
Gotcha!

1069
01:23:38,648 --> 01:23:40,639
Devo guns ready?

1070
01:24:06,476 --> 01:24:09,138
Are you all right?

1071
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:11,442
<i>- Are they all right?
- Right.</i>

1072
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:15,882
- Mario- roni!
- Daniella!

1073
01:24:15,952 --> 01:24:18,750
<i>Too late, humans!</i>

1074
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:22,052
<i>- Sir, you pizza's here.
- Not now.</i>

1075
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,593
Looks like I win.

1076
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,788
<i>Soon you and everyone
in your world...</i>

1077
01:24:27,864 --> 01:24:31,163
<i>- will all be de- evolved into...
- Sir? Sir?</i>

1078
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:34,260
<i>- What is it now?
- The Goombas are dancing again.</i>

1079
01:24:34,337 --> 01:24:37,329
<i>Deal with it!</i>

1080
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:40,967
<i>Will be de- evolved into...
monkeys. Ha!</i>

1081
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,943
Oof! Ahhhhh!

1082
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:50,918
Gimme that.

1083
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:03,892
<i>Die, plumbers!</i>

1084
01:25:03,966 --> 01:25:06,958
Work, work, work, work!

1085
01:25:07,036 --> 01:25:09,664
- Take my tools and get outta those handcuffs.
- Here, hold this.

1086
01:25:09,739 --> 01:25:12,970
<i>- Mario! Take my belt.
- What?</i>

1087
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:18,574
Trust the fungus.

1088
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:22,747
<i>Look out!</i>

1089
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:28,146
All right!
Yeah, heh- heh!

1090
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,825
Where are you?
Where are you?

1091
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:42,867
Ah!

1092
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:52,541
Ah!

1093
01:25:56,085 --> 01:25:59,248
Yes!

1094
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:05,060
You wanna rock,
I'll give ya a rock.

1095
01:26:15,304 --> 01:26:18,137
<i>- Where's the rock?
- Hey!</i>

1096
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:20,698
You lookin' for this?

1097
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:24,234
Give it to me.

1098
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:27,714
Gimme that rock, you monkey.
That's mine!

1099
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:30,115
<i>Give it to me!</i>

1100
01:26:32,355 --> 01:26:34,220
<i>- I'll show him...
- We've gotta stop her.</i>

1101
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:36,884
- Come on, girls, let's go.
- Who are you?

1102
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:39,826
Luigi Mario.
What, you got a problem with that?

1103
01:26:39,896 --> 01:26:41,488
- I don't got a problem.
- No.

1104
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:45,500
Okay, come on, let's go.

1105
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:51,234
My time is come!
The universe is mine!

1106
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:55,403
Die, die, you mammal!
You give me that rock!

1107
01:27:06,088 --> 01:27:09,489
Ahhh!

1108
01:27:16,832 --> 01:27:20,461
My time has come!

1109
01:27:20,536 --> 01:27:23,630
And the rock will merge
our two dimensions. Lena, don't!

1110
01:27:23,706 --> 01:27:25,970
You're too late.

1111
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:31,139
You see, I do have the power
to merge the worlds, Princess.

1112
01:27:31,213 --> 01:27:33,773
- It's not too late. We've gotta stop her.
- All right.

1113
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:35,817
<i>Come on, girls,
come on, let's go!</i>

1114
01:27:35,885 --> 01:27:38,979
- Where are we going?
- Back from where you came. Come on, move it, this way!

1115
01:27:42,558 --> 01:27:45,959
Come and get it, lizard breath!

1116
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:53,724
- It's a B- bomb!
- He's got a B- bomb!

1117
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:59,137
B- bomb?

1118
01:28:23,099 --> 01:28:26,034
<i>Messed up again, mammal.</i>

1119
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:38,369
All right. Come on.
Come and get it.

1120
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:42,679
<i>Come on. Come on, ruffle head,
let's see what you're made of.</i>

1121
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:53,194
- Don't look down. Don't look down.
- Get outta my way!

1122
01:28:53,262 --> 01:28:55,389
- Go on. You've gotta get through and tell everybody!
- Go!

1123
01:28:55,464 --> 01:28:59,059
<i>Go back to Brooklyn. Tell 'em about
the invasion and the Goombas!</i>

1124
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:03,229
- Oh!
- Good luck, Luigi!

1125
01:29:03,305 --> 01:29:06,399
It's incredible!

1126
01:29:10,413 --> 01:29:12,381
Uh.

1127
01:29:15,885 --> 01:29:17,910
Yikes.

1128
01:29:17,987 --> 01:29:20,547
Man, she sure makes
an impression.

1129
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,616
That's what Koopa meant.

1130
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,924
Only I can withstand the force.

1131
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:31,262
- Come on.
- No!

1132
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:34,632
I- It's jammed in.
I can't get it.

1133
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:38,935
Luigi, we've gotta stop it.
We've gotta get it out.

1134
01:29:39,008 --> 01:29:42,500
Grab on to me!

1135
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:47,775
Come and get it.

1136
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:52,411
<i>Uh- oh.</i>

1137
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:58,986
Oh. It's melting.

1138
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:05,366
We're merging.
You don't have the rock!

1139
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:09,598
You filthy mammal.

1140
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:19,773
We're merging!

1141
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:25,686
I'm gonna drill it out!

1142
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,154
- Gimme the wheel puller. It looks like a corkscrew.
- This?

1143
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,057
Yeah.

1144
01:30:31,127 --> 01:30:34,062
Hold on to me, all right?

1145
01:30:39,268 --> 01:30:42,726
Look!
It's Koopa's tower!

1146
01:30:42,805 --> 01:30:44,796
Those guys'll do
anything for publicity.

1147
01:30:50,546 --> 01:30:52,480
Mario?

1148
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:58,412
<i>It's Brooklyn! My world!</i>

1149
01:30:59,989 --> 01:31:02,014
Gimme that devo gun.

1150
01:31:06,495 --> 01:31:10,056
- He's trying again?
- What is this?

1151
01:31:13,502 --> 01:31:15,561
Monkey!

1152
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:19,034
Scapelli?

1153
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:33,714
Boss! What'd they do to you?

1154
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:37,782
And now,
I'm gonna make a monkey...

1155

<i>- outta you, plumber.

1157
01:32:14,063 --> 01:32:16,463
B- bomb!

1158
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:26,204
Take a gun. Go.

1159
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:28,869
- What are you doin'?
- It's okay.

1160

Stupid!

1164
01:33:11,587 --> 01:33:14,021
Ahhh! Plumbers!

1165
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:22,722
You plumbers!

1166
01:33:23,966 --> 01:33:27,458

See ya later, alligator!

1169
01:35:07,736 --> 01:35:09,931

- What?

1170
01:35:10,005 --> 01:35:13,668
- Come on, get on my feet.
- Oh, right.

1171

Oh, Luigi, Mario.

1172

Oh, I'm back.

1173
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:10,060
Love those plumbers.

1174

All right.
Come on, let's go.

1176

I can't.

1177
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:46,290
You mean, you wanna stay?

1178
01:36:46,368 --> 01:36:48,734
Until we can get things
settled here and...

1179
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:51,136
I can get to know my father.

1180
01:36:51,206 --> 01:36:55,040
Come on, Daisy, you know
how I feel about you, right?

1181
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:57,670
I wanna be with you.

1182
01:36:57,746 --> 01:37:02,376
I do too, but... I can't.

1183
01:37:02,451 --> 01:37:06,683
She's tryin' to tell ya she can't leave
here until she knows where she belongs.

1184
01:37:06,755 --> 01:37:10,054
<i>And if you loved her,
you'd understand that.</i>

1185
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:15,892
<i>And if I had any sense,
I'd mind my own business.</i>

Bye.

Judge for yourself.
Alternate worlds...

1193

Hey, I love that dress.
I never seen that before.

1194
01:38:26,334 --> 01:38:29,626
That's what you said
last time you saw it, Mr. Wonderful.

<i>Luigi. Are you gonna stop

and save a parallel world
from a ruthless dictator.

1202

Monkey- fried to the max.
