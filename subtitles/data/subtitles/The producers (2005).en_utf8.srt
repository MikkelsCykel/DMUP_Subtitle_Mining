<i>-Opening night</i>
<i>-Opening night</i>

2
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:44,308
<i>It's opening night</i>

3
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,309
<i>It's Max Bialystock's latest show</i>

4
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,314
<i>Will it flop or will it go?</i>

5
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,484
<i>The cast is taking its final bow</i>

6
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,487
<i>Here comes the audience now</i>

7
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,324
<i>The doors are open</i>
<i>They're on their way</i>

8
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,951
<i>Let's hear what they have to say</i>

9
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,997
<i>He's done it again</i>
<i>He's done it again</i>

10
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,002
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

11
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,089
<i>We can't believe it</i>

12
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,175
<i>You can't conceive it</i>

13
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,929
<i>How'd he achieve it?</i>

14
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,560
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

15
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,524
<i>We sat there sighing</i>

16
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,604
<i>Groaning and crying</i>

17
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,228
<i>There's no denying</i>

18
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,532
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

19
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,743
<i>Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss</i>

20
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:47,746
<i>We've seen shit</i>
<i>But never like this</i>

21
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,163
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

22
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,383
<i>The songs were rotten</i>
<i>The book was stinkin'</i>

23
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,963
<i>What he did to Shakespeare</i>
<i>Booth did to Lincoln</i>

24
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,098
We had this specially made up
for Max Bialystock.

25
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,933
<i>We couldn't leave faster</i>

26
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,360
<i>What a disaster</i>

27
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,323
<i>We are still in shock</i>

28
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,023
<i>Who produced this schlock?</i>

29
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:27,238
<i>That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock</i>

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,493
<i>What a bum</i>

31
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,470
Hello?

32
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,091
Mr. Bialystock?

33
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,351
Anybody here?

34
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,435
Mr. Bialystock?

35
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,862
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

36
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,200
What do you want?

37
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,785
Speak to me, dummy. Speak!

38
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,497
Why don't you speak?

39
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,868
Scared. Can't talk.

40
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,381
All right, I'm sorry.

41
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,426
I'm sorry. Calm down. Get ahold
of yourself. Come with me.

42
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,304
Come on. Come on.

43
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,633
Come on, right this way.
Watch your step.

44
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,843
Look, just--

45
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,303
Take a deep breath.

46
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,645
Let it out slowly.

47
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,608
-Who are you?
-I am Leopold Bloom.

48
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,278
I'm an accountant.
I'm from Whitehall & Marks...

49
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,741
-...and I've come to do your books.
-Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen--

50
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,954
-Who is it?
-Hold Me-Touch Me.

51
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,166
Hold Me-Touch Me.
One of my backers.

52
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,377
Listen, I have to meet
with an important investor.

53
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,830
Do me a big favour,
go to the bathroom.

54
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,841
-But I don't have to go.
-Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls.

55
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,554
Be with you in a moment,
my darling.

56
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,270
Hold Me-Touch Me.
Where is Hold Me-Touch Me?

57
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,107
Kiss Me-Feel Me,
Clinch Me-Pinch Me...

58
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,563
...Lick Me-Bite Me, Suck Me--

59
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,651
Here she is. Hold Me-Touch Me.

60
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,864
You know, it worked.
As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls...

61
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,783
-...I didn't have any trouble at all--
-Back. Back. Don't make a sound.

62
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,037
Coming. Coming.

63
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,309
Hello, gorgeous.

64
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,853
-Hold me, touch me.
-As soon as I shut the door.

65
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,194
Did you bring the checkie?

66
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,324
Bialy can't produce plays
without checkies.

67
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,911
Here you go.

68
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,252
But first,
can we please play a game?

69
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,334
One dirty little game.

70
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,761
All right, my little sex kitten.

71
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,631
What shall we play?

72
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,805
The Debutante and the Bricklayer?

73
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,760
-Oh, no.
-No.

74
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,384
How about the Rabbi
and the Contortionist?

75
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,605
You like that one, mama,
keeps you limber.

76
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,061
I know.

77
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:46,614
Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid
and the Well-Hung Stableboy.

78
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,984
I don't think I have the strength.

79
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:08,291
...this milk is so heavy.
I'll never reach the house.

80
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,130
You there, well-hung stableboy.

81
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,883
Won't you please help me?

82
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,107
Of course, my little dairy queen.

83
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,900
First I'll take your milk.

84
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,398
Then I shall take your virginity!

85
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,484
No! No! Never! Never!

86
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,538
Yes. Yes.

87
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,321
Give it to me, well-hung!
Give it to me.

88
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,164
Darling, wait,
I haven't even had coffee yet.

89
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,840
Yes. Yes, my darling.
Thursday. Come back Thursday.

90
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:58,351
I'll send you to the moon Thursday.
I may even join you.

91
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,684
But first, the checkie.

92
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,764
Where's the checkie?
Come on, come on, find the checkie.

93
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,267
Here you go.

94
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:15,113
I made it out, like you told me,
to the title of the play:

95
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,822
<i>-Cash.</i>
-Yes.

96
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,825
That's a funny name
for a play, <i>Cash</i>.

97
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,793
Yes, so was <i>The Iceman Cometh.</i>

98
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,710
I'll see you Thursday.

99
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,964
-Bye.
-Bye. Bye.

100
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,129
Yes, yes, yes.

101
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,137
You dirty old buzzard.

102
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,481
May I come out of the bathroom now,
Mr. Bialystock?

103
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,649
-Yeah, sure.
-I'm terribly sorry I caught you...

104
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,393
-...feeling up the old lady.
-" Feeling up the old lady."

105
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,606
Thank you, Mr. Tact.

106
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,908
-May I take your coat?
-Oh, thank you.

107
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,993
So you're an accountant, huh?

108
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,571
-Yes, sir. I am, sir.
-Then account for yourself!

109
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,827
Why are you looking up little
old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert?

110
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,710
I know what you're thinking.

111
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,590
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts.

112
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,170
-Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn--
-Shut up!

113
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,875
I'm having a rhetorical conversation.

114
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:18,223
-Do you know who I used to be?
-Well, yes. You're Max Bialystock...

115
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,810
-...the king of Broadway.
-No, I'm Max Bialy-- That's right.

116
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,022
-That's right.
-And might I say, Mr. Bialystock--

117
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,688
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

118
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,571
-...but you're not just a dirty old man.
-Thank you.

119
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,899
Oh, you're also
a great Broadway producer.

120
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,951
And there's something about me
you should know.

121
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,655
When I was a kid...

122
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,821
...I had the good fortune
to be taken to <i>Bialy-Hoos of '42</i>.

123
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,034
-Oh, <i>Bialy-Hoos</i>.
-Yes.

124
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,123
And I still have the ticket stub.

125
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,248
-Oh, look at that.
-Yeah.

126
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,550
And ever since,
I've had a secret desire...

127
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,632
...to be a Broadway producer.

128
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,255
A secret desire, huh?

129
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,809
-Kid, can I give you some advice?
-Yes, sir.

130
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,428
Keep it a secret.
Do the books, please.

131
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,724
Top drawer, to the left.

132
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,907
Oh, my God.

133
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,952
Will you look at that.

134
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:25,203
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

135
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,580
Mr. Bialystock,
may I speak to you a minute?

136
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,707
-A minute?
-Yes.

137
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:33,168
-Just one minute?
-Yes.

138
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,422
-Okay.
-ln glancing at your books...

139
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,969
-Go! You have 58 seconds left.
-...I noticed that in the column--

140
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,469
-You're gonna time it?
-Time is money.

141
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,850
I looked at your books and the
columns marked "monies received."

142
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,015
-And I can't make the figures work out.
-Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.

143
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,814
-There's a problem with your figures.
-Twenty-eight. Running out of time.

144
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,352
-Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
-I cannot--

145
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,610
-Fifteen seconds.
-I cannot-- I can't function.

146
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,073
-I cannot function in these conditions.
-Five, four, three, two, one.

147
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,251
What? This? No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

148
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:13,708
Well, if it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

149
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:18,374
My blanket. My blue blanket!

150
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,086
Give me back my blue blanket!

151
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:27,139
Give me my blanket! Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give me the blanket.

152
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,062
Give it to me! Give it to me!

153
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,350
Here, here, here.

154
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:36,854
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't panic.

155
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,029
I....

156
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,438
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,494
It's just that I don't like anyone
touching my blue blanket.

158
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,906
It's not important,
it's a minor compulsion.

159
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,950
I can deal with it if I want to.

160
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,829
But I've had it ever since I was a baby,
and I find it very comforting.

161
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,420
I need to lie down for a minute now.

162
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,256
They come here. They all come here.

163
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,926
How do they find me?

164
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,892
Hey, kid. Hey.

165
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,979
Look at this.

166
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,605
How can I help you?

167
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,228
-What's wrong?
-You're gonna jump on me.

168
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,240
-What?
-You're gonna jump on me.

169
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,282
I know you're gonna jump on me
and squash me like a bug.

170
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,405
-Oh, God.
-Please, don't jump on me!

171
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,244
I'm not gonna jump on you!
I'm not gonna jump on you!

172
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,081
Get ahold of yourself!
Stop it! Stop it!

173
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,288
Stop! Calm down!

174
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,664
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

175
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,003
-What's the matter now?
-I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.

176
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,514
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

177
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,308
I can see that.
All right. All right, calm down.

178
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,892
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Take it easy.

179
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,408
I'm wet!

180
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,322
I'm wet.
I'm hysterical and I'm wet!

181
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,831
I'm in pain.

182
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,951
I'm in pain, I'm wet...

183
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,742
...and I'm still hysterical.

184
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:21,421
All right, all right. What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

185
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,833
Move away, you frighten me.

186
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,333
-You're too close.
-I frighten you?

187
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,172
Yes, get over there and stop
touching-- Move over there! Sit down.

188
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,633
I'm sitting, I'm sitting.

189
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,430
You still look angry.

190
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,516
I'm sorry. How's this?

191
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,734
Who's my little accountant?

192
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,981
Who's my little accountant?

193
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,034
Are you my little accountant?
Are you my little accountant?

194
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,039
-Are you my little accountant?
-I am.

195
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,242
Yes, you are.

196
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,045
Well, thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

197
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,799
Well, you know what they say:

198
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,128
"Smile and the world smiles
with you."

199
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,550
This man should be
in a straightjacket.

200
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,552
-You feeling better?
-Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.

201
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,224
-Good.
-May I speak to you?

202
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,644
Yes, Prince Myshkin.
What can we do for you?

203
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,225
Well, this is hardly
the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.

204
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,352
I've discovered a serious error...

205
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,275
...in the accounts of your last show,
<i>Funny Boy</i>.

206
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,242
-Where? What?
-Well, according to the backers list...

207
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:33,659
...you raised $100,000.
But your show only cost 98,000.

208
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,617
There's 2000 unaccounted for.

209
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,289
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares?

210
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,745
The show was a flop.
Bloom, do me a favour...

211
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,463
...move a few decimal points around.
You can do it, you're an accountant.

212
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,590
You're part of a noble profession.
The word "count" is part of your title.

213
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,592
-That's cheating.
-It's not cheating.

214
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,468
It's charity.

215
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,724
Bloom...

216
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,431
...you see this stickpin?

217
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,055
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye.

218
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:05,518
I used to wear handmade
ltalian shoes, $500 suits.

219
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:06,770
And look at me now.

220
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,319
Look at me now!
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

221
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,751
Bloom, you gotta save me.

222
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,205
I'm reaching out to you.

223
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,125
Don't send me to prison.

224
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,005
Help me.

225
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,343
All right. All right.
Okay, I'll do it.

226
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,970
-Really?
-Yes, I'll do it.

227
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,890
See, $2000 isn't so much.

228
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,014
I'm sure I can hide it someplace.

229
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:44,732
After all, the lRS isn't interested
in a show that flopped.

230
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,984
Right. Good thinking.

231
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,815
You figure it out.
I'm gonna take a little nap.

232
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,773
Now, let's see.

233
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,244
Let's see, if we add up
these deductions, we get....

234
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,994
Carry the three, divide by four....

235
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,498
Amazing.

236
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,169
It's absolutely amazing, but...

237
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,925
...under the right circumstances...

238
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,672
...a producer could
make more money with a flop...

239
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,927
...than he could with a hit.

240
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,591
Yes, it's quite possible. lf he were
certain that a show would fail...

241
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,182
...a man could make a fortune.

242
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,269
-Yes?
-Yes, what?

243
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,268
-What you were saying. Keep talking.
-What was I saying?

244
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,978
You were saying that a producer...

245
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,519
...could make more money
with a flop than a hit.

246
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,363
Well, yes. It's quite possible.

247
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,732
You keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

248
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,818
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

249
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:40,538
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

250
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,948
Assume away.

251
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,502
All right. When you produced
your last show, <i>Funny Boy</i>...

252
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,465
...you raised $2000
more than you needed.

253
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,466
But you could've raised a million...

254
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,382
...put on your $100,000 flop
and kept the rest.

255
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,550
-But what if my show was a hit?
-Then you would go to jail.

256
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,889
See, rather than 100 percent
of the show...

257
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,260
...you would've sold
more than 1000 percent.

258
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,014
So if the show's a success,
there's no way to pay off the backers.

259
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,727
-Get it?
-Got it.

260
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,146
So in order for our scheme to work,
we'd have to find a sure-fire flop.

261
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,155
"Our schem<i>e''</i>? What scheme?

262
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,271
What scheme?

263
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,363
Your scheme,
you bloody little genius.

264
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:21,078
I meant no scheme. I merely posed
a little academic accounting theory.

265
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,414
-It was just a thought.
-Bloom...

266
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,746
...worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

267
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,498
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.

268
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,915
It's so simple.

269
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,460
Step one,
we find the worst play ever written.

270
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,802
Step two,
we hire the worst director in town.

271
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,809
-Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.
-Two?

272
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,434
Yes, one for me, one for you. There's
a lot of little old ladies out there.

273
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,932
Step four, we hire the worst actors
in New York and open on Broadway.

274
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,771
And before you can say "step fiv<i>e,''</i>
we close on Broadway...

275
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,857
...take our 2 million and go to Rio.

276
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:55,611
Rio? That'd never work.

277
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,233
Oh, ye of little faith.

278
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,661
<i>What did Lewis say to Clark</i>
<i>When everything looked bleak?</i>

279
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,583
<i>What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing</i>

280
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,629
<i>As they struggled</i>
<i>Toward Everest's peak?</i>

281
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,630

282
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,833

00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:16,751
<i>I'm sure you're well aware</i>

284
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,715
What'd they say?

285
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,719
<i>We can do it</i>

286
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,762
<i>We can do it</i>

287
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:28,059
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>Me and you</i>

288
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,899
<i>We can do it</i>

289
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,983
<i>We can do it</i>

290
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,398

00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,987

<i>Caressing you, undressing you</i>
<i>And driving you mad</i>

295
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,455
No.

296
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,706
Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.

297
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,508
Hear me out. Just think about it.

298
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,767
Stop!

307
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,504
What do you say, Bloom?

308
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,216
<i>What do I say?</i>

309
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:46,015
<i>Finally, a chance to be</i>
<i>A Broadway producer</i>

<i>I can't do it</i>

<i>That's not me</i>

<i>I'm a coward</i>

Don't you ever wanna become

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,614
-Where to?
-Central Park.

325
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,534

00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,758
<i>-We can do it</i>
<i>-I cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot do it</i>

340
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:46,341
<i>'Cause I know it's gonna fail</i>

341
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,677
Fail? How could it miss?
All you need is a little courage.

342
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,432
Bloom, you know what you are?
You're like a--

343
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,438
You're like a....

344
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:59,812
You're like a fountain waiting
to explode and shoot into the sky!

345
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,519
-I'm a fountain?
-Yes, you're a fountain!

346
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:07,484
Don't you realize? There's a lot more
to you than there is to you.

347
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:11,652
Mr. Bialystock, I'm afraid you've made
a terribl<i>e e</i>rror in judgment.

348
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,198
You've mistaken me
for someone with a spine.

349
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,087
I'm going back
to Whitehall & Marks now.

350
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,629
-Goodbye forever.
-Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute! Bloom.

351
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,179
Think about it. You'll never get a cab
at this hour! Bloom.

352
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,887
Oh, Lord. Dear Lord...

353
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,891
...I want that money!

<i>Unhappy</i>

355
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,544

00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,188
Bloom!

359
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,106
Where the hell have you been?

360
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,026
You are six minutes late.
This is an accounting firm...

361
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,195
...not a country club.
You can't come and go as you please.

362
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:35,574
-Yes, Mr. Marks.
-Remember, you're a nobody.

363
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,574
A PA. A public accountant.

364
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:45,133
And I am a CPA.
A certified public accountant.

365
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:50,506
A rank a miserable little worm like
yourself could never hope to achieve.

366
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,260
Yes, Mr. Marks.
Thank you for speaking to me.

367
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,969
You're welcome.

368
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,976
What are you gawking at?

369
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:59,429
You never saw a person
humiliated before?

370
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:03,562
Now, get back to work. All of you!

00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:33,385
<i>-It figures, not much</i>
<i>-Unhappy</i>

377
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:39,933
<i>I have a secret desire</i>
<i>Hiding deep in my soul</i>

378
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:43,350
<i>It sets my heart afire</i>

379
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:48,727
<i>To see me in this role</i>

380
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,581
<i>I wanna be a producer</i>

381
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,410

<i>I wanna be a producer</i>
<i>And say, ''You, you, you--''</i>

389
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:01,513
Not you.

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,557

Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold everything.

419
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,452
Hold everything!

420
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:51,327
What am I doing here?
Mr. Bialystock was right.

421
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,625
There is a lot more to me
than there is to me.

422
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:59,165
Stop the world, I wanna get on!

423
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,167
What the hell is going on in here?

424
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:08,428
Do I smell the revolting stench
of self-esteem?

425
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,477
Bloom,
where do you think you're going?

426
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:15,186
You've already had
your toilet break.

427
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:19,526
I'm not going into the toilet.
I'm going into show business.

428
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,862
And, Mr. Marks,
I have news for you. I quit!

429
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,612
And you were right about one thing,
you are a CPA.

430
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,076
-A certified public asshole!
-Hooray!

431
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,569
Here's my visor...

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,040

I'm back! I'm back.
I've changed my mind.

440
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,913
Boy, you are good.

441
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,328
-Who are you talking to?
-Never mind, just an old friend.

442
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,708
-What happened?
-Oh, just this--

443
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:27,543
Just this: When I said that I was
scared that I was gonna go to jail...

444
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:31,594
...I didn't realize
that I already was in jail.

445
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,595
I've spent my life counting
other people's money.

446
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,017
People I'm smarter than...

447
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,938
...better than.

448
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:42,019
When's Leopold Bloom
gonna get his share?

449
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:47,063
When's it gonna be Bloom's day?
I want-- I want--

450
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:54,076
I want everything
I'v<i>e e</i>ver seen in the movies.

451
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,958
And, Leo, you're gonna have it.
Because....

462
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,509
Oh, Max, let's give up.
I can't read anymore.

463
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:53,219
-How many plays can a person read?
-Stop complaining.

464
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:55,507
We have to find the worst play
ever written.

465
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:57,634
-I've been reading all night.
-Who cares?

466
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:01,056
You wanna be a producer, read,
read. Keep reading.

467
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,810
Here's one.

468
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,853
Act I, scene one.

469
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,608
"Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to discover...

470
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:14,200
...that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach."

471
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,653
No, too good.

472
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:24,666
" But how could you see me?
The glass was frosted."

473
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:28,711
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've read this before.

474
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:33,089
I think I've read this one before.
What's it called? What's it called?

475
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:34,882
<i>The Frosted Glass.</i>

476
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,719
Max, I'm reading plays
that I read last night, Max.

477
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:39,891
I can't go on anymore.
It's too much.

478
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,721
Let's face it, we'll never find it.

479
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:55,032
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

480
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:58,244
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

481
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,740
Leo. Leo. See it? Smell it.

482
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,663
Touch it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

483
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,158
It's the mother lode.

484
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:08,419
-What is it? You found a flop?
-A flop.

485
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,375
That's putting it mildly.

486
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:12,300
This is a catastrophe.

487
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,971
A disaster certain to offend peoples
of all races, creeds and religions.

488
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:20,385
A guaranteed-to-close-in-one-night
beauty.

489
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:23,353
-Well, let's see it.
-Here.

490
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,397
<i>''Springtime for Hitler...</i>

491
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,442
...a gay romp with Eva and Adolf
at Berchtesgaden."

492
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:37,114
Oh, my God.

493
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:38,947
"Oh, my God" is right.

494
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,163
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

495
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,956
-Max, this won't run a week.
-A week? Are you kidding?

496
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,620
This play has got to close
on page four.

497
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,215
What's the author's name again?

498
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:55,802
" Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street,
New York, New York."

499
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:59,097
Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street.

500
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:03,803
Let's go. We'll get the Broadway
rights to <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>...

501
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,096
...even if we have to go so far
as to pay him.

502
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,811
-Come on.
-This other hat, Max...

503
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,485
...may I wear it?

504
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,734
-No, you may not.
-Why?

505
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:18,194
Because that
is a Broadway producer's hat.

506
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,817
You don't get to wear
a Broadway producer's hat, son...

507
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,326
...until you're a Broadway producer.

508
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,331
And you're not
a Broadway producer until--

509
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,911
I know, I know. Until I've produced
a show on Broadway.

510
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,829
But I'm going to wear that hat,
and soon too, because....

511
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,050
<i>We're gonna be the producers</i>

512
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:40,341
<i>Of a great big Broadway flop</i>

513
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:49,981
<i>Ja, ja</i>, my <i>Lieblings</i>.

514
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:55,861
Let me grab you here.

515
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,148
We have work to do.

516
00:35:58,366 --> 00:36:02,530
Hilda, my darling. Here, I have
written an important message...

517
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:06,660
...which must reach
Ernst Schlongdorf.

518
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,955
29 West Santiago Boulevard...

519
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:13,543
...Buenos Aires, Argentina.

520
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,666
AQAP.

521
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,508
As quick as possible.

522
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,671
Good.

523
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:24,388
Fly, Hilda. Fly!

524
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:27,052
Hilda, where are you going?

525
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,726
Argentina's that way!

526
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,482
Okay, chow time.

527
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,069
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Goes right into your belly.

528
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:44,238
It's just a hunch,
but I'm betting this is our man.

529
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:48,831
Max, he's wearing a German helmet
and lederhosen.

530
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,877
Yeah, I know. Don't notice them.
Don't notice anything.

531
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,919
Always look straight ahead.
Remember, we need that play.

532
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,423
Franz Liebkind?

533
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,756
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party!

534
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,467
I only followed orders.

535
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:07,055
I had nothing to do with the war.

536
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,261
I didn't even know
there was a war on.

537
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:11,806
We lived in the back...

538
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,648
...right across from Switzerland.

539
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,147
All w<i>e e</i>ver heard was yodelling.

540
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,277
-Who are you?!
-Relax.

541
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,618
Mr. Liebkind,
we're not from the government.

542
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,119
We're producers,
Bialystock and Bloom...

543
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,085
-...here to talk to you about your play.
-My play?

544
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,964
You mean <i>Springtime for</i>...

545
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,623
-...you-know-who?
-That's the one.

546
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,961
-What about it?
-We love it. Don't we love it?

547
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:45,547
-We think it's a masterpiece.
-We want to put it on Broadway.

548
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:49,300
Broadway! Oh, joy of joys.

549
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,975
Dream of dreams. I can't believe it.

550
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,853
...Adolf.

551
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,531
Do you hear?

552
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:06,156
We are finally going to clear
the Führer's name.

553
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:09,572
Broadway!

554
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,245
You know,
not many people know this...

555
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,160
-...but the Führer was a terrific dancer.
-Really?

556
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,212
-We didn't know that, did we, Leo?
-No, no, we sure didn't.

557
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:25,127
That's because you were taken in
by the BBC!

558
00:38:25,347 --> 00:38:28,431
Filthy British lies!

559
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:33,185
But did they ever say a bad word
about Winston Churchill?

560
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,685
Churchill!

561
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:41,151
With his cigars, with his brandy
and his rotten paintings.

562
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,857
Rotten!

563
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:44,353
Hitler.

564
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:46,234
There was a painter.

565
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,368
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon.

566
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:51,488
Two coats.

567
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,995
Yes. Yes.

568
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,497
Yes, of course he could,
Mr. Liebkind.

569
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,498
And that is exactly why
we wanna produce your play.

570
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:02,881
Show the world the true Hitler.
The Hitler you loved...

571
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:06,711
...the Hitler you knew,
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

572
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,966
Here, Franz Liebkind.
Sign here...

573
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:12,389
...and make your dream a reality.

574
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,643
-No.
-That's what <i>''nein''</i> means.

575
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:19,805
First you must prove to me
that you believe as I believe...

576
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:24,569
...by joining with me and singing and
dancing the Führer's favourite tune:

577
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,738
" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

578
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,076
I know.

579
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,574
-" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"?
-" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop."

580
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:33,781
No. I could never sing
the Führer's favourite...

581
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,161
Delighted. Delighted.

582
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,996
-...song.
-Shut up, he's almost ready to sign.

583
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:41,580
All right. First you will roll up
your pants.

584
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,424
-Rolling?
-Rolling.

585
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:48,878
-Don't be stingy. Show some leg.
-Alrighty.

586
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,342
-Good.
-Good.

587
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:52,466
-Key of E?
-ls there any other?

588
00:39:56,813 --> 00:40:00,264
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

589
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:04,066
<i>Ach, du lieber</i>
<i>Und oh, boy</i>

590
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,944
<i>Guten Tag clap clap</i>
<i>Guten Tag slap slap</i>

591
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,731
<i>Ach, du lieber</i>
<i>What a joy</i>

592
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:15,365
<i>Oh, wir essen und fressen</i>
<i>Und tanzen und trinken</i>

593
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:19,117
<i>Tanzen und trinken</i>
<i>Until we get stinkin'</i>

594
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:22,005
-Everybody!
<i>-Guten Tag hop hop</i>

595
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:23,672
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

596
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:27,673
<i>Guten Tag</i>
<i>Mein lieber Schatz</i>

597
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:31,385
<i>So we hop our hops</i>
<i>Und we clop our clops</i>

598
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:35,975
<i>Und we drink our Schnaps</i>
<i>Till we platz</i>

599
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,759
You will sway?

600
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:42,560
We will sway.

601
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,657
Follow me.

602
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:53,695
Very good.

603
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:12,504
Whatever you say.

604
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:16,182
<i>This is a tricky one</i>

605
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:34,858
Oh, the Hop-Clop.
It's been so long!

606
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:42,163
Sort of a Nazi hoedown.

607
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:52,546
Gentlemen, you may
produce my play.

608
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,347
Excellent. Excellent.

609
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,845
Here we are. Here.

610
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:01,852
But only if you take
the Siegfried Oath.

611
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,890
The Siegfried Oath?
What's that?

612
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:07,523
A pledge of eternal allegiance
to our beloved Führer.

613
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,016
Never...

614
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,313
...took that oath before.

615
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:14,947
One for me, one for you,
<i>und</i> one for you.

616
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,493
Never-- Had one of those on before.
Thanks very much.

617
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,994
-You're welcome.
-Nice colours.

618
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:22,915
Oh, look, reversible.

619
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,582
-Oh, yeah, you're right.
-Max.

620
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:28,333
Max, we never
should have started this.

621
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:30,671
I think we're getting in too deep.

622
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,876
Too deep? This is nothing.

623
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:35,764
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

624
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:37,466
All right.

625
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:40,173
First, you will raise
your right forefinger...

626
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,433
...<i>und</i> repeat after me.

627
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,018
I solemnly swear...

628
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,850
-I solemnly swear...
-I solemnly swear...

629
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:52,105
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

630
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:56,272
-...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.
-...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

631
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,284
<i>-Und...</i>
<i>-Und...</i>

632
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,693

...never, never, never...

-...never, never, never...

00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:13,382
...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the memory
of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

636
00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:16,760
-...dishonour the spirit <i>und</i> the--

-Elizabeth?
-Elizabeth?

638
00:43:18,515 --> 00:43:22,429
<i>Ja</i>, that was his middle name.

639
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,304
Not many people know this...

640
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:30,808
...but the Führer was descended
from a long line of English queens.

641
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:37,363
ls that right?

642
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:40,160
Yes.

643
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:43,497
-Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.
-Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

644
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:47,076
-Good. Now I sign your contract.
-Excellent! Excellent.

645
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:50,378
Here we are, sir.
Right here on the dotted line.

646
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,005
There you are.
You shall never regret this.

647
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:56,170
So thank you, Herr Liebkind.
Alrighty, then.

648
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:58,260
Thank you.

649
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,430
Let it go. Let it go.

650
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,268
Halt!

651
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:06,854
I forgot to tell you.

652
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:12,517
The penalty for breaking
the Siegfried Oath...

653
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,859
...is dess.

654
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:16,863
" Dess"?

655
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:18,781
ls that anything lik<i>e ''</i>death"?

656
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,399
Yeth.

657
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,698
Sorry to hear that. Don't worry...

658
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:27,999
...we'll iron out all these
thorny details over strudel.

659
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:30,332
Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go....

660
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,044
We're trapped! Trapped!

661
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,046
Got it.

662
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:41,053
Let's have lunch.

663
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,676
What nice guys.

664
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:48,306
Broadway.

665
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:52,649
I haven't been so happy
since we crushed Poland.

666
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,906
Hello, the living room of
renowned theatrical director...

667
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:01,902
...Roger DeBris<i>' e</i>legant
Upper East Side townhouse...

668
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:05,487
...on a sunny Tuesday
afternoon in June.

669
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:08,196
Who may I say is calling?

670
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,868
Listen, you broken-down

671
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:13,327
...he was drunk, he was hot,
you got lucky.

672
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:15,705
-Don't ever call here again.
-Who was that?

673
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,963
Wrong number.

674
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,725
Yes?

675
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,455
Well, hi there.

676
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:01,043
I'm Max Bialystock and this
is my associate, Mr. Bloom.

677
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:03,966
We have an appointment
with renowned theatrical director...

678
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,802
-...Roger DeBris.
-Ah, yes. Yes, please come in.

679
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:09,721
-Please. Yes.
-Thank you.

680
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:22,395
I am Carmen Ghia...

681
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:25,949
...Mr. DeBris'
common-law assistant.

682
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,319
You ar<i>e e</i>xpected.

683
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:39,330
May I take your hat, your coat
and your swastikas?

684
00:46:39,924 --> 00:46:43,009
Oh, these. We-- We--

685
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:46,920
We just came from this big rally.
Everybody was wearing them.

686
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:51,144
-You didn't tell me we had those on?
-I didn't notice them.

687
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:57,023
-You told me to look straight ahead.
-Yes, all right. Let's not fight. Okay?

688
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:03,353
Oh, Roger.

689
00:47:03,573 --> 00:47:06,527
We're not alone.

690
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:21,215
Here's Roger.

691
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:29,962
-Max, he's wearing a dress.
-No kidding.

692
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:32,140
Roger, good to see you again.

693
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:35,472
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

694
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,562
Forgive the pun.

695
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:41,727
-What pun?
-Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

696
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:46,571
Roger, may I say you look gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.

697
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:50,786
By the way, Max, darling,
we loved <i>Funny Boy</i>, didn't we?

698
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:52,075
Worshipped it.

699
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:54,577
<i>To be or not to be</i>
<i>You mean a lot to me</i>

700
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,033
-Showstopper!
-Fabulous.

701
00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:01,045
Oh, dear. Your Mr. Bloom
is staring at my gown.

702
00:48:01,881 --> 00:48:03,755
-Well, I was--
-I should explain.

703
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,751
I'm going to the Choreographers' Ball.
There is a prize for best costume.

704
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:11,885
-We always win.
-I'm not so sure about this year.

705
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,136
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia...

706
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:18,603
...but I think I look more like
the Chrysler Building.

707
00:48:19,941 --> 00:48:23,773
Well, as far as I'm concerned, without
your wig on, you're only half dressed.

708
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:27,237
Well, then,
why don't you go and get it...

709
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,983
...oh, Wicked Witch of the West.

710
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:35,496
lf your intention...

711
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:40,452
...was to shoot an arrow
through my heart...

712
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:43,914
...bull's-eye!

713
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:51,343
Oh, Roger, let's face it,
that building is you.

714
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:54,308
Listen, I know we sent it to you
only this morning...

715
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:56,593
...but did you read
<i>Springtime for Hitler</i>?

716
00:48:56,811 --> 00:48:59,053
Read it? I devoured it.

717
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:01,597
And I find it remarkable.
Remarkable!

718
00:49:01,816 --> 00:49:05,731
I feel it is a very important piece,
drenched with historical goodies.

719
00:49:05,945 --> 00:49:09,149
I, for one, for instance,
never realized that the Third Reich...

720
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:11,405
...meant Germany.

721
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,990
Yeah, how about that.
Then you'll do it?

722
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:18,367
Do it? Of course not. It's not my
kind of thing. I mean, Max, please.

723
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:22,711
World War ll?
Too dark, too depressing.

724
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:25,756
<i>The theatre's so obsessed</i>
<i>With dramas so depressed</i>

725

726

727

00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:36,883
<i>What's the word?</i>

729
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,972
-Gay?
-Exactly.

00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:43,972

00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:47,478

00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:51,444

<i>Mayhem or rage</i>

733

<i>Don't complain, it's a pain</i>

734
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,364
<i>People want laughter</i>
<i>When they see a show</i>

735
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:02,868
<i>The last thing they're after is</i>
<i>A litany of woe</i>

736
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:06,870
<i>A happy ending</i>
<i>Will pep up your play</i>

00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,378
Couldn't agree more.

742
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:18,224
And you have our blessings,
Roger...

743
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:22,384
...to mak<i>e Springtime for Hitler</i> just
as gay as anyone could possibly want.

744
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:24,064
So come on, do it for us. Please.

745
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:27,358
I'm sorry, Max.
It's simply not my cup of tea.

746
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:30,142
Still, fair is fair.

747
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:32,735
I should ask my production team
what they think.

748
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:34,443
Your production team,
who are they?

749
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,735
You'll see. They all live here.

750
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:40,239
Guys! Come say hello
to Bialystock and Bloom!

751
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:42,782
This is my set designer, Brian.

752
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:43,997
Hello.

753
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,377
<i>Keep it mad, keep it glad</i>

00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:59,138
<i>We're clever, creative</i>
<i>It's our job to see</i>

757
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:02,850
<i>That everything's perfect</i>
<i>For Mr. DeBris</i>

758
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,221
Scott, my choreographer.

759
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,100
Hi there.

760
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,168
And, finally, last and least...

761
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:30,292
...my lighting designer,
Shirley Markowitz.

Now, they all just read <i>Springtime</i>.
What did you think of it, fellas?

765
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,646
-<i>It needs glamour</i>
-<i>And glitz</i>

766
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:51,143
-<i>It needs sequins</i>
-<i>And tits</i>

767
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:54,812
Leo. Leo, I think we're losing them.

768
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:58,032
Go say something nice to Roger.
I think he likes you.

769
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:02,323
-But, Max....
-Go on. It's just show biz.

770
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:10,623
Mr. DeBris. Roger.

771
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:14,338
Roger, actually,
I think your gown is very stunning.

772
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,259
Why, thank you, Mr. Bloom.

773
00:52:16,469 --> 00:52:18,343
Leo.

774
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:22,172
What is that enchanting
cologne you're wearing?

775
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,016
Me? I'm not wearing any cologne.

776
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:27,643
You mean that smell is you?

777
00:52:27,856 --> 00:52:29,979
Oh, God.

778
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:36,395
lf I could bottle you, I'd shove you
under my armpits every day.

779
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:48,038
Oh, Max.
Max, we never should've started this.

780
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:52,379
-I think we're getting in too deep.
-Too deep? This is nothing.

781
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:54,878
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

782
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:57,381
<i>And so the rule is</i>

-What should we do?
-Relax. Watch this.

Roger, I--

788
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:15,733
I think that <i>Springtime for Hitler</i> would
be a marvellous opportunity for you.

789
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:18,899
I mean, up to now,
you've always been associated with--

790
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:21,072
Dare I say it? --frivolous musicals.

791
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:23,241
You're right.
I've often felt as though...

792
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:26,240
...I've been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments.

793
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:29,125
Dopey showgirls in gooey gowns.

794
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:31,907
Two, three, kick, turn, turn, turn,
kick, turn.

795
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:33,872
-Roger.
-It's enough to make you heave.

796
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,422
Nonetheless, I'm sorry, Max, I just
couldn't do <i>Springtime for Hitler</i>.

797
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,425
-Why not? Think of the respect.
-No.

798
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,260
-Think of the prestige.
-No, no, no.

799
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:42,930
Think of the Tony!

800
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:47,764

801
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,637
-What's the matter?
-ls he all right?

802
00:53:49,854 --> 00:53:51,052
-He's having a stroke.
-What?

803
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:53,431
-Of genius!
-I see it at last.

804
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,726
The chance
to do something important.

806
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,278
Of course that second act

840
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:36,748
<i>Dramas annoy us</i>

841
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:40,212
<i>So keep your Strindbergs</i>

<i>Keep it gay</i>

854
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,802
Exclusive Broadway rights

855
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:29,593
...and a signed contract
with the worst director who ever lived.

856
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:32,262
We're in business.

857
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,059
And what a business.

858
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,677
ln the same day,
I'm taking the Siegfried Oath...

859
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:41,101
...and dancing the conga
with a cop, a sailor...

860
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:44,188
...and an extremely friendly
Cherokee lndian.

861
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:46,729
Yeah. Oh, well.

862
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:49,404
It's not easy
being a Broadway producer.

863
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:52,868
But together we'll make it.
Partners, Leo. Partners all the way...

864
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,321
...and nothing or no one
will ever come between us.

865
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,948
Nothing or no one, Max.

866
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:00,077

We don't even know when
we're beginning rehearsals--

00:57:27,697 --> 00:57:30,817
Yes, we just started
casting today. Yes.

876
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:34,450
-We're casting?
-Yes. Yes, we're casting.

877
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:37,070

00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:57,141
That was my first name.

884

You wanna hear my last name?

885
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:03,184
We don't have the time.
We'll just call you Ulla.

886
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,725
Okay? Yeah. What do you do, Ulla?

887
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:08,233
-Ulla sing and dance.

-What are you going to sing?
-Well...

893
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:29,542
...yesterday when I was stepping out
of a big, white Rolls-Royce limo...

894
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,796
...a crazy man
yelled something out the window...

895
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:35,550
...that inspired me to write this song.

<i>When you got it</i>

897
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,481

<i>Step right up and strut your stuff</i>

899

<i>People tell you modesty's a virtue</i>

900
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,528
<i>But in the theatre</i>
<i>Modesty can hurt you</i>

901
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:01,028
<i>When you got it</i>

902
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:04,410

00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:17,430
<i>When you got it</i>
<i>Shout it out loud</i>

907
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:19,681
Now Ulla dance.

908
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:36,989
<i>When you got it</i>

909
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:39,075

<i>Put your hidden treasures</i>
<i>On display</i>

911
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,749
<i>Violinists love to play an E string</i>

912
00:59:46,961 --> 00:59:50,461
<i>But audiences really love a G-string</i>

913

<i>When you got it</i>

914
00:59:52,884 --> 00:59:54,462

917
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:06,563
<i>When you got it</i>
<i>Let it hang out</i>

918
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,730
-Remember when Ulla dance?
-Yeah.

919
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,140
Ulla dance again.

920
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,980
Ulla dance again!

921
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:34,087
<i>When I was just a little girl</i>
<i>In Sweden</i>

922
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:38,168
<i>My thoughtful mother</i>
<i>Gave me this advice</i>

923
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:42,172
<i>If nature blesses you</i>
<i>From top to bottom</i>

924
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,262
<i>Show that top to bottom</i>
<i>Don't think twice</i>

925
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:47,601
Now Ulla belt.

926
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:51,681
<i>Don't think twice!</i>

927
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:54,143

<i>Share it</i>

929
01:00:56,197 --> 01:01:00,065
<i>Let the public feast</i>
<i>Upon your charms</i>

930
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:03,950
<i>People say that being prim</i>
<i>Is proper</i>

931
01:01:04,164 --> 01:01:07,449
<i>But every showgirl knows</i>
<i>That prim will stop her</i>

932
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,992
<i>When you got it</i>

933
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:11,955
<i>Give it</i>

934
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:17,130
<i>Don't be selfish</i>
<i>Give it all away</i>

935
01:01:21,931 --> 01:01:23,556
<i>Don't be shy</i>
<i>Be bold and cute</i>

936
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,558
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit</i>

937
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,888
<i>When you got it</i>

938
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:32,851
<i>If you got it</i>

939
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:36,778
<i>Once you got it</i>

940
01:01:36,988 --> 01:01:39,230
<i>Shout out</i>

941
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:45,829
<i>Hooray!</i>

942
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:54,671
Okey-dokey.

943
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:56,079
You like it?

944
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:58,588
Like-- Like it?

945
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:02,336
I want you to know, my dear,
that even though we're sitting down...

946
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:06,600
...we're giving you
a standing ovation.

947
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:14,102
She's in the show.

948
01:02:14,317 --> 01:02:19,275
Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know
if there's a part for her in the show.

949
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:22,443
Would you excuse us, my dear?

950
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,450
Nonsense, Bloom.

951
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,618
Bloom,
do I have to teach you everything?

952
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,237
There is always a part
for the producer's girlfriend.

953
01:02:29,457 --> 01:02:32,127
But we don't even know
when we're starting rehearsal yet.

954
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:36,333
So what? So what?
We're producers, aren't we?

955
01:02:36,548 --> 01:02:39,465
So until she goes into the show,
she can work for us here.

956
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:44,468
Because we need--
Nay, des<i>erve</i> to have ourselves a--

957
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:49,893
Des<i>erve</i> to have ourselves a gorgeous
Swedish secretary/receptionist.

958
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,970
But, Max, a secretary who doesn't
speak English? What will people say?

959
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:55,982
They'll say:

960
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:00,732
Offer her the job, please?

961
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,115
Just a moment, miss.

962
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,278
We might have a position for you.

963
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:10,444
As a matter of fact, we might
have several positions for you.

964
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:12,159
Until the show gets going...

965
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:16,836
...we can offer you a job here
as a secretary/receptionist.

966
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:20,416
Secretary/receptionist?

967
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:23,171
Okey/dokey!

968
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:24,584
I can do that.

969
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:29,053
Answer telephone.

970
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:31,260
Bialystock and Bloom.

971
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,102
Bialystock and Bloom.

972
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:34,558
Smart as a whip.

973
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,896
You're hired!

974
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:45,522
Well-- Well, all right. lf he says so,
I don't have a--

975
01:03:47,827 --> 01:03:50,069
Secretary/receptionist.

976
01:03:50,288 --> 01:03:52,696
And maybe you can tidy up
around here a little bit too.

977
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,789
Tidy up? Tidy up.

978
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:57,326
Such a funny word.
What means "tidy up"?

979
01:03:57,545 --> 01:04:00,215
-You know, clean.
-Make look nice.

980
01:04:00,423 --> 01:04:03,875
-Oh, yeah. Ulla can make tidy up.
-Very good.

981
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,217
What time can you be here
in the morning?

982
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:09,679
Well, Ulla wake up every morning,
5 a.m.

983
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:12,347
From 5 to 7, Ulla like to exercise.

984
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,680
From to 7 to 8,
Ulla like to take long shower.

985
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:19,942
From to 8 to 9, Ulla like
to have big Swedish breakfast.

986
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:22,061
Many different herrings.

987
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:26,062
From to 9 to 11 , Ulla like to practice
her singing and her dancing.

988
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:29,865
And at 11 , Ulla like to have sex.

989
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:32,403
What time should I get here?

990
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:33,737
-Eleven.
-Eleven.

991
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,662
Good. Ulla will come at 11 .

992
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:39,664
Ulla will come at 11 .

993
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:51,433
God bless America!

994
01:04:53,852 --> 01:04:56,556
God bless Sweden.

995
01:04:56,938 --> 01:05:00,437
Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic.

996
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:03,224
The most beautiful girl
I'v<i>e e</i>ver seen.

997
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:05,022
I've never felt this way before.

998
01:05:05,238 --> 01:05:08,358
It's like a volcano erupting
inside of me...

999
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:13,616
...like hot lava rising higher
and higher and--

1000
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,739
What is that, Max?

1001
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:18,080
What is it?

1002
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:23,501
It's called an erection.
It's either that or malaria.

1003
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:26,629
But don't worry,
they have shots for everything now.

1004
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:28,178
Come here,
I want to show you something.

1005
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,298
-What do you see?
-Nothing.

1006
01:05:32,515 --> 01:05:35,884
Exactly. But now that we've got
our sure-fire flop...

1007
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:39,388
...it's gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars.

1008
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:43,390
Two million?
Gee, how much do we put in?

1009
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:57,619
How much--?
How much do we put in?

1010
01:05:57,832 --> 01:05:59,540
Bloom...

1011
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:03,120
...the two cardinal rules
of being a Broadway producer...

1012
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:06,671
...are one, never put
your own money in the show.

1013
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:08,081
And two?

1014
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:13,924
Never put your own money
in the show!

1015
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:16,934
-Get it?
-Got it.

1016
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:19,136
-Good.
-So how do we raise the money?

1017
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:22,023
How? I'll tell you how.

1018
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,691
From my investors.

1019
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:26,728
Hundreds of little old ladies...

1020
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:32,022
...all looking to Max Bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery.

1021
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:36,074
So in the days to come, Bloom,
you shall see very little of me.

1022
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:38,613
And right now,
I'd like to see very little of you.

1023
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:40,824
Scram while I get myself ready.

1024
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:44,874
For Max Bialystock
is about to launch himself...

1025
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,496
...into little-old-lady land.

1026
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:51,926
<i>The time has come</i>

1027
01:06:52,137 --> 01:06:56,514
<i>To be a lover from the Argentine</i>

1028
01:06:56,725 --> 01:07:01,221
<i>To slick my hair down</i>
<i>With brilliantine</i>

1029
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:07,891
<i>And gargle heavily</i>
<i>With Listerine</i>

1030
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:16,908
<i>It's time for Max</i>

1031
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:22,031
<i>To put his backers on their backs</i>

1032
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:27,624
<i>And thrill them with amazing acts</i>

1033
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,544
<i>Those aging nymphomaniacs</i>

1034
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:43,928
<i>They were helpless</i>
<i>They were hopeless</i>

1035
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:47,598
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1036
01:07:47,817 --> 01:07:51,436
<i>They were joyless</i>
<i>They were boy-less</i>

1037
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:55,070
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1038
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:58,901
<i>They're my angels</i>
<i>I'm their devil</i>

1039
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,785
<i>And I keep those embers aglow</i>

1040
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:06,534
<i>When I woos 'em</i>
<i>I can't lose 'em</i>

1041
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,829
<i>'Cause I cast my spell</i>
<i>And they start yellin'</i>

1042
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,375
<i>''Fire down below!''</i>

1043
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:14,089
<i>So romantic</i>
<i>They were frantic</i>

1044
01:08:14,302 --> 01:08:18,086
<i>Then their prayers were heard</i>
<i>Up above</i>

1045
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:19,966
<i>Heaven sent them</i>

1046
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:21,843
<i>Their Bialy</i>

1047
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:28,727
<i>I'm the celebration of love</i>

1048
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:38,986
<i>Who is it? Who is it?</i>

1049
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:40,993
It's Max Bialystock.

1050
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,040
Maxy.

1051
01:10:04,788 --> 01:10:06,068
Fire down below!

1052
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:08,994
<i>We were listing</i>
<i>We were sinking</i>

1053
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:12,578
<i>Then along came Bialy</i>

1054
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:15,880
<i>We were desperate</i>
<i>We were drinking</i>

1055
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:19,424
<i>-Then along came Bialy</i>
-Who's your daddy?

1056
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:22,756
<i>So romantic</i>
<i>We were frantic</i>

1057
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:26,341
<i>Then our prayers were heard</i>
<i>Up above</i>

1058
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,888
<i>It's Bialy</i>

1059
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,561
<i>Hey, Bialy</i>

1060
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:31,680
<i>He's the culmination</i>

1061
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:33,392
<i>The restoration</i>

1062
01:10:33,608 --> 01:10:35,102
<i>The consummation</i>

1063
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:36,563
<i>The titillation</i>

1064
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,189
<i>Ejaculation</i>

1065
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:43,150
<i>He's the celebration of love</i>

1066
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:02,216
Thank you.

1067
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:15,307
Bloom! Bloom!

1068
01:11:15,525 --> 01:11:17,601
What, Max? What?

1069
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,488
I've done it. I've done it,
I've raised the 2 million.

1070
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,532
Now all we have to do is put on
the biggest flop in history.

1071
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,983
That's great!

1072
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,577
<i>We can't miss</i>

1073
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:01,939
I gotta make the next payment
on the theatre by 3:00 or else--

1074
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:03,400
Sorry, wrong office.

1075
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,524
Bialystock. Bloom.

1076
01:12:06,701 --> 01:12:08,112
Max. Leo.

1077
01:12:23,593 --> 01:12:25,799
-Ulla?
-Ulla?

1078
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:27,882
What happened to the office?

1079
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:31,052
Like you tell Ulla, "tidy up."

1080
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:33,556
Tidy "oop"?

1081
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:35,727
How did you find the time
to do all this?

1082
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:39,355
-I skip lunch.
-Of course you did.

1083
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:42,272
-Very nice.
-She skipped lunch.

1084
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:44,230
Almost 3.
That payment to the Shuberts.

1085
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:45,941
I'll get the cash from the safe.

1086
01:12:46,157 --> 01:12:48,233
You make sure
all those contracts are signed.

1087
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:49,732
Yes, Max.

1088
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:53,780
She painted over the numbers.

1089
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:09,802
Hello, boys.

1090
01:13:11,933 --> 01:13:14,720
Nobody knows
what I went through to get you.

1091
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:16,395
Ulla knows.

1092
01:13:16,604 --> 01:13:20,768
You had to shtupp
every little old lady in New York.

1093
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:25,108
That's right. That's right.

1094
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:28,906
And I've still got
the denture bites to prove it.

1095
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:33,945
Work, work, work. Work, work, work.

1096
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:40,456
So, Mr. Bloom.

1097
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,959
We are all alone.

1098
01:13:43,548 --> 01:13:46,039
Yes, we are, aren't we?

1099
01:13:51,848 --> 01:13:55,264
Why Bloom go so far camera right?

1100
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:58,855
Bloom no like Ulla?

1101
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:01,643
Ulla like Bloom.

1102
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:04,273
Bloom like Ulla, all right.

1103
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:07,487
-Maybe a little too much.
-Good.

1104
01:14:07,697 --> 01:14:09,773
I'm glad.

1105
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:13,777
Why Bloom need blue blanket?

1106
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:15,655
Oh, it's not important.

1107
01:14:15,872 --> 01:14:17,865
It's just a minor compulsion.
It's that I've--

1108
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,870
I've had it ever since
I was a baby, and I....

1109
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:24,003
You're a little too close.

1110
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:30,008
<i>The urge to merge</i>
<i>Can rob us of our senses</i>

1111
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,882
<i>The need to breed</i>
<i>Can make a man a drone</i>

1112
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,512
<i>We must be on alert</i>
<i>With our defences</i>

1113
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:43,015
<i>For every skirt will test</i>

1114
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:48,026
<i>Testosterone</i>

1115
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,022
<i>So knowing this</i>
<i>I severed all connection</i>

1116
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:55,611
<i>With any creature</i>
<i>Sporting silk or lace</i>

1117
01:14:55,829 --> 01:15:00,206
<i>I was firmly headed</i>
<i>In the right direction</i>

1118
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:04,628
<i>When suddenly I stumbled on</i>

1119
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:08,207
<i>That face</i>

1120
01:15:09,843 --> 01:15:12,001
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

1121
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,296
<i>That dangerous face</i>

1122
01:15:14,514 --> 01:15:18,726
<i>I mustn't be unwise</i>

1123
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:21,058
<i>Those lips</i>
<i>That nose</i>

1124
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:23,394
<i>Those eyes</i>

1125
01:15:23,606 --> 01:15:27,853
<i>Could lead to my demise</i>

1126
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:30,062
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

1127
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,272
<i>That marvellous face</i>

1128
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:36,737
<i>I never should begin</i>

1129
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:39,029
<i>Those cheeks</i>
<i>That neck</i>

1130
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:41,240
<i>That chin</i>

1131
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:45,752
<i>Will surely do me in</i>

1132
01:15:45,962 --> 01:15:48,085
<i>I must be smart</i>
<i>And hide my heart</i>

1133
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,456
<i>If she's within a mile</i>

1134
01:15:50,675 --> 01:15:53,462
<i>If I don't duck</i>
<i>I'm out of luck</i>

1135
01:15:53,678 --> 01:15:58,755
<i>She'd kill me with her smile</i>

1136
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:06,103
<i>That face</i>
<i>That face</i>

1137
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:08,273
<i>That fabulous face</i>

1138
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:12,779
<i>It's clear I must beware</i>

1139
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:14,982
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

1140
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,109
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

1141
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:18,607
<i>But it's worth it</i>

1142
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:22,032
<i>For that face</i>

1143
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,409
Bloom help Ulla down?

1144
01:16:25,835 --> 01:16:29,619
All right. Bloom help Ulla down.

1145
01:18:56,361 --> 01:18:58,069
<i>That face</i>

1146
01:18:58,279 --> 01:18:59,774
<i>That face</i>

1147
01:18:59,989 --> 01:19:05,743
<i>That lovable face</i>

1148
01:19:06,204 --> 01:19:13,535
<i>It melts my Swedish heart</i>

1149
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:18,048
<i>I'm certain if I fall in love</i>

1150
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:23,881
<i>I'm lost without a trace</i>

1151
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:27,596
<i>But it's worth it</i>

1152
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:33,100
<i>For that face</i>

1153
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,165
Again! Arabesque, prepare...

1154
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:00,290
...pirouette and twirl.

1155
01:20:00,508 --> 01:20:02,584
And goose step, goose step...

1156
01:20:02,802 --> 01:20:04,759
...waltz-clog and kick. Again!

1157
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:08,506
Arabesque, prepare,
pirouette and twirl.

1158
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:12,972
And goose step, goose step,
waltz-clog and kick! Again!

1159
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,939
Arabesque, prepare, pirouette!

1160
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:17,643
-Halt!
-Halt.

1161
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:20,860
-Halt!
-Halt!

1162
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,359
-This is bedlam! Bedlam!
-This is bedlam! Bedlam!

1163
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:28,284
Shut up!

1164
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:31,073
We must have some order here.

1165
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:34,076
Will all the dancing Hitlers
please wait off-stage right...

1166
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:37,827
...and all the singing Hitlers
off-stage left.

1167
01:20:38,505 --> 01:20:40,213
Get that way.

1168
01:20:40,423 --> 01:20:43,377
Carmen,
call in a singing Hitler, please.

1169
01:20:43,593 --> 01:20:46,049
Yes, darling-- Roger.

1170
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,227
"Jacques LaPidus."

1171
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:03,690
"Jacques LaPidus."

1172
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:09,156
"Jack Lapidus."

1173
01:21:09,619 --> 01:21:12,537
Well, Jack, what are you
going to sing for us?

1174
01:21:12,747 --> 01:21:17,575
I would like to sing
"A Wandering Minstrel I."

1175
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:19,876
lf you must.

1176
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,800
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>

1177
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:29,922
<i>A thing of shreds and</i>

01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,302
-Thank you!
-<i>Patches</i>

1179
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:33,259
Next, please.

1180
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:36,975
" Donald Dinsmor<i>e.''</i>

1181
01:21:37,188 --> 01:21:39,430
Well, Donald, if we--

1182
01:21:41,234 --> 01:21:42,432
Well, Donald, I--

1183
01:21:42,652 --> 01:21:44,775
-Hi, how are you?
-That's all right, Donald.

1184
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:48,564
Now, what are you
going to sing for us, friend?

1185
01:21:48,783 --> 01:21:53,825
I'd like to sing
"The Little Wooden Boy."

1186
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:57,123
Thank you.

1187
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:07,918
Next!

1188
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:11,754
"Jason Green."

1189
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:16,222
Well, Jason,
what have you been up to lately?

1190
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:20,599
For the last 16 years, I have been
touring in <i>No No Nietzsche</i>.

1191
01:22:20,815 --> 01:22:23,141
-You played Nietzsche?
-No, no.

1192
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,902
What are you gonna sing for us?

1193
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:27,400
" Have You Ever Heard
the German Band?"

1194
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:29,690
-No.
-That is the name of the song...

1195
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:32,066
...I am going to sing.

1196
01:22:33,703 --> 01:22:35,114
Play it, please.

1197
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,376
Speed it up.

1198
01:22:40,585 --> 01:22:46,421
<i>Haben Sie gehört</i>
<i>Das deutsche Band?</i>

1199
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:47,961
<i>Mit a bang</i>

1200
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:49,456
<i>Mit a boom</i>

1201
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:52,347
<i>Mit a bing-bang bing-bang boom</i>

1202
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:55,214
<i>Oh, haben Sie gehört--</i>

1203
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:58,185
Halt! Halt!

1204
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:01,230
Halt! No, no, no.

1205
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,226
This man could never play
Adolf Hitler.

1206
01:23:04,442 --> 01:23:07,194
The Führer wasn't
a mousy little mama's boy.

1207
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:08,862
The Führer was butch!

1208
01:23:09,072 --> 01:23:10,531
And that is not how you sing...

1209
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:12,400
..." Haben Sie geh<i>ö</i>rt
das deutsche Band?"

1210
01:23:12,617 --> 01:23:15,191
This is how you sing " Haben Sie
geh<i>ö</i>rt das deutsche Band?"

1211
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:17,321
B-flat. Two-two time!

1212
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:19,697
Modulate at the bridge!

1213
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:26,871

01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:31,133

01:23:31,344 --> 01:23:35,294
<i>Oh, haben Sie gehört</i>

1217
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:37,389
<i>Mit a bang</i>
<i>Mit a boom</i>

1218
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,973
<i>Mit a bing-bang bing-bang boom</i>

1219
01:23:40,186 --> 01:23:43,887
<i>Russian folk songs</i>
<i>Und French ooh-la-la</i>

1220
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:47,440
<i>Can't compare</i>
<i>With the German oom-pah-pah</i>

1221
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:48,648
<i>We're saying</i>

1222
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:52,028
<i>Haben Sie gehört</i>
<i>Das deutsche Band?</i>

1223
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,114
<i>Mit a zetz</i>
<i>Mit a zap</i>

1224
01:23:54,325 --> 01:23:56,484
<i>Mit a zing</i>

1225
01:23:56,703 --> 01:24:00,403
<i>Polish polkas</i>
<i>They're stupid und they're rotten</i>

1226
01:24:00,623 --> 01:24:03,909
<i>It don't mean a thing</i>
<i>If it ain't got that</i>

1227
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:10,248
<i>Schweigen-reigen-schone-</i>
<i>Schutzen-schmutzen Sauerbraten</i>

1228
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:12,424

01:24:13,094 --> 01:24:16,712
<i>We're saying</i>

1230
01:24:16,931 --> 01:24:22,174
<i>Haben Sie gehört</i>

1232
01:24:24,397 --> 01:24:25,773
<i>Mit a zing</i>

1233
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:27,809
<i>It's the only kind of music</i>

1234
01:24:28,026 --> 01:24:32,273
<i>That we Hans und our honeys</i>
<i>Love to sing</i>

1235
01:24:33,114 --> 01:24:35,237
That's our Hitler!

1236
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:47,702
Have your tickets ready.
Have your tickets ready.

1237
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:50,412
This way, please.
This way, please.

1238
01:24:50,632 --> 01:24:52,838
Take your seats.

1239
01:24:56,846 --> 01:24:59,254
Good evening, sir. Nice to see you.

1240
01:24:59,474 --> 01:25:01,965
-Enjoy the show.
-Thank you.

1241
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:09,685
-Oh, Mr. Bloom.
-Oh, Mr. Bloom.

1242
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:13,317
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you.

1243
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,656
Leo!

1244
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:20,576
Leo, who said
you could wear that hat?

1245
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:24,370
Nobody, Max. But I thought now that
I'm the producer of a Broadway show--

1246
01:25:24,582 --> 01:25:26,160
-Has the curtain gone up yet?
-No.

1247
01:25:26,584 --> 01:25:28,292
-Has the curtain come down yet?
-No.

1248
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:30,828
Then you're not a producer yet.
Give me that hat.

1249
01:25:31,047 --> 01:25:33,585
Mr. Bloom! Leo.

1250
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,373
Your tie is all askew.

1251
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:38,920
Askew. Oh, thank you, Ulla.

1252
01:25:39,139 --> 01:25:41,215
Have a good show.

1253
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,730
Roll them in the aisles.

1254
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:51,270
Okey-dokey.

1255
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:53,109
I will try to.

1256
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:56,320
But there's just so many of them.

1257
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:02,571
Gee, I thought we were partners,
sharing everything 50-50.

1258
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:06,037
Now I'm out in the cold, and you two
are busy askewing each other.

1259
01:26:06,249 --> 01:26:07,708
Askewing? Never, Max.

1260
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:11,203
Hugs and kisses, yes,
but that's as far as I go.

1261
01:26:20,513 --> 01:26:24,096
Gunter, you will pick me up back here
right after the curtain.

1262
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:30,227
Oh, God, will they love us?
Will they hate us?

1263
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,603
The suspense is killing me.

1264
01:26:31,816 --> 01:26:35,102
I know.
I feel like I'm going into labour.

1265
01:26:38,156 --> 01:26:42,818
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom.
Well, gentlemen, <i>merde</i>.

1266
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:46,823
And I just wanna
wish everybody good luck.

1267
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,076
-What? What did you say?
-Bite your tongue.

1268
01:26:50,293 --> 01:26:52,665
Well, what's the matter?
All I said was "good luck."

1269
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:56,082
-He said it again.
-Hasn't anyon<i>e e</i>ver told you?

1270
01:26:56,299 --> 01:26:58,921
<i>It's bad luck to say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

1271
01:26:59,135 --> 01:27:01,757
<i>If you do</i>
<i>I tell you</i>

1272
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:04,178
<i>It is certain by the curtain</i>
<i>You are through</i>

1273
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:05,386
Good luck.

1274
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,806
<i>It's bad luck to say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

1275
01:27:08,019 --> 01:27:10,854
<i>Once it's said</i>
<i>You are dead</i>

1276
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:13,306
<i>You will get the worst reviews</i>
<i>You ever read</i>

1277
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:14,520
Good luck.

1278
01:27:14,734 --> 01:27:16,608
<i>Even at the Comédie Française</i>

1279
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,856
<i>On the opening night</i>
<i>They are scared</i>

1280
01:27:20,073 --> 01:27:22,778
<i>''Bonne chance, mes amis''</i>
<i>No one says</i>

1281
01:27:22,992 --> 01:27:25,614
<i>-The only word you'll ever hear is</i>
<i>-Merde</i>

1282
01:27:25,829 --> 01:27:27,204
Good luck, good luck, good luck.

1283
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:30,083
<i>It's verboten</i>
<i>Wishing luck on opening night</i>

1284
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,996
<i>Take advice</i>
<i>Don't think twice</i>

1285
01:27:33,211 --> 01:27:35,998
<i>Or your show will surely end up</i>
<i>In the Scheiss</i>

1286
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:39,132
<i>At the famous La Scala in Milan</i>

1287
01:27:39,342 --> 01:27:41,798
<i>On opening night it's a rule</i>

1288
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:44,763
<i>''Al bocca lupo, '' they say with élan</i>

1289
01:27:44,973 --> 01:27:46,384
<i>And just for luck they all shout</i>

1290
01:27:46,599 --> 01:27:48,142
<i>-''Vaffanculo''</i>
<i>-I got it</i>

1291
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:51,103
<i>Now I'll never say ''good luck''</i>
<i>On opening night</i>

1292
01:27:51,312 --> 01:27:54,895
<i>That's the rule</i>
<i>I'm no fool</i>

1293
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,729
<i>What do I say, I beg?</i>

1294
01:27:57,944 --> 01:28:02,689
<i>What you say is ''break a leg''</i>

1295
01:28:02,907 --> 01:28:04,366
-Break a leg?
-Yeah.

1296
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:06,070
-Break a leg.
-Break a leg.

1297
01:28:06,286 --> 01:28:08,325
<i>If you're clever</i>

1298
01:28:08,538 --> 01:28:09,653
Good luck.

1299
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:11,830
<i>You'll endeav our</i>

1300
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:16,243
<i>To never, never, never, never</i>
<i>Ever, ever, ever say</i>

1301
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:19,132
<i>On opening night</i>

1302
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,258
Five minutes to curtain.
Curtain going up in five minutes.

1303
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:24,795
I'm late. I must run!

1304
01:28:25,221 --> 01:28:27,344
-Break a leg!
-Break a leg!

1305
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:45,650
Franz, what happened?

1306
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:48,868
I broke my leg.

1307
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:52,946
Now we'll have to cancel the show
and giv<i>e e</i>veryone their money back.

1308
01:28:53,249 --> 01:28:54,708
Money back?

1309
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:56,080
Money back?

1310
01:28:56,294 --> 01:28:57,492
Money back.

1311
01:28:57,712 --> 01:28:59,621
Don't ever say that again.
Money back?

1312
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:01,547
Never.
We gotta think of something else.

1313
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:05,209
But Franz plays Hitler, Max,
and he has no understudy.

1314
01:29:05,428 --> 01:29:08,215
You're right. What are we gonna do?
There must be a way out.

1315
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:11,101
lf I could only think of something.
Some way. Some--

1316
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:14,388
Hold it. I got it.
Roger, you. You could play Hitler.

1317
01:29:14,604 --> 01:29:16,015
You know every line in the show.

1318
01:29:16,231 --> 01:29:20,181
I've seen you at rehearsal, always
moving your lips along with the actors.

1319
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:23,071
It's an embarrassing habit.
I'm trying to break myself of it.

1320
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:25,901
But me play Hitler? No!
There's no way I could go on tonight.

1321
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:28,404
I don't have the strength.
I don't have the courage.

1322
01:29:28,618 --> 01:29:30,575
I can't do it! I can't do it! I can't do it!

1323
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:32,744
-Wow, that hurt.
-Roger.

1324
01:29:32,956 --> 01:29:34,533
Listen to me.

1325
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:36,364
You can do it.

1326
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:38,660
You know you can do it,
and I know you can do it.

1327
01:29:38,878 --> 01:29:41,251
You've been waiting all your lifetime
for this chance.

1328
01:29:41,464 --> 01:29:44,086
And I'm not gonna let you
pass it up.

1329
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:49,762
You're going out there a silly,
hysterical, screaming queen.

1330
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:52,890
But you're coming back
a great big...

1331
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,438
I'll do it! By God, I'll do it!

1332
01:30:02,652 --> 01:30:05,855
I've got to get into makeup.
Quick, get Franz's Hitler moustache.

1333
01:30:06,072 --> 01:30:10,070
And, oh! My lucky
Gloria Swanson mole.

1334
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,655
Got it!

1335
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,244
Leo, the overture.

1336
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:21,334
Let's go.

1337
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,758
-Max.
-What?

1338
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:44,852
-Good luck, Leo.
-Good luck, Max.

1339
01:30:57,832 --> 01:31:01,332
<i>Germany was having trouble</i>
<i>What a sad, sad story</i>

1340
01:31:01,544 --> 01:31:05,328
<i>Needed a new leader</i>
<i>To restore its former glory</i>

1341
01:31:05,548 --> 01:31:08,549
<i>Where, oh, where was he?</i>

01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,927
<i>Where could that man be?</i>

1343
01:31:12,138 --> 01:31:13,965
<i>We looked around</i>

01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:16,009
<i>And then we found</i>

1345
01:31:16,226 --> 01:31:19,926
<i>The man for you and me</i>

1346
01:31:33,576 --> 01:31:39,745
<i>And now it's</i>

1347
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:46,672
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1348
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:53,465
<i>Deutschland is happy and gay</i>

1349
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:59,635
<i>We're marching to a faster pace</i>

1350
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:06,065
<i>Look out</i>
<i>Here comes the master race</i>

1351
01:32:07,068 --> 01:32:13,403
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1352
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:20,403
<i>Rhineland's a fine land once more</i>

1353
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:25,831
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1354
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:28,541
<i>Watch out, Europe</i>

1355
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:33,917
<i>We're going on tour</i>

1356
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:39,262
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1357
01:32:39,559 --> 01:32:40,757
<i>Look, it's springtime</i>

1358
01:32:40,977 --> 01:32:47,347
<i>Winter for Poland and France</i>

1359
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:52,734
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1360
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:54,406
<i>Springtime</i>
<i>Springtime</i>

1361
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:56,110
<i>Springtime</i>
<i>Springtime</i>

1362
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,524
<i>Springtime</i>

1363
01:32:58,161 --> 01:32:59,952
<i>Springtime</i>

1364
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,372
<i>Come on, Germans</i>

1365
01:33:02,582 --> 01:33:05,453
<i>Go into your dance</i>

1366
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:17,381
<i>I was born in Düsseldorf</i>
<i>And that is why they call me Rolf</i>

1367
01:33:19,099 --> 01:33:23,096
<i>Don't be stupid, be a smarty</i>
<i>Come and join the Nazi Party</i>

1368
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:35,899
Well, I never!
Talk about bad taste.

1369
01:33:40,787 --> 01:33:43,408
Come on, let's get out of here
before they kill us.

1370
01:34:03,393 --> 01:34:04,852
<i>The Führer is coming</i>

1371
01:34:05,061 --> 01:34:06,721
<i>The Führer is coming</i>

1372
01:34:06,938 --> 01:34:09,607
<i>The Führer is coming</i>

1373
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:14,187

<i>Heil Hitler</i>

1377
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:42,090
<i>Heil myself</i>

1378
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:45,967
<i>Heil to me</i>

1379
01:34:46,186 --> 01:34:48,511
<i>I'm the Kraut who's out</i>

1380
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:51,055
<i>To change our history</i>

1381
01:34:51,274 --> 01:34:54,477
<i>Heil myself</i>
<i>Raise your hand</i>

1382
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:58,359
<i>There's no greater dictator</i>
<i>In the land</i>

1383
01:34:58,573 --> 01:35:01,574
<i>-Everything I do, I do for you</i>
<i>-Yes, you do</i>

1384
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:04,454
<i>If you're looking for a war</i>
<i>Here's World War II</i>

1385
01:35:04,662 --> 01:35:07,866
<i>Heil myself</i>
<i>Raise your beer</i>

1386
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:10,574
<i>Every hotsy-totsy Nazi</i>
<i>Stand and cheer</i>

1387
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:12,204
<i>Hooray</i>

01:35:13,797 --> 01:35:16,501
<i>Heil myself</i>

1389
01:35:17,133 --> 01:35:18,296
<i>Heil myself</i>

01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:29,766
<i>Heil myself</i>

1394
01:35:35,694 --> 01:35:37,271
<i>I love you.</i>

1395
01:35:47,414 --> 01:35:52,122
<i>I was just a paperhanger</i>

1396
01:35:52,335 --> 01:35:55,787
<i>No one more obscurer</i>

1397
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:58,413
<i>Got a phone call from the Reichstag</i>

1398
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:01,634
<i>Told me I was Führer</i>

1399
01:36:01,845 --> 01:36:03,469
<i>Germany was blue</i>

1400
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,131
<i>Oh, what, oh, what to do?</i>

1401
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,307
<i>Hitched up my pants</i>

1402
01:36:09,519 --> 01:36:11,761
<i>And conquered France</i>

1403
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:17,816
<i>Now Deutschland's smiling through</i>

1404
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:21,613
<i>Oh, it ain't no mystery</i>

1405
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:24,279
<i>If it's politics or history</i>

1406
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:27,410
<i>The thing you gotta know is</i>

1407
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:31,832
<i>Everything is show biz</i>

01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:38,622
<i>Watch my show</i>

1410
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:42,174
<i>I'm the German Ethel Merman</i>
<i>Don't you know?</i>

1411
01:36:42,385 --> 01:36:44,010
<i>We are crossing borders</i>

1412
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:48,763
<i>The New World Order is here</i>

1413
01:36:48,975 --> 01:36:50,469
<i>Make a great big smile</i>

1414
01:36:50,685 --> 01:36:54,813
<i>Everyone ''Sieg Heil'' to me</i>

1415
01:36:55,023 --> 01:37:01,524
<i>Wonderful me</i>

1416
01:37:01,738 --> 01:37:05,818
<i>And now it's springtime</i>

1417
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:11,704
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1418
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:18,579
-<i>Goose step</i>
-<i>Goose step's the new step today</i>

1419
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:26,424
<i>Bombs falling from the skies again</i>

1420
01:37:27,597 --> 01:37:33,386
<i>Deutschland is on the rise again</i>

1421
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:45,530
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1422
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:54,532
<i>U-boats are sailing once more</i>

1423
01:37:54,791 --> 01:38:00,912
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1424
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:05,256
<i>-Means that</i>
<i>-Soon we'll be going</i>

1425
01:38:05,468 --> 01:38:09,252
<i>-We've got to be going</i>
<i>-You know we'll be going</i>

1426
01:38:09,472 --> 01:38:11,050
<i>You bet we'll be going</i>

1427
01:38:11,266 --> 01:38:14,849
<i>You know we'll be going</i>

1428
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:21,942
<i>To war</i>

1429
01:38:36,249 --> 01:38:37,624
Roger!

1430
01:39:27,384 --> 01:39:29,092
"A satiric masterpiec<i>e.''</i>

1431
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:30,959
No way out.

1432
01:39:32,889 --> 01:39:34,549
"A surprise smash."

1433
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:37,008
No way out.

1434
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:39,800
" It was shocking,
outrageous, insulting...

1435
01:39:40,021 --> 01:39:41,848
...and I loved every minute of it."

1436
01:39:42,065 --> 01:39:43,524
No way out!

1437
01:39:43,733 --> 01:39:45,607
How could this happen?

1438
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:50,030
We picked the wrong play,
the wrong director, the wrong cast.

1439
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,695
Where did we go right?

1440
01:39:54,244 --> 01:39:56,782
" Congratulations."

1441
01:40:06,965 --> 01:40:09,372
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking these books...

1442
01:40:09,592 --> 01:40:11,300
...and I'm leaving.

1443
01:40:11,511 --> 01:40:14,180
Don't try and stop me.
I've made up my mind.

1444
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:16,013
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

1445
01:40:16,224 --> 01:40:18,264
I'm turning myself in.
It's the only way.

1446
01:40:18,476 --> 01:40:20,054
I'm going to play ball with the lRS.

1447
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:22,144
I'm going to cooperate
with the authorities.

1448
01:40:22,355 --> 01:40:25,107
They'll reduce my sentence,
there's time off for good behaviour.

1449
01:40:25,316 --> 01:40:27,190
Maybe I'll get a job
in the prison library.

1450
01:40:27,402 --> 01:40:30,154
Please keep in touch.
It's been very nice working with you.

1451
01:40:31,197 --> 01:40:35,195
Leo. Leo. Leo.

1452
01:40:35,785 --> 01:40:37,742
Frightened Leo. Nervous Leo, relax.

1453
01:40:37,954 --> 01:40:39,532
Take it easy, all right?

1454
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:42,036
You're overwrought.
You don't know what you're doing.

1455
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,531
You're acting out of panic.

1456
01:40:43,752 --> 01:40:46,124
Give me those frigging books!
Give me!

1457
01:40:46,338 --> 01:40:50,418
-Give me! Give me! Give me!
-I never should've listened to you.

1458
01:40:50,633 --> 01:40:52,875
I was an honest man
before I met you.

1459
01:40:53,094 --> 01:40:56,095
An honest man?
You were an honest mouse!

1460
01:40:56,306 --> 01:40:59,058
-Give me. Give me.
-How I hate you!

1461
01:40:59,267 --> 01:41:02,553
Double! Double! Double!

1462
01:41:11,946 --> 01:41:14,947
Fat! Fat!

1463
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:16,700
I'm not that fat.

1464
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:18,404
Fat!

1465
01:41:20,872 --> 01:41:22,497
Fat!

1466
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:24,951
Fatty!

1467
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:29,244
Fatso!
You fat, fat, fatty, fatty, fat walrus.

1468
01:41:29,464 --> 01:41:30,792
Give me the fat books!

1469
01:41:31,007 --> 01:41:34,839
-Never, never!
-Fat, fat, fatty, fat!

1470
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:36,969
-Oh, Jesus!
-Give them to me!

1471
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:38,343
Give me the books!

1472
01:41:38,556 --> 01:41:40,051
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1473
01:41:40,266 --> 01:41:42,140
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No! No!

1474
01:41:42,352 --> 01:41:44,890
-Give it to me! Give it to me!
-No! No!

1475
01:41:45,105 --> 01:41:46,978
Now, that's what I call celebrating.

1476
01:41:48,566 --> 01:41:50,892
You. You lousy fruit.

1477
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:53,981
-You ruined me.
-You ungrateful breeder.

1478
01:41:54,197 --> 01:41:57,233
After he stepped in and saved
your little show, I cannot-- My chains!

1479
01:41:57,450 --> 01:42:00,487
-Leave him alone!
-My ltalian chains! My chains!

1480
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,077
You have broken the Siegfried Oath.

1481
01:42:07,293 --> 01:42:09,535
You must die. You all must die!

1482
01:42:17,053 --> 01:42:19,888
What are you doing,
you neo-Nazi nitwit?

1483
01:42:20,098 --> 01:42:22,470
-Your show's a hit.
-Who cares?

1484
01:42:22,684 --> 01:42:24,427
You made a fool out of Hitler.

1485
01:42:24,644 --> 01:42:26,851
-He didn't need our help.
-He didn't need our help.

1486
01:42:30,066 --> 01:42:33,186
Stand still! How can I shoot you
if you keep moving?

1487
01:42:34,404 --> 01:42:35,863
Get back here!

1488
01:42:36,072 --> 01:42:38,029
Under the desk! Under the desk!

1489
01:42:38,908 --> 01:42:41,945
-Darling, quick, back in the closet.
-Okay.

1490
01:42:46,583 --> 01:42:48,291
This is no good.

1491
01:42:48,501 --> 01:42:50,992
I'm not killing anybody.

1492
01:42:51,338 --> 01:42:54,125
You must cooperate!

1493
01:42:56,426 --> 01:42:59,131
All right, Bialystock <i>und</i> Bloom.

1494
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,888
Now I got you.

1495
01:43:01,097 --> 01:43:02,639
Say your prayers!

1496
01:43:03,266 --> 01:43:05,223
Remember I'd tell you
when we're in too deep?

1497
01:43:05,435 --> 01:43:07,226
-Yeah?
-We're in too deep.

1498
01:43:08,313 --> 01:43:10,720
Franz, don't do it! Please, I beg you!

1499
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:13,562
Oh, no, no.

1500
01:43:15,737 --> 01:43:18,062
You snivelling cowards!

1501
01:43:18,281 --> 01:43:20,072
Cringing under a desk?

1502
01:43:20,283 --> 01:43:24,363
Clinging to life like baby butterflies.

1503
01:43:24,579 --> 01:43:27,913
Franz Liebkind will show you
how to die like a man!

1504
01:43:35,757 --> 01:43:38,378
Jammed.
Boy, when things go wrong....

1505
01:43:40,595 --> 01:43:43,679
That's it. Next time, no author.

1506
01:43:45,975 --> 01:43:48,134
What are you shooting
at us for anyway?

1507
01:43:48,353 --> 01:43:49,930
You Teutonic twit!

1508
01:43:51,481 --> 01:43:53,438
Wait. Wait a minute.

1509
01:43:53,650 --> 01:43:55,109
I just got an idea.

1510
01:43:55,318 --> 01:43:57,607
A way to close the show.

1511
01:43:57,821 --> 01:44:00,312
Franz, I--

1512
01:44:01,658 --> 01:44:06,403
-There, there.
-Where? Where?

1513
01:44:06,955 --> 01:44:08,698
Franz, listen to me.

1514
01:44:08,915 --> 01:44:11,240
Why don't you use this
where it'll do some good.

1515
01:44:11,459 --> 01:44:14,081
-Why don't you shoot the actors.
-The actors?

1516
01:44:14,295 --> 01:44:15,754
Yes, the actors.

1517
01:44:15,964 --> 01:44:19,000
Everybody laughed at your
beloved Führer tonight, and why?

1518
01:44:19,217 --> 01:44:22,052
Because of the actors.
The actors were making fun of him.

1519
01:44:22,262 --> 01:44:23,721
Yeah, you're right, the actors!

1520
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:26,801
Yes. Here, go, buy bullets.

1521
01:44:27,017 --> 01:44:30,931
-Kill. Kill all the actors.
-I must kill all the actors.

1522
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:33,637
Wait a minute!

1523
01:44:34,232 --> 01:44:35,975
What are you talking about?

1524
01:44:36,192 --> 01:44:38,944
What do you mean, " kill the actors"?
You can't kill the actors.

1525
01:44:39,154 --> 01:44:41,479
Actors are not animals.
They're human beings.

1526
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:43,690
They are?
Have you ever eaten with one?

1527
01:44:43,908 --> 01:44:46,482
-Here. Listen--
-Open up, it's the police!

1528
01:44:46,703 --> 01:44:48,612
-The police!
-The police!

1529
01:44:50,081 --> 01:44:51,279
Come on, boys.

1530
01:44:51,499 --> 01:44:53,955
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party. I had nothing--

1531
01:44:54,169 --> 01:44:55,995
You, drop that gun.

1532
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:58,839
-Ociffers!
-What's going on here?

1533
01:44:59,049 --> 01:45:00,507
This crazy Kraut is crackers!

1534
01:45:00,717 --> 01:45:02,840
He crashed in here
and crassly tried to kill us.

1535
01:45:03,053 --> 01:45:06,256
-Oh, Roger, what alliteration.
-Thank you, darling.

1536
01:45:08,141 --> 01:45:10,430
Okay, youse two can go.

1537
01:45:10,643 --> 01:45:12,553
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1538
01:45:13,563 --> 01:45:15,188
Tried to kill him, eh?

1539
01:45:16,816 --> 01:45:18,524
Officer O'Rourke, take this man in.

1540
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:20,194
Next stop, Sing Sing.

1541
01:45:20,403 --> 01:45:25,279
Sing Sing?
You'll never take me alive!

1542
01:45:30,413 --> 01:45:34,791
-What happened?
-I broke my other leg.

1543
01:45:40,632 --> 01:45:44,215
All right, who are you,
and why was he trying to shoot you?

1544
01:45:44,427 --> 01:45:48,211
I haven't the slightest idea,
Sergeant O'Toole.

1545
01:45:48,431 --> 01:45:51,551
The name is O'Bialystock.

1546
01:45:51,768 --> 01:45:55,718
I was just passing by on me way
to the Pat O'Brien Film Festival...

1547
01:45:55,939 --> 01:45:59,639
...and I ducked in to see
what the hell was going on.

1548
01:45:59,859 --> 01:46:04,735
And now I'll be on me way,
before me voice gets any higher.

1549
01:46:06,616 --> 01:46:09,736
As we say in the old country, "Taxi!"

1550
01:46:09,953 --> 01:46:11,198
Hold it!

1551
01:46:11,454 --> 01:46:12,913
Hey, sarge, look at this.

1552
01:46:13,123 --> 01:46:15,281
-What?
-I found these two accounting books.

1553
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:20,874
-This one says, "Show to the lRS."
-And what's the other one say?

1554
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:24,006
" Never show to the lRS."

1555
01:46:24,217 --> 01:46:26,922
I think the three of you
better come downtown with me.

1556
01:46:27,137 --> 01:46:31,549
-Three?
-Yeah, you and them two books.

1557
01:46:38,773 --> 01:46:41,347
Mr. Bialystock?

1558
01:46:41,818 --> 01:46:43,811
Mr. Bloom?

1559
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,270
Where are you?

1560
01:46:46,489 --> 01:46:50,273
Everyone is waiting for you
at the opening-night party.

1561
01:46:50,493 --> 01:46:53,660
Ulla, help me.

1562
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:01,790
What happened to you?

1563
01:47:02,922 --> 01:47:04,333
I know.

1564
01:47:04,549 --> 01:47:08,547
You hung up your coat
while you were still in it.

1565
01:47:20,065 --> 01:47:22,734
Thank you for helping me down.

1566
01:47:31,451 --> 01:47:33,029
What were you doing up there?

1567
01:47:33,244 --> 01:47:34,489
Hiding.

1568
01:47:34,704 --> 01:47:35,985
I was hiding.

1569
01:47:36,206 --> 01:47:38,163
From who? From what?

1570
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,537
From the police.

1571
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:43,001
They were just here.
They've arrested Max.

1572
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:45,501
-They found the books?
-I don't know what to do.

1573
01:47:45,715 --> 01:47:46,913
Poor Max.

1574
01:47:47,133 --> 01:47:49,838
Maybe I should turn myself in
and go to jail with him.

1575
01:47:50,053 --> 01:47:54,430
Well, my sweet cupcake,
I know we both love Max...

1576
01:47:54,808 --> 01:47:59,019
...but it seems to me
you have two choices.

1577
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:03,690
Number one, you can go to jail
with Mr. Bialystock...

1578
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:08,112
...for years and years and years.

1579
01:48:08,321 --> 01:48:10,943
Or number two...

1580
01:48:11,157 --> 01:48:16,614
...you can take that 2 million dollars
and Ulla, and go to Rio.

1581
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:20,874
Oh, my God, what a dilemma.

1582
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:23,041
Oh, what should I do?

1583
01:48:23,253 --> 01:48:27,251
Should I go to jail or go to Rio?

1584
01:48:29,843 --> 01:48:32,131
Mail call.

1585
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:35,590
Hey, fatso.

1586
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:38,514
I'm not that fat!

1587
01:48:38,727 --> 01:48:40,387
Says you.

1588
01:48:40,645 --> 01:48:42,721
You got a postcard.

1589
01:48:43,064 --> 01:48:44,973
A postcard? From where?

1590
01:48:45,442 --> 01:48:47,150
Brazil.

1591
01:48:48,111 --> 01:48:49,985
Brazil.

1592
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:53,021
Who do I know in Brazil?

1593
01:48:53,950 --> 01:48:56,406
Why am I asking you?

1594
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:05,164
" Dear Max, Rio is everything
you said it was and more.

1595
01:49:06,796 --> 01:49:09,418
Ulla and I think of you
every chance we get.

1596
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:16,924
<i>In the morning, when we</i>
<i>have breakfast on our terrace...</i>

1597
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:18,718
<i>...many different herrings.</i>

1598
01:49:19,684 --> 01:49:23,931
<i>In the afternoon, when we rub</i>
<i>each other's sun-drenched bodies...</i>

1599
01:49:24,147 --> 01:49:30,268
<i>... with banana-cream coconut oil,</i>
<i>number 15.</i>

1600
01:49:31,654 --> 01:49:36,482
<i>And then, in the evening, when</i>
<i>we samba together in the moonlight.''</i>

1601
01:49:36,701 --> 01:49:39,951
<i>You'll find your happiness in Rio</i>

1602
01:49:40,163 --> 01:49:43,366
<i>The beaches there</i>
<i>Are strewn with pearls</i>

1603
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:46,869
<i>The tropic breezes</i>
<i>Always blow there</i>

1604
01:49:47,087 --> 01:49:50,621
<i>And so, we hear</i>
<i>Do the girls</i>

1605
01:49:51,007 --> 01:49:54,376
<i>''Sorry, must run. U lla's waiting.</i>

1606
01:49:54,678 --> 01:49:57,632
<i>It's almost 11.</i>

1607
01:49:59,724 --> 01:50:01,633
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

1608
01:50:01,851 --> 01:50:06,145
<i>Your pal, Leo.''</i>

1609
01:50:07,524 --> 01:50:09,315
<i>Just like Cain and Abel</i>

1610
01:50:09,526 --> 01:50:11,898
<i>You pulled a sneak attack</i>

1611
01:50:12,112 --> 01:50:14,650
<i>I thought that we were brothers</i>

1612
01:50:14,864 --> 01:50:18,399
<i>Then you stabbed me in the back</i>

1613
01:50:18,618 --> 01:50:22,568
<i>Betrayed</i>

1614
01:50:22,789 --> 01:50:26,240
<i>Oh, boy, I'm so betrayed</i>

1615
01:50:27,168 --> 01:50:29,920
<i>Like Samson and Delilah</i>
<i>Your love began to fade</i>

1616
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:32,751
<i>I'm crying in the hoosegow</i>
<i>You're in Rio getting laid</i>

1617
01:50:32,966 --> 01:50:34,923
<i>Betrayed</i>

1618
01:50:35,135 --> 01:50:38,835
<i>Let's face it, I'm betrayed</i>

1619
01:50:39,222 --> 01:50:44,679
<i>Boy, have I been taken</i>

1620
01:50:45,103 --> 01:50:49,017
<i>Oy, I'm so forsaken</i>

1621
01:50:49,232 --> 01:50:50,726
<i>I should have seen</i>
<i>What came to pass</i>

1622
01:50:50,942 --> 01:50:52,484
<i>I should have known</i>
<i>To watch my ass</i>

1623
01:50:52,694 --> 01:50:55,232
<i>I feel like Othello</i>
<i>Everything is lost</i>

1624
01:50:55,447 --> 01:50:56,692
<i>Leo is Iago</i>

1625
01:50:56,906 --> 01:50:58,235
<i>Max is double-crossed</i>

1626
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,027
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1627
01:51:00,243 --> 01:51:02,366
<i>Did I mention I'm betrayed?</i>

1628
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:05,533
<i>Now I'm about to go to jail</i>
<i>There's no one who will pay my bail</i>

1629
01:51:05,749 --> 01:51:09,497
<i>I have no one who I can cry to</i>
<i>No one I can say goodbye to</i>

1630
01:51:10,295 --> 01:51:12,169
I'm drowning!

1631
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:13,874
I'm drowning!

1632
01:51:14,090 --> 01:51:15,882
I'm drowning here!

1633
01:51:16,092 --> 01:51:19,710
I'm going down for the last time.

1634
01:51:20,388 --> 01:51:24,884
I can see my whole life
flashing before my eyes.

1635
01:51:25,226 --> 01:51:30,897
I see a weathered old farmhouse
with a white picket fence.

1636
01:51:31,149 --> 01:51:35,610
I'm running through fields
of alfalfa with my collie, Rex.

1637
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:38,691
No, Rex, not on the alfalfa.

1638
01:51:41,117 --> 01:51:42,909
And I see my mother.

1639
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:46,737
I see Mama standing
on the back porch...

1640
01:51:46,956 --> 01:51:49,827
...in a worn but clean
gingham gown.

1641
01:51:50,043 --> 01:51:53,246
And I hear my mama
calling out to me.

1642
01:51:53,463 --> 01:51:54,791
Alvin!

1643
01:51:55,006 --> 01:51:56,963
Don't forget your chores.

1644
01:51:57,175 --> 01:52:00,093
The wood needs a-cording
and the cows need a-milking.

1645
01:52:00,303 --> 01:52:03,090
Alvin! Alvin!

1646
01:52:04,641 --> 01:52:05,921
Wait a minute.

1647
01:52:06,142 --> 01:52:08,265
My name's not Alvin.

1648
01:52:08,603 --> 01:52:10,643
That's not my life.

1649
01:52:11,106 --> 01:52:14,688
Somebody else's life
is flashing before my eyes.

1650
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:19,569
What the hell is that about?

1651
01:52:19,864 --> 01:52:22,949
I'm not a hillbilly.
I grew up in the Bronx.

1652
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:37,916
<i>But wait, now I remember</i>

1653
01:52:38,133 --> 01:52:40,505
<i>How did it begin?</i>
<i>He walked into my office</i>

1654
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,296
<i>With his cockamamie scheme</i>

1655
01:52:42,512 --> 01:52:44,884
<i>You can make more money</i>
<i>With a flop than with a hit</i>

1656
01:52:45,098 --> 01:52:47,387
<i>We can do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

1657
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,640
<i>I can't do it</i>
<i>We can do it</i>

1658
01:52:49,853 --> 01:52:52,474
<i>I can't do it</i>
<i>Goodbye, Max</i>

1659
01:52:52,689 --> 01:52:55,144
<i>Lord, I want that money</i>
<i>I'm back, Max</i>

1660
01:52:55,358 --> 01:52:56,639
<i>Come on, Leo, we can do it</i>

1661
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:58,817
<i>Step one, find the play</i>

1662
01:52:59,029 --> 01:53:01,983
<i>See it, smell it, touch it, kiss it</i>
<i>Hello, Mr. Liebkind</i>

1663
01:53:02,198 --> 01:53:03,479
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

1664
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,277
<i>Adolf Elizabeth Hitler?</i>

01:53:05,535 --> 01:53:07,409
<i>Guten Tag hop hop</i>
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

1666
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:10,621
<i>Step two, hire the director</i>
<i>Keep it gay, keep it gay, keep it--</i>

1667
01:53:10,832 --> 01:53:12,908
<i>Two, three, kick,</i>
<i>Turn, turn, turn, kick, turn</i>

1668
01:53:13,126 --> 01:53:14,704
<i>U lla</i>

1669
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:17,247
<i>Step three, raise the money</i>

1670
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:19,747
<i>Along came Bialy</i>

1671
01:53:19,966 --> 01:53:22,255
<i>Step four, hire all the actors</i>

1672
01:53:22,469 --> 01:53:24,710
<i>A wandering minstrel I</i>
<i>A thing of shreds and--</i>

1673
01:53:24,929 --> 01:53:27,005
<i>Next</i>
<i>The little wooden boy</i>

1674
01:53:27,223 --> 01:53:29,015
<i>Next</i>
<i>That's our Hitler</i>

1675
01:53:29,642 --> 01:53:31,682
<i>Break a leg</i>
<i>I broke my leg</i>

1676
01:53:31,895 --> 01:53:33,934
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1677
01:53:34,147 --> 01:53:37,314
<i>A surprise smash</i>
<i>Springtime for Hitler and Germany</i>

1678
01:53:37,525 --> 01:53:39,898
<i>It'll run for years!</i>
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

1679
01:53:40,111 --> 01:53:41,819
<i>Where did we go right?</i>

1680
01:53:42,072 --> 01:53:43,732
<i>Give me those books</i>
<i>Fat, fat, fatty</i>

1681
01:53:43,948 --> 01:53:45,608
<i>Give me those books</i>
<i>Fat, fat, fatty</i>

1682
01:53:45,825 --> 01:53:48,363
<i>Books, fat, books, fat</i>
<i>Books, fat, books, fat</i>

1683
01:53:48,578 --> 01:53:50,037
<i>Lousy fruit</i>
<i>Kill the actors</i>

1684
01:53:50,246 --> 01:53:51,824
<i>You ever eat with one?</i>

1685
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,994
<i>Then you ran to Rio</i>
<i>And you're safely out of reach</i>

1686
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:56,538
<i>I'm behind these bars</i>

1687
01:53:56,753 --> 01:54:01,545
<i>You're banging U lla on the beach</i>

1688
01:54:01,841 --> 01:54:05,293
<i>Just like Julius Caesar</i>

1689
01:54:05,512 --> 01:54:07,718
<i>Was betrayed by Brutus</i>

1690
01:54:07,972 --> 01:54:11,258
<i>Who'd think an accountant</i>
<i>Would turn out to be my Judas</i>

1691
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:13,967
<i>I'm so dismayed</i>

1692
01:54:14,187 --> 01:54:18,399
<i>Is this how I'm repaid?</i>

1693
01:54:18,608 --> 01:54:20,565
<i>To be</i>

1694
01:54:20,777 --> 01:54:28,192
<i>Betrayed</i>

1695
01:54:28,410 --> 01:54:30,533
<i>Betrayed</i>

1696
01:54:32,914 --> 01:54:36,365
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached your verdict?

1697
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,080
Yes, Your Honour, we have.

1698
01:54:40,422 --> 01:54:42,545
We find the defendant...

1699
01:54:42,757 --> 01:54:44,916
...incredibly guilty.

1700
01:54:48,138 --> 01:54:50,379
Hold me, touch me.

1701
01:54:51,641 --> 01:54:53,848
I'm a little busy.

1702
01:54:54,185 --> 01:54:58,397
Does the defendant have
anything to say on his own behalf?

1703
01:54:59,983 --> 01:55:02,308
Yes, Your Honour, I do.

1704
01:55:03,319 --> 01:55:08,065
I admit, for the last 20 years
I've been a lying, double-crossing...

1705
01:55:08,283 --> 01:55:11,616
...two-faced, backstabbing,
despicable crook.

1706
01:55:11,828 --> 01:55:13,287
But I had no choice.

1707
01:55:14,664 --> 01:55:17,618
I was a Broadway producer.

1708
01:55:18,501 --> 01:55:19,996
A man without a conscience...

1709
01:55:20,295 --> 01:55:22,702
...and with no one
who gave a damn about him.

1710
01:55:22,922 --> 01:55:25,710
And that, Your Honour,
is what hurts the most.

1711
01:55:26,217 --> 01:55:30,049
I thought I'd at last
found a loyal partner.

1712
01:55:30,722 --> 01:55:33,177
A man I cared about...

1713
01:55:33,516 --> 01:55:35,474
...and who I thought
cared about me.

1714
01:55:36,019 --> 01:55:37,394
What breaks my heart is now...

1715
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:39,929
...when I need him most,
he's deserted me.

1716
01:55:40,148 --> 01:55:42,639
I will probably never see
or hear from him ever again.

1717
01:55:42,859 --> 01:55:44,270
That's not true!

1718
01:55:48,948 --> 01:55:50,324
Order! Order in the court!

1719
01:55:50,909 --> 01:55:53,614
And stop that samba!

1720
01:55:54,871 --> 01:55:57,991
-Who are you?
-I am Leopold Bloom...

1721
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:01,043
...Max Bialystock's partner.

1722
01:56:01,252 --> 01:56:03,494
And who are you, my dear?

1723
01:56:03,713 --> 01:56:07,248
My name is
Ulla lnga Hansen Benson...

1724
01:56:07,467 --> 01:56:12,627
...Yonsen Tallen-Hallen
Svaden Svanson Bloom.

1725
01:56:12,847 --> 01:56:14,390
Bloom?

1726
01:56:14,599 --> 01:56:17,173
-You're his wife?
<i>-Ja</i>, Your Honour.

1727
01:56:17,394 --> 01:56:20,145
He wouldn't do it
unless we got married.

1728
01:56:21,356 --> 01:56:22,554
What a schmuck.

1729
01:56:24,776 --> 01:56:27,148
Now, Mr. Bloom,
why in the world would you...

1730
01:56:27,362 --> 01:56:29,687
...want to come back here
and give yourself up?

1731
01:56:29,906 --> 01:56:32,527
Why? To speak on his behalf.

1732
01:56:33,493 --> 01:56:38,404
We all know that Max Bialystock
is a lying, double-crossing...

1733
01:56:38,623 --> 01:56:43,119
...two-faced, slimy,
manipulative, underhanded--

1734
01:56:43,336 --> 01:56:44,914
Please...

1735
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:46,832
...don't help me.

1736
01:56:48,925 --> 01:56:51,879
Your Honour-- Your honour,
if I may address the court.

1737
01:56:53,179 --> 01:56:58,719
The law was created to protect
people from being wronged.

1738
01:56:58,935 --> 01:57:02,719
So whom has
Max Bialystock wronged?

1739
01:57:02,939 --> 01:57:05,975
-Well, not these dear ladies.
-No.

1740
01:57:06,192 --> 01:57:08,268
And not me, not--

1741
01:57:08,778 --> 01:57:10,687
Not me.

1742
01:57:11,114 --> 01:57:13,237
I was this nobody.

1743
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:16,735
No on<i>e e</i>ver called m<i>e ''</i> Leo" before.

1744
01:57:16,953 --> 01:57:20,037
I mean, Your Honour,
I know it isn't a big legal point...

1745
01:57:20,248 --> 01:57:24,412
...but even when I was in kindergarten
everybody always called m<i>e ''</i> Bloom."

1746
01:57:24,919 --> 01:57:28,917
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that even when I was in Rio...

1747
01:57:29,132 --> 01:57:33,841
...and had everything
I'd ever dreamed of...

1748
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:39,548
...I suddenly realized that--

1749
01:57:39,768 --> 01:57:41,844
That this man....

1750
01:57:42,896 --> 01:57:44,556
This man....

1751
01:57:45,398 --> 01:57:48,684
<i>No one ever made me</i>
<i>Feel like someone</i>

1752
01:57:49,194 --> 01:57:51,151
<i>Till him</i>

1753
01:57:53,698 --> 01:57:57,233
<i>Life was really nothing</i>
<i>But a glum one</i>

1754
01:57:57,452 --> 01:58:00,821
<i>Till him</i>

1755
01:58:01,706 --> 01:58:05,455
<i>My existence bordered on the tragic</i>

1756
01:58:05,919 --> 01:58:09,204
<i>Always timid</i>
<i>Never took a chance</i>

1757
01:58:10,006 --> 01:58:11,963
<i>Then I felt his magic</i>

1758
01:58:12,175 --> 01:58:16,754
<i>And my heart began to dance</i>

1759
01:58:18,223 --> 01:58:21,758
<i>I was always frightened</i>
<i>Fraught with worry</i>

1760
01:58:22,018 --> 01:58:24,260
<i>Till him</i>

1761
01:58:26,523 --> 01:58:29,974
<i>I was going nowhere in a hurry</i>

1762
01:58:30,193 --> 01:58:34,606
<i>Till him</i>

1763
01:58:34,948 --> 01:58:39,159
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1764
01:58:39,536 --> 01:58:44,661
<i>Filled it to the brim</i>

1765
01:58:44,874 --> 01:58:50,995
<i>There could never</i>
<i>Ever be another one</i>

1766
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:58,511
<i>Like him</i>

1767
01:59:02,058 --> 01:59:03,636
Leo....

1768
01:59:10,108 --> 01:59:11,602
Leo...

1769
01:59:11,818 --> 01:59:14,226
...I never realized.

1770
01:59:15,613 --> 01:59:19,362
-You're a good singer.
-Thank you.

1771
01:59:19,576 --> 01:59:23,870
-No, really, like a professional.
-Well, I sang it for you, Max.

1772
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,081
I sang it because I'm your friend.

1773
01:59:28,335 --> 01:59:29,912
You are?

1774
01:59:31,004 --> 01:59:33,874
I've had a lot of relationships...

1775
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:36,130
...but you couldn't call
any of them "friend."

1776
01:59:36,343 --> 01:59:38,335
But come to think of it...

1777
01:59:38,595 --> 01:59:41,928
...no on<i>e e</i>ver, ever really knew me.

1778
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:45,556
<i>Till him</i>

1779
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,352
<i>Everyone was always out</i>
<i>To screw me</i>

1780
01:59:51,566 --> 01:59:55,564
<i>Till him</i>

1781
01:59:56,863 --> 02:00:01,157
<i>Never met a man I ever trusted</i>

1782
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:05,780
<i>Always dealt with shysters</i>
<i>In the past</i>

1783
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:08,364
<i>Now I'm well-adjusted</i>

1784
02:00:08,583 --> 02:00:14,704
<i>'Cause I've got a friend at last</i>

1785
02:00:18,593 --> 02:00:20,586
Don't help me.

1786
02:00:20,804 --> 02:00:25,098
<i>Always playing singles</i>
<i>Never doubles</i>

1787
02:00:25,308 --> 02:00:28,095
<i>Till him</i>

1788
02:00:42,659 --> 02:00:47,120
<i>Never had a pal</i>
<i>To share my troubles</i>

1789
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:51,957
<i>Till him</i>

1790
02:00:52,544 --> 02:00:57,122
<i>He filled up my empty life</i>

1791
02:00:57,757 --> 02:01:02,965
<i>-Filled it to the brim</i>
<i>-Filled it to the brim</i>

1792
02:01:03,388 --> 02:01:06,009
<i>There could never ever be</i>

1793
02:01:06,224 --> 02:01:11,930
<i>Another one</i>

1794
02:01:14,357 --> 02:01:24,192
<i>Like him</i>

1795
02:01:29,622 --> 02:01:31,615
Gentlemen, it breaks my heart...

1796
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:34,205
...to break up
such a beautiful friendship.

1797
02:01:34,419 --> 02:01:36,127
So I won't.

1798
02:01:36,338 --> 02:01:39,007
Five years in the state penitentiary
at Sing Sing.

1799
02:01:41,217 --> 02:01:44,421

<i>Are always free</i>

1805
02:01:56,066 --> 02:01:57,061

Congratulations.

1810
02:02:08,078 --> 02:02:11,244
You now own 45 percent...

1811

...of <i>Prisoners of Love</i>. Next!

1812
02:02:15,919 --> 02:02:18,207

-Six hundred percent.

ls that all? Keep selling.
Keep selling.

1814
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:26,672
All right, break it up! Break it up!
Quiet! Give me that.

1815
02:02:26,888 --> 02:02:28,881
How many times do
I have to tell you guys?

1816
02:02:29,099 --> 02:02:31,803
No knife fights in rehearsal.

1817

Hi. What are you in for,
lack of rhythm?

1818
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:39,062
Get in line.
Everybody get in line, right away!

Hey, you.

1827
02:03:00,714 --> 02:03:03,917
The warden wants to get in
on this thing.

1828
02:03:06,678 --> 02:03:09,762
Tell the warden he now owns
100 percent of <i>Prisoners of Love</i>.

1829

Hey, Bialystock, Bloom, Liebkind,
good news!

1834
02:03:24,279 --> 02:03:25,773
This just came from the governor.

1835
02:03:25,989 --> 02:03:28,231
"Gentlemen, you are hereby
granted a full pardon...

1836
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:31,534
...for having, through song and dance,
brought joy and laughter...

1837
02:03:31,745 --> 02:03:35,612
...into the hearts of every murderer,
rapist and sex maniac in Sing Sing."

1838
02:03:35,832 --> 02:03:38,204
-You're free!
-Free?

1839
02:03:38,418 --> 02:03:41,123
Next stop, <i>Prisoners of Love</i>

02:04:29,177 --> 02:04:30,588
<i>Blue skies above</i>

1853
02:04:30,804 --> 02:04:32,512
<i>'Cause we're still prisoners</i>

1854
02:04:32,889 --> 02:04:34,264
<i>We're still prisoners</i>

1855
02:04:34,766 --> 02:04:37,387
<i>We're still prisoners of love</i>

1856
02:04:37,602 --> 02:04:41,849
<i>-Love, love, love</i>
<i>-Love, love, love, love</i>

1857
02:04:42,357 --> 02:04:44,100
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

1858
02:04:44,317 --> 02:04:51,399
<i>Love</i>

1859
02:05:06,464 --> 02:05:08,291
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1860
02:05:08,508 --> 02:05:10,417
<i>Up off our backs</i>

1861
02:05:10,635 --> 02:05:14,384
<i>Back on the Great White Way</i>

1862
02:05:14,597 --> 02:05:16,555
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1863
02:05:16,766 --> 02:05:18,391
<i>Back on our tracks</i>

1864
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:21,887
<i>We're back on top to stay</i>

1865
02:05:22,105 --> 02:05:26,268
<i>So when we take your money</i>
<i>Never fear</i>

1866
02:05:26,484 --> 02:05:30,233
<i>We'll knock Broadway</i>
<i>Right on its ear</i>

1867
02:05:30,447 --> 02:05:32,238
<i>The cast is great</i>
<i>The script is swell</i>

1868
02:05:32,449 --> 02:05:34,109
<i>But this we're telling you, sirs</i>

1869
02:05:34,325 --> 02:05:35,950
<i>It's just no go</i>
<i>You've got no show</i>

1870
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:39,327
<i>Without the producers</i>

1871
02:05:42,125 --> 02:05:44,877
<i>We'll never quit</i>

1872
02:05:45,086 --> 02:05:46,415
<i>Hit after hit</i>

1873
02:05:50,633 --> 02:05:55,758
<i>The producers</i>
<i>Leo and Max</i>

1874
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:47,366
<i>The overture is over</i>

1875
02:07:47,584 --> 02:07:49,790
<i>The curtain starts to rise</i>

1876
02:07:50,003 --> 02:07:52,079
<i>You're suddenly in clover</i>

1877
02:07:52,297 --> 02:07:54,586
<i>You can't believe your eyes</i>

1878
02:07:54,799 --> 02:07:56,875
<i>You're sitting on the aisle</i>

1879
02:07:57,093 --> 02:07:59,300
<i>You break into a smile</i>

1880
02:07:59,512 --> 02:08:01,422
<i>Why this magic feeling?</i>

1881
02:08:01,639 --> 02:08:05,803
<i>And then you realize</i>

1882
02:08:06,019 --> 02:08:09,055
<i>That there is</i>

1883
02:08:09,272 --> 02:08:13,400
<i>Nothing like a show on Broadway</i>

1884
02:08:13,610 --> 02:08:17,608
<i>Nothing like a Broadway show</i>

1885
02:08:17,822 --> 02:08:21,357
<i>Hearts will skip a beat on Broadway</i>

1886
02:08:21,576 --> 02:08:24,067
<i>If you're feeling blue</i>
<i>I'm telling you</i>

1887
02:08:24,287 --> 02:08:26,161
<i>That's the place to go</i>

1888
02:08:26,373 --> 02:08:28,412
<i>Movies drag</i>
<i>Their endings sag</i>

1889
02:08:28,625 --> 02:08:30,249
<i>TV's just a bore</i>

1890
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:32,417
<i>So hit the street</i>
<i>And move your feet</i>

1891
02:08:32,629 --> 02:08:34,123
<i>To the place we all adore</i>

1892
02:08:34,339 --> 02:08:38,882
<i>Because there's nothing</i>
<i>Like a show on Broadway</i>

1893
02:08:39,094 --> 02:08:43,008
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1894
02:08:43,223 --> 02:08:44,931
<i>It's often been said</i>
<i>The theatre is dead</i>

1895
02:08:45,141 --> 02:08:46,801
<i>The critics repeat it en masse</i>

1896
02:08:47,018 --> 02:08:48,810
<i>But the theatre's alive</i>
<i>It's gonna survive</i>

1897
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:50,598
<i>Although it's a pain in the ass</i>

1898
02:08:50,814 --> 02:08:52,605
<i>You waited forever</i>
<i>And finally got tickets</i>

1899
02:08:52,816 --> 02:08:54,642
<i>To get to your seat</i>
<i>You gotta cross pickets</i>

1900
02:08:54,859 --> 02:08:56,651
<i>The guy to your right</i>
<i>Is frightfully tight</i>

1901
02:08:56,861 --> 02:08:59,103
<i>The guy to your left</i>
<i>Appears to have rickets</i>

1902
02:08:59,322 --> 02:09:01,196
<i>The music's yuck</i>
<i>The lyrics suck</i>

1903
02:09:01,408 --> 02:09:03,234
<i>The casting is all wrong</i>

1904
02:09:03,451 --> 02:09:05,278
<i>And when you reach the bathroom</i>

1905
02:09:05,495 --> 02:09:06,775
<i>The line is five miles long</i>

1906
02:09:06,996 --> 02:09:11,243
<i>But still there's nothing</i>
<i>Like a show on Broadway</i>

1907
02:09:11,459 --> 02:09:15,327
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1908
02:09:15,547 --> 02:09:17,255
<i>You swear you'll never go again</i>

1909
02:09:17,465 --> 02:09:19,292
<i>It's simply not worthwhile</i>

1910
02:09:19,509 --> 02:09:21,549
<i>You make that v ow</i>
<i>And then somehow</i>

1911
02:09:21,761 --> 02:09:26,257
<i>-You're back there on the aisle</i>
<i>-You're back there on the aisle</i>

1912
02:09:26,474 --> 02:09:29,678
<i>That's why there's</i>

1913
02:09:29,894 --> 02:09:33,726
<i>Nothing like a show</i>
<i>On Broadway</i>

1914
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:36,396
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1915
02:09:36,609 --> 02:09:37,985
<i>Till you're in movies</i>

1916
02:09:38,194 --> 02:09:42,406
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>Like a Broadway show</i>

1917
02:09:42,615 --> 02:09:46,744
<i>And though it is expensive</i>
<i>At a hundred bucks a throw</i>

1918
02:09:46,953 --> 02:09:49,574
<i>There's nothing</i>

1919
02:09:49,789 --> 02:09:56,291
<i>Like a Broadway show!</i>

1920
02:13:08,405 --> 02:13:11,655

<i>-Goodbye</i>
<i>-Get lost</i>

1937
02:14:07,714 --> 02:14:11,297
<i>Get out</i>

1938
02:14:11,801 --> 02:14:13,177
It's over.
