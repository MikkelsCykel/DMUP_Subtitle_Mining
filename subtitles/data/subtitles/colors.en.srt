00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,807
Hodges. What d'you think
about those hotshot jitterbugs?

2
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,923
- What about 'em?
- You never pulled that shit, did you?

3
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,006
No way.

4
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,247
- Bullshit, huh?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,646
I don't understand Melindez, I really don't.
John Wayne's Rexall Rangers - pussies.

6
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,965
I got one year left.

7
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,445
Gimme a towel. And after that...

8
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,886
After that...

9
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,286
Ex cuse me.

10
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,166
I'm gonna go for another ten.

11
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,166
Who are you?

12
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,446
Rocky VI.

13
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,286
What'd you say you did for a living?

14
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,003
I'm a guardian of masculinity, man.

15
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,008
- Somebody smells good!
- Where does that put you?

16
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,247
- Where the fuck is my gun?
- Fuck.

17
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,282
We want a uniformed presence...

18
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,366
...out in the street.

19
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,720
They're flying their colours,...

20
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,647
...we're flying ours.

21
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,523
I want them to know
who they're dealing with.

22
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,885
They got uzis. They got shotguns.

23
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:38,482
They got explosives. They got access
to any weapon they want within 24 hours.

24
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,408
We got over 50,000
gangbangers out there.

25
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,760
We're bleeding from open wounds.

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,563
We're just jamming you 24 in
to stop the flow.

27
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,079
We sound like a bunch of Tampax.

28
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,120
What?

29
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,648
You wanna tell me what you were saying?

30
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,007
uh...

31
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,883
I said we sound like
a bunch of Tampax, sir.

32
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,488
Kid's cute.

33
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,085
Tampax goes someplace good.

34
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,763
- Give this guy to Hodges.
- What? What?

35
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,160
Beat it.

36
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,399
- Just light the damn sherm.
- Yes, yes.

37
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,680
- Light it up, dude.
- Yes, yes, yo.

38
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,887
- Sherm up the driver, cuz.
- Eat it up.

39
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,400
We like to get high
So a nigger kid dies

40
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,249
Checkin' out slobs
That is our job

41
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,079
And if you think we're the Crips
Well, you hit it on the nob

42
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,520
G- ridin' in the van
With my main man

43
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,006
Shotgun jam
Turnin' niggers into Spam

44
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,762
Rocket don't smoke
And Rocket don't joke

45
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,609
Yo! Rocket, put the cap on the nigger

46
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,363
- Hey, man, shut the fuck up.
- Better?

47
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,050
- Chill out, motherfucker.
- Yo, Rocket.

48
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,565
Man, I'm high as a motherfucker.

49
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,804
Yo, Rocket, we're comin' in.

50
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,807
Hey, Blood!

51
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,648
Oh, God! No!

52
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,681
No! No!

53
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,482
No! No!

54
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,727
Oh, God! No! No! No!

55
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,410
He can't die! He can't die!

56
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,601
No! He can't die!

57
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,643
No! Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!

58
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,925
No!

59
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,521
- What'd you find out?
- OK, the victim's name is Robert Craig.

60
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,039
A little warlock, house of Blood set.

61
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,288
Apparently, at least two blacks
drive by in a van, say "Hey, Blood. " Boom.

62
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,366
Shit.

63
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,365
She saw it.

64
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,646
Ex cuse me.

65
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,282
- I ain't seen nothin'.
- I'd like to ask you a few questions.

66
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,444
- Nothin'!
- Ma'am, if you saw this, you can't...

67
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,165
Who can't? Just get on out of my face.

68
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,202
Are you gonna just close your eyes
every time this happens?

69
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,881
- There's a kid laying here dead, ma'am!
- Let's go, let's go. She has to live here.

70
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,245
He can't die! He can't die!

71
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,080
D'you need anything?

72
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,165
Jeez, I don't know, Hodges.
Maybe some of your valuable expertise.

73
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,522
I doubt it. You guys are doin' such a fine
job, that's why they call us out at 2am.

74
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,805
Hey, why don't you flyin' CRASH guys
go take a flyin' fuck?

75
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,166
Hey, fuck you.

76
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,849
- Fuck you.
- Let's get in the car.

77
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,926
There's too many bodies around here.

78
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,405
No! No! No!

79
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,202
He can't die! No!

80
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,800
Lord have mercy! Lord have mercy!

81
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,682
No!

82
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,839
The kid was a Blood. Dealing too.

83
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,168
Whether it was drugs or gang related, I
don't know. For now, let's hook and book.

84
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,009
Be inventive. Find some probable cause.

85
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,088
Get both gangs off the street,
at least for a night or two.

86
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,804
Let 'em calm down. See if they'll talk.

87
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,006
What I need is a shot of Demerol
and some clean sheets.

88
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,970
Whoa, whoa. Any further questions?

89
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,558
- No, sir.
- All right. Let's rock'n'roll.

90
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,559
- Stand up. Keep your fuckin' mouth shut.
- Why the fuck you holdin' on us?

91
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,487
- Wait, wait.
- Shut up!

92
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,760
Don't get ex cited, man. Wait!

93
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,408
Yo, man, we ain't did nothin'!

94
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,602
Man, they rode on us.
The punk-ass motherfuckers!

95
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,439
Keep movin, Rocket.

96
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,079
And there they are.
The Ville. Crips. Crip de Ville.

97
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,289
Stone fuckin' killers. They'll walk in your
house, blow you away, sit down to eat...

98
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,560
Then leave.

99
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,005
That's right. You get them off the street.

100
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,847
- Lady, we're trying.
- You need more help!

101
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,202
- So, what's up, Rocky-o?
- Yo, yo, yo, put it here.

102
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,564
Get your hand outta my face, all right?

103
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,725
Oh.

104
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,806
Hodges, you back, huh?

105
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,843
- What's up, homes?
- Hey, turn the music down, man.

106
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,248
- Hey, fuck that! That ain't my job.
- You better watch your back, man.

107
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,203
Nice ride, man. I didn't make it.

108
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,721
- Why you sneakin' up on us like that?
- You wanna get back on the sidewalk?

109
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,686
- You're all buffed out. Been to the joint?
- Just County. Missed you for a while.

110
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,364
You out on good time? What's this?

111
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,248
Oh, this here's my Hopalong Cassidy rag.

112
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,043
Get rid of it.

113
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,960
- Find better friends. You're in violation.
- Hey, I live right there. I'm just passin' by.

114
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,879
- What's the matter with him?
- Who, Rocket?

115
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,526
- Don't he like it around here?
- Cuz is down for the hood, man.

116
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,086
Y'all got any dope today?

117
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,726
Not us. We just say no to drugs.

118
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,958
- You go get some. I'll be right back.
- All right, man. Get some for us.

119
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,248
Yeah, you bet.

120
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,567
Hey, later on, Hodges.
Take care of yourself, homeboy.

121
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,646
They ain't got nothin', cuz.

122
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,086
Hodges has a new partner.

123
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,765
Fuckin' Melindez, man. I cannot
believe I'm back out here. Man!

124
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,803
I worked CRASH for five years.
I did my time. Finally made it up to Juvie.

125
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,128
Home at night with the wife. Get to
help somebody every once in a while...

126
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,208
Here I am. Same old shit.

127
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,482
He don't wanna see us.

128
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,486
Freeze.

129
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,960
Stop, asshole!

130
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,961
Fuckhead!

131
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,168
Don't move.

132
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,123
That's what you get
for messin' with the police.

133
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,289
Hands behind your heads, interlock your
fingers, down on your knees. Let's go.

134
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,366
Cross your ankles. Don't move.

135
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,318
Drop it.

136
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,363
1- CRASH-32. Requesting backup.
My partner's on foot in an alley.

137
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,640
1200... South Main.

138
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,681
OK, you kids, get outta here. Get lost. Go
home. These guys are creeps. Go home!

139
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,766
Go on!

140
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,486
Bring him out here, McGavin.

141
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,999
Homes, what d'you think I'm gonna
find when I look under that car, huh?

142
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,882
Huh?

143
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,441
You don't run from
the fastest white boy on two feet.

144
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,200
Oh, man, you smell good, homes.
What is that? Eau de doo-dah-day?

145
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,166
I saw him toss it.

146
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,320
What the hell were you runnin' for?

147
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,721
Answer me, asshole.

148
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,726
Answer me.

149
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,440
What's your name?

150
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,690
- What's your name?
- Clarence Brown.

151
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,639
- Don't lie to me.
- Clarence Brown.

152
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,524
- How old are you?
- 18.

153
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,086
How old are you?

154
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,883
14.

155
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,481
What else do they call you?
What's your name on the street?

156
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,566
Give me another name.

157
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,120
- High Top.
- Why do they call you that?

158
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,448
You a second-storey man, High Top?
You go down on basketball players?

159
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,489
What do you hang out with this loser for?
Wanna be like him? You do, don't you?

160
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,168
No.

161
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,722
- What's your heart beatin' for?
- I'm scared, man.

162
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,325
I thought you were runnin' a marathon.

163
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,125
Got it.

164
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,605
Stand up. Let's see your tattoos.

165
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,243
Oh, man, homes. It's fuckin' Gibraltar.

166
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,803
- Look at the red. He's a Blood. Let's see.
- What?

167
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,929
- Recognise this?
Cancel Christmas. You're dead.

168
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,406
- You on parole or probation?
- No.

169
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,328
Well, I got you on my file now.

170
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,199
If I catch you here again, I'm gonna shove
this up your ass. How would that feel?

171
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,407
uncuff him.

172
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,486
uncuff him.

173
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,886
You heard me.

174
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,329
- I'm Hodges. Ask around who I am.
- Yeah.

175
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,281
- You owe me one, OK?
- Yeah.

176
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,366
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.

177
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,206
Say it.

178
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,000
- I owe you one.
- OK.

179
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,086
Get outta here.

180
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,360
This alley is hot.

181
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,446
It's no longer yours, it's mine.

182
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,607
If I catch you here again,
I'm gonna arrest you.

183
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,483
Be straight with me,
I'll be straight with you.

184
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,443
Now, all of you, get lost.
Let's go. Come on. Out!

185
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,288
- Come on, man. Let's go.
- Go on.

186
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,560
- We'll get him round the corner.
- Right on.

187
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,840
I'm down for that.

188
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,966
I'll drive.

189
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,679
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

190
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,278
I made a righteous collar
back there, partner.

191
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,323
If I do something, I expect you to back
me up and I hope you expect the same.

192
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,999
Oh. You don't even know the area, yet you
wanna drag him in for a pissy little rock...

193
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,247
...and spend the rest of the shift
doin' paperwork? Is that a plan?

194
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,600
- You wanna hear a plan? I got a plan.
- Yeah.

195
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,319
We get him for rock,
then for somethin' else,...

196
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,887
...and when he does something serious,
it's not a first fuckin' offence!

197
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,369
Male causing disturbance
at parking lot, corner of 9th and Figueroa.

198
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,566
Shit.

199
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,609
OK, that's your plan. All right.
Now you wanna hear mine?

200
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,528
You're full of fuckin' adrenaline, man.
You know...

201
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,847
You're not chasin' around
Mickey Mouse crimes any more.

202
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,764
Now, the plan as I see it
is to get to know these guys,...

203
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,848
...so then when somethin' big
does come along...

204
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,482
You wanna listen or what?

205
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,323
What?

206
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,362
You wanna look at pussy
or learn about this job? Which is it?

207
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,725
You heard the one about the two bulls?

208
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,686
Not yet.

209
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,766
Not yet, huh?

210
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,729
These two bulls are sittin' on a knoll
overlookin' a herd of Guernseys,...

211
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,527
...and the baby bull says "Hey, Pop, let's
run down and fuck one of those cows. "

212
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,210
But the papa bull says "No, Son. "

213
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,006
"Let's walk down. "

214
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,086
"Fuck 'em all. "

215
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,083
Unit 15,
what is your location?

216
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,128
- When d'you get outta jail?
What?

217
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,325
I could put a word in with Parole.

218
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,366
- What's your name?
- Louisa.

219
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,808
Danny.

220
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,921
Hi, Danny.

221
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,928
So you get time off for good behaviour?

222
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,326
You ever go out with a cop?

223
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,806
You don't like cops, do you?

224
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,488
No.

225
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,807
- No what?
- No sale. Let's go.

226
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,409
Yeah, sure.

227
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,280
I will be back.

228
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,720
I really love... your coffee, Louisa.

229
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,561
Bye.

230
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,646
Bye.

231
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,164
- You're jealous.
- That's right.

232
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,487
But I got a wife at home
whom I love, and three kids.

233
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,161
- Yeah, well, that don't mean shit.
- That's why I'm jealous.

234
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,524
You don't wanna get laid, man.

235
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,086
It leads to kissin',
and pretty soon you gotta talk to 'em.

236
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:43,119
White Fence are the oldest gang in LA.
There's three or four generations.

237
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,925
I don't know if you remember -
they threatened that lady DA last year.

238
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,920
Que pasó, homes?
- What's up?

239
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,962
Nice ride.
- Hodges, what's happenin'?

240
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,808
Not much.

241
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,922
You still smokin' that PCP?
Make you stupid, man.

242
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,247
No, I don't fuck with juice. This is weed.

243
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,326
Peewees smoke that shit. I don't.

244
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,320
You seen any... gang members around?

245
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,279
Who, me? I ain't seen any gang members.

246
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,366
You seen any gang members?

247
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,765
Check these vatos.

248
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,728
- 21st Street on our list?
- Nah.

249
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,364
Poor fuckers are professional victims.

250
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,641
Get their ass kicked constantly.

251
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,726
Kind of a mixed gang.

252
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,601
You got Diamond Street there, the Ville,
and the projects on the west.

253
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,688
So they gotta fight their way in
and fight their way out.

254
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,847
- They're fucked, huh?
- They are fucked.

255
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,406
Jesus!

256
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,240
What're you gonna do? Stand in the street
and wave your fist? Let's go. Come on!

257
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,206
Hey, what you guys doin'?

258
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,803
Stay where you are.
Drop and you're dead, buddy.

259
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,081
OK. All right, let's line up.
Come on, let's go.

260
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,280
Come on. Right up here. Let's go.

261
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,366
Let's go. Come on.

262
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,686
All right.

263
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,799
What's the matter with you?
Put that fuckin' thing away!

264
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,247
Asshole.

265
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,838
Hey, get your hands outta your pockets.
Put your hands behind your neck.

266
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,642
Come on. And you.

267
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,968
Are you guys stupid or what? Throwin'
rocks at our car... This is my office.

268
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,241
What are you, crazy?

269
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,448
Get your hands up.
Gimme your fingers, man.

270
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,806
Spread your legs. Wider.

271
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,127
Spread your fuckin' legs, homes.

272
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,368
Who threw the rock?

273
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,919
We can have it any way you want.
You wanna have an understanding?

274
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,610
Are we gonna have
some kind of rapport or what?

275
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,440
- What's that?
- Cigarettes.

276
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,522
- You have any fuckin' primos in there?
- Chale, homes.

277
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,606
OK, get out.

278
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,406
What do you wanna have?

279
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,208
- Hodges, still with that rapport shit, huh?
- Hey. How you doin'?

280
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,247
What's my little brother
doin' up in that tree?

281
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,324
- Thinks he's a monkey vato, eh?
- Stay up there.

282
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,406
You heard the man.

283
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,922
- Little brother?
- Sí, mon.

284
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,526
What's your name, little brother?

285
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,279
- Tell him your name, homes.
- Felipe.

286
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,767
- That's my partner, McGavin.
- What's your name, man?

287
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,926
- Huh?
- Larry.

288
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,802
Larry.

289
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,406
New partner.

290
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,486
OK, Larry. Get over there.

291
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,166
Larry Sylvester. Looney Tunes.

292
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,520
What's the matter
with the peewees, homes?

293
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,086
- What?
- They threw a rock at my brand-new car.

294
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,480
Who threw the rock?

295
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,286
Who threw it?!

296
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,442
- You're a stupid fuck, you know that?
- No future in it, homie.

297
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,920
- So you're back in the jungles, homes?
- This ain't the jungle. This is Disneyland.

298
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,846
So how we gonna teach them?

299
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,445
I don't know, Hodges. I don't know, man.

300
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,482
I don't know about this
younger generation, homes.

301
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,169
You come down, Felipe.
I'm gonna beat your ass.

302
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,489
Well, keep the homeboys in line, all right?

303
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,966
Yes, sir.

304
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,686
Have a good day.

305
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,678
All right, homes.

306
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,008
I didn't mean to jump on your case,
it's just you were blowin' my deal.

307
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:05,166
Our community have kids out there
who are dying over colours.

308
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,647
I mean, actually dying over red or blue.
And what we need is your help.

309
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,126
We need you to testify when
you see something going on out there.

310
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,799
We're outnumbered, we're outgunned,
we're tired. We need your help.

311
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,444
You mean the cops
don't have enough guns? Shit!

312
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,722
- You wanna know why they pull this shit?
- Cos there ain't no jobs out there!

313
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,525
Hell with 'em all!
Throw all the motherfuckers in jail, huh?

314
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,325
I know all about bein' outgunned,
all right? I mean, I was in Vietnam.

315
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,599
Yeah!

316
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,120
It ain't about what you got in your hand.
It's about what the people want.

317
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,879
That's what it is, man.
You're doggone right that's what it is.

318
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,923
- It's what the people want.
- Wait. Let the man talk, all right?

319
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,759
I used to run with a gang, all right?
Now I work with 'em.

320
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,960
I just wanna make a point here.

321
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,969
The reality on the streets is
the dope dealer has the Mercedes-Benz,...

322
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,686
...the money and the women. Now, these
kids have eyes. They see what's goin' on.

323
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,122
And that is their socialisation.
It's the values that they respect.

324
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,718
We don't educate 'em.
We don't give 'em jobs.

325
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,648
We know all that.
Why don't you do somethin' about it?

326
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,603
Look, what we need
is some damn protection.

327
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,643
- Then you've got to get involved.
- Why the fuck d'you think we're here?

328
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,489
We're fed up! We're sick of this shit!

329
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,078
The police are never gonna get anywhere.

330
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,646
Shakin' people down,
shinin' their lights in our eyes.

331
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,240
Treatin' all of us like criminals
cos of where we live!

332
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,124
- And right in front of our kids!
- D'you know where your kids are now?

333
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,284
Fuck you!

334
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,208
- Fuck you, man!
- You don't go botherin' me about my kid.

335
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,527
Calm down!
Please hold it down. Let's come to order!

336
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,643
I want to thank Miss Loretta Thomas
and her choir,...

337
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,524
...greet the congregation and
all the rest of you who have chosen...

338
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,722
...to grace our church on this special day.

339
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:03,959
What makes this day so special?
"What is so special?" you ask.

340
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,241
Another black boy bites the dust
to which thou art returned.

341
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,999
I knew this boy, this Robert Craig,...

342
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,439
...whose mama brought him up
as best she could.

343
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,642
- It wasn't lack of love that killed him.
Amen!

344
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,238
It was the scourge of drugs and gangs.

345
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,326
That's right.

346
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,560
And what makes this day so special is, we
have now declared war upon this plague!

347
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,645
Yeah!

348
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,286
Till we see that this scourge of
gang violence is driven from our streets!

349
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,600
We've been bullied too long
by these sawed-off gangsters.

350
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,528
These gangbangers,
as they call themselves.

351
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,046
And now it is time for decent folk,...

352
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,480
- ... for people of God, to start bangin' back.
- Amen!

353
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,882
- Are we afraid of these hoodlums?
- No.

354
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,080
- I said, are we afraid?
- No!

355
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,528
They hit, goddamn it!

356
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,927
We have a black and white following
a black Ford LTD. Request air unit.

357
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,166
- Fuck!
- Shit!

358
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,329
Eastbound in alley
between 113 and 114 from Wilmington.

359
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,920
Air units,
come in on southeast frequency.

360
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,802
Air 18. Go ahead.

361
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,404
Keep this motherfucker goin'!

362
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,286
Fuckin' asshole!

363
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:36,767
Get outta Dodge, you motherfuckers.
Eat shit and die, motherfuckers!

364
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,365
Get these cops. Fuck 'em up!

365
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,446
Air 18, respond to shots fired.

366
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,405
That fuckin' bitch can drive, man.

367
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,279
Air 18.
Code six. Have three suspects...

368
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,361
Assholes. Fuck. Crips, Bloods...

369
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, shit!

370
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,645
My wife, uh...
says she wants to meet you.

371
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,840
She says, uh,...

372
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,325
- ... you can bring a date.
- Thanks.

373
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,444
Jesus Christ!

374
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,279
So we had Linda, you know.
She's 18 now, right?

375
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,800
And then Bobby said
"Well, why don't we try for a boy?"

376
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,922
So I thought Tommie for sure
was gonna be our last one, but...

377
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,201
...these things happen!

378
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,960
Well, they better not.

379
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,126
Oh, no. You heard what he said?

380
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:32,289
Jumbo shrimp! There's a contradiction.

381
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,083
- $14.95 a pound.
- Bobby...!

382
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,121
Hey, he's my partner.

383
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,038
What's money to two highly paid
professionals of LA's best? Right?

384
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,922
- Right.
- Let me go help you.

385
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,679
- No, honey. Sit down.
- It's OK. I'll just come. Later, dear.

386
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,200
Prick. Bastard.

387
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,888
You dog.

388
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,367
You better treat her right,
or her Mexican mama's gonna chop it off.

389
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,163
- A fuckin' angel.
- I know.

390
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,009
Pretty fancy drivin'
the other day, McGavin.

391
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,324
I mean, we didn't
have to try and catch 'em.

392
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,884
Are you sayin' I wouldn't have?

393
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,207
Well, if I was you,
a year before pension,...

394
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,639
...a wife like that, a kid...

395
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,920
Three kids. That's bullshit.

396
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,290
D'you wanna get into this now?

397
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,606
I don't understand you. I really don't.

398
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,887
You wanna psychoanalyse me?

399
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:38,844
- Where'd you get your fuckin' hard-on?
- Ask me if I loved my mother.

400
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,962
I used to get jacked up
cos I thought I needed that edge.

401
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,325
Well, maybe you don't, maybe I do.
Maybe we're just different.

402
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,521
What I remember most from that time
is nothing but regrets.

403
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:55,529
Let me tell you something: you can't
prove anything out on the streets.

404
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:00,360
What you do is a job. You can try to be a
professional - that's the best you can do.

405
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,286
Now in 19 years I've learned one thing.

406
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:07,608
If you try to fight every jerk on the street,
you'll be one sad, sorry son of a bitch.

407
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,880
And you'll never last 20 years.

408
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,685
And God forbid if you ever get married
and take it out on your wife.

409
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,165
She will walk. She will fucking leave you.

410
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,120
So why make it worse all the time?

411
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,480
- Is that one thing?
- Yeah, one thing.

412
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,646
It's all one thing.

413
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,489
- The other day...
- This isn't to do with that.

414
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,443
- Shut up! uh, do I get to talk?
- Talk.

415
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,563
I'm sorry about the car.
I fuckin' wiped out. What can I say?

416
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,488
You want me to say
it's not gonna happen again?

417
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,718
I know what you're saying
and trying to do,...

418
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,480
...but I didn't volunteer for CRASH to play
games and be nice to these assholes.

419
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:56,128
Think you get respect? They laugh and
fuck somebody up. I can't deal with that.

420
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:00,402
If you don't think you can deal with me,
well, I understand that, too.

421
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,802
- Well?
- What?

422
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,366
- So tell me about him.
- Well, I will tell you later.

423
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,005
- Gimme the baby. Louisa?
- No, it's all right. I enjoy it.

424
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:31,405
How do you want me
to cook those shrimp?

425
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,885
Oh, butterfly 'em.

426
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,446
What's up?

427
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,887
Nothin'.

428
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,762
You OK?

429
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,642
Yeah.

430
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:03,125
Here I come!
- Look at your brother there. Look.

431
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:12,246
Now look what I got.

432
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,848
Hey, homes. You kiddin' me, homes?
Listen up, homes. Listen up.

433
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,530
That dude was fly, homes.

434
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,806
He so fly, he gone.

435
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,366
He made his own from the kerb, man.
Over and out.

436
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,240
Boom! Yeah.

437
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,566
Hey, Larry.

438
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,130
- You can make it out too, man.
- How?

439
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,001
Maybe I'll go to Hollywood,
be Eddie Murphy.

440
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,359
Frog, you think America's ready
to love two niggers at the same time?

441
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,481
Chale, homes.

442
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,887
- You been talkin' to Bird too long, eh?
- Say what?

443
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,003
I say you been talkin' to Bird too long.

444
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,485
- He says there's no future in it.
- Ain't no future but what you make it.

445
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,566
- Shit.
- Bangin' is shit!

446
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,808
Listen, homes! Hey, see, man,
that's just the way the world is, ese.

447
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,366
There's always gonna be gangs.
There's always gonna be fighting.

448
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,359
Always was and always is, man.
Nobody's gonna fuckin' stop it, man.

449
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,481
That's just life.

450
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,286
- You can stop it for yourselves.
- Fuck you. I don't wanna stop nothin'!

451
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:54,119
- Fuck you, you stupid fuckin' asshole.
- Fuck you back, man!

452
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,320
Tell your fairy tales to somebody else.

453
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,204
What am I gonna do with you guys, man?

454
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,528
What do you mean? What the fuck
you mean, what you gonna do, man?

455
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,406
Who the fuck sent you anyway, homes?

456
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,086
- Hodges.
- Hodges?!

457
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,567
Yeah, he thinks maybe you're smart
enough to walk away from this bullshit.

458
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,683
- But you're too stupid to realise it.
- What does Hodges know, man? Huh?

459
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,727
Fuck Hodges, man!

460
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,410
Where does Hodges
come from anyway, huh?

461
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,326
See, man, these are my homeboys, vato.

462
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,569
See, our homie here is all we have, man.

463
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,446
I love them...

464
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,043
They love me back, man.

465
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:47,487
Mi barrio es primero, man.

466
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,410
D'you want me
to walk away from this, man?

467
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,968
No way.

468
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,842
Fuck you. No way, man.

469
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,760
I banged.

470
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,918
- But there's more.
- Where, man?

471
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,325
Fuckin' show me, huh?

472
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,010
What's up? What's goin' down, homes?

473
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,361
- Get outta here, Felipe.
- Well, shit, man!

474
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,607
Get the fuck away, homes!

475
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,125
That's your little brother, man.

476
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,446
You can stop over there.

477
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,967
I had a nice time.

478
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:04,046
Thank you.

479
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,282
Hey.

480
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,246
- What?
- Look over here.

481
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,326
Where?

482
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,926
Closer.

483
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,886
What?

484
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,806
Lookin' pretty good.

485
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,286
I like you, too.

486
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,046
I didn't say that.

487
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,040
Tough guy, huh?

488
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,799
You know, everybody around here
is so tough that...

489
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,080
...that doesn't get to me.

490
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,726
What does?

491
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,366
Be nice.

492
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,999
- Wanna tell me what you were thinking?
- No. uh... no!

493
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,278
OK. I'm gonna go then.

494
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,878
No, no, no, no, no. I'll drive you down.

495
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,966
This is a bad area.

496
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:11,527
- I'll bring you down.
- Danny, I'm a homegirl.

497
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,369
This is my barrio, remember?

498
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,401
I'm safe.

499
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,328
Now they see me with you, maybe I'm not.

500
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,526
Good night.

501
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,006
Come here.

502
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,000
- She was that good?
- Yeah. The biggest tits I ever saw.

503
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,886
This fuckin' paperwork!

504
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,882
Ex cuse me! Hello? Anyone know
where the valet parking is?

505
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,847
Hey, how do I look?
I don't mean relative to you, of course.

506
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,519
- Looks like they got a lemon.
- It looks like a Pac-Man.

507
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,529
- Oh, yeah, gobble them assholes up.
- Hey, hey, ooh. Pac-Man.

508
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,040
That's my street name.
- Got a registration for that?

509
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:31,319
- I'll registrate your ass.
- Take all you bluecoats to try.

510
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,887
- Let's go get some of this juicy booty.
- Juicy booty!

511
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,841
Come on, we ain't goin' in that.

512
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,202
1- Mary-11, 1-Mary-11,
meet 1-Mary-10...

513
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:43,560
How'd you get involved?

514
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,841
Shit. Sheriff's got
the best intelligence, man.

515
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,799
We the ones called you in.

516
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,125
Yeah?

517
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,040
I noticed all those gangbang assholes
drivin' fire extinguishers off the docks.

518
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:03,410
I couldn't figure out why they was so
concerned about puttin' out a fuckin' fire.

519
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:07,284
So I'm checkin' out the fire extinguishers,
and it goes off in my hands.

520
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:12,647
They put the coke in the holes, you
know? So the evidence gets destroyed.

521
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:16,928
I nearly froze my fuckin' balls off.

522
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:23,086
35-Charlie-22.
212 Collins Street. 2-1-2 Collins Street.

523
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:28,206
The fire extinguisher's made in Taiwan,
comes from Colombia on a Panama boat.

524
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,886
11-George, are you ready?

525
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,048
11-Georgia. So, Big Bird, let's do it to it!

526
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,518
Police! We have a search warrant.
Open up!

527
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:55,963
Freeze! Stand the fuck up!
Turn around! Keep your fuckin' hands up!

528
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:59,446
Stand the fuck up! Turn around!
Get your fuckin' hands up in the air!

529
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,165
Put 'em behind your fuckin' head!
Put 'em behind your head!

530
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:07,326
Fuck! Don't move!

531
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:13,886
OK, we're inside.

532
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,280
- What have you got?
- I don't know. Check back there.

533
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:32,485
- He's got a gauge.
- Doin' some duck huntin', asshole?

534
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:49,166
- I didn't get his lower half yet.
- I'll get it.

535
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,886
Cuff this fuckin' gorilla.

536
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,888
All right, get him
on his goddamn feet. Now!

537
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,285
Help me lift him.

538
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:08,479
Air 11.
Code four. Suspects in custody.

539
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,359
Code four.
Suspects in custody. Code four.

540
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,449
Code four. Suspects in custody.
Code four.

541
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,166
Hey, now, Oso.

542
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,445
- Oso means "bear" in Spanish, huh, Oso?
- Sí, mon.

543
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,528
Well, ain't this a fuckin' bear, Oso?

544
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,806
You know what I want from you, man?

545
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,328
Five names.

546
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,485
You ain't shit. We'll fuck you.
Send you to county jail.

547
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:52,724
Or you give us five names,
stand back of court, and walk.

548
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,045
Is that understood?

549
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:57,766
We ain't talkin' no DA deal now.

550
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,083
I don't know anybody, officer.

551
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,442
Search warrant. Resistin' arrest. Want
more? You're messin' with a sheriff now.

552
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,845
If I talk?

553
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:10,609
Gun clean, you walk,
right here, right now.

554
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:16,568
Fuck it. Sheriff,
you got Chango, Mosca and Trian.

555
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,566
That's good. I know those assholes
as well as I know my own.

556
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,841
Now, who take it to the city?
For my friends here.

557
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:28,682
Who take the coke out the hose?
Who is Smokey the Bear?

558
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:32,887
A cat named Winky and High Top.

559
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,121
- High Top?
- I'm not lyin', man.

560
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,208
I don't owe them pinche myates
a fuckin' thing!

561
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:48,926
Let's go. Come on. You been a good bear.
You can go hibernate for a while.

562
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:54,205
- High Top.
- I fuckin' had the motherfucker.

563
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:59,369
Had what? What did we have?
A piece of rock. Big deal.

564
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,845
Did we know he was tied in here?

565
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,962
Oh, hey, what?
uncle Bob make a mistake?

566
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,360
- You wanna go and second-guess me?
- No, I wanna go and bust him.

567
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,204
So you gonna pull a fire extinguisher
out of his ass?

568
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:17,207
I'll plant one there if I have to,...

569
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:22,120
...then you can pull it out so you don't
have to dick around in the car all the time.

570
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:30,686
You wanna fuckin' die? Spit it out!

571
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,080
Spit it out!

572
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,639
Face the wall. Down on your knees.
On your knees!

573
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:39,807
Spit it out! Spit it out!
You're gonna fuckin' die.

574
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,963
- Spit it out!
- That's enough, McGavin. Enough!

575
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:48,208
My partner doesn't fuckin' care if you
die either. Fuckin' stand up. Stand up!

576
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,286
Keep your hands behind your head.

577
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:53,726
Get down!

578
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,482
Your homeboy is gonna fuckin' die, OK?
He's gonna start turnin' blue and dyin'.

579
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:04,727
If somebody gives a fuck,
they'll bring him to the hospital.

580
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:09,207
- Don't fuckin' dance on me, OK?
- Enough. McGavin! Enough, hotshot.

581
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:22,646
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

582
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:27,286
Hold on. What are you doin', Picasso?
Crossin' out the names of your friends?

583
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:30,959
Not gonna like that, are they?
Put your hands on your head.

584
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:35,125
You at war with these guys now?

585
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,120
Well, they're not gonna
like that one bit, my friend.

586
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,486
I'll tell you what.

587
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,126
Turn around, White Fence.

588
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:48,607
Why don't you graffiti on this mural?
Why don't you do that?

589
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,684
Cos they'll kill your fuckin' ass
and you know that, right, homes?

590
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:57,723
Now, if I were you, I'd get out
of this neighbourhood right away.

591
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,882
Hey.

592
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,886
This is a misdemeanour.

593
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,765
We could take you to jail for this.

594
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:10,441
But I got a plan. We can work somethin'
out. Ever heard of Earl Scheib, homes?

595
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,286
That's enough of that shit!

596
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,961
What should I have done?
Put masking tape on his ears?

597
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:23,966
Go on, get outta here.

598
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,206
Fuck you, Pac-Man!

599
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:35,083
- Here's your lemonade.
- Thank you, darlin'.

600
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:39,362
So, like I was sayin', everything's
goin' all right. You're doin' a good job.

601
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,324
You down for your crime,
so don't worry about nothin', man.

602
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:46,408
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Yes.

603
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,126
Pac-Man!

604
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:02,646
Stand up.

605
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,206
I said stand up!

606
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,086
Get your hands behind your head.

607
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,598
Where your friends goin', dealer man?

608
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:17,881
You're usin' ten-year-olds
to carry your dope now?

609
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,886
What's this? You a brain surgeon?

610
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,966
Dr Feelgood?

611
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:35,120
Look at this shit.

612
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:39,248
- Where'd you get this?
- My auntie.

613
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:44,046
Man, I'm just kickin' it here. I'm just
chillin' out. What Pac-Man on me for?

614
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,242
Keep your hands behind your head
and turn around.

615
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:02,321
Who do you call when that beeper goes
off? Who's the nice man who calls you?

616
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,124
Huh?

617
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,764
Who's your connection? High Top?

618
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,846
What are you lookin' at, huh?

619
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,363
Don't you ever gimme no hard looks, cuz!

620
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,048
- Come on.
- Hey!

621
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:20,845
- Just for that you're goin' to jail, homes.
- Goin' to jail?!

622
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,286
But I ain't did nothin'.

623
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:29,288
- Ex cept become a professional asshole.
- Aagh!

624
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:34,564
- Man, these handcuffs is too tight!
- Well, they're not built for comfort, pal.

625
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:39,002
- Listen, man, you ain't got nothin' on me!
- I got handcuffs on you.

626
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:41,485
Say, man, you ain't got to grab my hair!

627
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:49,519
Ah, shit! Man, you ain't got shit on me!

628
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,800
Shut up!

629
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,160
Soon I'll be out of this motherfucker, man!

630
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,487
All that old punk shit you doin',
that ain't nothin'!

631
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,729
That ain't shit!

632
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:06,605
Say, man, a fuckin' parole violation? I'll
be out of this motherfucker in six months.

633
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,802
- Shut up.
- These handcuffs are too tight.

634
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,763
Want me to do a little
tap dance on your head? Shut up.

635
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,767
This fuckin' guy...

636
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:19,288
- What's the matter?
- I'm too old for your shit.

637
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:23,438
- I'm not gonna argue with that.
- Oh, yeah?

638
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:26,323
You think you can handle me?
You think I'm over the hill?

639
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,607
You want a fuckin' piece of me?!
Right now, huh?

640
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:34,804
You think you got the market cornered?
You think I'm not fuckin' crazy? Try me.

641
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,761
Try me, you fuck.

642
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:39,440
What are you talkin' about?

643
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,561
That's what I thought.

644
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,282
Hey, Hodges.

645
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,844
uncle Bob.
I don't have any problem with you.

646
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,402
Oh, no? You got problems with
the whole fuckin' world, and I'm in it.

647
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,202
And I don't like it.

648
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,608
Why don't you just chill out a little bit
and figure out which side you're on?

649
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,085
I would if I could.

650
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,724
But you're just like them, Pac-Man.

651
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,090
Nothin' but a gangster.

652
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:29,079
Now, you've been to my house, that's
where I live. Any time. Any fuckin' time!

653
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,120
You better bring your lunch.

654
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,125
- Will you just come out to talk?
- No!

655
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:44,400
- Why?
- You OK?

656
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:47,206
Yeah, I'm fine.

657
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:53,967
- What do you want?
- Nothing. Just... go away!

658
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:02,043
This is stupid. It stinks back here.

659
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,003
No kidding? Well, thank you.

660
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,205
Will you just tell me what I did?

661
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,241
They hate you, McGavin.

662
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,238
McGavin? Oh.

663
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,207
You see that badge?

664
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:26,128
I wear it. That's my job. That's what I do.

665
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,046
So what do you want?

666
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,162
The other day you caught this boy
and put paint all over his face.

667
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,765
Well, he's my cousin.

668
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,166
Oh, that's funny?

669
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,525
I didn't know you had such a big family.

670
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,561
I'm sorry. OK?

671
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,646
I'm sorry.

672
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,766
You know what he was doin'?

673
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:01,920
He was crossing out the names
of East LA gang members on the wall.

674
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:04,610
You know what that means
when they do that?

675
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:10,529
It means they're gonna kill someone.

676
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:14,882
So I'm sorry if I sprayed the kid's face.
Maybe I saved his life that way.

677
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,160
- But I swear...
- I don't care!

678
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,765
That's mean, Danny. You're sadistic.

679
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,926
I am not with you.

680
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:31,843
I am with them, Danny. I'm a homegirl.

681
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,125
Did they threaten you?

682
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,962
No.

683
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:40,046
No one knows I saw you.

684
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:44,490
It's you who threaten me, Danny.

685
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:48,406
You have a mean heart.

686
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,845
What's up? What can I do for you?

687
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,687
- Thanks for comin' by.
- I called you because Felipe's got...

688
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:22,768
Felipe got all fucked up on PCP, homes.

689
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:29,278
He got whacked on that juice.

690
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:32,880
But he's straight, homes.
He goes to school.

691
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:37,367
Now they got him on this gang file shit
and he ain't banging, homes.

692
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:42,118
He ain't in no gang.
Barrio don't need him, homes.

693
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:46,846
Hodges, I'm telling you this. You gotta
get him off the computer file, homes.

694
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,242
Well, he's gonna have
to go to Juvie Hall anyway.

695
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,486
Might do him some good.
Scare him a little.

696
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:57,159
Ah, he's scared. He's scared
of what I'm gonna do, homes.

697
01:04:57,290 --> 01:05:02,444
Listen, get him out of the gang file. You'll
fuck up his life sure as I live, homes.

698
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,760
I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him, OK?

699
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,965
Orale! I know the routine, homes.

700
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,728
I owe you one.

701
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,239
That's what makes
this country great, homes.

702
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,521
- What's that?
- Credit.

703
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,401
You got your Visa card. I got you, homes.

704
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:24,126
Thanks, homes.

705
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:29,602
- Hey, Frog.
- Yeah.

706
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,686
- 21st Street, right?
- Sí, mon.

707
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:36,088
Leo Lopez. Homeboy, you just saved
me a trip. I got a warrant out for you.

708
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:38,360
Hey, homes, I'm a visitor, man.

709
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,958
- Now you're a guest.
- I'm a fucking visitor.

710
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:43,923
Turn around. Assume the position, man!

711
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,566
- What'd he do, man?
- This clown's got 15 outstanding tickets.

712
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,920
Hey, homes, I was gonna pay those.

713
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,723
Yeah, well, you're a little late, partner.

714
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,084
Want me to raise your bail, man?

715
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,929
Nah. I got more time than money.

716
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,567
Dreamer.

717
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:30,966
Let's go.

718
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:50,406
Good morning, officer.

719
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,003
Hey!

720
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:08,245
Hey!

721
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,281
Watch it!

722
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,209
High Top!

723
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:21,648
Hey!

724
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,168
Hey, High Top!

725
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:31,526
Everybody down! Everybody down!

726
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,330
Release the woman, motherfucker!

727
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:41,765
- Let's go.
- No.

728
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,085
God! Please.

729
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:46,286
Release the woman!

730
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,646
Give it up, asshole!

731
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,765
Please!

732
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,048
Release the woman, motherfucker,
or I'll fuckin' shoot!

733
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,279
How long you been
thinking about this one?

734
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,160
Motherfucker!

735
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:24,325
Let me see your fuckin' face, asshole!

736
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,686
You're under arrest.

737
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:32,048
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

738
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:38,040
If you give up that right, anything you say
can be used against you in a court of law.

739
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:43,850
You have the right to speak to an attorney
and have one present during questioning.

740
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:49,041
If you so desire and cannot afford one,
one will be appointed for you at no cost.

741
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:11,042
Hey, Bob!

742
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:19,560
- That was hot shit, cowboy.
- Thank you, man. Thank you.

743
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,646
For an old man.

744
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:25,447
Well, every dog has his day.

745
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:30,724
It was my own fault, right? I mean, I was
the asshole that let him go to begin with.

746
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:34,406
Hey, wait a minute.

747
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,606
I wanna apologise.

748
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,449
- For what?
- For a lotta shit.

749
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:46,163
Go see a priest, say a couple of Hail
Marys. I mean, I'm not the guy for that.

750
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,920
If you cut me half as much slack as you
do those assholes, I might owe you one.

751
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,006
I have.

752
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:57,688
You do.

753
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,804
Listen, I spoke to Melindez at DSD, OK?

754
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:10,688
I'll be gettin' a new partner
first of the month.

755
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:19,722
You ever have a bad relationship with
a woman where you fight all the time?

756
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:22,000
Even when you love 'em.

757
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:26,885
It's like havin' two heads. One says
"red", the other's sure to say "green".

758
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:31,367
Once you had one that wasn't like that,
you never go back again. You leave it.

759
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:34,288
You don't point a finger
and blame someone.

760
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:36,970
You just go your separate ways.

761
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:38,842
OK?

762
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:43,480
That's it.

763
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:45,805
Yeah, well, the apology still goes.

764
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,960
That's your ass, High Top!

765
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,565
Bloods don't deal with Crip dealers.

766
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:36,446
You Crip!

767
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:43,366
Hey, Crip!

768
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,727
We're Bloods, motherfucker!

769
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:58,159
I want a doctor.

770
01:13:59,930 --> 01:14:02,364
Why'd they do you, High Top? Hm?

771
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:05,129
You sellin' bad shit in the street?

772
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,162
You been hangin' around
those Crips too much, man.

773
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:11,325
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

774
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:14,123
Lawyer's not gonna help you, man.

775
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:17,606
Give it up.
Tell me somethin' that I don't know.

776
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:21,681
Even his homeboys can't deal with him.
Get his ass outta here.

777
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:23,801
- Get him put in his cell.
- Hold it!

778
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:31,929
Wanna get out of the gang module, huh?
Wanna get back in the population?

779
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:35,440
You don't - well,
you're one dead motherfucker.

780
01:14:35,570 --> 01:14:38,130
Tell me somethin' I don't know.

781
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:43,447
You may beat the rap, but there's
all kinds of justice in this world.

782
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,322
I don't know what you know.

783
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:48,721
Give me somethin' tasty.

784
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:52,206
Some of that nasty cheese of yours, hm?

785
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:58,600
It's a cold world, Blood. No mercy.

786
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:01,927
Ain't that what you write on the walls?

787
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,846
Who got Robert Craig?

788
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,885
Rocket. It was Rocket.

789
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:22,009
Hollenbeck units.
Vehicle used in a 187.

790
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:28,239
Dark-blue van. License. 1-Frank-
9-2-6-David. 1-Frank-9-2-6-David.

791
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:31,442
- That's Rocket's van, man.
- Well, here we go.

792
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:36,849
1- CRASH-32, we're southbound
on Huntington, responding to a 187 van.

793
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:39,438
At the liquor store,
you go past it, turn right.

794
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:44,127
I have my light on
a dark-blue van behind the liquor store.

795
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,841
Driver, put both hands out the window.

796
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,926
Both hands!

797
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:20,408
Keep your right hand out the window.
Take your left hand,...

798
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:23,647
...cross it over your body
and take the keys out of the ignition.

799
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:29,760
I wanna see the keys in your hand.

800
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,648
Air Two. I have
two units, code six, on the suspect.

801
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:42,448
Now, with one hand,
open the right-hand door.

802
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,366
I want it all the way open.

803
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:47,886
Same hand, open the other door.

804
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,003
Now get your hand back up.

805
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,281
Air Two.
We have two suspects. Male, black.

806
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:00,528
Passenger,...

807
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:04,768
...slowly climb over the driver's side.
Exit with your hands in the air.

808
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:12,160
Put your hands in sight above your head.

809
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:15,006
Face forward.

810
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:26,080
Hey, RJ, these guys look pretty scary.
You feelin' like a hero? Cuff 'em up.

811
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:31,729
This is the van that ol' Rocket was driving
when he shot up Robert Craig.

812
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,808
- Read 'em their rights.
- What for?

813
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:39,443
All right, keep your head still.

814
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:43,404
OK, move 'em over. That's it.
What you got? Nice and easy now.

815
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:45,964
- See my flashlight?
- Tell me what you got.

816
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:49,639
- OK, what do we got here?
- Don't want no surprises.

817
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,842
Don't worry. They got no diseases.

818
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:59,198
Air Two.
Code four. Suspects in custody.

819
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,444
How long have you known Rocket?

820
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,845
A year? Ten years?

821
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:10,729
- About one year, I guess.
- About one year, you guess.

822
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,000
Where does his lady live?

823
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,403
I don't know.

824
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:19,804
Hey, don't pull my fuckin' dick, stupid.

825
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,086
I don't. I don't know where she lives.

826
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:27,406
OK, look. Somebody
wants to kill Rocket, let's say.

827
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:32,399
And old fat Willie's gotta let him know, be
a hero to him. Now, how do you find him?

828
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:34,648
I don't know.

829
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,566
Oh, man, homes.

830
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:45,087
We can do this all fuckin' night.
What is Rocket's girlfriend's name?

831
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:48,849
I don't know his girlfriend's name.

832
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:53,246
Hey, look.

833
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:56,845
You're not talkin' to some fool now.

834
01:18:57,570 --> 01:19:00,164
We're talkin' about your freedom.

835
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:03,123
You don't know her.
What's her girlfriend's name?

836
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:07,762
- What girlfriend?
- Any one. Pick one.

837
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:11,166
Don't tell me you don't know
the little bitches' names in the hood.

838
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:13,246
Big strong boy like you.

839
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:16,766
Huh?

840
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:21,725
What's the name of some of
Rocket's girlfriend's friends?

841
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:24,769
Annie.

842
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:26,846
Annie what?

843
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,286
I don't know.

844
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,569
180, 65. Come to the front desk.

845
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:37,241
Who else? Don't pull my fuckin' dick.
I'll front you in front of the homeboys.

846
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,999
I'll go out there, give you $50,
say "Thanks for the information. "

847
01:19:41,130 --> 01:19:43,121
I'll do it. I've done it before.

848
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:48,686
Cheryl Williams.

849
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:53,404
I'll be back.
You keep your fuckin' mouth shut.

850
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:55,482
Annie, Cheryl Williams.

851
01:19:55,730 --> 01:20:00,679
Call at the front desk.
1- David-12, phone call at the front desk.

852
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,326
How did he get your van?

853
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:14,606
How did he get your van?

854
01:20:16,370 --> 01:20:18,326
Hm?

855
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:23,647
We know that he used your van, Lewis.
Now, if you don't wanna get in trouble,...

856
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,965
...just tell me how Rocket got it.

857
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,360
I lent it to my brother.

858
01:20:39,490 --> 01:20:41,481
And?

859
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:43,566
Rocket took it from him at a party.

860
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:46,127
He just took the van?

861
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:49,245
My brother was afraid.

862
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:53,010
He's more afraid of Rocket than of you?

863
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:01,603
Detective McShaney
has a call in the front office.

864
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:09,082
Just so we understand ourselves.
We don't want you, man. We want him.

865
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:12,887
But they used your van in a drive-by,...

866
01:21:13,010 --> 01:21:15,922
...so we're gonna book you
unless you help us out.

867
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,325
Relax, man. I'm not laughin' at you.

868
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,526
- You know what fat Willie just told me?
- What?

869
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:35,041
You know that foxy little chick that hangs
out with Cheryl Williams and Annie?

870
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:38,242
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, yeah, you know who I mean.

871
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:40,759
The sexy little thing. This is wild.

872
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,166
Shit, uh...

873
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:47,729
Lewis, what the fuck
is the name of that girl?

874
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:50,681
- Sharon?
- Right!

875
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,846
Oh, yeah.

876
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:56,009
Right, Sharon, uh...

877
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:57,529
I don't know.

878
01:21:58,490 --> 01:22:00,446
Robbins?

879
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,724
Robbins. Right.

880
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,604
Rocket's lady.
- Right, man!

881
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,446
Right.

882
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,281
Police! Open up.

883
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:21,880
I don't think they heard us.
- Fuck 'em. Let's go.

884
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:24,046
Talk about gettin' off.

885
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:27,207
We are going in. Be careful and be quiet.

886
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:45,646
Yes!

887
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:20,406
Freeze!

888
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:27,244
That's not Rocket. That's not Rocket.

889
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,447
Holy fuck! Stop that shit.

890
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:35,003
Come on.

891
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:42,361
Killer-Bee.

892
01:23:42,490 --> 01:23:44,685
Why'd you move, man? Why?

893
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:47,370
I was reachin'... for my pants, man.

894
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,242
Yeah.

895
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:54,239
Just lie still. Don't move, OK? Hang
in there. I'll get you an ambulance, OK?

896
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,684
Somebody get an ambulance!

897
01:23:58,010 --> 01:23:59,966
Hang in there.

898
01:24:07,170 --> 01:24:11,607
Motherfucker, you!
Pac-Man, motherfucker, you!

899
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:14,722
We're gonna get you, motherfucker!

900
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:22,406
We can get Pac-Man.

901
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:25,845
- You get Pac-Man.
- We gonna let Rocket know.

902
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,006
Sure enough, momma. We tell Rocket.

903
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,365
Yo, Rocket, man! Check out this uzi.

904
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:41,442
Definitely tighten up
Pac-Man's shit, homeboy.

905
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,922
T- Bone.

906
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:58,565
- You gonna shoot me, you punk?
- I'm not gonna shoot you.

907
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,284
- You gonna shoot me?
- Everything's cool. Let's go.

908
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:03,560
Fuck that, man!

909
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:06,329
- Get off me! Gimme my rabbit.
- Calm down, T-Bone.

910
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:08,520
Tell him to gimme my rabbit. Punk!

911
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:11,118
You couldn't get none at home?
Get off me, man!

912
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,684
- There's your rabbit, T-Bone.
- Yeah, yeah.

913
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:17,246
- There's your rabbit.
- I stuck my T-bones in your hind!

914
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:20,043
- In the hind, baby.
- Get up, T-Bone.

915
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:24,402
- You don't have to stick my face in it.
- You'll get your rabbit. Got your rabbit.

916
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:27,442
- Give it!
- Here's your rabbit. Come on.

917
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:30,323
You're tryin' to take T-Bone away.
I want another one.

918
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:33,362
You can't take T-Bone away, man.
You can't take the T!

919
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:37,529
Here, boy, come on now. Come on.
The rabbit's gonna be right with us here.

920
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:39,402
Here's your rabbit.

921
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,885
See that? That's the part that's next.

922
01:25:57,370 --> 01:26:02,000
Hey, man. Wherever I go,
I represent the set, man. I am the set.

923
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:06,248
Kickin' back, illin' with the homeboys.
Doin' that crazy shit.

924
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:09,282
- Right on, T-Bone.
- I love that crazy shit.

925
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:12,129
Crashin' motherfuckers on the floor.
Bam, man!

926
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,366
Bust 'em in the head, stab 'em, whatever.

927
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:17,527
- Robbin' houses, beatin' up on fools.
- You know that.

928
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:21,245
- Blastin' my enemies.
- Go partyin' afterwards. That's it, man.

929
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:24,999
Yo, I go to this freak house, man,
with cuz. I left cuz there.

930
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:29,442
Man, I come back, the boy's sleepin'
on the floor, man. Like The Little Rascals.

931
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:31,322
Boy's sleepin' on the floor.

932
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:33,759
You know Rocket's hidin' out, man.

933
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:37,280
Cops killed the Killer-Bee, man.
Shot that boy down, man!

934
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:41,039
He's pumpin' his fuel into Rocket's lady.
The cops came in, bang, bang!

935
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:44,367
Pumped so much lead in that boy,
turned him into a pencil, man.

936
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:48,369
Left him on the floor curled up
like a baby with a big dick, man.

937
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:51,288
- That's cold, man.
- Word, that's the Pac-Man.

938
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:55,323
That motherfucker Pac-Man,
we gonna put the bite on his ass, man.

939
01:26:56,850 --> 01:26:59,603
Yo, man, go get me some cigarettes.

940
01:26:59,730 --> 01:27:02,164
And a girlie magazine. Hurry up, man.

941
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:05,849
Hey, come on, Frog.
Are you playin' or what?

942
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:23,649
What about the woman, Officer Baines?
Was she in the line of fire?

943
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:26,523
Not to my knowledge. She wasn't hit.

944
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:31,841
Your knowledge of our shooting policy
is the question here, Officer Baines,...

945
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,848
...because your judgment
is certainly suspect.

946
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:38,201
You killed a man, mister -
for reachin' for his pants.

947
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:43,482
Sir, I thought my life and the lives
of my fellow officers were in danger.

948
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:48,365
- He appeared to be going for a weapon.
- I do understand that, Officer Baines.

949
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:50,242
But what I can't figure out...

950
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:53,919
...is why you didn't take more time
to find out who was really in that room.

951
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:57,486
Sir, we thought the 187
murder suspect was in the room.

952
01:27:57,610 --> 01:27:59,760
That's why we were there.

953
01:28:01,370 --> 01:28:04,123
You thought wrong, Officer Baines.

954
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:06,966
Man, this is crazy.

955
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:10,481
They think he shot him.

956
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:13,204
- It wasn't you, was it?
- No, sir.

957
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:16,921
What difference does it make?
If they think he did, he did it.

958
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,166
They're not gonna shoot a cop.

959
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:22,566
- Who told you this?
- I'd rather not say.

960
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:25,001
I'm not asking you to testify.

961
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:30,680
I'm not gonna give up your source.

962
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:36,169
Leo Lopez. Call him Frog.

963
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:39,487
He's in County on a traffic warrant.
He owed me one, OK?

964
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:45,164
- Look, I believe him.
- I'm sick of these dumb assholes.

965
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:49,000
Call Metro. Put the clamps on
until we get 'em to call it off.

966
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,247
- Melindez, you wanna set it up?
- Yeah. Sure.

967
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,769
What we gonna do with him?

968
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:57,446
Ex cuse me. If you wanna take me
off the street, that's your option.

969
01:28:57,570 --> 01:29:02,360
But we shouldn't let these gangbangers
dictate the way we operate. I'll be OK.

970
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:05,326
What do you think?

971
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:11,479
I'll call Metro when I get upstairs.
In the meantime, kick back.

972
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:14,408
Relax, tú sabes? And be careful.

973
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:16,486
Yes, sir. Thank you.

974
01:29:22,170 --> 01:29:24,126
I'm back after lunch.

975
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:50,088
Fuck it, man! They're still out there, dude,
askin' about the hit on Pac-Man.

976
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,565
Say what?
- No shit.

977
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:57,403
- Who said?
- I saw 'em rollin' down the street!

978
01:29:57,770 --> 01:29:59,726
Bullshit, shit!

979
01:30:01,250 --> 01:30:03,206
- Y'all been talkin'?
- Hell, no!

980
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:07,684
- Is everybody here?
- No.

981
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:10,927
T- Bone, cuz. up in County, man.

982
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,406
Word.

983
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:21,522
- Y'all find out who that nigger with.
- T-Bone say Frog from 21st Street.

984
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:25,201
- Let's bust a cap in his ass.
- Get his hide.

985
01:30:25,330 --> 01:30:27,286
We down.

986
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,840
Your brother paid.
I got him a job, remember?

987
01:30:32,970 --> 01:30:35,643
Shit! Well, he shouldn't have paid, homes.

988
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,967
- It's just money, man.
- I know, but he shouldn't have paid.

989
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:41,001
Went up to Miss Mousie's door

990
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,688
Shut up, man!

991
01:30:42,810 --> 01:30:45,119
Gonna get a job and
pay your brother back now?

992
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:48,959
- I don't know, homes.
- He's into Miss Mousie now, man.

993
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:53,766
You're gonna have to get some pussy.
You been in the slammer too long.

994
01:30:55,690 --> 01:30:57,521
All right!

995
01:30:57,650 --> 01:30:59,368
Party tonight, man. Party!

996
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:29,806
Come on, homie. Show us how!

997
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:43,806
This is so strong, man.

998
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:50,562
You wanna have some of this shit
and get high, then we'll bust some hose.

999
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,046
Yeah, back in a bit.

1000
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:09,566
Shit.

1001
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:14,321
Good shit, huh?

1002
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:17,760
I feel sorry for the bitch
I'll take home tonight, ese.

1003
01:32:46,490 --> 01:32:51,610
Units in the area, shots fired.
1070 Hicks. Ganahl and Hicks.

1004
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:54,400
Roger. 1-CRASH-32, there in one.

1005
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:56,998
Air 12. CRASH-1-32.

1006
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:01,920
We have our light on you. Are responding
to shots fired, Ganahl and Hicks.

1007
01:33:10,970 --> 01:33:14,440
- One of you back me up, will you?
- I'm goin' with Hodges.

1008
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:16,766
I'm OK. How you doin' tonight?

1009
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,565
Bet we got victims up there now.

1010
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:48,925
Turn the music off.

1011
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:52,726
Sit him down.

1012
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:56,322
- Did anybody get hit?
- No.

1013
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:58,042
- Anyone hurt?
- No.

1014
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:11,123
- What's with your homeboy, Spanky?
- Too many cervezas, homes.

1015
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:13,926
Go sit over here, man.

1016
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:21,166
What are you on, man?

1017
01:34:21,930 --> 01:34:24,967
- Been smokin' some super kools?
- Go sit over there.

1018
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,365
See my finger? Follow my finger.

1019
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:30,566
This guy's dusted.

1020
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:34,290
Don't sneak up on me like that, man.

1021
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:38,290
Come on. Come on out.
Take a seat over here.

1022
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:07,966
What?

1023
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,764
What's the matter with you, Pac-Man?

1024
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,801
Huh?

1025
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:20,002
What's the matter with you, man? Hey.

1026
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,882
- Hey, Pac-Man!
- Hey.

1027
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:24,240
Hey, Pac-Man! Hey, man.

1028
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:26,122
Fuck you. I know him.

1029
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:31,204
Just relax. Relax, relax. She's gone.

1030
01:35:33,730 --> 01:35:36,608
I was watchin' TV...

1031
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:42,762
- What's your name?
- Mary Castillo.

1032
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:45,520
Castillo?

1033
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:49,367
You think you know who I am, Danny?
Huh? Do you?

1034
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:52,368
All you see is what you want,
and you only want things one way.

1035
01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:54,401
Look at me, Danny!

1036
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:57,485
- Look at me!
- Go back up, Dennis.

1037
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,445
Look at me, Pac-Man!

1038
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:03,685
This is me too, man!

1039
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,126
Why?

1040
01:36:19,450 --> 01:36:21,600
Why? Why?

1041
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:29,123
Oh, God!

1042
01:36:38,890 --> 01:36:41,404
Why? Why?

1043
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:43,885
I don't know why, man.

1044
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,120
Did you see how many people
were in the car?

1045
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,002
I didn't see anything.

1046
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:55,248
Why?

1047
01:37:11,770 --> 01:37:13,726
I saw who it was, man.

1048
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:16,924
It was Rocket, Dog-Man and Shooter.

1049
01:37:18,170 --> 01:37:20,968
- Rocket?
- Fuck the Crips, eh?

1050
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:23,046
They die.

1051
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:28,479
I want in. Won't take this shit no more.

1052
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:30,168
Es mi barrio.

1053
01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:32,246
I want in.

1054
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:34,964
Get off the fuckin' porch, homes.

1055
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,685
Get off the fuckin' porch, homes.

1056
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:48,684
So you wanna let the little fucker in, huh?

1057
01:37:49,650 --> 01:37:51,641
I don't think he's tough enough, homes.

1058
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:55,078
I don't think he's got enough heart, man.

1059
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:43,239
That's two fights, homes. All right.

1060
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,406
All right!

1061
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,450
There's no turning back now, homes.

1062
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:14,446
You fucked up, homes.

1063
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:17,121
You joined the gang.

1064
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:19,081
Es mi barrio, homes.

1065
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:21,326
Mi barrio.

1066
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,406
You did good.

1067
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,846
You all right?

1068
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:27,399
Good.

1069
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:29,486
Way to go, homie!

1070
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:21,486
Bang. 2-1, homes.

1071
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,366
OK, loosen up!

1072
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:19,285
All right, I want all CRASH units
on full alert. Wear your vests.

1073
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:22,720
use every precaution. Arrest 'em on sight.

1074
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:26,047
These streets'll be quiet soon.
There'll be nobody to bust.

1075
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:28,126
All right, let's go to work!

1076
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:29,362
All right, just as we planned.

1077
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,206
Stupid fucks.

1078
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,526
Grenades!

1079
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:52,006
Fuckin' Looney Tunes, eh?

1080
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:55,286
He's fuckin' Rambo, ese.

1081
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:58,806
Rambo didn't die, homes.

1082
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:05,767
Fuck that, man.
Cos I'm a fuckin' Rambo, homes!

1083
01:45:05,890 --> 01:45:08,927
See, I go, man. I'll go just like Larry.

1084
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:12,440
Fuck! Fucking vato psycho loco, homes.

1085
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:25,289
When I die, homes,
I wanna go just like that, man.

1086
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:28,482
Die?

1087
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:33,488
You ain't never gonna die, homes.

1088
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:38,646
Come here.

1089
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:51,720
When I die, homes,...

1090
01:45:51,850 --> 01:45:54,045
...I'm gonna die like that.

1091
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:56,126
Con mi ruca, homes.

1092
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:00,605
Relax, homie.

1093
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:02,641
You did good.

1094
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:05,000
Te aventaste, homes.

1095
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:08,528
You got big balls, little brother.

1096
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:22,883
Police!

1097
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:30,161
- What do you want, eh?
- Stand up! Hands on top of your head!

1098
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:33,168
- Get your hands up now!
- Drop that shotgun!

1099
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:38,762
Air Two. I have 20 suspects with
automatic rifles, shotguns and handguns.

1100
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:42,121
I repeat. this is Air Two.
I have 20 suspects...

1101
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:45,447
...with automatic rifles,
shotguns and handguns.

1102
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:49,486
Put your hands behind your head!

1103
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:52,329
Get down on your knees!
Down on your knees.

1104
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:57,246
Down on your knees!

1105
01:46:58,970 --> 01:47:02,929
- Been lookin' for you, Frog.
- Are we gonna have a rapport, Hodges?

1106
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,208
- Who'd you tell?
- Huh?

1107
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:08,161
- Who'd you tell?
- Nobody.

1108
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:10,246
You're a fuckin' liar.

1109
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:17,210
I go and do a favour
for your lousy partner.

1110
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:29,842
Get that cigarette
out of your mouth. Get up!

1111
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,204
- This guy's got a gun.
- Gimme another set of cuffs.

1112
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:35,366
Get down. Get down! Get down.

1113
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:41,128
- Hey, turn the fuck around.
- No future in it, vato!

1114
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:43,128
Oh, shit!

1115
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:50,523
Air Two requesting
four additional units for shots fired.

1116
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:52,845
Oh, Gosh. Oh.

1117
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:56,883
- Officer down! Call an RA unit!
- Officer requesting backup.

1118
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:59,285
Four units. 20 suspects. Armed.

1119
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:02,199
Jesus fucking Christ, man!

1120
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:07,168
It's OK.

1121
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:09,963
It's just... I can't feel my legs.

1122
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:13,400
- OK. It's OK.
- I just wanna lay here for a minute.

1123
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:16,408
- Stay calm. Stay calm.
- Just call my wife.

1124
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:19,124
OK. Somebody get an ambulance!

1125
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:23,081
Have somebody call my wife
and tell her to come get me.

1126
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:26,359
Go get my w... Get my wife.

1127
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:29,004
OK. I just wanna rest my head a minute.

1128
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:32,122
I gotta catch my breath.
I'm gonna catch my breath.

1129
01:48:32,250 --> 01:48:34,081
OK.

1130
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:37,441
I'm gonna catch my breath.
Gonna catch my breath.

1131
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,806
Catch my breath.

1132
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:46,526
OK. Now, after just a little rest I...
I'll be ready to roll in a minute.

1133
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:52,769
My wife...
- Stay calm. Stay calm.

1134
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:54,642
OK.

1135
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:58,765
Gotta catch my breath.

1136
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:06,925
Breathe. Breathe.

1137
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:10,841
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1138
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:15,759
Let me catch my breath.
Where's my wife?

1139
01:49:19,730 --> 01:49:23,439
OK, I'll be ready to roll in a minute. OK.

1140
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:25,526
It's all right. Call my wife.

1141
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:33,323
- Catch my breath.

1142
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:36,888
Breathe.

1143
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:39,604
Bob, breathe. Breathe!

1144
01:49:46,130 --> 01:49:49,088
Air Two. We have a possible 187.

1145
01:50:01,730 --> 01:50:04,483
Air Two...

1146
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:52,566
So you know, I keep my backup
on my inside left ankle.

1147
01:50:52,690 --> 01:50:56,080
If we ever get into any hostage situation,
I call you by my name...

1148
01:50:56,210 --> 01:51:00,123
Hey, hey, you ain't got to worry
about no hostage situation, partner,...

1149
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:05,802
...cos now, see, you got yourself
a bad, black, kick-ass cop for a sidekick.

1150
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:08,649
What's this, man?
Looks like we got us a deal.

1151
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:26,766
They toss it?

1152
01:51:30,250 --> 01:51:32,206
You're all fired up, man.

1153
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:37,761
- Let me tell you about workin' the ghetto.
- Hey, I grew up in this neighbourhood.

1154
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:41,041
I don't need no lecture from no white cop
about how to get on here.

1155
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:45,288
Hey, what you gettin' moody for? I grew
up here. I know what the fuck I'm doin'.

1156
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:47,366
Just shut up, all right? Listen.

1157
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:56,969
There were these two, uh, bulls...

1158
01:51:58,050 --> 01:52:00,769
...and they're standin'
on top of a mountain.

1159
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:03,645
And, uh... um...

1160
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:06,525
...they're lookin' down at a bunch of cows.

1161
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:10,325
And then, uh, the older one
says to the younger one...

1162
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:15,323
No! The younger one...
The younger one says...

1163
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:18,400
"Hey, Pop. "

1164
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:23,285
"What do you say we run down
and fuck one of them cows?" And, uh...

1165
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:27,361
And then the older one says "No, son. "

1166
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:31,123
"Let's walk down and fuck 'em all. "

1167
