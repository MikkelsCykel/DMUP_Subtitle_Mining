1
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:30,824
<i>Every life is a riddle.</i>

2
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:36,300
<i>The answer to mine
is a knowledge born of darkness.</i>

3
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,374
<i>It wasn't always so.</i>

4
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,442
<i>In the beginning,
I still had questions.</i>

5
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:50,145
<i>In the beginning,
my mystery still remained.</i>

6
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,048
Brother Dominic...

7
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,149
...scholar of the Catholic arcane.

8
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,986
Believer in
the unsanitized church.

9
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,862
A church that no longer
believes in itself.

10
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:50,432
The church
of stigmata...

11
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:54,560
...and exorcism, saints...

12
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,604
...and demons...

13
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,731
...and me.

14
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:11,920
I believe in many things.

15
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:15,357
So do I.

16
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:19,217
And right now,
I believe it's time.

17
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:29,928
Are you ready to
make your confession?

18
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,102
Forgive me, Alex.

19
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:43,383
I have sinned against you.

20
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:09,243
<i>There he is. That's Alex.</i>

21
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,680
- He's young.
- But an old soul, Clive.

22
00:05:14,784 --> 00:05:18,049
<i>He's an old soul.</i>

23
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:22,409
<i>Mea culpa. Mea culpa.</i>

24
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,486
<i>Mea maxima culpa.</i>

25
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,720
<i>- Corpus Christi?
- Amen.</i>

26
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:35,022
<i>- Corpus Christi?
- Amen.</i>

27
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,438
<i>- Corpus Christi?
- Amen.</i>

28
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,473
<i>I need to speak with you.</i>

29
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,347
<i>Do you always say
the mass in Latin?</i>

30
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,284
- It's how I was taught.
- It belies your age.

31
00:06:58,387 --> 00:07:00,412
And with your back
to your audience, no less.

32
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:02,582
<i>You know, six or 700 years ago...</i>

33
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,922
<i>...they wouldn't have
seen you at all.</i>

34
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:08,793
You'd have sung the mass in Latin
behind a huge choir screen...

35
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:13,358
...out of the sight of a congregation
who was only allowed to... Listen.

36
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,905
I think you would have liked the choir
screen, Alex. You're a contradiction.

37
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:25,139
What I am is stuck here because the church
doesn't know what to do with me.

38
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:29,150
<i>Well, the church doesn't know
what the hell to do with itself.</i>

39
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:32,244
<i>Look, I won't pretend I don't know
you have certain qualifications...</i>

40
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,620
<i>...certain skills, that set you apart
from other priests.</i>

41
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:40,389
However, the diocese has certain questions
about your faith, Alex.

42
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,265
So, what do you want from me?

43
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:49,160
Well, I have
sad news for you.

44
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:55,043
- Dominic, the head of your order...
- I know who he is.

45
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,904
He's dead.
Today. In Rome.

46
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,586
<i>Is this your mother?</i>

47
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:24,631
Say good-bye, Alex.

48
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:29,507
It's time to say good-bye.

49
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,745
Good-bye.

50
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:36,409
Leave your tears here
and then forget them.

51
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:39,717
<i>Alex?</i>

52
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:44,555
Alex? Alex?

53
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:50,897
How is it that a cardinal has enough
time to come and tell me this?

54
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,795
Because I loved him.

55
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:57,202
Because he was my mentor.

56
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:03,101
Because the circumstances
of his death are... Curious.

57
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,581
I need to go to Rome.

58
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,553
The diocese will arrange a flight.

59
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:22,289
In the name of God, in the name of
jesus Christ, I order you back to hell.

60
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,389
<i>Your time is coming.</i>

61
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,028
In the name of God, in the name of
jesus Christ, I order you back to hell.

62
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:35,175
In the name of God, in the name of
jesus Christ, I order you back to hell.

63
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:46,386
<i>Fuck your god.!</i>

64
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,554
All mouth, no trousers.

65
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:16,210
Your church will be lost,
Priest.

66
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:19,754
<i>The dark pope... Rises.</i>

67
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:41,741
- Hello?
- Ah, Thomas.

68
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:43,937
- I've been trying to reach you, mate.
- Alex.

69
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:46,139
<i>How are you, SpaghettiO?</i>

70
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:48,648
Yeah, listen to me.
Dominic died.

71
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:51,049
- Dominic?
- Yeah.

72
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:52,984
Ah, no.

73
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:57,457
<i>- When did it happen?
- Last night.</i>

74
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,757
Where are you? In New York?
At St. Anthony's?

75
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:03,457
Yeah. Listen,
I'm going to Rome, Thomas.

76
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:07,195
- When?
- Tomorrow.

77
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,670
And guess what.
So are you.

78
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,577
Just be there.

79
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,660
Hi.

80
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,064
Hi.

81
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:41,993
When did they release you?

82
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:45,531
I was released today.

83
00:11:49,612 --> 00:11:52,080
<i>Years ago, it was a dorm
for all the priests.</i>

84
00:11:55,518 --> 00:11:57,418
<i>Now it's empty.</i>

85
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,358
You're here.

86
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,360
True.

87
00:12:07,463 --> 00:12:10,694
<i>Oh, I'll wait.</i>

88
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:17,766
Uh, we're looking
for Alex Bernier.

89
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,433
That's me.
Is there something wrong?

90
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:22,511
<i>Just a heads-up, Father.
You know a...</i>

91
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,011
Mara Williams?

92
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,639
Yes.

93
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:34,487
<i>She escaped today from the mental-health
facility where she was remanded by the court.</i>

94
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,286
Remanded, huh? And what does this
have to do with me?

95
00:12:37,393 --> 00:12:40,590
<i>Well, she was locked up
for trying to kill you, wasn't she?</i>

96
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:43,460
That was the main reason, yes.

97
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:47,024
I just thought you'd like to know
she's unaccounted for.

98
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:52,601
Look, I could have a car drive
by here once in a while.

99
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:56,701
<i>- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Well, like I said, a heads-up.</i>

100
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:02,778
<i>You know, it says here...
I couldn't make it out in this copy...</i>

101
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:05,979
...that she, uh... That she shot you
at an exercise class?

102
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:08,921
No, at an exorcism.

103
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:11,424
Oh.

104
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:15,554
Have a good night.

105
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,859
You, too, Father.

106
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:22,028
<i>You lied. You said
they released you.</i>

107
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:25,004
No, I didn't. I didn't lie.

108
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:27,837
I said I was released.
I didn't say who did it.

109
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:31,037
- Mara?
- Alex...

110
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:34,615
...you didn't say good-bye.

111
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:39,712
They said it would be better
that I didn't see you for a while.

112
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:42,347
For a year?

113
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,396
I don't know.

114
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:02,037
<i>- I started painting again.
- Did you?</i>

115
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:05,375
Yeah. Flowers mostly.

116
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:09,440
<i>I wanna paint sunflowers,
but I don't have the guts.</i>

117
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,523
Do you think I'm crazy?

118
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,993
I know you're not.

119
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,864
Why'd you come here?

120
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:29,101
- I heard you call me.
- Mara, don't say that.

121
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:32,765
Okay, I got a feeling...

122
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,333
...that I should be with you...

123
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:39,175
...in case one of us
has to say good-bye.

124
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,355
I've never been to Rome before.

125
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,427
<i>Is it amazing?</i>

126
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:55,964
<i>- I bet it is.
- It scares me...</i>

127
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,492
<i>...ever since I was a boy.</i>

128
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,437
And you're staying here.

129
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,770
No, I'm not staying here.
I can't stay here.

130
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,140
And you need me
whether you know it or not.

131
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:12,577
- And?
- The nightingales are gone.

132
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,615
<i>- Are they?
- Yeah.</i>

133
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,921
They've been gone for about a year.
Same as you.

134
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:28,388
Alex, look at me.

135
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,433
It's you and me.

136
00:15:34,536 --> 00:15:37,130
You and me
till the wheels fall off.

137
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:41,108
Promise you won't try to kill me.

138
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:49,851
<i>Cross my heart, hope to die.</i>

139
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,824
It's here.

140
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:36,697
Hey.

141
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,305
Mara?

142
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:06,661
<i>- What are they?
- Orphans.</i>

143
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,724
But of what I have no idea.

144
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,766
<i>I've been in worse places.</i>

145
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:49,527
It just needs light, that's all.

146
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:22,234
What are those?

147
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:27,575
Aramaic.
It's the language of Christ.

148
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,735
What does it say?

149
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,572
<i>Barath-mae. "Blood in."</i>

150
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:37,345
<i>Down there, barath-sec.
"Blood out."</i>

151
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:42,120
This must have been where
they found Dominic's body.

152
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,117
Alex, what are you thinking?

153
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,195
It was a ceremony.

154
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,565
<i>The message I got said suicide.</i>

155
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,161
<i>Sleeping pills, signore.</i>

156
00:19:01,643 --> 00:19:04,476
Is that him?

157
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,843
Yes, it's him.

158
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,393
Thank you.

159
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:23,055
<i>No, no. I didn't pay
to look at his face.</i>

160
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:27,067
If you don't mind.

161
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,140
What are these?

162
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:38,372
<i>- Okay, let's go, please. Hurry up.
- No, no, no. What are these?</i>

163
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,142
<i>- Do you know what these are?
- Maybe a birthmark.</i>

164
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:45,117
<i>- I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
- That's not a birthmark.</i>

165
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:58,900
<i>- When's the body due to be
released to the church? - It isn't.</i>

166
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:03,097
When we are done with it,
it goes to the state...

167
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:06,038
...for burial in the state cemetery.

168
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,101
Okay. Please, let's go.

169
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,179
Please. Come with me.

170
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:28,553
<i>It's always nice to see a priest.</i>

171
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,368
- And a Carolingian, no less.
- You've seen others?

172
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:40,367
<i>A Dominic Sousa, perhaps?</i>

173
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:50,183
Carolingians...

174
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:53,550
<i>...you surpass even theJesuits in your
heretical search for knowledge.</i>

175
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:57,989
<i>It's important to stay
inside the lines.</i>

176
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:02,052
What lines?

177
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:13,206
This way.

178
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:29,589
Those were the marks.

179
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:33,226
Dominic, what were you doing?

180
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,099
"Bread and salt
eaten off the body...

181
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:45,196
...the sins of one man
consumed by the other."

182
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:49,143
A sin eater.

183
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:52,407
If Hitler had had one in the bunker,
he'd be sitting on a cloud right now.

184
00:21:52,514 --> 00:21:54,641
<i>Of course, sin eaters...</i>

185
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,377
...haven't existed for two centuries,
have they?

186
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:00,848
What did Dominic buy from you?

187
00:22:00,956 --> 00:22:04,016
Many things over the years.

188
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:07,926
<i>Last time, a vellum parchment
written in Aramaic.</i>

189
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:11,294
What did it say?

190
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,300
I'm not as clever as Dominic...

191
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:17,462
...scholar of mysteries.

192
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:20,666
<i>He delved deep and dark.</i>

193
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:23,209
Always after knowledge.

194
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:25,336
I think he'd have sold his soul
for knowledge.

195
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:30,316
<i>- Do you?
- His heretic soul or something precious to him.</i>

196
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,354
<i>Is there a price tag
on your head?</i>

197
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,018
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

198
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:44,492
<i>Sometimes it's better
for a priest not to know.</i>

199
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:48,262
Knowledge is the enemy of faith.

200
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,168
And sometimes when you
look into the abyss...

201
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:54,106
...the abyss looks back into you.

202
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,415
Look, his order meant everything to him.

203
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:13,517
Now, Dominic should be buried with
his order in the Concezione Cemetery.

204
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:16,392
Your order. His former order.

205
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:19,399
The Carolingians, not many
of you left in the world.

206
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,401
Yeah, a dying breed.

207
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:24,028
Look, and when they die,
it's the Concezione Cemetery.

208
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:27,267
Suicide is a cardinal sin.

209
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:34,278
- Dominic didn't commit suicide.
- It makes no difference.

210
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:38,113
He had been excommunicated, excluded
from our society and sacraments.

211
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:43,524
"There is no salvation outside the church."

212
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:48,119
<i>- Yes, I know my Latin.
- Unlike your manners. Respect what you are.</i>

213
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,256
Well, what I am is my concern.
Thank you.

214
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:57,237
Listen, I'm sorry. I am. I...

215
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:02,276
<i>I need the theosophic council
to convene as soon as possible.</i>

216
00:24:02,377 --> 00:24:06,507
The council?
It hasn't convened in years.

217
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,515
<i>For what purpose?</i>

218
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:12,244
Tell them I found a sin eater.

219
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:14,254
A sin eater? Here?

220
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:16,722
At the start
of the new millennium?

221
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:19,885
<i>How many other impossible things
do you believe in?</i>

222
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:23,487
<i>It's not impossible. I've seen the marks
on Dominic's body myself.</i>

223
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,933
Your mentor
was excommunicated...

224
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:31,767
...for rejection of articles of faith.

225
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:34,774
<i>Heresy. Accept it.</i>

226
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:38,539
He took his own life
because he couldn't bear that.

227
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:49,973
<i>- Grazie, Franca.
- Father Alex.</i>

228
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,185
Ciao, Maria. Ciao.

229
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,292
<i>Grazie.</i>

230
00:26:39,501 --> 00:26:42,265
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

231
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:45,906
Amen.

232
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:09,922
In the name of God...

233
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:15,194
I command you to return
from whence you came.

234
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:37,842
In the name of God...

235
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:42,889
<i>In the name ofJesus, God, and the
Holy Virgin, I order you back to hell.!</i>

236
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:55,091
Well, off to hell yourself.
What kind of a greeting's that?

237
00:28:55,203 --> 00:28:57,364
You're late.

238
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,372
<i>Never too late, Alex.</i>

239
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:01,374
<i>Witness the repentant thief...</i>

240
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:05,242
...crucified alongside our Lord Savior.

241
00:29:05,346 --> 00:29:07,280
- Quick thinker, eh?
- How you doin'?

242
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:09,748
Ah, I'm grand.

243
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:17,024
- So, did you bury him?
- Yeah.

244
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,260
<i>Rogue priest readin' rites
over an excommunicado.</i>

245
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:26,128
Damn dirty job,
but someone's gotta do it.

246
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:28,134
Well, cheers.

247
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,296
To the last of the Carolingians.

248
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,240
You and me.

249
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:40,944
Cheers.

250
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:46,547
<i>What just passed
through here, Alex?</i>

251
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,815
<i>Demon spawn
in the guise of children.</i>

252
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,583
Nothing I couldn't handle.

253
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:55,754
<i>- Who summoned those nasties up?
- Dominic, I think.</i>

254
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,763
<i>They were camped
outside his apartment.</i>

255
00:29:57,865 --> 00:30:00,527
<i>Oh, speaking of the apartment,
I met your girlfriend.</i>

256
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,399
She's not my girlfriend.

257
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:06,268
Well, she should be. She said
you'd be at the Concezione.

258
00:30:06,374 --> 00:30:08,274
You told her it was a restaurant?

259
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:11,402
- Well, she would have come with me otherwise.
- Oh, women.

260
00:30:12,914 --> 00:30:15,678
Can't live with 'em.

261
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:18,684
Can't live with 'em.

262
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:25,124
<i>- Come on.
- Sin eater.</i>

263
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,319
<i>- Come on.
- Sin eater.</i>

264
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,155
"In absolution, the burden of guilt...

265
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:32,926
"would be transmuted
to the sin eater...

266
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:35,798
...as would the knowledge
of the transgressions."

267
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:42,242
Wait. You mean he'd know what
your sins were? Even the details?

268
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:45,835
He'd know them
and feel the burden of them.

269
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:48,916
<i>He'd spend sleepless nights
over things others had done.</i>

270
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:51,713
He'd have the ascendancy
to free a man's soul.

271
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,049
And damn his own.

272
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,055
We're Carolingians, Alex and I.

273
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,648
<i>Now, in a way,
that makes us responsible.</i>

274
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,526
<i>They say the practice of sin eating began
with banished members of our order.</i>

275
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,723
<i>Come on. That's like
saying that sheep...</i>

276
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,528
<i>...are responsible for the sweaters
that get made from their wool.</i>

277
00:31:07,635 --> 00:31:09,535
Maybe they are, Mara, girl.

278
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:13,937
I found the vellum Dominic bought.
I'll translate it for you.

279
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,942
Okay...

280
00:31:16,044 --> 00:31:19,070
"Place the instrument
of delivery over the heart."

281
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,081
<i>It must be some kind of weapon.
And then look.</i>

282
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:26,347
<i>"Barath-mae, barath-sec. '"
Blood in, blood out.</i>

283
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:29,218
"And drive into the heart."
Now, the rest is missing.

284
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:32,781
- Still, you get the idea.
- I'm not sure I do.

285
00:31:32,894 --> 00:31:35,124
Well, they're instructions...

286
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,697
...on how to kill a sin eater.

287
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,859
Dominic trained us to deal with ghosts
and demons and all manner of undead...

288
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,959
...but this sin eater,
he's a living man.

289
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:45,335
Well, whatever he is,
he killed Dominic.

290
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,340
Maybe, maybe not.

291
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,510
<i>I've seen another copy
of this somewhere.</i>

292
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:17,227
So, we meet again.

293
00:32:18,306 --> 00:32:20,433
<i>Jesu, the fuckin' cavalry.</i>

294
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:24,978
<i>So, how are you finding our city
of emperors, our city of martyrs?</i>

295
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:27,980
<i>Would you care for a beer, Your Eminence?
Or something a little stronger?</i>

296
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,113
- And you are?
- He's Thomas.

297
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:35,121
- She's Mara.
- We're the Catholic Pete, Linc and Julie.

298
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:40,086
Well, I am Michael Cardinal Driscoll,
and among other things...

299
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,424
<i>I'm head of
the theosophic council.</i>

300
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:47,725
<i>A bit like the dead letter department
of the post office, I'm afraid.</i>

301
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:53,435
I believe Michelangelo
went blind from candlelight.

302
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,635
Dominic didn't believe
in electricity.

303
00:32:56,744 --> 00:33:00,111
<i>Yes, but a sin eater? You couldn't have
shocked the bishop more if you'd said...</i>

304
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:04,207
<i>...you'd been possessed by some Phoenician
demon and then demanded an exorcism.</i>

305
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,947
<i>- The exorcism was on Friday.
- Well, today is Monday.</i>

306
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:12,225
And yet, I think there may be
credence to what you say.

307
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,528
<i>Matter of fact, I know there is.</i>

308
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:21,367
A sin eater...

309
00:33:21,469 --> 00:33:24,961
<i>...a renegade who provides a path to heaven
outside of the church, outside of our savior.</i>

310
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:27,404
<i>If you believe such things,
he has the power...</i>

311
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,476
<i>...to grant redemption
to the unrepentant.</i>

312
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:34,776
<i>Sort of a heretical wrench in the cogs
of our Catholic machinery.</i>

313
00:33:38,152 --> 00:33:41,053
You two were Dominic's chosen. What do
you know about his excommunication?

314
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:43,419
Nothing.

315
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:46,721
<i>- He wouldn't speak of it.
- Well, Dominic believed this other...</i>

316
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:49,160
...this man was based right here in Rome.

317
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:54,098
Now, that's all I know because
that's all he told me...

318
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:57,103
<i>...and I assume that the two of you
plan to seek him out.</i>

319
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:59,765
<i>Otherwise, I am just spinning
my wheels here.</i>

320
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:13,347
<i>Sadly, the church no longer
has the will to dispatch.</i>

321
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:16,685
Thank God we still have the tools.

322
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,524
The instrument of delivery,
if you will.

323
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:30,236
Now, if you'll excuse me...

324
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,898
<i>...there are even more pressing matters
weighing on the Vatican tonight.</i>

325
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:37,770
<i>Signorina.</i>

326
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:44,409
<i>What could be more
important than this?</i>

327
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,284
<i>They say the pope is ill.
In fact, they say that he's dying.</i>

328
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:54,657
And that man, Mara, girl,
that American is front-runner for the job.

329
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:57,162
That man that just asked you
to kill somebody?

330
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:06,233
Left it to our discretion, I'd say.

331
00:35:11,145 --> 00:35:13,909
Where'd you get that?

332
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:17,678
<i>Last year. Got drunk,
woke up with it.</i>

333
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,753
That's very strange.

334
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:22,550
<i>Sailors get anchors, so I'm a priest.</i>

335
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:24,557
It's still strange, Tommy.

336
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,459
I'm glad Dominic
believed in bathrooms.

337
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:37,503
<i>I usually just open the window
and lean out.</i>

338
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:45,840
<i>What's strange is that you're a priest
sleeping on the couch...</i>

339
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:49,041
<i>...instead of a man
sleeping in bed with her.</i>

340
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,347
Thomas, two days ago,
she was in a mental institution.

341
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:54,353
So, she's crazy about you.

342
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:02,952
<i>Can you look me in the eye and tell me
you still wanna be a priest?</i>

343
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,901
Can you?

344
00:36:13,374 --> 00:36:15,842
<i>There are other ways to serve.</i>

345
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,104
<i>Hmm, to serve.</i>

346
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,372
- It's knowledge I'm after.
- Knowledge.

347
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,917
When I look under a rock,
my gut reacts to what I see.

348
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,079
I don't wonder how it got under
the rock to begin with.

349
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:36,926
You guys tired?

350
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:39,090
<i>Go upstairs and get some sleep.</i>

351
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,502
- Good night.
- Night.

352
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,799
- Sweet dreams, yeah?
- You too.

353
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:51,036
I know who she is,
but who is she?

354
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:53,113
Tell me something about her.

355
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,077
<i>Hmm.</i>

356
00:36:57,184 --> 00:37:00,244
<i>She's a... She's a painter.</i>

357
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:03,414
Really good too.

358
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:06,288
I don't know, there's something
about her that...

359
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:11,191
She sees things differently.

360
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,832
She feels things differently.

361
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,338
I wish I never saw her face.

362
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,671
Alex, you're a fool.

363
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:28,614
Same as you were once.

364
00:37:30,718 --> 00:37:33,710
<i>Alex, your head rules your heart.</i>

365
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,914
- Oh, and what rules yours?
- Laughter, of course.

366
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:39,925
<i>Hey, hey, you laugh
to keep from going mad.</i>

367
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:42,860
<i>- You laugh to keep the wolves at bay.
- It's still laughter.</i>

368
00:37:42,963 --> 00:37:46,228
<i>- As for you, SpaghettiO, choose life.
- Right.</i>

369
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,234
Let your heart wear the crown,
not your head.

370
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,236
Here we are.

371
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:53,704
<i>Time to see Chirac.</i>

372
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,104
<i>Who is he anyways?</i>

373
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:00,305
A rising darkness.

374
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:03,983
A rising darkness?

375
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:34,878
We're looking for Rosalinda.

376
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,576
Sure. She's over there.

377
00:38:42,356 --> 00:38:44,722
Girl with the faraway eyes.

378
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,225
We need you to take us to Chirac.

379
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:50,249
<i>Don't start your posturing,
you pagan worshipping pig.</i>

380
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,325
<i>You owe me a debt.</i>

381
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,355
My friend and I
are looking for the other.

382
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,994
...just what does he mean
by the dying?

383
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,957
Ask him.

384
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,004
Oh, shit. Uh...

385
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:41,006
Where... Where can I find the sin eater?

386
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:45,545
The other will find you.

387
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:49,173
<i>Upon the stone where all is built...</i>

388
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:54,619
<i>...he brings you claves...</i>

389
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:57,520
<i>...regni caelorum.</i>

390
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:05,198
<i>Claves regni caelorum?
The keys to the kingdom of heaven.</i>

391
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:20,739
<i>Upon the stone
where all is built.</i>

392
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:24,511
<i>Upon the stone
where all is built.</i>

393
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:27,143
Ah, I hate riddles.

394
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:31,350
<i>Petrus, stone. Petram.</i>

395
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:36,191
<i>Peter is the stone upon which all,
right, the church is built.</i>

396
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:38,197
St. Peter's.

397
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,995
Well, the other will find me then.

398
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:45,868
St. Peter's. Doesn't anyone
just meet for coffee anymore?

399
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:49,568
<i>And he will bring you claves regni...</i>

400
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,908
Alex!

401
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:58,607
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

402
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,873
<i>Thomas.</i>

403
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:05,712
<i>Thomas.</i>

404
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:08,686
<i>No point in hangin' around.</i>

405
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:13,424
<i>Thomas.!</i>

406
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,427
<i>Tommy, love.</i>

407
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:17,622
<i>How long have you
been a priest, Thomas?</i>

408
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:21,633
<i>Certain pleasures
are forever out of reach.</i>

409
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:23,635
<i>- Denied.
- Thomas.!</i>

410
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:26,900
Leave it for a sunny day.
Come on.

411
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,233
All mouth and no trousers.

412
00:43:30,344 --> 00:43:34,212
<i>Remember that girl
in Dublin? Megan was her name.</i>

413
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:41,085
<i>Did you feel foolish, Tommy?
In love with a whore.</i>

414
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:43,179
Thomas?

415
00:43:46,193 --> 00:43:49,754
<i>It's personal. Ignore it.
The first and only lesson, remember?</i>

416
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:54,493
<i>Tommy love. Oh, Tommy.
I love you, Tommy.</i>

417
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:57,035
<i>- Come on, mate.
- Never give them an inch.</i>

418
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:59,128
<i>- Tommy.
- Not one fuckin' inch!</i>

419
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,571
Thomas? Thomas! Thomas!

420
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:03,768
In the name of God
and Jesus Christ...

421
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:06,175
...to hell with you!

422
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,120
I love you, Tommy.

423
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,891
<i>I'll pray for you, Tommy.</i>

424
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:33,532
<i>Thomas.!</i>

425
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:41,213
Shit!

426
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:45,183
<i>I said there was no point
in hanging around.</i>

427
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:48,482
You never laugh, Alex.
It's not good for the soul.

428
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,506
I thought you might
be the nurse.

429
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:16,413
<i>- Thomas, what happened? Where's Alex?
- He's off in search of coffee.</i>

430
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:19,975
<i>As for me, I was hoisted up
by me own petard.</i>

431
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:27,919
Mara, if I can ask...

432
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:30,292
<i>...what happened
between you and Alex?</i>

433
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:33,429
It's okay.

434
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:36,962
If I was embarrassed,
I'd wear bracelets.

435
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:44,266
My little brother was murdered,
and they brought Alex in to consult.

436
00:45:45,812 --> 00:45:49,179
The Filmore murders.
Dominic sent Alex.

437
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:51,274
That was his first time on his own.

438
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:00,825
Mara, I hear confession all the time.

439
00:46:12,673 --> 00:46:14,573
Nightingales.

440
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:17,109
<i>What about them?</i>

441
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:19,678
<i>Those are the birds
that I'd hear singing...</i>

442
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,748
...right before
the headaches started.

443
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,581
<i>These headaches,
they'd go on for weeks.</i>

444
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:30,555
They were... Blinding.

445
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:37,460
<i>So, I did this,
and even that didn't help.</i>

446
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:39,589
<i>Alex performed an exorcism.</i>

447
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,767
Yeah.

448
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:47,273
<i>Alex took away my pain...</i>

449
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,104
<i>...and I fell in love with a priest
who couldn't love me back.</i>

450
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,872
Love.

451
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,971
<i>You traded one pain for another.</i>

452
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,149
<i>Something terrible is gonna
happen to Alex, Thomas.</i>

453
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:07,385
<i>I don't know what it is...</i>

454
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:10,691
...but I know that
it's worse than death.

455
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,177
<i>Am I the answer to your prayer?</i>

456
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:32,513
My friends call me William.

457
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:34,610
William Eden.

458
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,485
I'm not your friend.

459
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:39,559
That remains to be seen.

460
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:51,628
I know what you're feeling, Alex,
and you're right.

461
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:54,206
God exists.

462
00:47:54,307 --> 00:47:56,400
He just doesn't give a damn.

463
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:00,845
Magnificence.

464
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,650
Flesh rots.

465
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,652
St. Peter's remains.

466
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:12,555
<i>This impossible dome, Alex...</i>

467
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:15,856
...it was raised by my brother
when I was still a boy.

468
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,834
Blood and sweat built this...

469
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:25,632
...not faith.

470
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,300
<i>It was Michelangelo who drew
the dome on a piece of paper...</i>

471
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:34,072
<i>...but it was left to my brother
to figure out a way...</i>

472
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:38,049
<i>...to raise it halfway to heaven...</i>

473
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:42,815
<i>...and it was my honor, each day
to bring him something to eat...</i>

474
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:45,949
<i>- ...and ask him of the world outside of my own.
- Papa?</i>

475
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,550
Hey, William.
You brought some food.

476
00:48:49,996 --> 00:48:52,294
Thank you.

477
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:03,507
<i>Tell me a story, Phillip,
a story ofJerusalem.</i>

478
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,510
Jerusalem?

479
00:49:57,898 --> 00:50:00,366
<i>Phillip!</i>

480
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,363
<i>Phillip!</i>

481
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:10,243
<i>Phillip!</i>

482
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:19,143
He's dying.

483
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:21,618
I can give no absolution.

484
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:25,213
He was excommunicated
last year in Jerusalem.

485
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,793
Good enough to
build God's house...

486
00:50:27,894 --> 00:50:30,419
...but not to let him
enter his kingdom.

487
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,430
Is that it?

488
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:37,998
William, go.
Fetch the sin eater.

489
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:45,107
In Jerusalem, my brother gave
a dying Arab a drink of water.

490
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:48,204
There was no well,
so he gave him holy water.

491
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:53,650
<i>My brother gave the church
his youth in Jerusalem...</i>

492
00:50:53,753 --> 00:50:57,189
<i>...his blood at St. Peter's,
but when he lay dying...</i>

493
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:01,919
...they deserted him.

494
00:51:02,028 --> 00:51:06,158
When his soul stretched out,
caught between heaven and hell...

495
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,030
...it was the other
who delivered him.

496
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:11,535
<i>It was the other
who gave him peace.</i>

497
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,543
I always loved
my brother, Alex...

498
00:51:21,815 --> 00:51:24,841
...but the church I grew to hate.

499
00:51:26,686 --> 00:51:28,418
<i>This... is the other way.</i>

500
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:30,151
<i>This... is the other way.</i>

501
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,652
I can teach you...

502
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,921
<i>...if you are willing.</i>

503
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,997
I was willing.

504
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:42,460
And so, I was taught.

505
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:44,662
Did you kill Dominic Sousa?

506
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:48,197
The church killed him.

507
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:50,208
He died when
he was excommunicated.

508
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,973
<i>His body continued on a while,
but his spirit was dead.</i>

509
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,071
That's a lie.

510
00:51:56,182 --> 00:51:59,208
<i>He was, Alex. He was ruined,
broken, not playacting.</i>

511
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:01,913
Don't talk to me of lies.

512
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:11,693
I lost it in 1602.

513
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,596
I had dinner with Caravaggio
and drank too much wine.

514
00:52:14,701 --> 00:52:16,601
It's a means...

515
00:52:16,703 --> 00:52:18,933
...an instrument for ridding the world
of the other.

516
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,531
Answer my question.
Did you kill Dominic?

517
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:26,009
He killed himself, Alex,
after the church abandoned him...

518
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:30,378
...after they took away
his reason to live.

519
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:33,350
They did to him as they did
to my brother, Alex.

520
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:38,581
And you know what I did?

521
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:42,418
You know what
I did for Dominic?

522
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:46,088
I gave him absolution.

523
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,999
<i>I took on the burden of his sins,
and I gave him peace.</i>

524
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:52,731
Not the church... I.

525
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:57,569
So don't talk to me of lies, Alex.

526
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:02,272
Dominic was like a father to me.

527
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,954
I'm just trying to understand.

528
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:35,738
Come with me.

529
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:41,415
Every fear hides a wish.
Don't you think?

530
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:03,735
So what is it
to be a sin eater?

531
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:07,536
What is it not to be one?

532
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:10,343
I know of no other way to be.

533
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,250
It seems beyond a man's judgment.
Forgiveness is God's domain.

534
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:17,016
I'm just an instrument.

535
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:19,717
<i>Like any great power,
it depends on how it's used.</i>

536
00:54:19,826 --> 00:54:23,262
- And how do you use it?
- As I see fit.

537
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:27,628
I'm not a threat to the church.

538
00:54:27,734 --> 00:54:29,998
I'm an insult, an embarrassment.

539
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,774
But you're a Carolingian.
You know how it feels to be outside.

540
00:54:36,876 --> 00:54:38,776
<i>I serve the church.</i>

541
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:43,681
<i>Serve yourself.</i>

542
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,126
Get Alex some fresh clothes
and a hot bath if he would like.

543
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:02,099
<i>And then take him someplace quiet
where he can sit.</i>

544
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:06,104
If you would like anything,
anything can be arranged.

545
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:45,702
<i>- How long have I been asleep for?
- A few hours.</i>

546
00:55:48,915 --> 00:55:51,975
What is it you want, Alex?

547
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:56,614
- I want to learn the truth.
- Truth?

548
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:01,985
The terrible thing about searching for
the truth is that sometimes you find it.

549
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:06,395
<i>Not to mention it makes you
very unwelcome at parties.</i>

550
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:10,560
<i>It makes you unwelcome anywhere,
even in church.</i>

551
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:20,535
Who are you?

552
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:23,844
I'm all that remains when
everything else turns to dust.

553
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:29,386
<i>But to put it simply, Alex,
I'm very, very tired.</i>

554
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,423
Are you a man?

555
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:34,755
I shit. I fuck.

556
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:38,262
I shave. Does that
make me a man?

557
00:56:38,364 --> 00:56:40,093
Can you die?

558
00:56:46,206 --> 00:56:48,697
You tell me.

559
00:56:50,243 --> 00:56:53,110
<i>I laugh. I cry.</i>

560
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:57,516
Once, I loved.

561
00:56:57,617 --> 00:57:01,485
Does that make me a man?
I don't know. What about you, Alex?

562
00:57:02,855 --> 00:57:04,755
<i>Are you a man?</i>

563
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:09,692
<i>- I'm a priest.
- You understand the difference...</i>

564
00:57:09,796 --> 00:57:11,923
<i>...the truth of it.</i>

565
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:13,931
<i>Good.</i>

566
00:57:14,033 --> 00:57:17,560
Do you remember what Keats said
about the truth?

567
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,905
"Beauty is truth. Truth is beauty."

568
00:57:25,378 --> 00:57:27,471
<i>Keeping that in mind...</i>

569
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,639
...my original question,
what is it you want?

570
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:32,309
<i>The truth...</i>

571
00:57:32,418 --> 00:57:34,545
<i>...or something beautiful?</i>

572
00:57:40,293 --> 00:57:42,193
Something beautiful.

573
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:45,860
Beauty is truth, Alex.

574
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,891
Does your oasis have a name?

575
00:57:51,771 --> 00:57:53,671
Mara.

576
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:56,765
<i>- Her name is Mara.
- So say it.</i>

577
00:57:59,812 --> 00:58:01,837
<i>Say what you want, Alex.</i>

578
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,542
If it's the truth, then
why be afraid? Say it.

579
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:10,321
I want Mara.

580
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:17,428
Then you're a man...

581
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:20,865
<i>...and not a priest.</i>

582
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:26,865
<i>And if Mara's what you want,
then you should go and get her.</i>

583
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,908
<i>Shh. You'll wake her.</i>

584
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:15,878
She might be dreaming.

585
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:42,423
How we run
from the things we need.

586
01:01:14,057 --> 01:01:15,888
He's dying.

587
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:18,552
That's why I'm here.

588
01:01:21,998 --> 01:01:25,263
Rembrandt did some
remarkable things.

589
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:27,802
This isn't one of them.

590
01:01:27,904 --> 01:01:30,031
It's a de Gelder.

591
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,802
But only I'll know that.
Put it in the car.

592
01:01:34,744 --> 01:01:38,043
<i>- Your services don't come cheap.
- No, they don't.</i>

593
01:01:38,148 --> 01:01:40,048
What did Dominic give you?

594
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:44,177
I mean he, uh...
he had nothing.

595
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:48,087
<i>That's not true. He gave me friendship
once, and I returned it.</i>

596
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:08,099
What do you think
you can do for him that I haven't?

597
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:10,509
I am the conductor
of the night train.

598
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:13,310
The answer to your question
is infinite.

599
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:18,182
Science, medicine.

600
01:02:18,288 --> 01:02:20,256
<i>You give people
nothing to hold...</i>

601
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:22,518
<i>...except words they can't pronounce.</i>

602
01:02:22,626 --> 01:02:25,094
<i>Cancers that act capriciously.</i>

603
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:31,767
You measure life with a ruler...

604
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:33,859
...and a bathroom scale.

605
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:36,200
You take away...

606
01:02:36,306 --> 01:02:40,675
...you kill the mystery
that makes life mean something.

607
01:02:44,247 --> 01:02:46,807
<i>And you pretend
to understand it all...</i>

608
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:50,648
...when you understand nothing,
when you are nothing...

609
01:02:50,754 --> 01:02:52,984
...when your dust has
more value than you do.

610
01:03:06,102 --> 01:03:08,070
<i>Christ on the cross...</i>

611
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:13,873
...he gave forgiveness to a thief
being crucified alongside him.

612
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:17,413
The church would not
have allowed it.

613
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:20,574
- But Christ did.
- I know this man.

614
01:03:20,684 --> 01:03:22,618
That's Marcus Burnham.
I read about him.

615
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,746
<i>A lost sheep.
A man full of regret and fear.</i>

616
01:03:26,856 --> 01:03:29,017
Such fear.

617
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:31,286
They say he got away with murder.

618
01:03:31,394 --> 01:03:33,954
That remains to be seen.

619
01:04:08,264 --> 01:04:10,289
"Blood in."

620
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:24,570
"Blood out."

621
01:04:32,822 --> 01:04:37,259
<i>From Jerusalem... My brother said
it held a splinter from the true cross.</i>

622
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:41,629
But the world is rotten with lies.

623
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:56,605
Bread for the host.

624
01:04:59,049 --> 01:05:01,415
And salt for the blood.

625
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:09,752
Are you ready to make
your confession?

626
01:05:09,859 --> 01:05:11,884
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

627
01:05:13,863 --> 01:05:15,763
Forgiveness for the unforgivable.

628
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,133
Breathtaking.

629
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:52,793
I forgive you.

630
01:07:09,412 --> 01:07:13,280
I'm... I'm free.

631
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:26,555
<i>My cross. Alex,
give me my cross, please.</i>

632
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:47,613
So, what do you think
of what I do?

633
01:07:53,356 --> 01:07:56,519
It's not immortality, Alex.
You will grow weary.

634
01:07:56,626 --> 01:07:59,993
But 500 years? 1,000?

635
01:08:01,564 --> 01:08:04,590
<i>Imagine what you could accomplish
given that time.</i>

636
01:08:04,701 --> 01:08:07,465
Imagine the knowledge that waits.

637
01:08:08,938 --> 01:08:11,463
What are you saying?

638
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:15,271
<i>I'm used up.
My time is done.</i>

639
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,117
But I believe in
the legacy of it all.

640
01:08:22,218 --> 01:08:24,880
I should not be
the last of my kind.

641
01:08:27,056 --> 01:08:31,891
There... Should be another other.

642
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:36,057
But why me?

643
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:39,259
In the end, Alex,
like recognizes like.

644
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:41,735
I'm not like you.

645
01:08:43,907 --> 01:08:48,469
<i>Alex, you buried an excommunicated
priest in consecrated ground...</i>

646
01:08:48,578 --> 01:08:50,671
...after the church
had forbidden it.

647
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,748
You went around
their authority, Alex...

648
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:55,010
...the same as I do.

649
01:08:57,253 --> 01:08:59,551
You're exactly like me.

650
01:09:15,271 --> 01:09:17,535
<i>I hope you like sunflowers.</i>

651
01:09:21,744 --> 01:09:24,212
I love sunflowers.
You know that.

652
01:09:31,754 --> 01:09:33,654
Why?

653
01:09:35,191 --> 01:09:37,955
Why do you love sunflowers?

654
01:09:38,061 --> 01:09:40,495
Because I always thought that...

655
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:42,496
...when God was making
beautiful things...

656
01:09:42,598 --> 01:09:45,192
<i>...he messed up with sunflowers.</i>

657
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:47,496
How?

658
01:09:47,603 --> 01:09:49,901
Well, 'cause they look like...
I don't know.

659
01:09:50,006 --> 01:09:54,409
They look like crooked teeth around
a mouth that's too big, kind of.

660
01:09:55,812 --> 01:09:58,440
Yeah.

661
01:09:58,548 --> 01:10:02,075
But...just when he was
about to start over...

662
01:10:02,185 --> 01:10:05,484
...he realized that's what
made them beautiful.

663
01:10:05,588 --> 01:10:07,579
They were a brilliant mistake.

664
01:10:10,193 --> 01:10:12,093
Like you and me.

665
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:21,135
Where did you go?

666
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:33,476
William Eden...

667
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:36,051
...offered me the world last night.

668
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:43,316
When I saw these, I knew.

669
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:45,326
Knew what?

670
01:10:46,629 --> 01:10:48,722
That all I want is you.

671
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:58,073
Tell me what it is.

672
01:10:59,876 --> 01:11:02,310
It's you and me.

673
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:08,909
It's you and me till the wheels
fall off.

674
01:11:15,892 --> 01:11:19,658
Yeah. That's right.

675
01:11:30,807 --> 01:11:33,173
<i>I hadn't expected you so soon.</i>

676
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,850
How are you feeling?

677
01:11:42,952 --> 01:11:45,921
<i>Formal. The pain has passed.</i>

678
01:11:46,022 --> 01:11:49,981
All that remains
is the knowledge gained.

679
01:11:50,093 --> 01:11:53,824
I brought you this, because
I believe it's yours.

680
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:57,229
And I have an answer for you.

681
01:11:57,333 --> 01:12:00,825
Haste. That doesn't bode well.

682
01:12:00,937 --> 01:12:03,235
My answer to your offer is no.

683
01:12:04,774 --> 01:12:07,208
I don't want to be your successor.

684
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:11,007
Was I that wrong about you?

685
01:12:11,114 --> 01:12:13,912
We have a lot in common.
I'll give you that.

686
01:12:14,016 --> 01:12:16,109
Can I ask you a question?

687
01:12:16,219 --> 01:12:18,187
Of course. Go ahead.

688
01:12:18,287 --> 01:12:21,450
Yesterday you said
you once loved.

689
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:23,821
Were you ever married?

690
01:12:23,926 --> 01:12:26,019
I've had many wives
over the years.

691
01:12:26,129 --> 01:12:30,862
But my love,
that was centuries ago.

692
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:32,935
They grow old, and they die.

693
01:12:33,035 --> 01:12:35,196
And I remain.

694
01:12:35,304 --> 01:12:38,171
Maybe you'll understand, then.

695
01:12:38,274 --> 01:12:42,142
Mara... I love her.

696
01:12:42,245 --> 01:12:44,213
Well, that's fine.

697
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:48,443
<i>Have it all... Mara too. There's no need
to choose. You're not a priest anymore.</i>

698
01:12:48,551 --> 01:12:51,042
Don't you see? I...

699
01:12:51,154 --> 01:12:54,123
I don't want Mara
to grow old without me.

700
01:12:54,223 --> 01:12:58,956
Alex, the greatest truth
of all is that love cannot last.

701
01:12:59,061 --> 01:13:01,723
You'll grow tired of it. Bored.

702
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:06,958
I'll still be here.
And so will my offer.

703
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:09,037
Yeah.

704
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,470
Good-bye, William Eden.

705
01:13:13,576 --> 01:13:15,567
If I've learned one thing, Alex...

706
01:13:15,678 --> 01:13:18,579
...it's that only in death
do we ever really say good-bye.

707
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:26,887
<i>You want to know what I think?</i>

708
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:28,889
Do I have a choice?

709
01:13:28,991 --> 01:13:32,427
I think he's evil. I don't think you
should have given him the dagger.

710
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:36,123
<i>And mostly, SpaghettiO, I don't think
he's gonna take no for an answer.</i>

711
01:13:36,232 --> 01:13:38,928
It's the only answer I've got.

712
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:41,936
Dominic trained us for what?

713
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,532
<i>- I'm not a priest anymore, Thomas...
- For what?</i>

714
01:13:47,643 --> 01:13:51,909
<i>- To dispatch ghosts, demons and
all manner of undead. - That's right.</i>

715
01:13:52,014 --> 01:13:55,040
- You said so yourself... Eden's a living man.
- Well, I was wrong.

716
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:57,415
And as soon as I can move,
I go back underground...

717
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,421
...see if Chirac knows where
we can find the rest of this.

718
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:02,423
It's time to walk away.
Let it go.

719
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:04,037
No walking away, Alex.
Take Mara and run.

720
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:05,549
No walking away, Alex.
Take Mara and run.

721
01:14:05,661 --> 01:14:08,459
Get as far away from here as you can.
Lose yourselves somewhere...

722
01:14:08,564 --> 01:14:10,623
<i>Thomas. Thomas, please.</i>

723
01:14:10,733 --> 01:14:13,497
<i>Please, get some sleep.
Eat someJell-O. Do something.</i>

724
01:14:13,603 --> 01:14:15,662
I'm... I'm gonna go visit Mara.

725
01:14:15,771 --> 01:14:18,262
<i>- I'll be back here later.
- Alex, I'm serious.</i>

726
01:14:18,374 --> 01:14:21,468
Yeah, and I'm starting to laugh.

727
01:14:22,612 --> 01:14:25,080
Just like you told me to.

728
01:14:27,617 --> 01:14:30,108
<i>Get some sleep.</i>

729
01:15:17,266 --> 01:15:19,734
<i>Is it dark where you go, Mara?</i>

730
01:15:21,904 --> 01:15:23,872
<i>Is your pain shapeless...</i>

731
01:15:23,973 --> 01:15:26,373
...or does it take form?

732
01:15:29,745 --> 01:15:31,770
What are you doing here?

733
01:15:33,115 --> 01:15:35,379
I came to see you.

734
01:15:35,484 --> 01:15:37,577
<i>I thought we should finally meet.</i>

735
01:15:46,762 --> 01:15:48,662
I've heard many confessions.

736
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:52,097
I never made one.

737
01:15:56,806 --> 01:15:59,900
Did you know Alex's
mother killed herself?

738
01:16:00,009 --> 01:16:02,671
<i>Has he ever told you that?</i>

739
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:05,542
How do you know
about his mom?

740
01:16:07,049 --> 01:16:09,210
I was there.

741
01:16:10,753 --> 01:16:13,483
His father died
in a car accident.

742
01:16:13,589 --> 01:16:15,557
I was there then too.

743
01:16:16,592 --> 01:16:19,186
Like me, Alex was defined...

744
01:16:19,295 --> 01:16:21,263
<i>...by specific events in his youth.</i>

745
01:16:21,364 --> 01:16:26,199
<i>In his case, they were too important
to be left to fate.</i>

746
01:16:28,304 --> 01:16:30,568
You killed them?

747
01:16:37,146 --> 01:16:40,309
<i>And Dominic helped me mold him.</i>

748
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:43,078
Dominic gave me Alex.
That was his sin.

749
01:16:50,092 --> 01:16:52,754
You still haven't answered
my question, Mara.

750
01:16:55,865 --> 01:16:58,459
Is it dark where you go, Mara?

751
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:01,092
When the nightingales sing?

752
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:04,672
Hmm?

753
01:17:04,774 --> 01:17:06,742
I brought them to you.

754
01:17:08,644 --> 01:17:10,544
<i>I placed you in Alex's path.</i>

755
01:17:12,148 --> 01:17:15,379
Your love is my creation...

756
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:19,918
<i>...manufactured like an automobile.</i>

757
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:25,288
You don't need to worry.

758
01:17:28,097 --> 01:17:29,997
<i>Alex will be fine.
I'll see to it.</i>

759
01:17:38,307 --> 01:17:40,901
I'm sorry, girl...

760
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:43,103
...but this world
is too much with me.

761
01:17:48,617 --> 01:17:51,415
<i>I'll take you to a place
where it isn't dark anymore...</i>

762
01:17:53,122 --> 01:17:55,249
...where the sun
shines all the time.

763
01:17:59,595 --> 01:18:01,324
I'm sorry.

764
01:18:44,874 --> 01:18:46,967
Mara?

765
01:18:53,816 --> 01:18:56,751
Oh!

766
01:18:56,852 --> 01:18:58,786
Ohh! Ohh! Ahh!

767
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:06,559
No! No! Oh, no.

768
01:19:06,662 --> 01:19:10,530
Mara. Mara.
Mara, baby. Baby.

769
01:19:10,633 --> 01:19:13,466
Baby, I...

770
01:19:13,569 --> 01:19:17,232
Baby. Oh!

771
01:19:24,713 --> 01:19:27,045
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii...</i>

772
01:19:31,754 --> 01:19:34,552
Oh, God.

773
01:19:34,657 --> 01:19:38,058
I'm sorry. I can't.

774
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,128
I can't.

775
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:44,622
<i>I'm not a priest anymore.</i>

776
01:19:56,478 --> 01:19:58,605
I can take you there if I...

777
01:20:14,196 --> 01:20:18,257
Baby, oh, hang on, okay?

778
01:20:18,367 --> 01:20:20,392
<i>Hold on, okay, please?</i>

779
01:20:24,006 --> 01:20:25,940
No. I...

780
01:20:39,288 --> 01:20:41,950
Baby. Now...

781
01:23:04,466 --> 01:23:07,367
<i>Buon giorno, Mr. Alex.</i>

782
01:23:07,469 --> 01:23:10,302
Eden!

783
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:13,473
He's not here.

784
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:17,504
Where is he?

785
01:23:17,613 --> 01:23:20,446
- We thought you would know, Mr. Alex.
- Eden!

786
01:23:20,549 --> 01:23:22,449
<i>He said to say good-bye.</i>

787
01:23:22,551 --> 01:23:25,611
He told me to tell you
that everything's in order.

788
01:23:25,721 --> 01:23:30,954
<i>Everything that once was his
is now yours.</i>

789
01:23:31,059 --> 01:23:33,550
What's going on here?

790
01:23:34,596 --> 01:23:36,587
What's going on here?

791
01:23:49,144 --> 01:23:52,807
<i>"Barath-mae, barath-sec. '"</i>

792
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:56,817
<i>Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.</i>

793
01:24:00,656 --> 01:24:04,023
And watch your language.

794
01:24:05,627 --> 01:24:07,891
<i>It's a set-up.</i>

795
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:14,235
<i>Now...</i>

796
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,400
...kiss the ring...

797
01:24:20,509 --> 01:24:22,443
<i>...and I'll spare your life.</i>

798
01:24:26,615 --> 01:24:28,515
<i>Blasphemer.</i>

799
01:24:33,355 --> 01:24:35,255
<i>Blasphemer.</i>

800
01:24:38,227 --> 01:24:40,855
So...

801
01:24:40,963 --> 01:24:43,523
...has the world gone mad?

802
01:24:43,632 --> 01:24:47,659
No. It still makes deals.

803
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:49,737
Mine was with William Eden.

804
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,167
<i>I opened the Vatican vaults
and retrieved the dagger...</i>

805
01:24:55,277 --> 01:24:58,542
William Eden had
lost 400 years ago.

806
01:24:58,647 --> 01:25:02,174
<i>In return, he compromised
certain votes...</i>

807
01:25:02,284 --> 01:25:04,809
...of certain cardinals.

808
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:09,653
For my deal with William Eden...

809
01:25:09,758 --> 01:25:12,659
<i>I will become pope.</i>

810
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:17,760
<i>A warrior pope.</i>

811
01:25:17,866 --> 01:25:22,030
<i>A pope of a church
that will reclaim its property...</i>

812
01:25:22,137 --> 01:25:25,538
<i>...and its sanctity and its power.</i>

813
01:25:29,044 --> 01:25:31,205
<i>Blasphemer!</i>

814
01:25:31,313 --> 01:25:33,474
Aaah!

815
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:37,748
<i>Pagan-worshipping blasphemer!</i>

816
01:26:10,052 --> 01:26:11,952
<i>I need to speak with Eden.</i>

817
01:26:16,591 --> 01:26:19,287
You know what I mean.
The other.

818
01:26:19,394 --> 01:26:21,555
No. I'm asking you.

819
01:26:38,847 --> 01:26:40,747
I seek the other.

820
01:26:40,849 --> 01:26:44,444
<i>He ends where he began...</i>

821
01:26:44,553 --> 01:26:46,783
...in St. Peter's.

822
01:26:48,690 --> 01:26:53,059
<i>We hang priests here.!
The weak ones.!</i>

823
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:50,918
Mara died.

824
01:27:53,288 --> 01:27:55,256
Slit her wrists.

825
01:28:07,903 --> 01:28:11,270
I've got to go.

826
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:16,844
I've got to go.

827
01:28:36,264 --> 01:28:38,232
Alex.

828
01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:12,426
<i>Am I the answer to your prayer?</i>

829
01:29:12,534 --> 01:29:14,434
You just might be.

830
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:20,840
<i>I performed the ceremony...</i>

831
01:29:22,811 --> 01:29:23,840
...found Mara dying.

832
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:24,870
Found Mara dying.

833
01:29:27,215 --> 01:29:29,342
I did it to set her free.

834
01:29:29,451 --> 01:29:31,385
How did it feel?

835
01:29:37,092 --> 01:29:39,560
Like I was God.

836
01:29:40,729 --> 01:29:43,095
What about her sins?

837
01:29:43,198 --> 01:29:45,666
Do you have knowledge
of them too?

838
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:50,227
Yes. There weren't many.

839
01:29:50,338 --> 01:29:54,001
Hmm. She was a good girl.

840
01:29:56,278 --> 01:29:58,508
One thing about it
troubles me, though.

841
01:29:58,613 --> 01:30:00,774
Don't intellectualize
something so visceral.

842
01:30:00,882 --> 01:30:03,908
It's just, in the church,
suicide is a mortal sin...

843
01:30:04,019 --> 01:30:07,182
...and I didn't feel it at all.

844
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:09,223
Maybe the church is wrong.

845
01:30:09,324 --> 01:30:11,224
No.

846
01:30:13,295 --> 01:30:15,923
She was murdered.

847
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:39,048
One day, you will realize, Alex...

848
01:30:40,589 --> 01:30:43,990
...that because of what I did...

849
01:30:44,092 --> 01:30:47,550
...in your heart,
Mara, your love...

850
01:30:47,662 --> 01:30:49,562
...will live forever.

851
01:30:49,664 --> 01:30:52,224
<i>No!</i>

852
01:30:58,173 --> 01:31:00,073
<i>Barath-mae...</i>

853
01:31:01,876 --> 01:31:05,573
<i>Barath-sec.</i>

854
01:31:07,749 --> 01:31:10,183
Now you'll know
what I know, Alex.

855
01:31:11,386 --> 01:31:13,445
Time to look into the abyss.

856
01:31:13,555 --> 01:31:16,752
There are wonders there.

857
01:32:24,225 --> 01:32:26,693
I feel like I'm...

858
01:32:26,795 --> 01:32:29,025
10 years old again.

859
01:32:31,633 --> 01:32:33,533
I'm home.

860
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,040
I...

861
01:32:41,142 --> 01:32:43,133
...understand.

862
01:32:45,747 --> 01:32:48,147
God save me, I understand.

863
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,220
<i>The parchment...</i>

864
01:32:55,824 --> 01:32:58,384
...it's not how you kill the other.

865
01:32:58,493 --> 01:33:00,393
It's how you become the other.

866
01:33:02,497 --> 01:33:05,227
I'm sorry.
I found out too late.

867
01:33:13,508 --> 01:33:16,909
I won't leave you like this, Alex.

868
01:33:17,946 --> 01:33:20,005
There has to be another way.

869
01:33:22,117 --> 01:33:25,018
When I learn what it is,
I'll find you...

870
01:33:27,956 --> 01:33:30,186
...even if it's to kill you.

871
01:33:48,877 --> 01:33:50,845
<i>Morning.</i>

872
01:33:59,854 --> 01:34:01,754
I sent for the sin eater.

873
01:34:01,856 --> 01:34:04,381
I am the sin eater.

874
01:34:10,598 --> 01:34:12,725
Huh.

875
01:34:14,335 --> 01:34:17,566
So Eden gets what he asks for...

876
01:34:17,672 --> 01:34:20,004
...and you and I are left behind.

877
01:34:23,611 --> 01:34:27,513
<i>What you told the Vatican
has ruined me. Did you know that?</i>

878
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:32,177
<i>Deposed...</i>

879
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:34,255
...and degraded.

880
01:34:35,957 --> 01:34:38,255
It was you, wasn't it?

881
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:45,258
I learned a lot
in a very short time.

882
01:34:48,303 --> 01:34:50,396
And in the end...

883
01:34:50,505 --> 01:34:53,872
<i>...the only secret people keep
is immortality.</i>

884
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:02,474
You ready?

885
01:35:08,723 --> 01:35:11,487
<i>It's the confession, not the priest...</i>

886
01:35:11,593 --> 01:35:13,720
...that gives you absolution.

887
01:35:13,828 --> 01:35:15,728
Do you understand?

888
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,730
Yes.

889
01:35:25,106 --> 01:35:28,166
Are you ready
to make your confession?

890
01:35:28,276 --> 01:35:30,244
Yes.

891
01:36:31,773 --> 01:36:34,173
She was like a sunflower.

892
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,011
God's beautiful mistake.

893
01:36:55,563 --> 01:36:57,531
<i>Choke on your own filth.</i>

894
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:19,642
<i>And now it is I.</i>

895
01:37:19,754 --> 01:37:22,814
<i>I have been blessed and cursed...</i>

896
01:37:22,924 --> 01:37:27,987
<i>...for now I possess the keys
to the kingdom ofheaven.</i>

897
01:37:28,096 --> 01:37:31,827
<i>I will forgive those
who deserve freedom.</i>

898
01:37:31,933 --> 01:37:35,994
<i>I will damn those
who have damned themselves.</i>

899
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:40,666
<i>I will learn to live
after love has died.</i>

900
01:37:40,775 --> 01:37:42,834
<i>I am the sin eater.</i>

901
01:39:06,227 --> 01:39:11,859
<i>Due croci.</i>

902
01:39:27,849 --> 01:39:32,809
<i>Due croci.</i>
