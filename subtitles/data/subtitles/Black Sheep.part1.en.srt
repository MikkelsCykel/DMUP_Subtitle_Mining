00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,241
Man:
Hold him there. Hold him there!

2
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,279
Man: Hey!

3
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:10,594
Henry, we've got a bolter!

4
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,599
Henry, Tucker,
go get him!

5
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,432
Get down, hold him!

6
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,203
Hold him! Hold him!

7
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,611
Good boy, get down.
Get down!

8
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,613
Hold him. That's it.

9
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,647
Good on ya, boy.

10
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,679
Tucker:
Come on, Henry!

11
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:20,595
Henry had
a little lamb,

12
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,828
its fleece
was white as snow,

13
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,202
and everywhere that
Dudley went,

14
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,298
Henry was sure to go.

15
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,216
Mrs. Mac? They're coming
down for lunch soon.

16
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,090
Coming down,
Henry!

17
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,962
Dudley?

18
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,236
Dudley,
where are you, boy?

19
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,903
Dudley?

20
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,285
Dudley?

21
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,494
Dudley?

22
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,402
Dudley?

23
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,101
Come out of there,
Dudley.

24
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,748
Ahh! Ah!

25
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,032
Boys!

26
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,698
Angus, pull
your head in!

27
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,264
Henry?

28
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,368
Boys.

29
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,911
It's your father.

30
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,280
There's been
an accident.

31
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,179
City boy, eh?

32
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,851
- No, I grew up on a farm.
- Oh, me too.

33
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,489
- Oh.
- You all right, my friend?

34
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,963
- Need some fresh air?
- Close it. Close it!

35
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,472
Woman:
Dr. Carey's office.

36
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,135
It's Henry Oldfield.
I need to speak with her.

37
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,644
She's in a session right now.
Can I have her call you?

38
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,909
Please, please.

39
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,183
Driver:
Nothing like it, eh?

40
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,881
God's green earth.
"All creatures great and small. "

41
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,817
There we go.

42
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,383
- Okay.
- This way.

43
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,893
This isn't gonna be like
the salmon farm, is it, Grant?

44
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,993
Hey, those fish
died free.

45
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,140
- Come on, possum.
- Shh shh.

46
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,336
What's that?

47
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,712
Angus fucking Oldfield.

48
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,206
You'll wait
for me, right?

49
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,236
It's your money.

50
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,997
Hello?

51
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,499
Hello?

52
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,086
Mrs. Mac: Unless you fancy nostrils
in the back of your head,

53
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,114
I'd not be moving
if I were you.

54
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,854
Mrs. Mac.

55
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,556
Bugger me days!
Henry!

56
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,592
Oh! Oh.

57
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,497
Oh don't worry.

58
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,705
I haven't shot anyone since Christmas.

59
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,942
Oh, just wait until
your brother sees you.

60
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,210
Yeah.

61
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,709
The Merino,
the Romney, the Drysdale...

62
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,949
these names are
whispered in the winds

63
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,050
that caress
the rugged hills.

64
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,617
These names are shared

65
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,891
in corners of
the farmyard,

66
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,866
and these are the names the
young men of the land recite

67
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,925
as they take themselves
off at night.

68
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,234
But in the future,
they will whisper

69
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,570
just one name...

70
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,439
the Oldfield.

71
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,310
Now you take it down

72
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,845
and lead it round in
front of the guests. That's it.

73
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,552
Stop so they
can touch it,

74
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,493
slap a flank,
feel the wool.

75
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,089
I'll take the other microphone,
give it to anyone else who...

76
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,929
has a question.

77
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,662
Get a prospectus
on every seat,

78
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,034
then go up the hill
and get the animal.

79
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,973
What are you doing here?

80
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,202
Lawyers have this
under control, don't they?

81
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,143
What am I doing here?

82
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,114
Our family's been here
for over 100 years.

83
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,346
Our father
was born here.

84
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,183
Our mother died giving
birth to me here.

85
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,712
This is where I spent
the first 10 years of my life.

86
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,823
And my therapist
said I should come.

87
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,322
Therapy.

88
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,303
- So you're still funny about the sheep.
- It's not about the sheep.

89
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,202
It's about other issues
I need to resolve.

90
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,002
Okay.

91
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,309
Angus.

92
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,042
Go inside.
I'll cut you a check.

93
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,789
Girl:
That must be the laboratory.

94
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,421
Woman:
Careful.

95
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,692
There you go.

96
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,700
- Okay.
- Astrid Rush.

97
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,999
Girl: Who'd hire her after
the thing with the leeches?

98
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,236
- You're end?
- Come and give a hand here.

99
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,948
Rush:
Careful!

100
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,814
Grant!

101
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,446
- Up, up more...
- Shit.

102
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,467
Yeah, baby, yeah!

103
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,130
Go after him!

104
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,266
Oi!

105
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,940
- Whooo!
- Hey wait!

106
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,923
They'll never catch us.
They're meat eaters.

107
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,090
Okay.

108
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,123
- What was one, Grant?
- What?

109
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,068
Um, get in
unobserved.

110
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,037
Right.
And what was two?

111
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,164
- Collect visual evidence.
- Right.

112
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,606
Three?

113
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,769
- Get out unobserved?
- Yeah.

114
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,403
And four?

115
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,912
Blow this whole
fucking game wide open;

116
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,108
Take the bastard under
and go down in history

117
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,276
as the two people with
enough balls to save this country

118
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,286
from genetically-
engineered devastation!

119
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,754
No, Grant.
Four was a have a meeting

120
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,154
about what to do next.

121
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,489
This is evidence, okay?
It's evidence.

122
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,024
Actually, that's probably
highly-toxic genetic material.

123
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,532
Fuckin' A!

124
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,001
Fuckin' A. And it's mine.

125
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,833
Or, it's ours.

126
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,465
You and me, baby,
all the way.

127
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,066
Yeah, Grant.

128
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,236
About the you
and me bit...

129
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,805
Now I wonder if
our relationship hasn't kind of got...

130
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,408
Shh!

131
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,511
They're in
here somewhere.

132
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,886
- Go!
- Grant, wait.

133
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,754
Man:
There he goes!

134
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,553
Oi!

135
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,333
Whoa!

136
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,577
Over there!

137
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,310
Where is he?

138
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,876
- Bugger!
- Grant: Oh fuck.

139
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,500
Right.

140
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,402
That's for me.

141
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,464
And that's for you.

142
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,806
It'll buy you
a lot of therapy.

143
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,539
Well, there's not
much around here

144
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,481
in the way of your
cappuccino culture,

145
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,382
but I'm sure Mrs. Mac
will do you a cup of tea

146
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,887
and an Anzac biscuit
for the road.

147
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,548
That's it, then.

148
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,225
You got rid of
all Dad's things.

149
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,628
Living in the past...

150
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,996
that's what's wrong with
these bloody farmers.

151
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,365
You're now the owner
of the biggest farm in the district.

152
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,199
What does that make you?

153
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,865
Up here's where the smart farming's
done these days, Henry.

154
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,171
Is that what all that
outside's in aid of?

155
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,739
People are interested in
what I'm doing here, Henry.

156
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,580
It's a whole new
approach to farming.

157
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,246
It's better for the animals,
better for the farmers,

158
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,347
better for the consumer.

159
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,723
It's an exciting time to
be in agricultural sciences.

160
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,824
And a profitable one.

161
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,254
More tea, Henry?

162
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,985
I think three's enough.

163
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,459
I should get going.

164
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,123
That's a pity.
You'll miss my rabbit pie.

165
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,031
I'm making watercress
for the Japanese.

166
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,035
Look, chopsticks.

167
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,537
He's quite the lord
of the manor now, isn't he?

168
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,061
Uh...

169
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,098
Angus was throwing
this away.

170
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,848
I know your father would
have wanted you to have it.

171
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,141
The Golden Shears.

172
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,653
Best shearer in the country

173
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,212
three years running.

174
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,350
Your father said you
were a natural too.

175
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,523
L... I really can't
see it on my coffee table.

176
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,159
You got what
you came for then?

177
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,669
Angus has
got his deal.

178
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,270
Guess I'm done here.

179
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,073
I'm having the farm manager take you
for a run up to the top.

180
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,944
But I haven't been
up there since the accident.

181
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,915
I know.
That's why you're going.

182
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,882
Oh, here he is now.

183
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,517
- Kia ora, Auntie.
- Henry: Tucker.

184
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,847
Flash threads, bro.
So you a model now or something?

185
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,881
I'm doing I.T.
Internet stuff.

186
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,155
Oh. Nude modeling.

187
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,890
And you're manager now?

188
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,922
Well, your brother's hardly young
farmer of the year, is he?

189
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,161
Angus seems to think he's
got a handle on things.

190
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,830
The only thing he's
got a handle on is his...

191
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,042
Okay, farm boy,
let's see your stuff.

192
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,278
Sure.

193
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,219
Okay.

194
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,482
Come on.

195
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,424
Yah!

196
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,863
What happened to you,
darling?

197
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,070
Give us a hand, bro!

198
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,340
L... I just need
to make a phone call.

199
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,710
Jesus, man.

200
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,738
Just gonna shove her
back over the fence.

201
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,856
Hey!

202
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,659
- Tucker: Hands up?
- Hands up!

203
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,576
It's okay.
It's okay.

204
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,778
I'll protect you.

205
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,453
Girl:
Grant!

206
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,092
Grant?

207
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,208
Is this gonna take long?
Because I've got a taxi waiting.

208
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,938
If you fascists
have hurt him,

209
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,913
I will organize the biggest
sit-in this farm has ever seen.

210
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,148
Look, we don't know
where your friend is, okay?

211
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,916
- Maybe my brother could help?
- Brother?

212
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,617
Angus Oldfield.

213
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,250
I should have known
you were an Oldfield.

214
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,885
I can see it
in your aura.

215
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,157
I think that was just something
he stepped in back there, eh?

216
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,596
- No, you have a very selfish aura.
- What?

217
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,862
How would you like a taste
of what you're dishing out?

218
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,994
Safety's on.

219
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,471
- What?
- The safety's on.

220
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,303
Just...

221
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,831
yeah, on the other side.

222
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,969
Back a bit.

223
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,842
And down.

224
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,745
Back and down.
Up.

225
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,751
Here here, here.

226
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,010
Yeah.

227
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,489
There we go, here.

228
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,685
Yeah, right.

229
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:55,030
...they were like,
looking around at us and...

230
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,519
What about me?

231
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,056
Can we give you
a ride somewhere?

232
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,150
Maybe to the car
so I can, um...

233
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:16,922
Tucker:
Organize your sit-in?

234
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,659
Wait for my...
for Grant.

235
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,224
I'm Henry, this is Tucker.
What's your name?

236
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,135
- Experience.
- Has been so far.

237
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,204
So why were you
going to shoot me, Experience?

238
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,709
Because this farm subjects
innocent animals

239
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,041
to cruel and sadistic
torture. Because...

240
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,912
Smoke.

241
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,797
- You coming?
- Um...

242
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,344
Mike?

243
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,910
Mike!

244
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,457
Oh my God.

245
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,160
What?

246
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:34,832
The feng shui
in this room is terrible.

247
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,538
Anyone there?

248
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,343
Mike?

249
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,791
Oh God.

250
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:14,370
Jesus, man,
it's not gonna bite.

251
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:17,142
- What's it doing?
- What is wrong with you?

252
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:21,118
- Ovinophobia, my therapist calls it.
- What's that?

253
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,211
Just a completely
unfounded and irrational fear

254
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,450
that one day
this is gonna happen!

255
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,289
Well, this happens when
you run the most reckless

256
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,454
genetic engineering program
in the southern hemisphere.

257
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,464
- Who engineered that?
- Your brother.

258
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:45,471
Mike.

259
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,949
Come on then,
muttonchops!

260
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,483
Bugger me.

261
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,228
Shoot it again!

262
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,767
That'll give you something
to talk to your therapist about.

263
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:20,266
Experience:
Oh, I'm going to be sick!

264
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,256
Oh shit.

265
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,290
Oh shit.

266
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,131
Kia ora.

267
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,901
Kia ora, kia ora.

268
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,101
Rattle your dags,
Henry!

269
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,679
There we go.

270
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,481
Good girls.

271
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:04,815
They're fine.

272
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,120
Tucker:
You get Henry. I'll start the car.

273
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,860
God, your chi
is in shambles.

274
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,559
Huh?

275
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,864
Take a deep breath.

276
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,367
You need
to ground yourself.

277
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,468
You're a tree.

278
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,341
Come on.

279
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,374
A tree.

280
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,184
Your taproot extends
down into the earth.

281
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,747
My... my what?

282
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,418
That's your base
chakra.

283
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,122
Feel the energy drawing
out of the soil.

284
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,896
Can you feel it?

285
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,494
Yeah.

286
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,368
- Really?
- Yeah.

287
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,239
Come on, Henry.

288
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,607
The energy flows up

289
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,941
into your navel chakra,

290
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,072
your solar plexus
chakra,

291
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:05,309
into your heart chakra.

292
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,910
It spreads
to your branches,

293
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,648
your twigs, your leaves.

294
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,884
You are a mighty kauri

295
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,755
commanding the forest.

296
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,559
Look with
your third eye.

297
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,292
Totally relaxed.

298
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,392
Totally relaxed.

299
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:27,769
Get on the fucking truck!

300
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,604
Nearly there, nearly there.

301
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,242
Go!
Go go go!

302
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,946
Watch out for the sheep!

303
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,819
Shoot!
Sorry.

304
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,151
What the hell's he doing?

305
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,642
Chainsaw.

306
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,621
Is it turned on?

307
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,024
- Prime it, prime it!
- What?

308
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,189
The pump thing.

309
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,005
Fuck!

310
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,282
Oi, Henry!

311
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,763
- Are you okay?
- If it weren't for my gumboot...

312
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,030
Who's driving?

313
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,564
- Jump!
- Both: What?

314
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,008
Jump off, now!

315
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,137
Jump off! Ah!

316
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,569
Oh, shit.

317
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,970
Experience:
Wow, what a beautiful view.

318
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,812
- This is, uh, where...
- I know.

319
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,286
This is what?

320
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,188
Ooh, long way down.

321
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,154
I wouldn't want
to fall off there.

322
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,424
This is where my father
fell to his death.

323
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,987
Oh.

324
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,794
Sorry...

325
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,824
to hear that.

326
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,463
Oh, a sheep!

327
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,495
Is that a good one
or a bad one?

328
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,002
Oh, definitely bad.

329
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,979
That's not funny.
Animal flatulence is responsible

330
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,209
for almost half the world's
greenhouse gas emissions.

331
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,718
It's pure methane.
The Kyoto Protocol...

332
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,380
Kyahhh!

333
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,351
What do we do?

334
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,360
Well, reducing carbon
emission from industries...

335
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,192
No, what do we do about
raising the alarm?

336
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,061
My phone...

337
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,067
is in the truck.

338
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,659
Tucker,
what do you think?

339
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,830
Hoof it for the house.
Tell his lordship what's going on.

340
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,396
Is it far?

341
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,068
It's rough terrain,
open paddocks, hot day, no cover.

342
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,407
Yeah, I'd say
it's pretty far.

343
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,742
With about 50,000 sheep
in between.

344
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,247
Then what?

345
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,308
Then I get as far
away from here as I can.

346
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,549
You're still leaving?

347
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,182
I'm especially leaving.

348
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:10,422
Experience: Oh, what if the sheep
get down there before us?

349
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,897
Then Angus is gonna have
some unexpected visitors.

350
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,194
Henry.

351
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,064
Well?

352
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,763
No sign of him.

353
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,739
The others have gone
out into the paddocks.

354
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,273
You cannot make a cup
of tea in this country

355
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,643
without some do-gooder starting
a petition to have you do it their way.

356
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,878
You help me in the lab.

357
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,579
And you,
get rid of that stuff.

358
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,517
Bloody animals.

359
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,090
You and your...
your bloody 4-wheel drives.

360
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,360
Think you own the road!

361
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,001
I do, actually.

362
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,200
Angus Oldfield.

363
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,176
What hole
did you crawl out of?

364
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,180
WEKA. The Whole Earth
Kollective Aotearoa.

365
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,007
I know all about
your Frankensheep!

366
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,714
Mother Nature spent millions
of years making sheep.

367
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,689
She doesn't need your help!

368
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:54,691
Don't talk to me
about nature.

369
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,716
Man made sheep
what they are today,

370
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,729
and I'm making them
what they'll be tomorrow.

371
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,663
If I was a sheep, I wouldn't
be anywhere near you!

372
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,826
If you were a sheep, I'd have you ground
up for dog food, you little worm.

373
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,893
Now get the fuck off my land.

374
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,133
Ahh!
