00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,093
-Cigar?
-I'II wait tiII we get out there.

2
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,461
-You ready to go?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

3
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,104
Where's your sister?

4
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:44,258
In the bathroom primping.
He thinks it's a fashion show.

5
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,981
Come on, whiIe we're stiII young.

6
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:50,341
You ever seen
such a head of hair?

7
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,014
Just get your ass moving, pretty boy.

8
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:58,096
Don't want to start the first
trip of the summer off with a cigar?

9
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:01,104
No wonder you have bad breath
and green teeth.

10
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,296
My teeth are not green, my man.

11
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,815
-They sure ain't white.
-Come on, Iadies.

12
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:08,864
Don't start the summer bickering.
Let's go.

13
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:12,262
Francis, your brother's right.
Your breath's disgusting.

14
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:14,296
What did I teII you, my man?

15
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm concerned, Mick.

16
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:50,415
Maybe it's time for you to get focused
on something. Maybe get a job.

17
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,019
Dad, I got a job.

18
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:54,864
That's no job,
it's an excuse to avoid reaIity.

19
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:59,054
Think about settIing down,
sink your teeth into something.

20
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,375
Something to give your Iife meaning.

21
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:04,699
Not to work on WaII Street
with this one, but. . .

22
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:09,424
. . .how about the fire department
or a cop? Something with benefits.

23
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:13,374
Here's how I see it. Ever since
the ''hairy ass'' incident. . .

24
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:17,658
. . .you've been out of the game,
you've been running away from Iife. . .

25
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,095
. . .instead of running towards it.

26
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:22,421
I think it's a good time, now. . .

27
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:26,783
. . .to turn around and start running
towards Iife again. You know?

28
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:29,340
Can I toss this asshoIe overboard?

29
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:31,621
Don't be that way. I want to heIp.

30
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,497
Shut up, Francis.

31
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:36,458
Your sis is right.
You need some stabiIity.

32
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:40,300
You know, Dad,
I don't need any stabiIity because. . .

33
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:42,462
. . .I'm happy right where I am.

34
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:47,176
Big deaI. You're happy.
You'II never make any reaI money.

35
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,616
So? You make a piIe of dough
and you're miserabIe.

36
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:52,298
What's that matter?

37
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:57,779
I'm not miserabIe. I'm dissatisfied.
That's what makes me a success.

38
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,694
Mickey, I meant to teII you something
since you been back.

39
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:06,501
You did right. Last thing you needed
was to get married.

40
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:08,457
EspeciaIIy to that one.

41
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:13,263
The one thing to remember is
this is your Iife. Not theirs.

42
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:16,298
You gotta do what makes you
happy first, okay?

43
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:20,778
Taxi!

44
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,662
Hey, what the heII?

45
00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:40,539
JFK, pIease.

46
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,263
Hey! How you doing?

47
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:57,460
I'm good. I'm good.

48
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:59,662
What about you? Where you. . .?

49
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,095
-Where are you fIying?
-New OrIeans.

50
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:03,420
For a vacation?

51
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:08,295
No, my best friend from high schooI's
getting married. It's funny.

52
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:09,654
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

53
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:12,983
Her sink was cIogged
so she caIIed a pIumber. . .

54
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:15,819
. . .and a reaIIy nice guy came over
to fix it.

55
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:19,461
And she ended up having sex with him
under the sink.

56
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,738
So she's gonna marry him.

57
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:24,413
Your best friend had sex
under the sink?

58
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:26,139
That's good to know.

59
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,103
What about you? Married?

60
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,935
Me? I was engaged once a coupIe
of years ago, but it didn't pan out.

61
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,413
What happened?

62
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:37,896
I came home earIy one night
to find her and a guy. . .

63
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:41,063
. . .passed out on my Iiving room fIoor.
Both naked.

64
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:43,415
Oh, God. Did you know the guy?

65
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:46,503
No. AII I saw was his hairy ass
staring at me.

66
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,299
I think he was a pIumber too,
actuaIIy.

67
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:51,103
What did you do?

68
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,819
Nothing, actuaIIy.
I Ieft the apartment. . .

69
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:58,416
. . .got in my car and spent the next
3 years driving around the country.

70
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,580
Do you have any regrets about it?

71
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,578
Yeah. Yeah, one.

72
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:07,823
I shouId've taken
my frigging TV when I Ieft.

73
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:18,536
-How Iong is the drive to New OrIeans?
-Like 23, 24 hours maybe.

74
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,218
How much wouId that cost?

75
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,497
You couId probabIy get
a cheap rentaI car here.

76
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:26,378
What if you drove me?
How much wouId that be?

77
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,695
What? If I drove you in my cab?

78
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:34,425
If I kept the meter running,
it'd cost you $ 70-80,000 maybe.

79
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:39,014
You couId come to my friend's wedding.
I can bring a date.

80
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,297
You want me to drive you
to New OrIeans in my cab?

81
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,065
Yeah. Come on, pIease?
It'II be fun.

82
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:48,940
I don't want to fIy. If I did
and I died, it's your fauIt.

83
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,022
You don't want that guiIt.

84
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:52,374
My fauIt?

85
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:56,102
TeII me why you're so afraid to fIy
and I might.

86
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,619
I don't Iike pIanes.

87
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,018
Hi, babe.

88
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:10,223
-You busy?
-A IittIe busy.

89
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:15,184
Too busy to maybe, I don't know,
do it tonight?

90
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,183
Do what, babe?

91
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:23,014
WeII, Francis, I can take off my
cIothes and you do whatever you Iike.

92
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:29,383
Renee, you know I gotta finish this.
A IittIe consideration, huh?

93
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:32,739
How about a IittIe
consideration for me?

94
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:37,542
You know, we haven't had sex
for a whiIe. You know?

95
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,694
AII right, Iisten.

96
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,615
If you're stiII up when
I finish this, we'II do it.

97
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:46,698
Don't do me any favors,
aII right, Romeo?

98
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:49,704
I can go into the bathroom
and use my vibrator.

99
00:08:50,305 --> 00:08:52,535
WouIdn't that be a IittIe difficuIt?

100
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,060
Seeing as you don't own a vibrator.

101
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,340
What's the big deaI with me
owning one?

102
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,259
No big deaI.

103
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:02,376
You just don't have one.

104
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:04,897
OccasionaIIy I need sex.

105
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,899
I'm married to a man
who doesn't Iike to have sex anymore.

106
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:13,218
So from time to time, I Iike
to pIeasure myseIf with a vibrator.

107
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:14,494
DeaI with it.

108
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:17,981
Excuse me, ''pIeasure yourseIf''?
That's rich.

109
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:21,894
And no, I'm not gonna deaI with it,
because you're my wife.

110
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,421
We have sex Iike normaI peopIe.
In a bed, Iying down.

111
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,300
We don't masturbate Iike animaIs
in bathrooms with vibrators.

112
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:34,499
You don't, I do. Wake up your Iibido,
or I'm in that bathroom in 5 minutes.

113
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:37,219
Hey, better yet, I couId go get it. . .

114
00:09:37,545 --> 00:09:39,740
. . .and we couId pIay with it together.

115
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,734
Very funny. Listen.
Let's get this straight, funny girI.

116
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:47,341
We do not have a vibrator
in this home.

117
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,539
Do we?

118
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:54,056
Yo, Franny! Francis!

119
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:56,581
Better go see who that is.

120
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,978
It's me, Mickey!

121
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:07,096
What the heII are you doing?

122
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,018
Hey, man, you won't beIieve this.

123
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:12,984
I got married.

124
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:15,176
Let us up
so you can meet my wife.

125
00:10:15,385 --> 00:10:16,579
What? Mickey!

126
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,776
CongratuIations!
When did it happen?

127
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,623
Let us up, I'II teII you.

128
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,424
HoId on a sec, Mick.

129
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:24,064
He wants to come up.

130
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:28,019
I heard. What's wrong? Let them up.
I'd Iike to meet her.

131
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:30,102
It's Iate. You're not thinking.

132
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:33,496
We're gIad you Iive a romantic Iife.
Both of us.

133
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:38,660
We got reaI jobs, responsibiIities.
Catch you tomorrow. CongratuIations!

134
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,817
Fuck you, you prick!
Come down and Iet us in.

135
00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:46,173
I'm Ietting you in, after you
don't invite me to your wedding?

136
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:50,583
Don't Iisten. Of course you can
come up. I'II send him down.

137
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,178
I'm Ietting him in
in the middIe of the night. . .

138
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:57,616
-. . .after he didn't invite me?
-You're sick.

139
00:10:57,985 --> 00:11:01,057
I'm sick? I'm not the one
with the vibrator, huh?

140
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:06,055
I find that thing, I maiI it to your
mother describing your perversions.

141
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:10,383
Go right ahead. Who do you think
got me the damn thing?

142
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,695
She knows my pain.

143
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:18,013
We had a great time
on the drive down. . .

144
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:22,662
. . .and I guess it was after we crossed
into Kentucky that we feII in Iove.

145
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,299
Mickey came to
my friend's wedding and. . .

146
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:30,061
. . .when we were dancing he said,
''It shouId've been us who got married. ''

147
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:34,417
I got the priest out of the bar,
puIIed him onto the dance fIoor. . .

148
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:38,217
. . .and he married us in the middIe
of the reception.

149
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:44,016
I want to get married Iike that.
Do you have any brothers I don't know?

150
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:48,383
Sorry, babe, just Princess Kitty here.
You're stuck with him.

151
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,660
That's it?

152
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:51,537
Is this true, Mick?

153
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,537
What can I say, man?
I'm about the Iove.

154
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,135
I had no idea you were
such an impetuous romantic.

155
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:02,064
That's a pretty impuIsive move
you puIIed.

156
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,057
When did you actuaIIy meet?

157
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,584
Wednesday.

158
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,260
Today's Saturday, okay, so. . .

159
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:11,138
. . .you were married
without a best man, when?

160
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,019
Thursday.

161
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:17,218
So you had a fuII 24 hours to get
to know each other.

162
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:21,054
I'm reIieved, aren't you?
I thought they'd rushed into this.

163
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,176
Watch yourseIf, Francis, okay?

164
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:27,344
Don't Iisten to him. He's as
impuIsive and romantic as a nun.

165
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,617
I'm wondering
why you actuaIIy didn't become one.

166
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,698
So am I.

167
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,703
You don't know your brother.

168
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:37,380
He's actuaIIy very romantic.

169
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:41,184
I don't think we need
to go there right now.

170
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,694
No, Iet's go there.
By aII means.

171
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:48,058
Mr. Romantic, Mr. Summer Breeze,
aII about the Iove.

172
00:12:48,265 --> 00:12:52,702
But what wouId I know? I'm just
the brother who wasn't the best man.

173
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,543
You'II have to get over this.

174
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:57,213
Nothing to get over, hon.
I'm thriIIed.

175
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,178
CongratuIations, romance is wonderfuI,
we Iove it.

176
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,535
Brightens the day. Just remember. . .

177
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:05,579
. . .it don't pay the rent. Okay?

178
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:09,055
Is he okay?

179
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,536
Yeah, he'II Iive.

180
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,579
It's right here.

181
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,014
This is the honeymoon suite, huh?

182
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:01,537
What's going on? Is she an iIIegaI?
Pregnant?

183
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:04,543
Maybe an iIIegaI.
She couId be from the isIands.

184
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,701
I was thinking the same thing.

185
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,576
I'm concerned for him, Francis.

186
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,057
-You think it'II Iast?
-No shot. You kidding me?

187
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:14,698
Poor kid.

188
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:17,383
Never used up here.

189
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:19,577
AIways used in here.

190
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,538
Just Iike your mother.

191
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:27,219
I can't beIieve he did it without me.

192
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:31,214
I shouId've been his best man.
He was my best man.

193
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:34,224
It's bad Iuck to have a wedding
without one.

194
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:37,019
Jesus, you're not crying, are you,
Francis?

195
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:41,816
I'm not interested in what they say.
I want you to do what you're toId.

196
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:45,222
When you have, caII me--
No. Have Ryan caII me.

197
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:49,696
I have Miss Davis on the phone.

198
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,379
Put her through.

199
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,334
Heather?

200
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:58,496
The office said you caIIed in sick.
I caIIed the apartment, nobody.

201
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,378
-You all right?
-I'm fine.

202
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:03,579
-How's work?
-Fine.

203
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,334
-Where are you?
-I'm at Papa 's.

204
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:09,064
Who the heII is Papa?

205
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,181
Come on, you know my friend Papa.

206
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:13,534
You mean Carl...

207
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,384
. . .the oId guy.
We agreed to caII him. . .

208
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,181
. . . ''CarI, the diaper-wearing
geriatric. '' Why are you there?

209
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:24,422
I sIept over here Iast night,
with him.

210
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,619
You mean you sIept with him, as in. . .

211
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:30,976
. . .had actuaI sexuaI intercourse
with this animaI?

212
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:33,699
-Amongst other things.
-That's not funny.

213
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,538
He's oIder than your father!

214
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:37,224
Francis, my father's dead.

215
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,336
My point exactIy, thanks.

216
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,895
This is very upsetting.

217
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,664
It's extremely important...

218
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:48,263
. . .that I see you now so I can
show you the error of your ways.

219
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,895
He'II be gone aII day Iong.

220
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:53,579
You couId come to his pIace
if you want.

221
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,182
I'm afraid I stiII have my pride,
darIing.

222
00:15:57,425 --> 00:16:00,019
I won't meet you
at this oId fucker's pIace.

223
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,184
I guess you won't
see me today then, wiII you?

224
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:09,699
Okay.

225
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,142
What's the address?

226
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,738
WeII, I hope that
cIeared things up for you.

227
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:23,294
What?

228
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,213
Excuse me.

229
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:30,054
Don't teII me sex with Grandpa
was better than with me.

230
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:33,063
You're not in competition with him,
Francis.

231
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,703
Besides, one wasn't better
than the other, just different.

232
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:40,341
They better damn weII be different.

233
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,577
He can't controI his bIadder
and wears diapers. . .

234
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:46,618
. . .and I'm a young staIIion
in my prime.

235
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,301
-How different?
-Just different.

236
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:53,537
-Forget I said anything.
-No, no. EIaborate.

237
00:16:53,905 --> 00:16:56,738
It might be enIightening
to understand how. . .

238
00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:00,223
. . .sex might be different
with a fossiI.

239
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,255
Okay, but don't get mad, aII right?

240
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,054
I faked my orgasm with you.

241
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:11,939
So?

242
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,216
I didn't have to with Papa.

243
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,699
I got you.

244
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:24,378
Don't be mad.
You wanted to know.

245
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:27,344
No, I reaIIy didn't.

246
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:30,344
Don't puII this jeaIous buIIshit
with me.

247
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:32,581
I can sIeep with whomever I want.

248
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,299
I'm not the one that's married.
You are.

249
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:38,744
You reaIIy had an orgasm?

250
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,218
Pardon my asking, Tom,
but how oId are you?

251
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,414
Sixty-eight.

252
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:51,535
I was wondering, more out of
curiosity than anything. . .

253
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:55,021
. . .if a guy your age. . .

254
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,024
. . .can stiII. . .

255
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:58,539
. . .have sex?

256
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:02,018
OnIy when the wife gives me the okay.

257
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:05,742
So you can stiII perform, then,
if she says so?

258
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:10,655
Sure! In fact, she says I'm better
now than when I was in my 20s.

259
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,024
Great.

260
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:16,577
That's terrific, Tom.

261
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:21,575
This apartment of ours,
how Iong have you Iived there?

262
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:24,015
AImost two years. Isn't it great?

263
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,938
It is. It's a IittIe smaII, though.

264
00:18:27,185 --> 00:18:29,380
-But it's cozy.
-Cozy.

265
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,219
It's funny, when I took a shower. . .

266
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,099
. . .there was no hot water.
I wasn't too cozy.

267
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:37,899
Oh, we never have
hot water on weekends.

268
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:39,339
ReaIIy?

269
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,503
There's a big hoIe
in the bathroom ceiIing.

270
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,493
This morning I had a nice view
up some guy's boxer shorts.

271
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:50,061
-It was nice.
-That's Jim. He's a good guy.

272
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:52,057
Jim's a good guy? Good.

273
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:55,775
If I'm gonna see his pecker every
morning he may as weII be.

274
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,101
I better go. This is where I work.

275
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:00,378
Yeah, right here?

276
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,615
It Iooks Iike it might get
a IittIe chiIIy in there. . .

277
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,061
. . .since you're practicaIIy naked.

278
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:10,695
I couId run home and get you
a nice big down jacket. . .

279
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:13,938
. . .or a sweat suit or something.
It might heIp.

280
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:17,581
I don't think so. I'II see you Iater.

281
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,220
-AII right. Take it easy.
-Bye.

282
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:23,700
Hey, babe, what's up?

283
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,380
-Was that him?
-Cute, huh?

284
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,705
I thought he kind of Iooked
Iike a jerk.

285
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:32,022
Thanks, Con, that's sweet.

286
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:34,659
No, I'm sorry.
I mean, he's probabIy. . .

287
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,983
. . .he's probabIy
a reaIIy, reaIIy nice guy.

288
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,379
I don't know.

289
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,575
-Did you have to marry him?
-AbsoIuteIy.

290
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:48,024
So you'II go to Paris with him
instead of me.

291
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:51,342
WeII, we reaIIy haven't
discussed that yet, but. . . .

292
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,896
It's good to be up-front and honest
at the start of the reIationship.

293
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:02,417
I've known him a week. I haven't toId
him my Iife story, aII right?

294
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:06,294
I understand.
It'II be interesting to see. . .

295
00:20:06,545 --> 00:20:10,379
. . .how a cabby from BrookIyn
feeIs about moving to Paris.

296
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:13,378
He'II probabIy be fine with it.
No big deaI.

297
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:15,416
He'II just move with you.

298
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:20,577
It'II never Iast. Nightmare
when they get to know each other.

299
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:24,620
Maybe they were made for each other.
Those things can happen.

300
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:28,022
CaroI and I met here
at the Beach CIub in 1 963.

301
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:29,937
-Right.
-A Friday morning.

302
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,215
By Saturday, I had her in the dunes.

303
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:36,179
Jesus, Ron! They don't want to hear
aII the detaiIs.

304
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:39,297
-Come on.
-We've been together ever since.

305
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:42,059
AII right! Enough about the dunes.

306
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,615
Franny, how's WaII Street?

307
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,543
-Things are good.
-Things are good?

308
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:50,744
Making haIf a miI a year at 25,
things are better than good.

309
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:54,935
Hate to spoiI the iIIusion,
but I don't make that much.

310
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:59,741
Do me a favor.
Don't buIIshit a buIIshitter, okay?

311
00:21:00,145 --> 00:21:04,024
Your favorite in-Iaw hasn't
had a nice inside tip in a whiIe.

312
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:07,342
When you gonna set me up
with one of your rich friends?

313
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:10,298
Excuse me, guys, my husband
has some ethics.

314
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:14,021
He's not some sort of
cheating sIeazebag. Right, babe?

315
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:18,457
-Don't you share the weaIth anymore?
-It's not aII he won't share.

316
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:23,136
-Mom, pIease?
-Getting greedy in your oId age, Fran?

317
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:27,896
It's nice to see you guys on weekends.
We shouId do it more often.

318
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,374
Honey!

319
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:33,374
Don't get sarcastic on us, young Iady.
We're your parents.

320
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:37,214
You're in no position to approve
or disapprove of us.

321
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:39,422
-Understand?
-He's right.

322
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:44,062
ReaIIy? My anaIyst wiII have a fieId
day with that bit of psychosis.

323
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:48,423
If you two Iunatics wiII excuse me,
I'm going to pIay tennis.

324
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:52,738
Her anaIyst?

325
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,299
Don't ask.

326
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,218
MacroCom.

327
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,024
I'II caII you Monday.

328
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:36,379
Hey, babe. Gotta go to work now.

329
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,855
Okay. You Iove me?

330
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,416
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

331
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:43,900
Good. Because I Iove you.

332
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:47,058
-Bye.
-AII right, take care.

333
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:57,739
Thanks a Iot.

334
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:04,535
75th and Madison, pIease.

335
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:15,182
75th and Madison,
that's a pretty swanky address.

336
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,098
Excuse me?

337
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:21,741
My God. Mickey?

338
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,300
What are you doing?

339
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:27,503
I'm in shock, is what I'm doing.
What are you doing?

340
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,582
I'm going home.

341
00:23:31,225 --> 00:23:33,056
What about you? How you been?

342
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,216
I been good.

343
00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:37,334
Good.

344
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:42,062
-Everything's aII right?
-Everything's fine.

345
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,493
What about you?

346
00:23:43,705 --> 00:23:46,697
Look Iike you're finaIIy
making some decent money.

347
00:23:46,945 --> 00:23:50,858
I'm stiII on WaII Street.
Making Iess money than I'd Iike.

348
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:54,057
WeII, you were never easy to pIease,
right?

349
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:57,139
So, you know, you married yet?

350
00:23:57,345 --> 00:24:00,178
No, he hasn't asked just yet.

351
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:01,500
ReaIIy?

352
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:05,414
Not that hairy ape who was
sprawIed out on my carpet, I hope.

353
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:08,896
No, not him.

354
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:13,018
I don't bIame you. From what
I saw, he wasn't too pretty.

355
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:15,181
A IittIe on the furry side.

356
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:18,101
Do I know the prospective husband?

357
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:23,064
No, I don't think so.
He and his friends have reaI jobs.

358
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,542
From anyone eIse,
I'd take that as an insuIt. . .

359
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:32,743
. . .but you forget that I know
how you put yourseIf through coIIege.

360
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:36,662
Somebody had to pay for my education,
sweetheart.

361
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:42,542
Had to bring that up, right?

362
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:46,223
Eye for an eye.

363
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:53,575
I've made up my mind.
I can't go through with this.

364
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:58,416
If you take the TV, it's onIy
fair that you give me back the watch.

365
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,855
It is the watch I gave you, right?

366
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:04,535
Yeah, it is, but Iike you said,
the watch was a gift. . .

367
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:06,337
. . .and the TV wasn't.

368
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,575
If I recaII correctIy. . .

369
00:25:09,785 --> 00:25:12,174
. . .I did pay for part of the TV.

370
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:15,224
It's not Iike you couId afford it
on your own.

371
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:21,537
You want the watch?
You can have the watch.

372
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:24,061
Doesn't mean much to me anyhow.

373
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:27,020
It's not the watch I want, Mickey.

374
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:31,423
Why don't we give that
a break aIready, okay?

375
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:36,381
A break? You're teIIing me that
you came here for the teIevision?

376
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:40,095
Yeah, I did.
Why do you think I came up here?

377
00:25:40,345 --> 00:25:42,381
You're so fuII of shit.

378
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:44,703
How do you figure that?

379
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:48,939
You can honestIy say that you don't
ever think of me anymore?

380
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,378
Sure, of course I think about you.

381
00:25:53,705 --> 00:25:56,583
I think, what couId've possibIy
possessed you. . .

382
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:59,424
. . .to take that dirtbag
home to my apartment?

383
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,254
Come on, Mickey.

384
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:06,019
We both knew
the reIationship was over.

385
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,181
I wanted a career and you wanted--

386
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:10,694
Who knows?
Did you ever figure it out?

387
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,902
As a matter of fact, I did.

388
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:16,217
That's right. Your brother toId me.

389
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,744
You got married.

390
00:26:20,585 --> 00:26:24,498
What do you mean, my brother?
Since when do you speak to Francis?

391
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:28,897
He and his friends have reaI jobs,
so occasionaIIy I run into him.

392
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:35,340
Yeah, it's a shame he's married. You
two probabIy wouId have hit it off.

393
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:37,018
Maybe.

394
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:42,340
I'm sorry you found out the way you
did. I'd Iike to have been friends.

395
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:44,896
Friends, reaIIy, yeah?

396
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,182
I don't think that wouId've worked.

397
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:53,061
I keep the number of friends who
Iie and cheat to me to a minimum.

398
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:56,019
Put your sanctimonious
buIIshit to rest.

399
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,340
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:57,545 --> 00:27:02,255
I guess my behaving Iike a decent
human being rubs you the wrong way.

401
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:04,263
Look where it's gotten you.

402
00:27:04,465 --> 00:27:07,741
You're the onIy EngIish-speaking
cabdriver in New York.

403
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:10,096
That shouId teII you something.

404
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,058
You know what, Heather?

405
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,984
I imagine it beats sucking dick
for a Iiving.

406
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:25,342
Depends on whose dick it is.

407
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:36,703
-Hey, Jim.
-Hi, Mick.

408
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:40,182
-How you hanging?
-Hanging fine, thanks, Mick.

409
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,024
Hey, babe.

410
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:00,496
It's hot in here.
What happened?

411
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:03,538
I know, we Iost our eIectricity again.

412
00:28:03,745 --> 00:28:07,260
ReaIIy, again? I reaIIy Iove
this pIace. It's great.

413
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:09,655
Grab a beer if you want to cooI off.

414
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,659
I don't mean to point out
the obvious. . .

415
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:17,536
. . .but usuaIIy the fridge doesn't work
if there's no eIectricity.

416
00:28:20,385 --> 00:28:21,704
-How is it?
-It's good.

417
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:24,374
Good. It has a nice
warm piss quaIity.

418
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:26,542
You're in a good mood, huh?

419
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:28,737
So, what's with the TV?

420
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:31,653
You Iike it?
I figured we needed a TV.

421
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:34,619
Yeah, it's fine,
but where'd you get it?

422
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:39,218
You know, it's funny you shouId ask.
I picked up. . .

423
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:42,098
. . .Heather in my cab today.

424
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,017
I toId you she had the TV. . .

425
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:46,614
. . .so I toId her I wanted my TV back.

426
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:49,579
Oh, reaIIy? Then what happened?

427
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,740
I went to her apartment,
got the TV and I carried it out.

428
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,505
You were in your
ex-fiancée's apartment?

429
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:58,821
How was that? Was it fun?

430
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:00,744
What are you doing?

431
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:04,058
I went up there for the TV, that's it.

432
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:06,381
-What, are you mad at me?
-No.

433
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:11,022
Come on, Hope, aII right?
I mean, enough.

434
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:16,736
This is one thing
you don't have to worry about.

435
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:22,536
Yeah, I know.

436
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:27,217
I'm aIIowed to get jeaIous sometimes,
aren't I?

437
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:28,733
No, I'm a good guy.

438
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:32,222
Yeah, I've heard
that song and dance before.

439
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:36,694
Does she have a nicer apartment
than us?

440
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:38,380
WeII, you know. . .

441
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:41,737
. . .she's got eIectricity,
so that's kind of nice.

442
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:43,219
I'm jeaIous of them.

443
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:46,736
Don't be. He's a cabdriver,
she's a waitress. . .

444
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:50,103
. . .they have a 4th-fIoor waIkup
with no eIectricity.

445
00:29:50,345 --> 00:29:53,064
But see how they're aIways
aII over one another?

446
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:56,621
I bet they have sex aII the time.
Does he taIk about it?

447
00:29:56,985 --> 00:30:01,376
Granted, he's my brother, but I don't
ask how often he's having sex.

448
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:06,062
What kind of numbers are we taIking?
Five, six, seven times a day?

449
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,535
I'm not teIIing you anything, okay?

450
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:10,737
Bet it's a Iot.

451
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:14,063
Remember how much we did it
when we got married?

452
00:30:14,305 --> 00:30:18,423
Yeah, sure. But honey, everyone's
Iike that when they first meet.

453
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:21,173
Then you get into a groove, sIow down.

454
00:30:21,385 --> 00:30:25,617
You couIdn't keep up that intensity
a Iong time. You'd hurt yourseIf.

455
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,743
That's why your back's fucked up.

456
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:31,182
Been doing it
around the cIock? Right?

457
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:35,504
What kind of degenerate are you?
You're taIking about my wife.

458
00:30:35,745 --> 00:30:38,054
We have a probIem with our sex Iife.

459
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:42,093
UnIike those two animaIs,
we have reaI responsibiIities.

460
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:45,382
We don't have aII day
to rub up against each other.

461
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:48,702
I can't remember the Iast time
I saw your penis.

462
00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:54,304
Excuse me! What kind of Ianguage
is that? This is a pubIic street.

463
00:30:54,905 --> 00:30:57,373
We shouId get
some sex-improvement tapes.

464
00:30:57,625 --> 00:31:01,061
Or I couId get some stuff
from Victoria's Secret.

465
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:04,496
Stop taIking about this,
because you're depressing me.

466
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,377
I toId you it's. . .

467
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:09,225
. . .it's a down cycIe, that's aII.

468
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:13,175
What? You're not famiIiar
with the ''down cycIe''?

469
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:17,379
No. What, exactIy, is a ''down cycIe''?

470
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:21,220
You know, in a reIationship
you got ups, downs. . .

471
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:24,582
. . .sometimes you do it a Iot,
Iike you do. . .

472
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:27,539
. . .other times, not at aII.

473
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:31,341
Ups and downs and. . . .
The down cycIe.

474
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:33,904
I feeI for you, man.

475
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:37,336
You're a sick individuaI
and you need heIp.

476
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,504
We shouId discuss our
apartment situation.

477
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:44,334
-You don't Iike our apartment?
-It's not that at aII.

478
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:47,702
I Iike that we don't have
eIectricity or hot water.

479
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,339
I Iove the pink waIIs.
I just think. . .

480
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:53,503
. . .maybe it's too smaII
for two peopIe.

481
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:58,779
We'II onIy be there another month
and then we might move to Paris.

482
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:04,343
What do you mean, ''we might move to
Paris''? Why wouId we move to Paris?

483
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:08,294
-I might go to schooI there this faII.
-Paris, France?

484
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:11,139
-Yeah.
-Where they hate Americans?

485
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:14,502
That's not true.
They don't Iike stupid Americans.

486
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:17,617
UnfortunateIy, I faII
into that category.

487
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:21,938
When do we find out? It's an
important deveIopment in our Iife.

488
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:24,096
I shouId find out this week.

489
00:32:24,305 --> 00:32:28,901
ReaIIy? Great. Terrific.
Thanks for Ietting me in on this.

490
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:30,339
I appreciate it.

491
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:35,784
Maybe your brother's right.
It's time for you to run towards Iife.

492
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:41,734
Is this what your wife had in mind?

493
00:32:41,985 --> 00:32:44,943
Don't joke about that.
She's stiII my wife.

494
00:32:45,185 --> 00:32:50,100
-SuddenIy he's got a conscience.
-It's time we discussed our future.

495
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,615
Do you think she'd Iike this?

496
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:54,856
I'm serious about this.

497
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:59,901
-Where's this reIationship going?
-ObviousIy, it's not going anywhere.

498
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:04,098
You don't get it. This reIationship
has to reach the next IeveI.

499
00:33:04,345 --> 00:33:07,178
We, as a coupIe,
have to decide that IeveI.

500
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,296
Why the sudden urgency?

501
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:12,537
WeII, for one thing,
I don't Iike the fact. . .

502
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:15,299
. . .that you have sex with a geriatric.

503
00:33:15,505 --> 00:33:18,497
WeII, how do you think I feeI
about your wife?

504
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:23,825
-I haven't had sex with her in months.
-I don't know if that's a good idea.

505
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:26,135
CIearIy, you need the practice.

506
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:30,344
Francis, if you're afraid
to ask for a divorce. . .

507
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:33,343
. . .just have sex with her
in the meantime.

508
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:38,784
Dad, I'm in Iove with another woman.
It'd be unfair to have sex with Renee.

509
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,698
Let me get this straight.

510
00:33:40,905 --> 00:33:44,102
You won't cheat on your girIfriend
with your wife?

511
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,694
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Jesus Christ.

512
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:52,302
You sure I'm your father? I have to
doubIe check with your mother.

513
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,541
Come on, Dad. I'm serious.

514
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,941
-How wiII Mom take it?
-She's gonna be devastated.

515
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:03,978
She prays at church every day
for your brother.

516
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:08,895
She says I spend too much time on
the boat. I won't even get into that.

517
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,824
Now you're gonna get divorced.
Christ!

518
00:34:12,065 --> 00:34:16,024
She'II be with Father John
24 hours a day. Thanks a Iot.

519
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:18,904
I'II have to make my own
breakfast again.

520
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:25,095
I'm sorry if my divorce interferes
with your breakfast pIans, Dad.

521
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:28,695
Hey, don't get aII sensitive
on me now, Barbara.

522
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:33,537
AII your Iife you wanted to screw
every skirt who waIked by.

523
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:37,494
Making aII this money,
you find you can get haIf of them.

524
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:39,343
Come on, Dad.

525
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:41,940
What have you toId me
my whoIe Iife?

526
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:45,495
I gotta do what makes me
happy first, right?

527
00:34:49,985 --> 00:34:53,102
Besides, it's normaI
maIe behavior, right?

528
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:56,741
We can't controI miIIions of years
of evoIution.

529
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:03,022
You know what it's Iike, reaIIy?

530
00:35:03,265 --> 00:35:07,497
It's Iike you've been driving
a '7 4 Buick your whoIe Iife. . .

531
00:35:08,545 --> 00:35:12,697
. . .then suddenIy you're behind
the wheeI of a brand-new Porsche.

532
00:35:14,265 --> 00:35:16,301
How do you go back to the Buick?

533
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:18,294
Yeah.

534
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:21,496
I guess you can't.

535
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:27,895
You know what, Dad?

536
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:31,695
I'm reaIIy doing this for Renee.

537
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,904
I'm sure she'II be reaIIy thriIIed.

538
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:41,898
Thank you.

539
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,903
Happy anniversary!

540
00:35:47,585 --> 00:35:49,337
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

541
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:50,938
They were fun, weren't they?

542
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:54,621
They were a Iot of fun.
They were aIso a $ 1 2 fare.

543
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:56,537
It was their anniversary.

544
00:35:56,785 --> 00:36:01,905
But they can afford 1 2 bucks, whereas
we, on the other hand, cannot.

545
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:05,137
-I'II pay the $ 1 2, Mr. Cheapo.
-Oh, reaIIy?

546
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:07,535
You have it on you, by any chance?

547
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:10,936
No, not right now.
I'II give it to you Iater.

548
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:14,894
Great. Listen, do me a favor.
Not to sound Iike a jerk. . .

549
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:18,336
. . .but if you want to work with me,
remind me to say no.

550
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,621
And I thought you were a romantic.

551
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:26,064
I am a romantic. As Iong as it
doesn't interfere with paying rent.

552
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:31,540
I'd rather Iive in the back seat than
Iet rent interfere with our romance.

553
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:34,015
What do you have to say to that?

554
00:36:35,785 --> 00:36:39,698
-When you're right, you're right.
-Jerk.

555
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:45,060
Speaking of back seats, I know a pIace
where we can park and maybe. . .

556
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:48,257
-. . .test your back-seat theory.
-Yeah?

557
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,137
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

558
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:53,223
Oh, my God!

559
00:36:56,985 --> 00:37:00,102
She's been with her sister.
I couIdn't do it.

560
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:03,300
HoId on, I think this is her.

561
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,742
Shit. Listen, I'II caII you Iater.

562
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:11,135
Hi, honey. Who was that?

563
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:16,260
-Bob what's-his-face from work.
-You've taIked to him a Iot IateIy.

564
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:19,901
Your Scott from coIIege
taIked to my friend NicoIe.

565
00:37:20,145 --> 00:37:21,897
You know her sister, Patti?

566
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:25,137
She went to B.U. with
Scott's brother, David.

567
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:28,855
He toId her that his divorce
was just finaIized.

568
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:32,579
Who got divorced?

569
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:34,099
Scott Sherman.

570
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:37,775
He caught his wife
boning her dentist in the shower.

571
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,936
''Boning''? That's charming.

572
00:37:40,185 --> 00:37:44,417
Oh, this is ''Fatso. ''
Four-eyed, greasy-haired Scott.

573
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:47,054
Computer geek tapping on the keyboard?

574
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,937
He was not that fat.

575
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:52,894
He was a 300-pound sack of shit, hon.

576
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:57,018
Maybe to you that's not fat,
but heII, you Ioved the animaI.

577
00:37:57,265 --> 00:38:02,783
That's reaIIy nice. He was not 300
pounds. SIightIy overweight, right?

578
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:05,744
Renee, his tits were bigger
than mine.

579
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:08,095
AII right, so he wasn't so skinny. . .

580
00:38:08,345 --> 00:38:11,894
. . .but he was a very smart,
reaIIy sweet guy. . .

581
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:15,302
. . .which is more than I can say
for the two of you.

582
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:17,894
You better be sweet to weigh 500.

583
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,820
What is your probIem with Scott?

584
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:25,422
Just a shy, harmIess guy.
Do you have to compete with everybody?

585
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:28,259
If he's such a fucking sweetheart. . .

586
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:31,457
. . .and I'm a creep, why didn't
you marry the pig?

587
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:35,618
If I'd known you'd be such an asshoIe,
maybe I wouId have.

588
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:38,134
Guess who's got his phone number?

589
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:43,260
You? You have Scott's number?
You won't caII him.

590
00:38:43,505 --> 00:38:47,214
Of course I am. You're the onIy one
who can marry rich?

591
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:49,979
I need someone to pay
my Bergdorf biIIs too.

592
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:53,501
Where are you from?
No! You're my sister!

593
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:56,265
There's an honor code
between sibIings.

594
00:38:56,465 --> 00:38:59,138
You don't date your sister's
ex-boyfriend.

595
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:04,733
Honey, Iet her go out with him.
What the fuck is the big deaI anyway?

596
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:07,863
UnIess you stiII have feeIings
for the yard ape.

597
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,699
No. It has nothing to do with that.

598
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:14,534
This has to do with respect,
that's aII. Respect.

599
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,061
A word the two of you
are not very famiIiar with.

600
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:24,621
Connie says we won't Iast a month.

601
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,902
-Why wouId she say that?
-She thinks you're a jerk.

602
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:29,942
I don't even know her.

603
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:34,701
-You haven't said yes to Paris yet.
-You haven't been accepted yet.

604
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:39,296
I aIso toId her about your brother,
your dad and the weird fishing trips.

605
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:44,295
Don't bash the fishing trips. It's
a tradition. Those trips are sacred.

606
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:47,463
Isn't it weird that your mom's
never on the boat?

607
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:50,384
My dad has a ruIe:
No women on the boat.

608
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:52,737
You don't think that's odd?

609
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:56,534
Yeah, but that's my dad.
He's from the oId schooI.

610
00:39:56,785 --> 00:39:59,504
Okay. So, what's Fran's excuse?

611
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:04,500
-You know, Franny's got some issues.
-Yeah, I'd say so.

612
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,702
Why are you getting me gifts?

613
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,214
-You don't have to.
-It was nothing.

614
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:14,299
-Do you Iike it?
-Yeah, of course. I Iove it.

615
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:17,258
Hey, what happened to the TV?

616
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,263
Your brother didn't teII you?

617
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,579
My brother? TeII me what?

618
00:40:23,825 --> 00:40:27,101
It was his TV.
He came up here and got it.

619
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:32,258
My bro--? Your ex-fiancé
was up in this apartment?

620
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:35,935
-When was this?
-I don't know. A few weeks ago.

621
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:40,178
-He picked me up in his cab.
-You didn't want to teII me?

622
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:43,940
Jesus! Since when do I
have to teII you anything?

623
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:48,940
Wait. So my brother came
into your bedroom. . .

624
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:51,938
. . .and took a TV. That's it?

625
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:55,182
I tried to get him in bed,
but he wasn't interested.

626
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:58,343
That's very funny.
You know he's married now.

627
00:40:58,545 --> 00:41:02,823
Picked up some psycho waitress
and married her in his cab. . .

628
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:06,461
-. . .or some shit Iike that.
-I know. You toId me.

629
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:10,101
Surprising move coming from Mickey,
don't you think?

630
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:14,300
Wish he'd had that impuIsiveness
when we were together.

631
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:17,343
What does that mean?

632
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:20,098
Nothing.

633
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,901
Fran! What are you doing here?

634
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:28,534
I can't come by
and see my big brother?

635
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:29,934
Sure. Come in.

636
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:34,899
Jesus Christ!
What a fucking dump.

637
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:38,263
Hey, I Iike the pink waIIs, though.

638
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:41,457
FinaIIy comfortabIe with
that part of yourseIf?

639
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:46,819
You can't just come in and keep
your mouth shut, right, moneybags?

640
00:41:47,065 --> 00:41:50,944
I'm sorry.
I forgot Mr. Summer Breeze is so. . .

641
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:55,736
. . .sensitivo. Hey, I Iike the TV.

642
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:59,534
How'd you swing that one?
I thought you two were broke.

643
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:02,737
Yeah, we stiII are, but. . . .

644
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:05,943
You won't beIieve this.
I picked up Heather. . .

645
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:10,144
. . .in my cab. She said
she stiII had my oId TV.

646
00:42:10,385 --> 00:42:13,695
So I went up to her pIace and took it.

647
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:16,664
It was kind of strange
seeing her again.

648
00:42:16,905 --> 00:42:19,658
So you went back and took your TV?

649
00:42:20,545 --> 00:42:22,376
You see it there, don't you?

650
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,661
You didn't feeI Iike a Ioser?

651
00:42:25,265 --> 00:42:27,301
Why wouId I feeI Iike a Ioser?

652
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:33,740
Three years go by and you scurry
back for a TV. It's Iike. . .

653
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:37,660
. . .admitting you're a faiIure
and can't afford a new TV.

654
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,103
How do we have
the same bIood in our veins?

655
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:45,981
You think I care what Heather
thinks of me? Come on, Franny.

656
00:42:48,785 --> 00:42:50,616
So, did you fuck her?

657
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:53,984
Did I what?

658
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:58,424
Up in the apartment, did you
put it to her? You bang her?

659
00:42:58,665 --> 00:43:01,737
What do you think,
I'm some sort of degenerate?

660
00:43:01,985 --> 00:43:06,297
You think I'm an immoraI skeII
who cheats on his wife? Listen. . .

661
00:43:06,505 --> 00:43:08,177
. . .I don't cheat on my wife.

662
00:43:08,425 --> 00:43:11,064
Oh, so, you didn't fuck her?

663
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:14,456
It just dawned on me.
You haven't fuIIy evoIved yet.

664
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:18,015
Mick, come on, you aImost
married this woman. . .

665
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:22,895
. . .then you go up to be aIone
in her apartment to ''get a TV. ''

666
00:43:23,185 --> 00:43:24,823
I don't buy it.

667
00:43:25,945 --> 00:43:30,700
Do you want to hear that I had sex
with her? WouId that make you happy?

668
00:43:30,945 --> 00:43:32,901
AII right, yeah. I did her.

669
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:37,462
On the kitchen tabIe, the couch,
and on the TV. It was beautifuI.

670
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:40,737
-You'd be proud.
-PIay aII the games you want. . .

671
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,943
. . .but I'm a man.
I know what I know.

672
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:46,494
Oh, you know what you know.

673
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:50,184
Franny, I don't need this shit
from you.

674
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:53,377
I don't need you to come over
and bust my hump.

675
00:43:53,985 --> 00:43:57,864
Do me a favor and get
the heII out of here, okay?

676
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:02,021
Sure, I'II do you that favor.

677
00:44:02,865 --> 00:44:04,696
Don't hurry back, aII right?

678
00:44:07,065 --> 00:44:08,498
Fuck!

679
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:10,978
I'm sorry, Mick.

680
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:14,939
I feeI so guiIty about
this fucking divorce.

681
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,221
I shouIdn't feeI guiIty, right?

682
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,535
No, no, you shouIdn't.

683
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:24,575
You shouId feeI guiIty about fucking
that other woman the Iast six months.

684
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:28,019
You shouId feeI guiIty about that.

685
00:44:31,345 --> 00:44:36,214
Tom, if you were singIe, wouId you
date your brother's ex-girIfriend?

686
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,979
I don't have a brother,
Mr. Fitzpatrick.

687
00:44:39,225 --> 00:44:41,944
But if you did, is that off-Iimits?

688
00:44:42,185 --> 00:44:45,894
I'd have to say that onIy
the Iowest of the Iow. . .

689
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:49,455
. . .a reaI scumbag wouId date
his brother's ex.

690
00:44:49,705 --> 00:44:52,503
There's a code between sibIings.

691
00:44:54,185 --> 00:44:56,016
Thanks, Tom.

692
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:03,338
Thanks.

693
00:45:04,985 --> 00:45:06,703
She's beautifuI, isn't she?

694
00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:10,062
Yeah. Yeah, she reaIIy is.

695
00:45:10,265 --> 00:45:12,620
She got her acceptance Ietter today.

696
00:45:12,865 --> 00:45:14,662
Yeah, I know she got accepted.

697
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:20,294
You better go with her to Paris.
You broke my heart. . .

698
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:25,420
. . .when you swept her off her feet.
I won't Iet any man hurt her again.

699
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:30,224
How did I manage to break your heart?
I met you 5 minutes ago.

700
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:33,696
My heart beIongs to Hope.
I Iove her.

701
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:36,694
-You Iove her?
-Yeah.

702
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:40,536
Do you have some sort of
speciaI reIationship. . .

703
00:45:40,785 --> 00:45:44,573
. . .I shouId be aware of,
seeing as I'm married to her?

704
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:49,742
-She didn't teII you about that?
-No. She forgot to mention it.

705
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:55,184
Oh, no, nothing Iike that.
Nothing sexuaI or anything.

706
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:57,222
Good. That's a good thing.

707
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:03,057
But, who knows? I mean, maybe one
day, if I'm Iucky. . .

708
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:05,699
. . .you'II Iet me share her with you.

709
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:20,818
Yeah. Your friend, Connie, here,
she cIaims you guys. . .

710
00:46:21,065 --> 00:46:25,024
. . .have some speciaI reIationship
or something.

711
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:29,497
-Did she ask if you'd share me?
-Yeah, she asked about that.

712
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,576
What do you think of that?

713
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:37,024
WeII, to be perfectIy honest,
the idea of two women at once. . .

714
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:40,337
. . .seems Iike a pIeasant way
to spend an evening.

715
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:43,533
But not if one of the girIs
is my wife.

716
00:46:43,785 --> 00:46:48,063
And I don't want to do it
with anyone eIse, so, yeah. No.

717
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,865
You better not do it
with anyone eIse.

718
00:46:51,105 --> 00:46:53,903
But you and her,
you guys actuaIIy never. . .

719
00:46:54,305 --> 00:46:58,014
. . .consummated, you know,
this Iove that she speaks of?

720
00:46:58,225 --> 00:46:59,499
No.

721
00:46:59,745 --> 00:47:02,498
It does paint a pretty mentaI picture.

722
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:06,983
I hear it's very popuIar in Paris.
Ménage a trois, it's French?

723
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:10,297
Yeah. Don't get too smart
there, funny man.

724
00:47:10,545 --> 00:47:12,501
So, you gonna come?

725
00:47:13,385 --> 00:47:15,296
To Paris?

726
00:47:15,545 --> 00:47:19,333
I don't know. You're serious about
going through with this?

727
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:20,774
Yep.

728
00:47:21,025 --> 00:47:24,415
Yeah, weII, then I guess
I gotta go, right?

729
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:26,978
I guess so.

730
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:36,338
So you're reaIIy gonna move to Paris?

731
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:39,338
-Yeah, I guess it Iooks that way.
-Wow!

732
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:42,503
Bet you didn't count on that
when you met her.

733
00:47:42,705 --> 00:47:47,904
I don't know, Fran. I'm starting to
feeI confused about this thing.

734
00:47:48,585 --> 00:47:49,938
Are you kidding me?

735
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:53,222
You know, it's Iike I don't even
know this girI.

736
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:56,901
She's got weird friends,
she Ioves the dump we Iive in. . .

737
00:47:57,105 --> 00:48:00,700
. . .and suddenIy she brings up
this moving-to-Paris thing.

738
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:04,898
You remember our discussion about
when I went to Heather's?

739
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:06,100
Yeah.

740
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:10,944
That's got me freaked out too.
Part of me wanted to hate her. . .

741
00:48:11,185 --> 00:48:13,301
. . .and part of me wanted to. . . .

742
00:48:13,985 --> 00:48:17,102
There was a weird connection.
We aImost got married.

743
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:21,537
Mick, come cIean. You fucked her.

744
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:23,013
Don't start, okay?

745
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:26,621
You're taIking about a weird
connection here.

746
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:30,494
-You stiII in Iove with her?
-It's nothing Iike that.

747
00:48:31,665 --> 00:48:34,941
But what? Did she say
she's in Iove with you?

748
00:48:35,185 --> 00:48:39,303
No, it was just weird seeing
her again, that's aII.

749
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:42,343
But it was nothing. Forget I said it.

750
00:48:44,865 --> 00:48:46,742
Yeah, I can meet you there.

751
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:49,698
46th and 8th. AII right.

752
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:56,947
Nice spot you picked here.

753
00:48:57,196 --> 00:48:59,835
Yeah, you know, I figured it was safe.

754
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:02,504
Don't fIatter yourseIf.
I'm here to taIk.

755
00:49:04,636 --> 00:49:06,354
Why don't we taIk?

756
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:11,989
I was thinking of how I
treated you a few weeks ago. . .

757
00:49:12,196 --> 00:49:16,951
. . .and I just wanted to apoIogize
for that, and for that night.

758
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:21,905
Yeah, weII, it was a Iong
time ago, right?

759
00:49:22,156 --> 00:49:23,430
It happens.

760
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,346
So, you think we can be friends?

761
00:49:28,276 --> 00:49:30,585
Yeah, sure, we can be friends.

762
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:34,345
And I'm sorry too, about
bringing up the whoIe. . .

763
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,952
. . .coIIege-tuition-payment-pIan thing,
you know?

764
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:42,710
It's sort of fun seeing one another
again, don't you think?

765
00:49:43,636 --> 00:49:46,673
I mean, I don't know
if I'd caII it fun. . .

766
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:49,146
. . .but it's certainIy interesting.

767
00:49:51,716 --> 00:49:55,868
I've been thinking a Iot about you
since you came up that day.

768
00:49:56,116 --> 00:50:02,066
I don't know. I was thinking maybe
things couId have been different.

769
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:05,114
-Maybe we made a mistake.
-We?

770
00:50:06,396 --> 00:50:10,753
I just came home to find you and
goriIIa boy in your birthday suits.

771
00:50:10,996 --> 00:50:15,274
Okay, so I made the mistake.
Did you have to run off Iike that?

772
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:17,666
-Never to be heard from again?
-Yeah.

773
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,635
What'd you expect me to do,
join the party?

774
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:22,025
No.

775
00:50:23,996 --> 00:50:27,113
I don't know.
Maybe give it another chance?

776
00:50:27,796 --> 00:50:30,754
And break up this beautifuI
new friendship?

777
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,832
I'm not about to do that.

778
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:36,228
Besides, you know, I'm. . . .

779
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:40,753
I'm married now.
You know? So. . . .

780
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,752
I'm gonna get out of here.

781
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,031
Bye.

782
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,867
Your mom said he gives you
that ''down cycIe'' nonsense.

783
00:51:00,116 --> 00:51:04,746
In 32 years of marriage, we've not hit
a down day, Iet aIone a down cycIe.

784
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:08,466
-Mom, make him go away.
-ReaIIy, that is disgusting.

785
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:12,470
-What's disgusting? That's true Iove.
-PIease, spare us.

786
00:51:12,716 --> 00:51:14,832
Fine. I know when I'm not wanted.

787
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:19,473
Good. And couId we not taIk about
my sex Iife anymore?

788
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,628
Excuse me, but pIaying
with a vibrator. . .

789
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:25,071
. . .does not quaIify as a sex Iife.

790
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:28,353
-Why does she know that?
-She's your sister.

791
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:31,747
Honey, maybe you shouId take him
to see a doctor.

792
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:33,827
No, it couId be physicaI.

793
00:51:34,036 --> 00:51:37,233
-Maybe he has a probIem with his--
-What kind of probIem?

794
00:51:37,476 --> 00:51:41,025
-You know, getting an erection.
-Mom, I'm warning you.

795
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:44,433
-It's possibIe.
-Maybe he's gay.

796
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:48,350
Francis is not gay.

797
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:51,865
-MoIIy's right.
-He couId be.

798
00:51:52,116 --> 00:51:54,471
He's aIways been a bit of a dandy.

799
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:57,276
It's my husband we're
taIking about, okay?

800
00:51:57,516 --> 00:52:02,465
Listen, honey. Get that Victoria's
Secret stuff. It worked for us.

801
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:05,594
If he doesn't want you then,
maybe he is gay.

802
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:09,550
Dad, Iook, okay?
My husband is not a homosexuaI.

803
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:12,230
But he's definiteIy under suspicion.

804
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:15,436
What do you mean, ''under suspicion''?

805
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:18,827
No, this is just a stage.

806
00:53:35,996 --> 00:53:40,035
I Iooked pretty good in that thing,
and he bareIy Iooked at me.

807
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:43,069
What did I teII you?
He's definiteIy queer.

808
00:53:43,276 --> 00:53:46,234
You know, I think you might be right.

809
00:53:46,596 --> 00:53:50,191
CaII his father and teII him.
He'II get it out of him.

810
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:54,873
-So, are you?
-Dad, I'm in Iove with another woman.

811
00:53:55,076 --> 00:53:57,192
How couId you say that to me?

812
00:53:57,396 --> 00:54:01,867
I'm just teIIing you I'm okay with it.
If you are or you aren't.

813
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:04,431
It's okay.
I'II aIways Iove you.

814
00:54:04,636 --> 00:54:06,672
Thanks, Dad, but I'm not gay.

815
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:09,430
-What do you think?
-HeII, I don't know.

816
00:54:09,676 --> 00:54:13,555
Renee's story sure sounds Iike he
couId be. He says he isn't.

817
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:16,151
You kids are nuts.
I wouIdn't be surprised.

818
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:20,275
Don't worry. If anybody wouId know,
I wouId. He's not gay.

819
00:54:20,516 --> 00:54:22,427
He wears coIogne, for chrissake.

820
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,950
Get out of here.

821
00:54:24,196 --> 00:54:28,712
Come on, you're prissy. You Iike
cooking, cIothing and furniture. . .

822
00:54:28,956 --> 00:54:31,424
. . .and you wear that frigging coIogne.

823
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:34,236
That's briIIiant. That makes me gay?

824
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:36,950
PeopIe might read you
as Iess than straight.

825
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:40,313
I'm your brother and I'II
aIways Iove you, sweet boy.

826
00:54:41,316 --> 00:54:43,876
HoId on a second, okay? Just stop.

827
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:45,868
Give me a minute here. . .

828
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,553
. . .and Iook at this maIeness.
How couId you possibIy think I'm gay?

829
00:54:50,796 --> 00:54:54,345
Because you don't Iook at me anymore,
Iet aIone touch me.

830
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:56,274
How many times do I have to--?

831
00:54:56,516 --> 00:55:01,988
Mention that ''down cycIe'' again and
I'II cut that maIeness right off.

832
00:55:02,196 --> 00:55:07,395
It's not naturaI to not want sex with
me at Ieast once in three months.

833
00:55:07,636 --> 00:55:10,833
Why is it my fauIt?
Maybe it's your fauIt.

834
00:55:11,076 --> 00:55:13,544
Excuse me?
How wouId this be my fauIt?

835
00:55:13,796 --> 00:55:18,995
I went and bought aII that Iingerie
crap and you didn't even Iook at me!

836
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:23,671
Was I not working that night?
Do you remember at aII?

837
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:28,068
Baby, maybe you've got a probIem.
Do you think you're impotent?

838
00:55:28,316 --> 00:55:31,035
What? No.

839
00:55:36,636 --> 00:55:39,469
Maybe you caught some disease
or something?

840
00:55:39,676 --> 00:55:42,634
Oh, yeah, that's it, babe. SyphiIis.

841
00:55:44,116 --> 00:55:45,868
Okay, Francis, Iook.

842
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:50,792
If you're homosexuaI, you can teII me.
I'II understand. I won't be mad.

843
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:53,590
But you gotta taIk to me.

844
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:57,667
WiII you cut it out with
the homosexuaI business?

845
00:55:57,916 --> 00:55:59,713
I skeeve out when you say it.

846
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:03,033
You want to know what's wrong?
I'II just say it.

847
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,914
PIease, I wouId.

848
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:12,232
I'm in Iove with someone eIse.

849
00:56:15,116 --> 00:56:17,027
I want a divorce.

850
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,229
What?

851
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:23,875
Since when?

852
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,827
Just a few months.

853
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:38,224
-Who is he?
-Enough with that, okay?

854
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:41,713
It's a she. She's a woman.

855
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,752
She's a beautifuI, inteIIigent,
sophisticated woman.

856
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:52,027
What does that make me?

857
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:59,075
I didn't mean it Iike that.
It wasn't a comparison. Don't cry.

858
00:56:59,316 --> 00:57:00,829
I'm not crying.

859
00:57:01,996 --> 00:57:03,429
I'm Ieaving.

860
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:12,433
He's not gay. He's seeing another
woman and he wants a divorce.

861
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:15,069
I need a cigarette.

862
00:57:18,276 --> 00:57:21,268
WeII, I guess you can
send her your vibrator.

863
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:23,029
She's gonna need it.

864
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:34,030
Your father scares me.
He doesn't Iike me.

865
00:57:34,236 --> 00:57:38,514
He Iikes you, okay? He toId me
how sweet he thinks you are.

866
00:57:38,756 --> 00:57:42,226
There's something I don't Iike.
She's kind of stuck-up.

867
00:57:42,476 --> 00:57:45,786
Not at aII. She's shy with
new peopIe, that's aII.

868
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:49,870
He got upset when I said I don't
taIk to my parents anymore.

869
00:57:50,116 --> 00:57:54,075
You're paranoid. He didn't speak
to his father for years.

870
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:58,468
-Who'd cut their parents off?
-She said they were reaIIy mean.

871
00:57:58,716 --> 00:58:03,915
My oId man was the meanest son of
a bitch, but I was there tiII he died.

872
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:06,272
He doesn't think I tricked you?

873
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:10,668
He thinks we're nuts, but said
as Iong as we're in Iove, who cares?

874
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:14,226
You don't care what anybody thinks.
You shouId hear them.

875
00:58:14,476 --> 00:58:15,465
Who?

876
00:58:15,716 --> 00:58:19,072
Your poor mother.
She thinks this girI's pregnant.

877
00:58:19,316 --> 00:58:23,628
I knew her 24 hours before we married.
I didn't have time for that.

878
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:26,868
We think she's an iIIegaI.
Wants a green card.

879
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:29,835
-ReaIIy? She's from Vermont.
-Vermont, my ass.

880
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:32,869
-Looks Iike she's from an isIand.
-Rhode IsIand.

881
00:58:33,116 --> 00:58:35,346
Don't get smart with me, wiseass.

882
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,235
Leave it to me.
I'II get to the bottom of it.

883
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:44,267
-Hey, Mr. DeIuca.
-Hey, Mickey. How are you, huh?

884
00:58:44,516 --> 00:58:45,471
Good.

885
00:58:45,716 --> 00:58:48,833
-Buying a driII for your dad?
-How'd you know?

886
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:52,955
Your mother toId me this morning.
She's a fine-Iooking woman.

887
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:58,586
-Who's a fine-Iooking woman?
-Your mother. Bellissima!

888
00:58:58,796 --> 00:59:03,267
Your father don't know how Iucky
he is. Me, I'm not so Iucky.

889
00:59:03,516 --> 00:59:06,633
My wife, 42 years of marriage. . .

890
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,628
. . .she has no Iove for me.

891
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:12,027
Ah, weII. That's for another time.

892
00:59:12,276 --> 00:59:14,073
How wiII you pay for this?

893
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:17,825
Just put it on the oId man's tab.
Take care of yourseIf.

894
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:19,674
-Fine.
-Nice to meet you.

895
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:21,065
Ciao, arrivederci.

896
00:59:21,316 --> 00:59:25,434
Mickey, say heIIo to your mother, huh?

897
00:59:46,636 --> 00:59:48,194
You're reaIIy a jackass.

898
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:51,633
-I had to teII her.
-At my birthday dinner!

899
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:55,272
She's off to see Father John.
She'II be gone three weeks.

900
00:59:55,516 --> 00:59:59,668
-My Iaundry wiII be on your doorstep.
-She didn't even Iike Renee.

901
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:03,664
In case you forgot, moron,
CathoIics don't get divorced.

902
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:08,228
-Just Iive unhappiIy and Iie.
-I don't care what you say out there.

903
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:11,229
But in my house,
you don't bash the Church.

904
01:00:17,996 --> 01:00:21,830
Why are you getting so upset?
You don't even beIieve in God.

905
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,345
Doesn't mean I'm not a good CathoIic.

906
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:35,226
Excuse me, Hope. I need a moment.

907
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:39,234
I'm gonna go taIk to him.

908
01:00:40,316 --> 01:00:42,068
That's not a good idea, Hope.

909
01:00:47,876 --> 01:00:49,434
Why bring up the divorce?

910
01:00:49,636 --> 01:00:53,914
Don't bIame me. She was compIaining
about his boat anyway.

911
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:58,032
He's 60 years oId.
She shouId Iet him be on the boat.

912
01:00:58,236 --> 01:01:01,433
What shouId Mom do?
Sit here and wait for him?

913
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:04,236
It's his Iife, Mick.

914
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:13,627
Are you okay?

915
01:01:15,796 --> 01:01:17,070
Yeah.

916
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:24,869
I'm sorry about that in there.

917
01:01:25,196 --> 01:01:28,427
Me and the missus haven't
been seeing eye to eye.

918
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:34,114
WeII, 34 years we've been together.
I guess things change.

919
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:42,474
Mickey teIIs me you kids
are moving to Paris.

920
01:01:42,716 --> 01:01:44,069
I'm going to the Sorbonne.

921
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:46,625
-How come?
-For my Ph.D.

922
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:51,953
Yeah, you Iook French. European.

923
01:01:55,116 --> 01:01:58,950
-Or maybe from one of the isIands.
-Oh, yeah? What isIands?

924
01:02:01,276 --> 01:02:02,948
Oh, I don't know.

925
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:06,350
-So where are you from?
-Vermont.

926
01:02:07,196 --> 01:02:09,949
-So you're an American citizen.
-Yeah.

927
01:02:12,636 --> 01:02:16,345
You know, it's funny,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick, my wife. . .

928
01:02:16,756 --> 01:02:21,466
. . .when she found out Mickey got
married, she was understandabIy upset.

929
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:26,346
She thought it might be a shotgun
wedding, since we'd never seen you.

930
01:02:30,636 --> 01:02:32,831
Anything you want to teII me?

931
01:02:34,636 --> 01:02:37,946
-No.
-If you're pregnant, that's fine.

932
01:02:38,196 --> 01:02:41,791
I aIways thought it'd be nice
to have a few grandkids.

933
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:46,951
Thought maybe Franny and Renee wouId
give me some, but it didn't work out.

934
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:52,751
-What about you?
-Thanks, but no, I'm not pregnant.

935
01:02:55,836 --> 01:02:59,954
-And you are an American citizen?
-The Iast time I checked.

936
01:03:00,596 --> 01:03:01,949
I thought so.

937
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:05,752
TeII me where you got it.

938
01:03:06,156 --> 01:03:08,147
-Why?
-Just teII me.

939
01:03:08,356 --> 01:03:12,269
-I toId you, it was a gift.
-I know. From who, though?

940
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:17,715
-What's the big deaI? It's a watch.
-It Iooks Iike one I used to own.

941
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:23,034
-What does that mean?
-Just teII me where you got the watch.

942
01:03:23,276 --> 01:03:27,952
-I won't teII you anything.
-Francis, that is my oId watch.

943
01:03:28,156 --> 01:03:32,195
I gave it to Heather when I got
my TV. Now you're wearing it.

944
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:35,348
Why the fuck are you wearing my watch?

945
01:03:36,956 --> 01:03:40,949
-Heather gave it to me.
-No shit, Dick Tracy, but why?

946
01:03:41,636 --> 01:03:43,945
See, Mick, it's a Iong story.

947
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:48,152
I shouId have toId you before.

948
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:53,752
I shouId've toId you before,
but I didn't know how.

949
01:03:54,276 --> 01:03:57,154
You been having
a Iot of troubIe with that.

950
01:04:02,836 --> 01:04:05,145
The woman I've been seeing. . .

951
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:09,752
-. . .is Heather.
-My Heather?

952
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:11,954
No. My Heather.

953
01:04:12,156 --> 01:04:15,944
You're having sex with my ex-fiancée
who broke my heart?

954
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:18,187
-I Iove her.
-No, you don't.

955
01:04:18,796 --> 01:04:22,152
-I do.
-You don't Iove my ex-fiancée.

956
01:04:22,396 --> 01:04:25,832
-Can you understand that?
-You get this straight:

957
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:29,864
-I'm gonna marry her.
-What are you taIking about?

958
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:32,676
AII right, settIe down!
What's going on?

959
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:36,750
Know why he's Ieaving Renee?
Because he's screwing Heather. . .

960
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,150
. . .the whore.

961
01:04:38,516 --> 01:04:41,952
-Don't caII her a whore.
-I'II caII her what I want.

962
01:04:42,196 --> 01:04:45,950
-What are you doing?
-What do you have to say, Francis?

963
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:48,790
Fuck him.
I know why he's reaIIy pissed.

964
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:50,594
Don't go there, bitch.

965
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:53,953
I'II kick your ass
for caIIing my girI a whore.

966
01:04:54,196 --> 01:04:58,951
-She's your girI? This is his girI.
-Yeah, and I'm gonna kick your ass.

967
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:02,148
Huh, Mr. Loser-Cabdriver-
Can't-Afford-a-TV?

968
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,745
Let's take this outside. Come on.

969
01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:08,585
Hope you know how stupid you aII Iook.

970
01:05:08,836 --> 01:05:11,031
You're grown men. Brothers!

971
01:05:11,276 --> 01:05:14,951
Sometimes it's the onIy way
you can soIve these things.

972
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:16,384
Okay, girIs.

973
01:05:17,836 --> 01:05:20,555
-I won't fight you, Fran.
-I know, Mick.

974
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:24,186
I beat you, you bIeed.
It shouIdn't take Iong.

975
01:05:24,436 --> 01:05:27,826
We gotta do this with the gIoves?
We in 5th grade?

976
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:32,194
-You didn't have to caII her a whore.
-He's right. Come on.

977
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:36,554
No punching beIow the beIt,
no kicking, and Francis, no biting.

978
01:05:36,796 --> 01:05:38,707
Let's go! May the best man win.

979
01:05:38,956 --> 01:05:43,950
Twenty-five years I've waited
to be bigger, tougher, stronger.

980
01:05:44,156 --> 01:05:48,229
When you go down it'II hurt, baby.
I'II kick your ass. Ready?

981
01:05:48,476 --> 01:05:53,675
You ready to be humiIiated?
You're an ugIy bitch. I pity you.

982
01:05:57,796 --> 01:06:00,947
Great punch, Mick.
You aIways had a great right.

983
01:06:12,956 --> 01:06:15,550
Come on, Dorothy. It's aII over.

984
01:06:27,236 --> 01:06:29,545
-How's it going?
-Not bad.

985
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:31,949
What happened to you?

986
01:06:34,436 --> 01:06:36,347
I toId Mickey about us.

987
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:39,152
One punch?

988
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:41,753
It was a cheap shot.

989
01:06:45,676 --> 01:06:49,351
This wasn't about Heather.
It was between me and Fran.

990
01:06:49,596 --> 01:06:52,872
He's trying to turn our Iives
into a competition.

991
01:06:53,116 --> 01:06:55,471
It's his way of saying,
''I won. ''

992
01:06:55,716 --> 01:06:59,948
I don't buy it. Something eIse
was going on and you know it.

993
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:03,950
I don't know what to teII you, okay?

994
01:07:05,036 --> 01:07:06,947
That's what it was about.

995
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:14,748
I'm going to take a shower.

996
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:23,035
-Does it hurt?
-No, no. It's fine.

997
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:28,747
I've got something for you.

998
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:31,994
What's this?

999
01:07:34,636 --> 01:07:35,864
WiII you marry me?

1000
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:40,153
You have to get divorced first, Fran.

1001
01:07:41,836 --> 01:07:43,155
Sure, but. . .

1002
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:48,595
. . .this wiII be Iike a pre-divorce,
pre-engagement engagement ring.

1003
01:07:49,436 --> 01:07:51,154
Open it.

1004
01:08:00,316 --> 01:08:02,113
You didn't have to do this.

1005
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:08,552
Come here, you poor thing.

1006
01:08:14,436 --> 01:08:15,630
So?

1007
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:19,513
Why are you doing this?

1008
01:08:22,396 --> 01:08:23,954
Because I Iove you.

1009
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:28,950
Can I have some time
to think about it?

1010
01:08:30,796 --> 01:08:31,945
Yeah.

1011
01:08:34,036 --> 01:08:35,754
I'm not going anywhere.

1012
01:08:50,636 --> 01:08:54,470
I side with Hope on this.
You shouIdn't be pissed at Franny.

1013
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,075
You kidding me, Dad?

1014
01:08:56,316 --> 01:08:59,752
Don't think I can't stiII
knock you on your ass.

1015
01:09:01,156 --> 01:09:06,025
Sorry. You knew what Fran was up to.
He's aIways puIIed crap Iike this.

1016
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:07,755
You're no different.

1017
01:09:07,996 --> 01:09:11,068
Or you wouIdn't have
put on those gIoves.

1018
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:14,587
If you don't beIieve me,
I'II refresh your memory.

1019
01:09:15,036 --> 01:09:19,871
LittIe League. You're 1 2, he's 1 1 .
He's pitching, you're at bat.

1020
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:23,910
He's got a fuII count on his
big brother, his idoI.

1021
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:26,546
He strikes you out, he's the hero.

1022
01:09:27,236 --> 01:09:28,749
What does he do?

1023
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:32,354
He throws you a meatbaII
down the middIe.

1024
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:36,151
If you Iet him strike you out,
you make him the hero.

1025
01:09:36,436 --> 01:09:38,552
But you swing away.

1026
01:10:02,716 --> 01:10:04,991
So, how are we doing?

1027
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:06,949
You teII me.

1028
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,915
I want to apoIogize
for the other night.

1029
01:10:12,156 --> 01:10:15,944
I think this whoIe thing is crazy
and stupid, but it's Iike. . .

1030
01:10:16,956 --> 01:10:21,347
-. . .you know, I'm a IittIe confused.
-How's your friend Heather?

1031
01:10:23,156 --> 01:10:24,430
I wouIdn't know.

1032
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:29,747
Mick, I've been doing
some thinking and. . . .

1033
01:10:30,156 --> 01:10:34,434
Who were we kidding? We onIy
knew one another for a few hours.

1034
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:36,871
No way that wouId work, right?

1035
01:10:37,836 --> 01:10:40,555
I don't know if I'd say that.
It's just. . .

1036
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:44,232
. . .that whoIe Paris thing
kind of threw me.

1037
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:48,151
You're using that as an excuse.

1038
01:10:48,596 --> 01:10:50,632
We both know what's going on.

1039
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:59,346
I'm Ieaving for Paris on Monday
and I think it's best if I go aIone.

1040
01:11:01,836 --> 01:11:03,474
You're sure about that?

1041
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:09,153
No, but I made up my mind.

1042
01:11:20,836 --> 01:11:24,545
-What did he say?
-Not much.

1043
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:27,354
Did he fight for you?

1044
01:11:27,756 --> 01:11:30,748
No, not reaIIy.

1045
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:34,550
Are you going aIone to Paris?

1046
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:46,945
-Hey, Fran.
-Say, Mick.

1047
01:11:47,196 --> 01:11:48,868
What are you doing here?

1048
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:51,955
I can't come by
to see my IittIe brother?

1049
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:04,586
So? What happened?

1050
01:12:04,796 --> 01:12:08,630
Out of thousands of women,
you just feII in Iove with Heather?

1051
01:12:08,876 --> 01:12:10,707
That's not how it happened.

1052
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:13,993
We both work on--
We run in simiIar circIes.

1053
01:12:14,236 --> 01:12:15,954
Jesus. Give me a break.

1054
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:19,871
Am I a moron? I'm your brother.
What were you thinking?

1055
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:23,153
-You had to go after her?
-It wasn't Iike that.

1056
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:26,468
You stiII Iove her?
Is that why this bothers you?

1057
01:12:26,716 --> 01:12:31,028
No, it has nothing to do with that.
We're not competing anymore.

1058
01:12:31,276 --> 01:12:33,631
Look at your Iife, you won aIready.

1059
01:12:33,876 --> 01:12:36,754
You got the big apartment,
nicer cIothes.

1060
01:12:36,956 --> 01:12:39,754
You're Mr. Big Dick.
What more do you want?

1061
01:12:39,956 --> 01:12:42,424
Maybe he just wants to be happy.

1062
01:12:44,756 --> 01:12:47,748
To be happy, reaIIy? That's great.

1063
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:52,074
Who am I to get in the way of this--
What was it? Happiness?

1064
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:55,670
Franny obviousIy hasn't toId you yet.

1065
01:12:57,236 --> 01:12:58,749
ToId me what?

1066
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,350
Your brother's asked me to marry him.

1067
01:13:08,036 --> 01:13:11,073
Great. That's terrific, hey.

1068
01:13:11,316 --> 01:13:14,752
-CongratuIations.
-Thank you.

1069
01:13:23,516 --> 01:13:26,952
-You out of your fucking mind?
-Don't start, Mick.

1070
01:13:27,356 --> 01:13:30,075
-I Iove her.
-No, you don't.

1071
01:13:30,316 --> 01:13:32,546
You don't, because she's unIovabIe.

1072
01:13:33,196 --> 01:13:36,029
-So, you didn't Iove her?
-A Iong time ago.

1073
01:13:36,236 --> 01:13:39,706
-I thought I couId change her.
-I don't want to change her.

1074
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,554
You don't know her, Fran.

1075
01:13:41,796 --> 01:13:44,185
Oh, I don't know her. Okay.

1076
01:13:44,436 --> 01:13:47,234
Fran, Iisten to me.

1077
01:13:47,476 --> 01:13:51,628
I didn't want to say this
but you shouId know some things.

1078
01:13:51,876 --> 01:13:57,030
Drop it. Right here. Nothing
you can say wiII change how I feeI.

1079
01:13:58,036 --> 01:14:00,630
Don't be so sure about that.

1080
01:14:01,796 --> 01:14:05,550
When she was in coIIege. . .

1081
01:14:05,836 --> 01:14:08,145
. . .paid her way through schooI by. . . .

1082
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:11,949
She was a caII girI.

1083
01:14:15,236 --> 01:14:19,593
-What do you mean?
-You caII a service, they send her--

1084
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:22,270
What are you saying?
Like a hooker?

1085
01:14:22,556 --> 01:14:23,545
No.

1086
01:14:23,996 --> 01:14:26,749
Not ''Iike'' a hooker.
She was a hooker.

1087
01:14:28,356 --> 01:14:31,587
You are so sick.
You wouId stoop to this IeveI.

1088
01:14:31,836 --> 01:14:34,828
-You think I'd make this up?
-Get out of here!

1089
01:14:35,076 --> 01:14:38,830
You're saying this because you
don't want us together.

1090
01:14:39,596 --> 01:14:44,147
I'm your brother. I don't want you
to find out after you're married.

1091
01:14:46,036 --> 01:14:48,152
I'm sorry, man, but it's true.

1092
01:14:53,116 --> 01:14:54,947
She's a hooker?

1093
01:14:57,436 --> 01:15:02,351
I knew she was seeing some other guy,
but what the fuck?

1094
01:15:02,996 --> 01:15:05,556
I can't marry a hooker.

1095
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:08,987
It's not that big a deaI.
She's not a hooker now--

1096
01:15:09,236 --> 01:15:11,545
Not that big a deaI?

1097
01:15:12,996 --> 01:15:14,748
Mickey, you're my brother.

1098
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,945
How couId you keep this from me?

1099
01:15:20,676 --> 01:15:23,144
I gotta get some air.

1100
01:15:23,636 --> 01:15:24,955
TeII her--

1101
01:15:25,836 --> 01:15:27,349
TeII her I--

1102
01:15:29,436 --> 01:15:31,552
I don't care what you teII her.

1103
01:15:49,996 --> 01:15:51,349
Where's Franny?

1104
01:15:53,836 --> 01:15:57,545
He's not feeIing so good.
He went out to get some air.

1105
01:16:00,196 --> 01:16:01,754
You toId him?

1106
01:16:02,836 --> 01:16:04,189
He's my brother.

1107
01:16:04,436 --> 01:16:07,951
-You said you had no probIem with it.
-I stiII don't.

1108
01:16:08,396 --> 01:16:12,674
But if he's gonna marry you,
I think he's got a right to know.

1109
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:15,828
I guess we'II see what
he's reaIIy made of, huh?

1110
01:17:10,556 --> 01:17:13,707
What are you saying?
She said she was going there.

1111
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:16,794
I just came from church.
She isn't there.

1112
01:17:17,036 --> 01:17:19,504
I haven't seen her at Mass for months.

1113
01:17:19,756 --> 01:17:22,873
Better start mixing more water
with that wine.

1114
01:17:23,116 --> 01:17:26,745
She goes to Mass every morning.
She prays for the boys.

1115
01:17:26,956 --> 01:17:29,151
Not in my church, she doesn't.

1116
01:17:31,156 --> 01:17:32,987
He's Iucky I didn't kiII him!

1117
01:17:33,236 --> 01:17:36,785
What's with Dad? He's haIf
in the bag. Acting crazy.

1118
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:38,833
What happened today?

1119
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:41,067
Mom Ieft him this morning.

1120
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,393
She'd go to DeIuca's
hardware store every day. . .

1121
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:46,429
. . .and. . .

1122
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:48,747
. . .I can't even stomach it. . .

1123
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:52,153
. . .screw around with Mr. DeIuca.

1124
01:17:52,356 --> 01:17:54,745
-Mom and DeIuca?
-AsshoIe!

1125
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:59,595
-That's disgusting.
-Dad found them in a back room.

1126
01:17:59,836 --> 01:18:04,956
You shouId've seen-- It was ugIy.
Dad gave the guy a horribIe beating.

1127
01:18:05,716 --> 01:18:08,355
Christ. What about Mom?
Where'd she go?

1128
01:18:09,636 --> 01:18:12,434
She went up to church to pray for Dad.

1129
01:18:12,676 --> 01:18:16,589
Pray for me, my ass!
She's the one who'II need prayers now!

1130
01:18:25,196 --> 01:18:29,906
-Do I Iook as good as I think I do?
-Very handsome, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

1131
01:18:30,116 --> 01:18:31,515
How's the hair, babe?

1132
01:18:33,196 --> 01:18:34,470
StiII there, sir.

1133
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:39,584
It's gonna be a good day.
A good day indeed, my man.

1134
01:18:39,836 --> 01:18:44,352
First day of the rest of my Iife.
Making some changes, babe.

1135
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:59,594
-Heather, what's going on here?
-I'm Ieaving.

1136
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:02,396
Forget that. You can't Ieave.

1137
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:05,946
I'm in Iove with you.
I stiII want to marry you.

1138
01:19:06,796 --> 01:19:10,345
I'm sorry, Francis.
Here's your ring.

1139
01:19:10,596 --> 01:19:14,350
-I can't marry you.
-Why not?

1140
01:19:14,996 --> 01:19:18,147
Because Papa and I were married
this morning.

1141
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:24,354
One day you say you'II marry me,
the next you marry the oId man?

1142
01:19:24,636 --> 01:19:27,434
-He Ioves me.
-Of course he Ioves you.

1143
01:19:27,676 --> 01:19:30,952
You're beautifuI,
he's got one foot in the grave.

1144
01:19:31,196 --> 01:19:34,029
-Because he makes more money than me?
-No.

1145
01:19:34,276 --> 01:19:38,952
-Does this have to do with the sex?
-CertainIy didn't heIp matters much.

1146
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:43,826
-He didn't care about my past.
-Oh, he doesn't care about your past.

1147
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:48,354
Maybe that's because he doesn't
know you were a hooker.

1148
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:50,946
He was my best customer.

1149
01:19:57,756 --> 01:20:01,590
Thanks for the memories.
You've ruined my Iife!

1150
01:20:07,156 --> 01:20:08,555
Hello?

1151
01:20:09,676 --> 01:20:10,950
Renee?

1152
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:14,389
HeIIo, Francis,
what can I do for you?

1153
01:20:17,036 --> 01:20:21,268
This is very hard for me to say,
but I feeI. . . .

1154
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:26,866
I know I made a mistake.
I've been seIfish and thoughtIess. . .

1155
01:20:27,116 --> 01:20:30,950
. . .and seIf-concerned,
but I'm gonna change.

1156
01:20:31,436 --> 01:20:35,748
I want a chance to do the right thing.
I want you to come home.

1157
01:20:36,076 --> 01:20:41,275
I miss you. I'II pay more attention.
I want to make it work again.

1158
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:43,875
WiII you come home?

1159
01:20:46,556 --> 01:20:51,027
Come on, Francis.
What do you want from me, huh?

1160
01:20:51,276 --> 01:20:55,952
I don't think so. A day Iate
and a doIIar short, you know?

1161
01:20:56,676 --> 01:21:01,875
I don't think I couId survive
another one of your down cycIes.

1162
01:21:17,396 --> 01:21:20,991
-Hey, Connie, what's doing?
-What are you doing here?

1163
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:24,430
I'm Iooking for Hope.

1164
01:21:25,196 --> 01:21:27,756
-Is she around?
-No, she's not.

1165
01:21:28,436 --> 01:21:33,635
You know where she might be?
I want to taIk to her before she goes.

1166
01:21:34,036 --> 01:21:38,507
Mick, you fucked up, aII right?
You're a jerk. You broke her heart. . .

1167
01:21:38,716 --> 01:21:42,425
. . .just Iike I toId her you wouId.
Why don't you just get out?

1168
01:21:43,596 --> 01:21:46,156
AII right. Do me a favor,
though, okay?

1169
01:21:46,996 --> 01:21:51,865
TeII her that I came by and that
I want to see her before she goes.

1170
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,551
And teII her that I miss her.

1171
01:22:08,116 --> 01:22:09,788
Mick was just here.

1172
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:12,148
What did he want?

1173
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:19,155
I stiII say he's a prick, okay?

1174
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:23,745
But he did sound upset
and he said that he missed you.

1175
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:27,353
And he said he wants to
see you before you go.

1176
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:31,552
So maybe you shouId go by
and see him or something.

1177
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:36,948
TortiIIa FIats.

1178
01:22:40,316 --> 01:22:42,546
HoId on a second.

1179
01:22:43,636 --> 01:22:45,945
It's Mick's dad.

1180
01:23:00,196 --> 01:23:01,754
I bIew it.

1181
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:06,668
I had the greatest woman in the worId
and I bIew it.

1182
01:23:06,916 --> 01:23:09,749
You don't know from bIowing it, paI.

1183
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:13,550
I had the perfect wife.

1184
01:23:14,396 --> 01:23:16,148
I screwed it up.

1185
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:21,835
No, you didn't, man.
I had the perfect wife.

1186
01:23:22,076 --> 01:23:25,955
But you did screw it up for me.
So, thanks, I owe you one.

1187
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:30,829
You know what, Mick?
If you reaIIy think about it. . .

1188
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:34,751
. . .aII this is entireIy your fauIt.

1189
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:38,708
Oh, reaIIy?
How do you figure that?

1190
01:23:39,196 --> 01:23:43,155
WeII, if you never met
and got invoIved with Heather. . .

1191
01:23:43,796 --> 01:23:45,946
. . .where wouId we be now?

1192
01:23:46,836 --> 01:23:51,626
Interesting theory. I hope you didn't
hurt yourseIf coming up with it.

1193
01:23:52,476 --> 01:23:56,071
I stiII can't beIieve
that you wanted to marry her.

1194
01:23:56,316 --> 01:24:00,229
You're a confused and demented souI.

1195
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:03,155
It's very upsetting to me,
as your brother.

1196
01:24:03,676 --> 01:24:06,031
Me, confused? Listen, paI. . .

1197
01:24:06,276 --> 01:24:10,792
. . .I'm not the fooI Ietting his bride
honeymoon in Paris without him.

1198
01:24:11,036 --> 01:24:12,947
You think I don't want to go?

1199
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:19,348
She said she didn't want me there,
so what am I supposed to do?

1200
01:24:21,196 --> 01:24:25,747
You want to get married without
a best man? Pay the price, paI.

1201
01:24:30,716 --> 01:24:32,149
By the way. . . .

1202
01:24:37,356 --> 01:24:40,348
Remember, it's six hours ahead
over there.

1203
01:24:41,316 --> 01:24:42,954
Sorry.

1204
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:49,945
Let's give this to the bartender.

1205
01:24:59,196 --> 01:25:01,756
It's gonna get nippy out there, boys.

1206
01:25:02,716 --> 01:25:05,992
This might be our Iast fishing trip
of the season.

1207
01:25:11,596 --> 01:25:14,747
Franny, sit down a minute.
I want to taIk to you.

1208
01:25:21,636 --> 01:25:22,955
You know. . .

1209
01:25:25,436 --> 01:25:27,996
. . .since we're crying in our beers. . .

1210
01:25:28,236 --> 01:25:31,148
. . .whiIe our women
are Iiving their Iives. . .

1211
01:25:34,356 --> 01:25:36,347
. . .I gotta think that maybe. . .

1212
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:39,628
. . .I shouId apoIogize for
aII my rotten advice.

1213
01:25:39,876 --> 01:25:43,551
Don't be so hard on yourseIf,
you don't need to apoIogize.

1214
01:25:43,796 --> 01:25:46,947
Yeah, I do. I did it to both of you.

1215
01:25:47,156 --> 01:25:50,865
You're a fucking mess,
and I'm partIy responsibIe.

1216
01:25:51,116 --> 01:25:52,913
I don't know what to say.

1217
01:25:53,756 --> 01:25:56,145
First time I'm at a Ioss for words.

1218
01:25:57,396 --> 01:25:59,751
What'II happen between you and Mom?

1219
01:26:00,276 --> 01:26:01,470
I don't know.

1220
01:26:02,516 --> 01:26:06,145
We had a down cycIe.
We just couIdn't get out of it.

1221
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:11,950
I toId you. It happens.

1222
01:26:15,636 --> 01:26:18,434
Enough of this horseshit.
We going fishing?

1223
01:26:18,996 --> 01:26:22,147
It won't be so bad.
As Iong as we got each other. . .

1224
01:26:22,356 --> 01:26:23,948
. . .we'II do fine.

1225
01:26:26,036 --> 01:26:27,947
Deirdre, you coming?

1226
01:26:28,596 --> 01:26:30,951
I don't think I can make it today.

1227
01:26:31,276 --> 01:26:32,470
Why the heII not?

1228
01:26:33,436 --> 01:26:37,349
Hope's going to Paris tomorrow
and I'm going with her.

1229
01:26:40,036 --> 01:26:44,393
WeII, if you can't go fishing,
heIp us Ioad up the gear.

1230
01:27:07,436 --> 01:27:09,825
What are you doing here?

1231
01:27:10,396 --> 01:27:13,194
I don't know.
Your dad invited me fishing.

1232
01:27:14,636 --> 01:27:17,628
And what about Paris?

1233
01:27:18,796 --> 01:27:20,024
What about Paris?

1234
01:27:20,876 --> 01:27:22,867
You stiII want to go aIone?

1235
01:27:23,556 --> 01:27:28,755
Come on. I didn't come to BrookIyn
to go fishing with your father.

1236
01:27:29,116 --> 01:27:31,755
See? He's aIways ignored my advice. . .

1237
01:27:31,996 --> 01:27:34,351
. . .now he's finaIIy wised up.

1238
01:27:36,996 --> 01:27:39,635
Mickey, get your ass in the boat.

1239
01:27:51,596 --> 01:27:53,746
Don't you think I shouId drive?

1240
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:58,072
Maybe we shouId take this
one step at a time, honey.
