2
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:40,670
<i>Over 20 years, I've written wills
for about 8.000 of 'em.

3
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,801
<i>I've sat with 'em as they've
combed through their assets.

4
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:48,176
<i>Figured out which kid gets
the painting over the fireplace,

5
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:52,149
<i>which one gets the
antique spoon collection.

<i>Last thanks, parting shots, confessions...
People try to fit it all in.

7

<i>And once I've finished,
another life has been summed up -

you look up, smile,

11
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:21,479

for 20 years: "Is that it, then?"

# Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you

# Happy birthday, dear Dad
Happy birthday to you

15
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:44,199
Ohh, wow. Beautiful.

16
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,861
All right, make a wish.

17
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,575
Sorry. I just have
to take this call.

18
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:54,407
- Did you win?
- "Take this call"?

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,745
- She's 14. How can she be "taking calls"?
- Jen, not now. Now's not the time.

20
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,615
Remind me, why was it we agreed
to give her the phone?

21
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:03,746
- Emergencies.
- Which this is, by the way.

22
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,756
Serious problem over there.

23
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:07,724
Get off, Jen.
Now, please. Come on.

24
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,556
- All right!
- Come on, get off.

25
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:14,497
Yeah, my dad's just gonna blow out
about a million candles. Bye.

26
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:18,058
All right, everyone,
are we all happy now?

27
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:23,706
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:27,211
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

29
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:33,211
- Sorry about the bathrobe.
- What do you mean?

30
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,254
Oh, I just had such a hard time
getting you a present.

31
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,515
I love this bathrobe.

32
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:40,786
I think the problem is that
you never really want anything.

33
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,326
- That's not true.
- That's true.

34
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:45,124
- Tell me one thing that you really want.
- What you gave me tonight.

35
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:48,166
Evan coming home, everyone's
at dinner, that cake you make...

36
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:52,499
Tell me one thing that you want
that comes in a box.

37
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:56,603
I rest my case.

38
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:12,118
Yes! That's it! That's it!
That's what we needed.

39
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,862
Good night, Mary.
I left the Anderson will on your desk.

40
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:21,922
Night, Bill.

41
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,257
<i>Next stop. Sedgwick.

42
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:57,160
Hello. I'm home.

43
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,170
There's a female bonding ritual
going on in the den.

44
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,905
- I know.
- What are they doing in there?

45
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,346
Tattooing "I love Satan" on their foreheads,
piercing their bellybuttons, stuff like that.

46
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:15,147
- Great. What did you say about that?
- I said, "Don't get any blood on the couch."

47
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,246
I worry about Jenna. She's
too beautiful. That's your fault.

48
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:19,847
- Here, sign this.
- What is it?

49
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,120
- It's your mom's birthday card.
- Oh, God, thank you.

50
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:24,924
- How was your workout?
- Same. How are you?

51
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:28,557
Fine. You know, ordering the
spring line at the store, yada-yada.

52
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:32,069
- I've got to get going.
- I thought you just got here.

53
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,571
Yeah, but it's the fundraiser
at Jen's school.

54
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,437
So your dinner's in the oven
and the girls have already eaten.

55
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,104
Can we go see a movie sometime?

56
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:46,048
Yeah. Or at least we could
look at the ads in the paper together.

57
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,382
How are you doing?

58
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:53,447
Fine.

59
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:58,825
Check on them now and then, OK?

60
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,058
Don't wait up.

61
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:10,002
Get out of here, Dad!

62
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:29,479
Bev? It's not true
that I don't want anything.

63
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,094
Bev?

64
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,988
<i>Doors open on the right.

65
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:21,399
- <i>Doors closing. Next stop, Sedgwick.</i>
- Excuse me.

66
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,214
Oh, my God. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

67
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,425
You know what?
I'm gonna just go up.

68
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,427
Oh, my God.

69
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:58,042
That was a great class.

70
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,471
Come on.

71
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,245
- Are we goin' up, or what?
- I'm just trying to...

72
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,253
Here.

73
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,889
- OK, don't do that.
- Do what?

74
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:15,358
Stand there looking dumb.
It's just not cute in a guy your age.

75
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:17,588
Be a doll and help me
carry my clothes.

76
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:20,927
Come on.
And stop lookin' at my ass.

77
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,392
I'll try.

78
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,432
T... A... N-G-O...

79
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:31,239
T... A... N-G-O...

80
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:35,342
T... A... N-G... Oh!

81
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,849
- I found him at the bottom of the stairs.
- Um... Uh...

82
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,613
Paulina, could you help?

83
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,950
Excuse me.

84
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,387
May I help you?

85
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,759
The sign said
"Feel free to watch."

86
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,200
Are you here for lessons?

87
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:00,503
Yes.

88
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,207
- Mr...?
- Clark.

89
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:07,673
Are you registering
as a couple or as a single?

90
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,306
Single. I mean, not that I'm...

91
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,414
Single. Yeah, just me.

92
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,583
Single privates are $45 an hour. If you buy
six at a time, the price per class drops $5.

93
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:26,495
- Have you ever danced before?
- No. No. But I'm a fast learner.

94
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:28,691
We're starting a new intro
ballroom series for singles.

95
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:31,793
I recommend that beginners start with that.
There's still room in the class.

96
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,636
It meets every Wednesday
at 7:30, for eight weeks.

97
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,732
All right.

98
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:41,812
Right, Wednesdays, 7:30. Great.

99
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,372
Great. Well...

100
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:49,051
- I'll come back then. Thank you.
- Mr. Clark?

101
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,250
Where are you going?
The class starts tonight.

102
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:54,951
Tonight?

103
00:09:55,026 --> 00:09:57,722
Oh, right, yeah.
Wednesday, 7:30.

104
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:00,856
You can wait over there.
We'll begin shortly.

105
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,299
OK...

106
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,915
Hey. I'm Vern.

107
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,548
John.

108
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:33,821
- You beginning ballroom?
- Yeah, looks that way. Yeah.

109
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:36,230
- Chic. Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,204
So, you dance much?

111
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:52,679
High-school prom.
"Stairway to Heaven."

112
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:57,513
- You?
- Not even a prom. I didn't go.

113
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:03,619
Anybody see any girls?
I mean, I'm here for the babes, right.

114
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,095
I mean, it can't be just us, can it?

115
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:12,559
Guys dancin' with guys ain't my kinda
thing, you know? No offense, sir.

116
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,065
None taken.

117
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,973
Hi.

118
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:28,075
See the slinky one with the eyebrows?
That's me - if you don't mind.

119
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,383
I know <i>you</i> won't mind.

120
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:34,291
- Be my guest.
- All right.

121
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,621
Work the goods.

122
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:43,567
Oh, yeah. Here they come.
Come to Papa.

123
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:45,694
Here they...

124
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:48,427
Ouch.

125
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:52,135
Memories of high school, huh, boys?

126
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:16,793
Good evening, gentlemen, and
welcome to the beginner's ballroom class.

127
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:20,497
My name is Miss Mitzi. I am the owner
of this dancing establishment,

128
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,632
and I am going to be your teacher.
Disappointed that I'm older?

129
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,040
Yes. I mean, no. I mean...

130
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,442
Hey, you look... experienced.

131
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:33,041
Forward, side, closed...
Back, side, close.

132
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:37,780
Very good, Chic.
Is it "Chick," or "Sheek"?

133
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,824
- Whoa! "Chick."
- "Chick."

134
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,290
- Yes. Very good.
- Easy.

135
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,793
Remember to use
the balls of your feet.

136
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,887
Wait a minute, Vern.
Where is your right foot?

137
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:49,229
- It's right back there. See?
- Yes, I know. It hasn't moved, has it?

138
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,528
Not yet.

139
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,627
- Well, now would be a good time.
- OK.

140
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,138
- OK? Close.
- Close...

141
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,470
Excellent. Very good.

142
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:02,912
All right. Forward, side, close.
Back, side, close.

143
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,643
One, two, three, rise.

144
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:09,483
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You guys saw that?

145
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:12,523
Excellent, gentlemen.
Excellent.

146
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,223
Keep your sticks up.
Promenade.

147
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:20,492
- And...
- Counter-promenade.

148
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,533
Let me see what you're doing. Ah!

149
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,228
- Miss Mitzi, I'm sorry. Sorry.
- God! Jesus!

150
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,237
- I said I'm sorry.
- Put the stick down.

151
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:30,536
We're not gonna play with these sticks
anymore if you boys won't behave.

152
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:33,805
A little faster this time. And...

153
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,746
Heel, toe, toe-toe,
toe, heel, toe-toe.

154
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,613
Excuse me. When we go forward,
is it heel-toe or toe...

155
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:42,915
It's forward, heel, toe, toe...

156
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:45,615
So it's back... Whoa...

157
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:57,931
Harder than it looks,
isn't it, gentlemen?

158
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,062
Well, you've all done very very well
for your first lesson.

159
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,697
And before you leave tonight,

160
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:06,835
I'm gonna give you a little incentive
to keep on dancing.

161
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,276
Paulina?

162
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:12,646
Would you and Francesco mind giving
our new students a little demonstration?

163
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:14,844
Certainly, Miss Mitzi.

164
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,080
Daphne?

165
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,154
Thank you, Paulina.

166
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,889
Whoo! Whoo!

167
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:37,400
That was beautiful.

168
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,768
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

169
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,272
Hey, guys, wait up.
I'm comin'.

170
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:47,834
Great. How lucky for us.

171
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,106
- Hey.
- Where are we goin'?

172
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,148
- Somewhere close.
- Yeah. I haven't got long.

173
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,705
Anyway. You guys.
Don't go to Jim's.

174
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,184
They got a bad roach problem
there around the corner.

175
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:58,689
You're gonna go anywhere after class,
you come here, OK? Thank you.

176
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:00,417
Why'd you guys decide
to take dance, anyway?

177
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:03,051
- I'm gettin' married in September.
- Nice.

178
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,789
Yeah. My bride said she'd like
to see me lose a few pounds.

179
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:09,264
She thinks the dancing will help.
I said it won't.

180
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,734
- I think you'll win that argument.
- I'm taking classes to impress the ladies.

181
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,601
You know what they say
about guys who can dance, right?

182
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,640
- That they're great in bed.
- Yeah, baby.

183
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:20,165
- Where do you get that stupid crap?
- Everywhere. What do you think?

184
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:23,771
Everybody knows a guy who can move
on the dance floor can move in the sack.

185
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:27,511
Most guys, they can't dance at all. Guys
who can, they get their pick of the litter.

186
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:30,110
That's why, when I'm done with this class,
babes will drop at my feet.

187
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:32,247
They're gonna be droppin'
<i>dead</i> at your feet.

188
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:36,589
When you took your shoes off in class
today, I had to run to the window for air.

189
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,596
What kind of person says something like
that to somebody they don't even know?

190
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,393
Hey, man, I'm doin' you a favor.

191
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,264
I'm telling you something obnoxious about
yourself that you might not be aware of.

192
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,769
If there's something obnoxious about me
that you don't think I'm aware of,

193
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:50,740
y'all should feel free to say
something about it to me.

194
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,667
Shooting fish in a barrel.

195
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:56,679
- Where are all the ladies, anyways?
- I don't know what I'm talking about.

196
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:59,477
The ladies, they all go and take
the classes down at Doctor Dance -

197
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,748
that's, like, the hip place to go downtown.
Ditzy Mitzi's is only hangin' on by a thread.

198
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:07,518
Only reason I go there is she lets me
rehearse whenever I want for free.

199
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:10,857
I'm gonna compete in the
Chicago Taittinger Trophy.

200
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:13,328
Soon as I find a partner.

201
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:17,333
So... that leaves you.

202
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,198
Leaves me? How? What?

203
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:23,536
Leaves you as the only one here
who hasn't said why he's dancing yet.

204
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,600
Oh. Well, I'm dancing
for exercise, like Vern.

205
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:27,769
Bull.

206
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,678
Because I'm lousy in bed, like Chic.
There, I've said it.

207
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:34,548
- That is bull! I didn't say I was bad in bed.
- You didn't have to.

208
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:36,610
Come on, why?

209
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:40,151
Is there any pepper here?
Could I have some?

210
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:42,624
That's what I thought.

211
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:45,218
She was a Blackpool finalist, you know.

212
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:46,285
Who?

213
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,231
The princess.
The other teacher, Paulina.

214
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,427
What's Blackpool?

215
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,766
Every year, all the best dancers
from all over the world...

216
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,797
go to England to compete there.
She was there last year with her partner -

217
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,708
who they say was much more to her
than just her partner.

218
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,474
Anyway, he dumped her. That's the only
reason she came back here to teach -

219
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,641
mad at the world,
boo-hoo-hoo and all that.

220
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,149
- Why'd he dump her?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:11,917
How the hell should I know?
God, they say women gossip! Golly!

222
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:38,211
Hello? I'm home.

223
00:18:56,601 --> 00:19:00,970
Great. Great, Vern.
Slow. The mambo is slow.

224
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:02,767
Slide that hand one inch
south of the equator...

225
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,400
and I will bust you on your ass,
twinkle-toes.

226
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:10,470
Let's get something straight. I don't like
the tropics any more than you do, OK?

227
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:28,156
<i>Five, six, seven, eight...</i>

228
00:19:28,232 --> 00:19:31,497
Arms. And basic.
And cross over.

229
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:33,767
Right.

230
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,398
One more time,
and walk around.

231
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:40,310
- And basic.
- Watch out.

232
00:19:40,378 --> 00:19:42,539
And big ending.

233
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,688
Look at you, John!

234
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,002
- That was pretty good.
- You were really good.

235
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,857
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm gonna go up and change.

236
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,959
Right.

237
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:42,767
- Dad work late tonight?
- Yeah, looks that way.

238
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,704
Guess whatever he's working on,
he must like it.

239
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:51,771
- Why do you say that?
- He seems happier lately.

240
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,379
Does he?

241
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:04,487
I called the Halston people
in New York.

242
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:08,123
We're gonna have trouble getting more
stock in. Everything's on back-order.

243
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:11,657
Look, Carolyn, I'm gonna need you
to go to New York and sweet-talk them.

244
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:14,227
- Can you leave tomorrow?
- No.

245
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,364
Why not?

246
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,375
My husband is having an affair.

247
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,714
How do you know that?

248
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:27,546
I picked up the receiver last night
to phone a friend,

249
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:32,783
not knowing that Greg was already
on the other line in the den.

250
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,882
He was whispering.

251
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:37,651
What was he whispering?

252
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,821
I don't know.

253
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:43,458
I was so scared I hung up
before I could hear anything.

254
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:47,470
Well, there's lots of other reasons
why he could be whispering.

255
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:51,975
I mean, maybe he didn't wanna
wake up the kids. Huh?

256
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:57,639
Or he could be planning a surprise for you.
I mean, your birthday's coming up, isn't it?

257
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,447
In two weeks.

258
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:09,584
That's it.

259
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:16,696
Take a breath, go get yourself a brownie
in the kitchen, just chill. It's gonna be fine.

260
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,758
OK.

261
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,264
- Euh!
- Ooh-hoo-hoo!

262
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:24,705
You silly goose, you.

263
00:22:26,777 --> 00:22:29,371
She'll be divorced by Easter.

264
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:43,451
Come on, John.
Join the warm-up.

265
00:23:22,633 --> 00:23:23,622
Ow!

266
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:26,693
- Jesus! I'm sorry!
- Watch your floorcraft, spasmo!

267
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,262
What, you think you own this floor? I'll
have a bruise the size of Texas tomorrow!

268
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:32,809
- Go away!
- Go away? You go away!

269
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:35,778
Take your stupid music with you!
I can't dance to that crap.

270
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:39,043
You just gonna stand there
and let that fat cow insult you?

271
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:44,076
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- Nothing. She didn't say anything.

272
00:23:54,698 --> 00:23:57,667
Sorry. These are the teeth
I wear for the Latin.

273
00:23:57,735 --> 00:24:00,670
It gets your smile out there.
Just a little bit bigger smile.

274
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,571
Bam! Gets the judges right
in the eye, catches the light.

275
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,302
And then the make-up -
you know the make-up.

276
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,402
"Swish-butt," "Fancy pants,"
"Pinky boy"...

277
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,710
All these names, all these names I've been
called ever since I was eight years old...

278
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:14,876
and dancing around
to my mother's rumba records.

279
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,716
You know what
the worst of it is? Huh?

280
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:23,088
I'm not gay. Can you imagine how much
easier my life would be if I were?

281
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,287
I mean, a straight man who likes
to dance around in sequins...

282
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:28,058
walks a very lonely road.
I got news for you.

283
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,066
Look, you're not gonna
tell anybody in the office, are you?

284
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:33,626
No, no, no. I wouldn't do that.
Look, I'm in the same boat, aren't I?

285
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:35,296
No, you're not. You're not.

286
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:37,932
- Why not?
- Because... people like you.

287
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:39,703
You know what I mean?
You're charming.

288
00:24:39,777 --> 00:24:43,873
I'm Linky Link. They would
crucify me if they found out.

289
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:47,384
I'm the sports trivia king,
I'm the super sports fan, you know?

290
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:50,614
- You don't like football?
- I... You know.

291
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:53,748
Run three yards, fall down, pile up.
Run three yards, fall down, pile up.

292
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:57,260
I mean, you know, four months of that,
I'm ready to put a gun to my head.

293
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:00,525
- Fooled me.
- I know. I fooled everybody.

294
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,429
You know what my dream is?

295
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,330
What?

296
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:11,035
My dream... is to be able
to dance free and proud.

297
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:14,202
Under my own name.
For all the world to see.

298
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,508
That's my dream.

299
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,343
Did I get it all?

300
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:25,617
Hey, Andy. It's Bev.

301
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,022
Look, I'm sorry to call you so late.
I was just trying to find John.

302
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:34,725
Called the office at six and Betsy said
that he'd left for the day, and I was just...

303
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,858
You got home by five?
How did you manage that, you lucky dog?

304
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:41,496
Ah, there's the door.
OK. See you. Bye.

305
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:43,301
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the office.

306
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:46,172
I wish you'd call, 'cause we were looking
all over for your car keys forever...

307
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:49,144
- I thought you were shopping with Jenna.
- That was weeks ago.

308
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:52,080
I called the office and Betsy said
you left for the day at six.

309
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,083
Yeah, I did - for a sandwich.
Then I came back.

310
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:57,177
Oh. Well, I called your private line
a few times, nobody picked up.

311
00:25:57,254 --> 00:25:59,518
That's because I wasn't working
in my office, I was in Andy's.

312
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,217
Oh. How is Andy?

313
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:05,523
We're working on a really big
estate plan together.

314
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,996
- So he was there?
- What?

315
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,726
Was Andy there?

316
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,529
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

317
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,536
I don't know.

318
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:18,870
Anyway, I stopped off for a bite
on the way home with Link Peterson.

319
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:21,536
Remember him?
Interesting guy.

320
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:24,942
Not what you'd think.

321
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:27,415
- How was your day?
- Great.

322
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,586
One, two, three, four...

323
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:42,263
One, two, three...

324
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,516
Mom?

325
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:03,517
Dad's acting weird.

326
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:16,494
They met five years ago
in a chat room for gardeners.

327
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:21,166
He says they're in love.

328
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,237
He's moving out Saturday.

329
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:27,334
He'll be back.
He loves those kids.

330
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,470
I thought we were happy.

331
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:31,810
He seemed happy to me.

332
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,541
I didn't know anything.

333
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,981
I didn't know.

334
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:49,857
Oh...

335
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,992
Hi.

336
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:57,097
I, uh... I give free consultations
during my lunch hour.

337
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,574
You sure you don't
wanna come in?

338
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:02,275
So he comes home late
on Wednesdays,

339
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,314
and when he comes home
his shirts smell like perfume.

340
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:07,646
He's been seen making strange body
movements and you feel he has a secret.

341
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:10,312
- That's correct.
- Ever think about just asking him?

342
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:13,948
- Yes, I've thought about it...
- Mrs. Clark...

343
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:18,358
things happen in long marriages.
To the best of people.

344
00:28:18,428 --> 00:28:21,329
And sometimes the thing that happens
doesn't mean anything.

345
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:24,299
Doesn't need an investigator, just needs
somebody to look the other way for a while.

346
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:28,930
My husband is a serious man, Mr. Devine.
If he's having an affair, it is not casual.

347
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,702
In which case,
the sooner I know, the better.

348
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:37,211
All right. Give me a moment while
I call in my associate, Mr. Harcourt.

349
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,272
Scottie!

350
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,414
Scottie Harcourt,
this is Mrs. Clark.

351
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,886
She suspects
her husband's up to no good.

352
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:49,289
"To catch a husband is an art.
To hold him is a job."

353
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,851
Simone de Beauvoir said that.
It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Clark.

354
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,919
Same here.

355
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:56,989
I think we can start this investigation
without too much cost to Mrs. Clark.

356
00:28:57,067 --> 00:29:02,198
Yes. Follow that husband around for a few
days, take some pictures, see what's up.

357
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,035
But I have to warn you,
if it goes to trial it's gonna be...

358
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:06,337
Trial?

359
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,112
In the event of a divorce.

360
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,977
But we don't know if
he's having an affair.

361
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:17,282
I mean, he could just be
involved with... I don't know...

362
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:21,224
people who get together
to invest things,

363
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:27,127
and... and the place that they
invest things is... filled with potpourri,

364
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:32,328
and that's why his shirts smell so sweet
when he comes home. It's possible.

365
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:34,700
Yeah, it's possible.
It's possible.

366
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:39,435
It's possible we could find your husband
neck-deep in potpourri, investing things.

367
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:41,500
Not likely.

368
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:48,176
Look, this is what we'll do.

369
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,784
We start out gently.

370
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:59,286
We look for the potpourri.

371
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:04,858
And if we find it, and it smells like flowers,
then 2,000 ought to cover my time.

372
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:09,235
But if we find the potpourri and there's
something big and stinky in the pot,

373
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:12,798
then you and I renegotiate, OK?
That sound good?

374
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,867
OK.

375
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:22,549
- Hey.
- Hi.

376
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:24,883
- How you doin'?
- Good.

377
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,957
- I can tell, you know.
- Tell what?

378
00:30:30,027 --> 00:30:32,825
That you've been dancing.
Your posture, it's a dead giveaway.

379
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:35,057
- You're kidding.
- No.

380
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:39,695
- How much you been practicing, anyway?
- Just in class.

381
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,706
No. Should be five to one.
Five-to-one ratio.

382
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:47,642
Five hours of practice
for every one hour of class.

383
00:30:50,113 --> 00:30:53,344
Doctor Dance has an open
dance party every Thursday.

384
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:56,818
Anybody can go and practice.
Even you.

385
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:00,617
Ballroom is all or nothing, John.

386
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:03,421
I'm draggin' your ass out of class
and onto a real dance floor.

387
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:06,428
We'll go straight there
after work.

388
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,794
- Link?
- Yeah?

389
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:11,299
Can you really tell?

390
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:13,063
Yeah.

391
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:37,287
Having fun?

392
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,853
- What are you doing here?
- Spying.

393
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:10,356
Excuse me, we were
dancing together.

394
00:32:10,427 --> 00:32:13,191
Dude, she does not wanna
dance with you. Now back off.

395
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,163
Hey, you know, I...

396
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:23,702
Link always insists on dancing
with the youngest girls.

397
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:29,076
I've never seen him with his perfect
partner. Not that those are easy to find.

398
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:31,114
Have you ever found one?

399
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:36,084
Once. He was my
dancing partner for 15 years.

400
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:39,020
- We were husband and wife for 14.
- Wow.

401
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:43,788
Yeah. He was my perfect partner.
Doesn't happen twice in a lifetime.

402
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,795
I'm lucky it even happened once.

403
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:47,761
Ah!

404
00:32:47,831 --> 00:32:52,495
At last, a song I know.
Oh, I love this song.

405
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,397
<i># Da da-da da...

406
00:32:55,472 --> 00:33:00,068
<i># Shall we still be together
With our arms around each other

407
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:04,375
<i># And shall you be
my new romance?

408
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:09,044
<i># On the clear understanding
that this kind of thing can happen

409
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,351
<i># Shall we dance, shall we dance,
shall we dance?

410
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:17,957
It's <i>The King and I.</i> Yul Brynner
and Deborah Kerr. Do you remember that?

411
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:21,293
They held hands like this...
Oh, come on, John, let's try it.

412
00:33:21,364 --> 00:33:24,026
- No. No, no, no, I can't. No way. I can't.
- Why not?

413
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:29,129
- Oh, John, come on. Come on.
- I don't... No, I don't want to...

414
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:38,344
Let go, John.

415
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:47,146
That's it, John.

416
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:52,252
Whoa!

417
00:33:52,329 --> 00:33:55,025
- Sorry! I wasn't watching.
- Hi! How are you?

418
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:59,057
- It doesn't matter. We're finished anyway.
- What do you mean?

419
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:01,161
No offense, but I can't be
your dance partner.

420
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:03,001
- Why?
- You're too much of a freak.

421
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:06,839
I mean, look at your palms. They're
bright orange from self-tanning lotion.

422
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:12,507
Don't you know you're supposed to wash
your hands after you use that stuff?

423
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:19,880
Excuse me.

424
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:48,613
Miss Mitzi couldn't make it tonight,
so I'll be your teacher.

425
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:50,312
I'm Paulina.

426
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:55,415
And you're...
Chic and Vern and...

427
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:00,721
- Tom.
- John. It's John.

428
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:05,265
What would you like
to work on tonight?

429
00:35:05,335 --> 00:35:11,035
Well, in my opinion - Chic - I think since
we're beginners, a good idea would be...

430
00:35:11,107 --> 00:35:12,904
Waltz.

431
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:15,171
Maybe the waltz.

432
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:20,749
OK. Um...

433
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:25,186
I'll work with you one at a time
and you can be first.

434
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,350
OK. All right.

435
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,234
- Oops.
- I'm sorry.

436
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,522
So are you really
a reporter for <i>The Times</i>.

437
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,116
Or are you just pickin' up on her,
like everybody else?

438
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:14,186
I'm a reporter.
Plus, she's not my type.

439
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:17,927
I like a woman built for comfort,
not for speed.

440
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:24,036
Really? Why don't you put the camera
down and take me out on the dance floor?

441
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:28,237
Two reasons: I'm working
and this is not my type of dance.

442
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:29,972
Well, how do you know
if you've never tried?

443
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:33,311
Come on, put the camera down.
Come on, give me a shot.

444
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:34,782
Oh, dear!

445
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,910
Sorry, sorry!

446
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:41,888
- I'm sorry.
- It's gonna stain.

447
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,485
Don't... worry.
I'll take care of it.

448
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:09,143
- Would you like to use this?
- Excuse me?

449
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,847
Just to wipe your coat, or...

450
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:17,520
Go ahead, just take it.
Please. Go ahead.

451
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:21,325
- It's silly, but it's my favorite coat.
- I'm sorry.

452
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:23,389
It's vintage.

453
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:27,928
But this part's real suede,
so now it's ruined.

454
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:30,564
You sure?
Maybe they can fix that.

455
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,076
No. I know about stains. It's...

456
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:37,205
You know, I never understood that.
I never understood -

457
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,580
live cows get dirty all the time,
they don't get stained.

458
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:45,644
All that leather stands in the mud,
nothing happens. Go figure. What is that?

459
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,949
Exactly.

460
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:54,756
Get a little sauce
on your coat and look.

461
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:56,992
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

462
00:38:57,066 --> 00:39:01,002
We'll have to ask the
next cow that comes by.

463
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,746
A man with a handkerchief. Wow.
I didn't know they made those anymore.

464
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:28,691
I haven't eaten yet. If you haven't eaten yet,
maybe we can go and... get a bite.

465
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:32,023
Someplace close. You know,
I saw a Chinese over here.

466
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:36,936
We could use chopsticks and drop an
endless variety of things on our clothes.

467
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:40,373
I'm sorry, I prefer not to
socialize with students.

468
00:39:40,977 --> 00:39:43,002
Oh. OK. All right.

469
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:46,641
I shouldn't have taken this from you.
I'll buy you a new one.

470
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:50,345
Please. I didn't...
I didn't mean anything by that.

471
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,188
I'll buy you a new one.

472
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:55,247
Excuse me.

473
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:02,559
Mr. Clark, I take dance
very seriously.

474
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,294
Miss Mitzi's is a school,
not a disco.

475
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,837
And I hope you didn't join class
with me as your goal,

476
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:11,965
because you'd be
wasting your time.

477
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:15,974
Don't dance if that's
what you're after.

478
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:37,155
Dance lessons? My husband
is taking dance lessons?

479
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,667
Well, I've found a lot worse hiding
in the potpourri over the years.

480
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:40,828
Consider yourself lucky.

481
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:43,464
What's this beautiful
young woman? Who's she?

482
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,634
His substitute teacher.
His regular teacher's a much older woman.

483
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:49,041
Great legs, but older.

484
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:53,776
Mr. Devine, what would make a man who's
done the same thing for the last 20 years...

485
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,479
suddenly do something so completely
out of character just out of the blue?

486
00:40:57,554 --> 00:40:59,818
That's a question for a shrink.
I'm just a detective.

487
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:04,622
I'm not asking you as a detective.
I'm asking you as a man.

488
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:13,031
Scottie? What would cause
a man after 20 years...

489
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:15,195
to do something completely
out of character out of the blue?

490
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:17,739
- Did I get that right?
- Yeah.

491
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:24,137
"The mass of men
lead lives of quiet desperation."

492
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:27,046
Maybe the desperation
can't be quiet anymore.

493
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:28,447
Bingo.

494
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:30,884
That's a wonderful use
of Thoreau, Scottie.

495
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:33,184
Thank you.
Hello again, Mrs. Clark.

496
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:34,985
Hey.

497
00:41:36,225 --> 00:41:38,853
- Desperation.
- Well, that's a possibility.

498
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:41,556
Mrs. Clark, the point is
your husband's dancing,

499
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:43,292
he's not checking into
hotel rooms.

500
00:41:43,366 --> 00:41:45,527
We can continue to keep an eye
on things for you,

501
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:49,698
but my guess is your husband will hang up
his dancing shoes shortly anyway.

502
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:54,368
- What makes you say that?
- Voice of experience.

503
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:57,777
You give him some time.
He'll be home soon.

504
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:11,693
<i>"The rest is up to you", I tell my clients.
"The rest is up to you."

505
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:14,292
<i>Every few years they come back.

506
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:19,495
<i>So I have these snapshots in my head
of how they've changed over the years.

507
00:42:19,569 --> 00:42:26,099
<i>The ones who've changed the most finally
bought that boat. Moved to that island.

508
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,336
<i>Those who haven't changed...

509
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:33,041
<i>I suppose they take comfort in
knowing what course their lives are on.

510
00:42:33,116 --> 00:42:36,950
<i>They like to believe
they know what lies ahead.

511
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:41,321
Shit!

512
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:07,577
Dad!

513
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,118
Evan!
What are you doing here?

514
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:13,622
Trying to meet up with some friends.
What are you doing here?

515
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,180
Well, you know, work...

516
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:18,716
I had to come to visit a client
over here. I had to come by and...

517
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:21,889
- It's really weird.
- It is?

518
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:26,060
Yeah. Because I've been wanting you
to meet this girl that I'm crazy about,

519
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:30,629
and I'm going to meet her right now
at this bar with my other friends.

520
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:33,699
So can you...
Do you wanna go?

521
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:37,669
Of course I do.
Lead on, my son.

522
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:55,687
Come on, let's get out there.

523
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:59,258
So, does your dad
wanna dance?

524
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:02,668
I don't know. Dad, you haven't
danced in, what, 90 years?

525
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:06,266
You two go. Go.
It's been a long day for me.

526
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,992
Mr. Clark?

527
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:36,335
Mr. Clark?

528
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:38,666
Do you wanna dance?

529
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:44,278
Yes. Yes, I do.

530
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,569
OK.

531
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:47,946
Could you say goodbye
to Evan for me? Thank you.

532
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:49,985
Sure.

533
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:05,325
- Sorry I'm late.
- Don't let it happen again.

534
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,304
Join the warm-up, John.

535
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:16,668
Come on!

536
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,604
Christ, Vern!

537
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:23,210
You're soaking wet, man.
I already had a shower today.

538
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:26,009
- Sorry.
- You're disgusting!

539
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:28,016
You don't have
to put it like that.

540
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:30,780
Why not? It's the truth.
And I prefer to tell the truth,

541
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:34,789
unlike some people who make up stories
about nonexistent fiancées.

542
00:46:34,857 --> 00:46:37,257
What are you talking about?
He's getting married in the fall.

543
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:39,385
Oh, come on.
What, are ya dumb?

544
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:42,954
People who are engaged take the classes
together, or what the hell's the point?

545
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:48,197
Come on, tell the people the truth.
You're not engaged, are you?

546
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,431
Huh?

547
00:46:49,505 --> 00:46:51,530
- Not exactly.
- Uh-huh.

548
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:56,637
- I haven't asked her quite yet.
- Thank you very much.

549
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:02,809
Look, I was gonna lose
some weight first,

550
00:47:02,885 --> 00:47:07,788
and then I was gonna take
her dancing somewhere romantic.

551
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:10,621
And then maybe pop the question.

552
00:47:12,028 --> 00:47:16,465
But I guess if I'm sweating all over the
place, that wouldn't be too romantic, huh?

553
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:19,430
She's a great dancer.

554
00:47:22,371 --> 00:47:26,171
Well, hey, don't listen to me.
What, are you...

555
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:33,309
C'mon, don't be a big baby. I didn't mean
to upset you or anything. Jesus, Vern.

556
00:47:35,151 --> 00:47:37,415
I said I was sorry.

557
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:40,486
Bobbie!

558
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:44,017
Somebody call a doctor.

559
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:46,584
Are you all right? She's out.

560
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:52,333
It's her electrolytes. They get crazy
because she overworks herself.

561
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:55,234
She's been in here twice before.

562
00:47:55,304 --> 00:47:57,795
And it's getting so boring, Mom.

563
00:47:57,873 --> 00:48:01,206
- Shut up, Tina.
- No, you shut up. God, she pisses me off.

564
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:05,077
She pulls a 12-hour shift at
Jimmy's Diner, working five till five,

565
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,945
and then she goes and cooks and
cleans for an old feeb in a wheelchair...

566
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:10,315
to earn extra money
for her crazy costumes.

567
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:14,083
And then she plays Cinderella
every night at dance practice.

568
00:48:14,156 --> 00:48:17,523
- When you should be home, resting.
- I don't need rest.

569
00:48:17,593 --> 00:48:21,029
Right. You need to hang out and flirt with
the shy guy with the nice-smelling sweat.

570
00:48:21,097 --> 00:48:23,657
- She told me all about you.
- Shut up, Tina.

571
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:26,293
I never said his sweat smells nice.
I never said...

572
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,929
She said it was the best-smelling sweat
she'd ever smelled.

573
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:30,131
OK, kill me now.

574
00:48:30,206 --> 00:48:34,472
It's all right, Bobbie. I've smelled
his sweat and I agree, it's not bad.

575
00:48:34,543 --> 00:48:37,535
Well, I mean, it's no field of flowers
after a spring rain...

576
00:48:37,613 --> 00:48:39,945
Yeah, I think we've talked
about this enough.

577
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:43,713
Maybe we should all go home now
and let Bobbie get some rest.

578
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:45,344
- Yeah.
- Bye, sweetheart.

579
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:48,413
Thank you. Thank you.

580
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:05,901
Bobbie needs a partner
for the competition.

581
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,205
Why not you, John?

582
00:49:08,277 --> 00:49:14,079
Me? Competition? No, no, I can't...
She'd never go for it anyway. Forget it.

583
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,951
Why not? What are you talking about?
You heard her daughter - she likes you.

584
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:22,513
And dance begins
with the dancers' feelings.

585
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:26,425
I'll work with the both of you
after class. Two extra hours.

586
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:30,591
The Miss Mitzi Special.
We've got three months.

587
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:34,028
This is good.

588
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:42,235
What do you think?

589
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,477
I think you better
stock up on deodorant.

590
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:59,389
<i>Anything a client says
in a lawyer's office is confidential.

591
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:02,829
<i>So I've gotten used
to holding onto secrets.

592
00:50:02,898 --> 00:50:05,298
<i>They're usually
nothing incriminating.

593
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:09,827
<i>But a lot of people have accounts
they haven't reconciled -

594
00:50:09,905 --> 00:50:13,170
<i>things they're just
not ready to share.

595
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,916
I took the liberty of ordering for you.
Bombay Sapphire, three limes.

596
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:28,150
I hired you to watch my husband.
You're not supposed to be watching me.

597
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:31,091
It's very hard not to, Mrs. Clark -
with all due respect.

598
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,890
- Are you a married man, Mr. Devine?
- I was.

599
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:36,932
- Oh, what happened?
- Unfaithful.

600
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,700
- She hired a detective?
- No, no, no.

601
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:43,670
When she found out,
I was too far gone, so...

602
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:46,139
You're smiling at me.

603
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,802
You are on a strange journey
to redemption, Mr. Devine.

604
00:50:48,878 --> 00:50:51,506
And a very long one, Mrs. Clark.

605
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:57,444
All these promises
that we make and we break.

606
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,818
Why is it, do you think,
that people get married?

607
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:02,585
- Passion.
- No.

608
00:51:02,658 --> 00:51:07,595
That's interesting. Because I would've
taken you for a romantic. Why, then?

609
00:51:08,998 --> 00:51:11,558
Because we need
a witness to our lives.

610
00:51:11,634 --> 00:51:16,367
There's a billion people on the planet.
I mean, what does any one life really mean?

611
00:51:16,438 --> 00:51:22,035
But in a marriage, you're promising
to care about everything -

612
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:26,309
the good things, the bad things,
the terrible things, the mundane things...

613
00:51:26,382 --> 00:51:28,942
All of it.
All the time, every day.

614
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:35,150
You're saying, "Your life will not
go unnoticed, because I will notice it.

615
00:51:35,224 --> 00:51:40,025
"Your life will not go unwitnessed,
because I will be your witness."

616
00:51:43,732 --> 00:51:46,428
You can quote me on that,
if you like.

617
00:51:47,036 --> 00:51:48,333
I'm sure I will.

618
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:51,168
Anyway, the reason
that I called you here today,

619
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,573
to tell you in person that I won't
be needing your services anymore.

620
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:55,837
Oh.

621
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:57,378
I think to continue...

622
00:51:57,446 --> 00:52:02,281
would be an unwarranted invasion
of my husband's privacy and...

623
00:52:02,351 --> 00:52:04,979
Anyway, even though
there was a reason...

624
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:09,684
I'm sorry for what I've done
and I know enough now and...

625
00:52:10,526 --> 00:52:12,653
it's time to stop.

626
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:17,228
Thank you for everything
and... goodbye.

627
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,062
Bye.

628
00:52:22,071 --> 00:52:24,062
Mrs. Clark?

629
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,109
I was right.
You are a romantic.

630
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:39,181
Bobbie!

631
00:52:39,255 --> 00:52:41,314
- A new costume.
- Yeah.

632
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,790
I got it from this mermaid dream
I had in the hospital.

633
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,759
Just floated up from
my subconscious.

634
00:52:45,828 --> 00:52:48,922
Where, tragically,
it did not stay.

635
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:53,299
Come on, partner.
What are you waiting for?

636
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:55,599
Divine intervention?

637
00:52:55,671 --> 00:53:00,904
You're a brave man, John Clark. Not
just anyone could take on the Bobbinator.

638
00:53:00,976 --> 00:53:02,034
Yeah.

639
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,170
Good luck, man.
We're with you.

640
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:08,307
Somebody help me up! Please?

641
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:11,286
John!

642
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:20,054
OK. 55 days from today you two
are gonna win the novice competition.

643
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:23,098
That means you're gonna
have to master five dances.

644
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:26,134
I've asked Paulina
to videotape you tonight,

645
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:28,601
so you can see what
you're doing wrong.

646
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:31,299
Let's start with a rumba.

647
00:53:57,266 --> 00:53:59,666
What? What is it?

648
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:03,364
It's the rumba.
It's the dance of love.

649
00:54:04,506 --> 00:54:06,997
And he's just not
giving me anything.

650
00:54:07,076 --> 00:54:10,011
What does she want me to do?
I'm doing it exactly the way I was taught.

651
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,239
You think it's easy...?

652
00:54:11,313 --> 00:54:16,842
The rumba... is a vertical expression
of a horizontal wish.

653
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:22,755
You have to hold her like the skin
on her thigh is your reason for living.

654
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:28,221
Let her go like your heart's
being ripped from your chest.

655
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:35,764
Pull her back like you're gonna have your
way with her, right here on the dance floor.

656
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,238
And then finish...

657
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:42,339
Like she's ruined you for life.

658
00:54:55,758 --> 00:54:58,522
See? Why can't you
just do it like that?

659
00:54:59,495 --> 00:55:02,794
Anyone else care
for a glass of water?

660
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:06,659
Damn it!

661
00:55:06,735 --> 00:55:08,327
No, not you.

662
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:11,339
Look, I have to call you back.

663
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,568
No, he's not home yet.

664
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:23,182
What was the score at half-time
in the NBA playoffs last night?

665
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,116
Why?

666
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:25,983
Why? You said you watched.
What was the score?

667
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:29,080
- I forget now.
- You didn't forget. You didn't watch.

668
00:55:29,158 --> 00:55:32,025
You don't care about playoffs.
You care about dancing!

669
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:33,527
Shh!

670
00:55:33,595 --> 00:55:35,062
I do not.

671
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,961
Yeah? Then what's this?

672
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:40,399
Give me that! No!
Give me that! Give me...

673
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,994
It's not even mine.
It's my mother's.

674
00:55:44,873 --> 00:55:47,933
At least, it was my mother's until I took it
to this wonderful alterations guy...

675
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,444
who had it tailored for me.

676
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:54,580
Look, it's not like I've
figured this out either.

677
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,813
- Hey, listen...
- What?

678
00:55:57,886 --> 00:55:59,410
- Come back to class.
- No.

679
00:55:59,488 --> 00:56:02,980
You could take over as
Bobbie's partner in the Latin dances.

680
00:56:03,058 --> 00:56:06,425
You've got those knocked already.
There's no way I could learn 'em in time.

681
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,020
I'm not comin' back as
the Bobbinator's partner!

682
00:56:09,097 --> 00:56:11,565
We'll look like an olive
and a toothpick together.

683
00:56:11,633 --> 00:56:13,863
Besides, she would
never dance with me.

684
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:15,733
Sure she would.

685
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:20,173
Just the Latin dances.
I'll still do the waltz and the quickstep.

686
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:22,107
She would.

687
00:56:22,511 --> 00:56:24,069
No!

688
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:28,480
Not if he was the last bald, bad-breathed,
heterosexual sequin-freak on earth -

689
00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:30,882
which he probably is.
I'm not doin' it.

690
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:34,286
You wanna win the Latin competition
or not? It's up to you. I don't care.

691
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:38,349
Link already knows the dances.
And he'll be a good competitor.

692
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:40,418
Right, Link?

693
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:50,863
So, finally giving up
on the underage bimbettes...

694
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:53,066
and gonna go for a real woman?
Is that it?

695
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:58,773
Yeah, no more underage bimbettes for me.
Only real women from now on.

696
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:04,479
Don't even think about coming near me
without a breath mint. You got that?

697
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:07,386
And quit lookin' at my ass.

698
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:09,856
We'll try.

699
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:14,555
Vern, you know, there's a
joyful freedom in your Latin.

700
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:19,590
And Chic, you have an innate sensuality
quite uncommon in a man.

701
00:57:20,602 --> 00:57:24,436
I've entered you both in the
competition along with John.

702
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:28,209
Good. That's settled.

703
00:57:49,731 --> 00:57:52,097
You... are the frame.

704
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:53,634
I'm the frame.

705
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:57,798
- She is the picture...
- She is the picture...

706
00:57:57,873 --> 00:57:59,932
...in your frame.

707
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:03,466
Everything that you do
is to show her off.

708
00:58:04,112 --> 00:58:06,444
- You got that?
- I didn't hear that.

709
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:23,263
Nice. Invite the lady in.

710
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:27,000
And... make the connection.

711
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:33,435
Projecting to the third balcony.

712
00:58:35,944 --> 00:58:38,208
911! 911, quick!

713
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,646
Quick, 911! 9...

714
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:47,378
And start here with an
initial sweep past the crowd.

715
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:49,447
Watch.

716
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,020
And contra-check.

717
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,433
Excellent.

718
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:55,245
Oh, Jesus.

719
00:59:55,323 --> 00:59:56,915
We wanted something unusual.

720
00:59:56,992 --> 00:59:58,323
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

721
00:59:58,393 --> 00:59:59,724
- You sure?
- No, I'm good.

722
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:02,992
But you guys look exhausted.

723
01:00:03,065 --> 01:00:06,626
I tell you what,
why don't we call it a night?

724
01:00:06,702 --> 01:00:10,229
For your sake, John.
You look like you're toast.

725
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:13,502
- And tomorrow's a big day.
- Yeah.

726
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:15,406
- Get home safe.
- OK.

727
01:00:16,078 --> 01:00:18,171
- I'm wearing you guys out.
- No. No, no, no.

728
01:00:18,246 --> 01:00:23,115
It's good. I like it when my feet hurt.
Takes my mind off my knees.

729
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:27,246
I've just been getting carried away, you
know, working hard with the two of you.

730
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:30,723
I guess I like it.
Feels good, you know?

731
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:32,760
For me too.

732
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:37,262
All right.
Well, I'm going home.

733
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:39,527
Hey, wait.

734
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:46,702
I wanted to talk to you about
that night that you asked me to dinner.

735
01:00:46,775 --> 01:00:50,108
I'm sorry about
how I treated you.

736
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:54,143
It's just, you know, that people get
the wrong idea about me all the time.

737
01:00:54,216 --> 01:00:57,242
Paulina, you don't have to
explain anything to me, ever.

738
01:00:57,319 --> 01:01:00,516
Well, I know I don't have
to explain anything to anybody...

739
01:01:00,589 --> 01:01:02,489
because I don't care
what people think about me.

740
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:05,025
Good. Good.

741
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:08,961
- I mean it.
- Yeah, uh-huh. Good. Good.

742
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,438
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be here right now.

743
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:27,176
No, it's OK. I think I'm just
hungry or something.

744
01:01:31,086 --> 01:01:33,281
- Hungry?
- Very.

745
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,385
- Oh, this is so stupid.
- No.

746
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,691
No, not at all. No, no.
I cry too when I'm hungry.

747
01:01:41,763 --> 01:01:44,425
For French fries, usually. You?

748
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:47,325
Cake.

749
01:01:51,907 --> 01:01:54,467
Careful. Don't spill it
on your new coat.

750
01:01:54,543 --> 01:01:57,740
- Old coat, new color. I had it dyed.
- Yeah?

751
01:01:57,813 --> 01:02:00,714
Yeah, my dad did it.
He's a dry-cleaner.

752
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:04,912
As is my mom, my brother,
my two older sisters and me.

753
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:07,352
I told you I know about stains.

754
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:12,291
- You're a dry-cleaner?
- Well, I was. Until I was eight.

755
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,090
Actually, that's when
I started dancing.

756
01:02:15,163 --> 01:02:17,825
I was helping out in the store
one day after school...

757
01:02:17,899 --> 01:02:20,891
when my mom asked me
to go in the back and get an order.

758
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:27,067
It was this incredibly delicate sequined
thing, held together by a gold thread.

759
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:31,169
<i>Well, I carried the costume
like it was gonna break.

760
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:33,680
<i>And then I saw the customer.

761
01:02:33,748 --> 01:02:38,344
<i>She was the most beautiful woman
I had ever laid eyes on.

762
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,154
<i>She invited us to see her dance that night.
And my mother said yes.

763
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:52,330
<i>It was like the whole world had suddenly
gone from black-and-white to color.

764
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,063
<i>The beautiful woman and her partner
stopped right in front of us...

765
01:02:56,137 --> 01:02:58,731
<i>and did a waltz pose.

766
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:02,937
<i>She tilted her head back
and she winked at me.

767
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:07,913
<i>And I felt like she was trying
to tell me something.

768
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:10,349
<i>I took it as a sign.

769
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:15,856
<i>And from then on. I knew that
ballroom dancing would be my life.

770
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:24,924
It wasn't the kind of dream
my parents had in mind.

771
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:28,969
What made you wanna dance?

772
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:31,595
You.

773
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:36,666
Looking out that window,
right up there.

774
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:40,780
You can see it from the train and...

775
01:03:41,683 --> 01:03:47,747
every night I'd come home from work
and I'd look for you, your face.

776
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:53,928
You looked on the outside
the way I was feeling on the inside.

777
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:56,088
I was watching you too.

778
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,428
From the window I saw you
practicing on the platform.

779
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,491
No! Oh...

780
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:10,971
That night I said all those things to you,
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

781
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:15,806
But you kept coming back.

782
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:17,943
I didn't want to.

783
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,889
But I figured if I hadn't, you'd have been
right about everything you accused me of.

784
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:27,520
Then I started dancing and I found
I really liked it. It made me happy.

785
01:04:27,595 --> 01:04:29,722
Yes, it shows.

786
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:35,361
I mean, I feel excited about something
for the first time in such a long time.

787
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:37,029
- Aren't you?
- Excited?

788
01:04:37,105 --> 01:04:40,165
About tomorrow.
The competition.

789
01:04:40,241 --> 01:04:43,233
No, no, no.
I'm petrified. I'm...

790
01:04:44,045 --> 01:04:46,980
I'm gonna forget everything, I won't be able
to put one foot in front of the other,

791
01:04:47,048 --> 01:04:50,347
- I'll make a mess of the whole thing.
- No.

792
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,858
Give me one hour.

793
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,660
Leave it. Leave the light.

794
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:18,034
Don't say anything...
and don't think.

795
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:23,946
And don't move
unless you feel it.

796
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:54,231
Be this alive.

797
01:07:57,639 --> 01:08:00,369
Be this alive tomorrow.

798
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:16,614
Thank you.

799
01:09:18,186 --> 01:09:20,552
God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I lost my balance.

800
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:22,351
Oh, that's OK.
I lost my fiancé.

801
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:23,720
Lisa! Lisa.

802
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,692
- There you are.
- Found the earring.

803
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:34,333
John Clark.
Photo op. Come on.

804
01:09:34,836 --> 01:09:36,360
Smile, everyone.

805
01:09:36,437 --> 01:09:39,133
Paso doble!

806
01:09:40,642 --> 01:09:43,543
- Good luck, everybody.
- Good luck.

807
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:45,476
- Hey.
- Yeah.

808
01:09:45,546 --> 01:09:49,448
So what did I tell you?
Girls love guys who can dance, right?

809
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:52,486
Even I got a partner.
Check it out.

810
01:09:52,553 --> 01:09:54,521
Cute.

811
01:09:54,589 --> 01:09:58,650
- But who's the guy?
- Oh, that's her brother.

812
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:03,228
Yeah, we play basketball together.

813
01:10:09,737 --> 01:10:13,229
Aren't they adorable?
They're gonna get slaughtered.

814
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:15,469
Oh, shh. Don't say that.

815
01:10:17,445 --> 01:10:19,436
Mr. Clark.

816
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,178
John?

817
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:26,643
You look blue. Breathe.

818
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,684
Thanks.

819
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:39,690
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

820
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:43,669
The Chicago Taittinger Trophy
Latin competition will now begin.

821
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:48,368
Judges, this is a semifinal round
with 11 couples on the floor.

822
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:52,402
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
your first dance is the cha-cha.

823
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,209
Music, please.

824
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:20,239
Nice chassé, Vern!

825
01:11:50,338 --> 01:11:52,135
Whoa!

826
01:12:15,663 --> 01:12:18,029
Let's hear it for the cha-cha,
ladies and gentlemen.

827
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:22,195
Who's your favorite couple out there?
Let them hear their numbers.

828
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:26,229
We danced like shit! All you did
was worry about that stupid wig!

829
01:12:26,307 --> 01:12:28,332
Well, what did you
expect me to do? You saw...

830
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:30,639
I know, he's a pig.
But you know what? This is Latin.

831
01:12:30,711 --> 01:12:33,009
The judges are looking
at your hips, not your hair.

832
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:37,039
So unless that thing
looks good on your ass, lose it!

833
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,643
Fine!

834
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:48,021
We love you, baldy!

835
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:50,162
Thank you, dancers.

836
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:53,928
Please take your positions for your
second and final dance of this competition,

837
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:56,526
the paso doble.

838
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:58,196
Music, please.

839
01:13:24,098 --> 01:13:26,692
Looks like he got rid of
a lot more than the wig.

840
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:38,838
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the
final results for the Latin competition.

841
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:42,808
Your finalists are...
couple 102...

842
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:47,071
We did it! Lisa,
we did it, we did it!

843
01:14:47,148 --> 01:14:48,911
Couple 104.

844
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:55,452
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Couple 106.

845
01:14:55,823 --> 01:14:57,791
Couple 109.

846
01:14:57,858 --> 01:15:00,326
Couple 110.

847
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:02,419
And couple 105...

848
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:05,192
has been disqualified.

849
01:15:05,266 --> 01:15:06,665
What?!

850
01:15:12,273 --> 01:15:14,571
I thought Slick Willy
was pretty good.

851
01:15:14,642 --> 01:15:19,011
Bad attitude. Ungentlemanly behavior.
It's a British sport, after all.

852
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,275
- The man was working it.
- Well...

853
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:23,442
Immediately following,
the standard competition.

854
01:15:23,517 --> 01:15:24,711
Ladies and gentlemen,

855
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,752
the Chicago Taittinger Trophy
standard competition will now begin.

856
01:15:29,256 --> 01:15:33,022
Judges, this is a semifinal round
with ten couples on the floor.

857
01:15:33,094 --> 01:15:36,086
They'll be dancing the waltz
and the quickstep.

858
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:38,563
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's bring our dancers out...

859
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:40,498
with a nice big round of applause.

860
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:43,332
Couples 115...

861
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:45,703
Couple 116.

862
01:15:49,944 --> 01:15:51,969
Couple number 117.

863
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:56,682
Couple number 118.

864
01:15:58,052 --> 01:15:59,781
Couple number 119.

865
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:03,282
Couple 120.

866
01:16:03,858 --> 01:16:05,917
Couple 121...

867
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:10,720
Wow.

868
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,700
Come on, come on,
we're gonna be late.

869
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,061
Hey, you're not gonna
choke on me, are you?

870
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:20,073
I think my feet are asleep,
I don't remember anything...

871
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:22,405
Don't worry. You're great.
You look beautiful.

872
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:25,070
And finally, couple number 126.

873
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:42,053
- There they are.
- Yeah. They look nervous.

874
01:16:42,129 --> 01:16:44,324
No, not them. Them.

875
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,965
You invited them?

876
01:16:51,038 --> 01:16:52,972
She said she wanted to be
a witness to her husband's life.

877
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,065
I thought she should witness this.

878
01:16:55,142 --> 01:17:01,342
So you're a marriage counselor now. But
could you at least bill Mrs. Clark for that?

879
01:17:02,249 --> 01:17:05,047
As our dancers take their positions
for their first dance,

880
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:11,490
I'd like to remind the judges that you'll be
recalling six couples for the final round.

881
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:15,893
Ladies and gentlemen,
your first dance is the waltz.

882
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:20,397
Music, please.

883
01:17:46,627 --> 01:17:48,891
Well done!

884
01:17:57,304 --> 01:17:59,295
He's awesome.

885
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:02,305
Dad is awesome!

886
01:18:33,841 --> 01:18:35,832
Spectacular.

887
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:39,009
It's spectacular.

888
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:13,305
- 116!
- Whoo!

889
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:23,686
Way to go, Dad!

890
01:19:28,762 --> 01:19:30,923
Such a beautiful waltz.

891
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:32,898
We weren't terrible.
I can't believe it.

892
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:35,800
Of course we weren't - you were
dancing with me, you big nut.

893
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:39,704
...the second and final dance
of this competition, the quickstep!

894
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:51,580
- Hey, is your daughter here tonight?
- No. Why?

895
01:19:51,652 --> 01:19:54,519
I thought I heard someone
yell at you "Go, Dad."

896
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:20,808
Yes!

897
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:38,421
126!

898
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:40,790
Go, Dad!

899
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,341
Way to go, Dad!

900
01:21:56,477 --> 01:21:58,342
- Beverly!
- Dad.

901
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:00,903
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
- Dad, you were terrific.

902
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:03,711
Get in the car, Jen.
Just get in the car.

903
01:22:03,784 --> 01:22:06,309
Beverly, how did you know?

904
01:22:06,387 --> 01:22:09,823
Because I hired a detective. Yeah.
I thought you were having an affair.

905
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:13,348
- It's ridiculous, I know. OK. I feel...
- Hey, listen, that was really bad luck.

906
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:15,486
Don't worry.
There's always next year.

907
01:22:15,562 --> 01:22:19,794
Oh, "there's always next year." Thanks.
Well, I have a whole year to prepare for it.

908
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:22,802
- Beverly, please, can we talk...
- No, there's nothing to talk about.

909
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:26,101
Please.
Will you please stay here...

910
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:31,970
Stop. No.

911
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:34,207
- Please, will you talk to me?
- If you want to talk,

912
01:22:34,281 --> 01:22:37,910
you can start by explaining what was it
that I just saw in there? What did I witness?

913
01:22:37,985 --> 01:22:39,919
I'm not having an affair.
There was no aff...

914
01:22:39,987 --> 01:22:42,478
What's goin' on?

915
01:22:42,556 --> 01:22:44,581
- Let's go!
- They're new friends.

916
01:22:44,658 --> 01:22:48,492
But you could've told me about it, couldn't
you? You just completely left me out.

917
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:51,725
Why didn't you tell me, John?
You've gotta answer that.

918
01:22:51,799 --> 01:22:54,233
- I was ashamed.
- Ashamed of what? Of dancing?

919
01:22:54,301 --> 01:22:57,031
- Well, no, no...
- Well, then of what?

920
01:22:57,805 --> 01:23:00,103
Of wanting to be happier.

921
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:03,542
When we have so much.

922
01:23:06,914 --> 01:23:09,439
And it's not your fault.

923
01:23:09,516 --> 01:23:13,885
Hey, Fred Astaire!
You're blocking traffic!

924
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,290
Finally! Thank you!

See? I told you. I knew it.
I knew Link Peterson was a freaky bastard.

I think Linky Link might be batting for

Somebody get a magnifying glass!

Fuck you all.

- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey.

944

Surprise.

945
01:25:18,812 --> 01:25:21,076
- This is gorgeous.
- Yeah, it's a pretty spot.

Thanks.

947

to talk to you for a minute.

948

Yeah, I just hope that you weren't
staying away from class on account of me.

I'm not mad about you ripping

I mean, I know you always
wanted to look at my ass...

time to do it, but I forgive you, John.

952
01:25:36,863 --> 01:25:39,058
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Honestly. OK?

953
01:25:39,132 --> 01:25:41,123
Come on, can we tell Miss Mitzi
you're coming back?

954
01:25:41,201 --> 01:25:47,140
I'm sorry, guys, I'm not coming back.
It's... It's... I'm done with that now.

I really appreciate that.

01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,946
Paulina, you know, she's gonna
go to England to study dance,

958
01:25:58,018 --> 01:26:01,715
and we're havin' a little, you know,
going-away party for her...

959
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:06,987
and we'd love for you to come.
Really love it if you would come by.

960
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:10,120
She gave me this
to give to you, so...

961
01:26:14,935 --> 01:26:19,099
Anyway, we hope that
we see you there. All right?

962
01:26:19,172 --> 01:26:20,833

to prove them right.

Oh, OK.

990
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:17,047
But you're not
giving up dancing, are you?

991
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:24,078
You could...
teach me to dance.

992
01:29:27,027 --> 01:29:29,791
Beverly, I'm not
dancing anymore.

993

Why not, Dad?

994
01:29:34,301 --> 01:29:37,702
Why don't you teach
Mom how to dance?

995
01:29:56,857 --> 01:30:01,817
The one thing I am proudest
of in my whole life...

996

is that you are happy with me.

997
01:30:06,933 --> 01:30:11,996
If I couldn't... if I couldn't tell you
that I was unhappy sometimes,

998
01:30:12,072 --> 01:30:17,908
it was because I didn't want to risk
hurting the one person I treasure most.
