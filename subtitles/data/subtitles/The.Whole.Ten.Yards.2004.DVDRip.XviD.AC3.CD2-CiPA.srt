1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,345
If they have Strabo, who has girl?

2
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,484
Answer. Answer, Mother.

3
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:34,039
You okay, darling?

4
00:00:40,684 --> 00:00:42,879
- What's up, Jill?
- Nothing.

5
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:51,118
Open the trunk.
Don't even think about it.

6
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:57,126
Thank you.

7
00:00:58,268 --> 00:01:01,863
- I think you nicked his head there.
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

8
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:04,063
- What is your problem, Jill?
- Nothing.

9
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,801
- I don't have a problem.
- Good.

10
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:09,673
Why don't you go and check us in.

11
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:11,939
Okay.

12
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:18,645
I wouldn't mind you wearing it,
it's just so ugly.

13
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:20,846
- Just throw it away.
- I can't.

14
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:23,788
- You still have feelings for her?
- It's sacrilegious.

15
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,158
- Why not give it back to her?
- I haven't seen her since my nickel in Joliet!

16
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:31,327
Where does he get sayings like that?

17
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:34,637
We aren't gonna talk much, are we?

18
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:37,467
There is something
really wrong with you, Jill.

19
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:40,906
- You're still in love with her.
- That's insane. Isn't it?

20
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,909
- Why don't you let me take it...
- Tell you what:

21
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:52,248
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
- I love you, Jill.

22
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:56,256
But if you touch this crucifix,
I'll kill you. That's a promise.

23
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,961
This is my good luck charm.

24
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,957
I take it off, I'm jinxed.

25
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,964
Wanna see me dead, Jill?

26
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:08,228
Do you?

27
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:10,972
Sometimes, yeah.

28
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:17,507
- I'm going to check in.
- Can you believe this?

29
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:22,744
- Well, 47 percent of couples at some point...
- You know, you've got a very long face.

30
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,784
Like a goldfish...

31
00:02:24,955 --> 00:02:28,083
...or a Shetland pony or something.
- Bring Strabo, Oz.

32
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:31,153
I gotta have you...

33
00:02:44,507 --> 00:02:45,906
Where is she?

34
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:50,135
Look, how nice. Everybody is still here...

35
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:53,510
...having a little repast. Isn't that lovely?

36
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,912
Where else would I be?

37
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,113
I don't know.

38
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,916
One would venture a guess.

39
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:05,187
A question could be asked:
Where have you been?

40
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:08,194
Big loft, very drafty. I understand.

41
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:11,332
Get me Figueroa on the phone!

42
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,662
Mr. G., Frankie Figs is dead.

43
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:19,073
How sad for him.
Try calling the one who's still alive!

44
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:29,584
Jill. Come on, open the door.

45
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:31,243
Jill!

46
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,748
Jill, will you come on? Be sensible.

47
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:37,985
Apologize.

48
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:42,195
Jill, honey, I'm sorry
I pointed a gun at your face...

49
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:44,993
...and said I was gonna
blow your brains out.

50
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:47,363
Okay? I didn't mean that.

51
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:51,268
- Come on, knock it off.
- I will when you get rid of that crucifix.

52
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,410
This cross represents my Lord and Savior.

53
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,738
The baby in the manger.
I throw it away...

54
00:03:56,913 --> 00:04:00,212
...I go to hell!
- Coming from a man who's killed 21 people.

55
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:03,409
- Twenty-one? That's impressive.
- It is, isn't it?

56
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:08,182
Two years, I've been begging you to go
back to work. Cynthia gets kidnapped...

57
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:10,485
...you're off to the races!

58
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,363
Off to the races?

59
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,365
"Apologize, then she'll come right out."

60
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,303
Squeal bag! Squealster!

61
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:24,701
Remington Squeal!

62
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:28,644
See what you got me into? Get over here
and you help me out of this jam.

63
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,874
You better make it good.

64
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,412
Snoodster? Hon?

65
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:37,147
You're gonna be hearing
from somebody else now.

66
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:39,416
Jill? Scooster?

67
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,560
Snoodster.

68
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:46,525
I think you're being a little unreasonable.
When he pulled a gun on you...

69
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,963
...that was pretty funny.

70
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,330
Oz, nobody's talking to you.

71
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,064
Hey, you take it easy on Oz, okay?
He's a doctor.

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,768
- People see him when they have problems.
- People see him when they have plaque.

73
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,804
- He's a wonderful dentist.
- Pipe it, toughie.

74
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:06,543
I promise I'll shoot you. Frankly, I don't care
whether we get Cynthia back or not.

75
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:08,778
Well, that's a bad...

76
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:12,224
- Oh, trouble in the bedroom?
- What'd you just say?

77
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,690
- Nothing.
- Excuse me, please.

78
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:19,126
Did you tell him that?!
Did you tell him that, Jill?!

79
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:23,430
A few moments of erectile dysfunction...
Just a few, really.

80
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:26,595
- And I'm not a man now? Is that it?
- Stop kicking.

81
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:29,139
If you didn't love her, you'd take it off.

82
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,102
- Is that it?!
- Excuse me.

83
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,305
Can we please call Lazlo
and make the switch for Cynthia?

84
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:38,542
No. I'll tell you why we can't do that!

85
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:43,655
Because that would involve me talking to
my wife, which I am never gonna do again!

86
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,654
I'm going to get drunk.

87
00:05:49,829 --> 00:05:52,229
- You believe this?
- Well, erectile dysfunc...

88
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:54,992
Shut up. I'm gonna
go get Jimmy. Will you...

89
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:58,296
...watch Strabo for a while?
- Eat shit.

90
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:01,440
How can he get drunk at a time like this?

91
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:11,181
Maybe this whole "erectile misfiring"
is God's way of punishing me.

92
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,478
He sees all things great and small.

93
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,612
You know, I've done
some very bad things. I lie to Jill.

94
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,156
I don't take the trash out.

95
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,487
- I killed 21 people.
- Actually, 22.

96
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,324
- Who'd I forget?
- Frankie Figs.

97
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:33,361
This is it. This is the reason that God
does not want me to father a child.

98
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,306
He does not want me to spread my seed.

99
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:42,376
God is counting my seed, Oz.
He's probably up in heaven right now...

100
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:47,111
...counting my little seeds. 138, 139...

101
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,279
...140...
- Stop, stop! Stop counting your seed.

102
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:54,017
I don't think God is keeping an eye
on your sperm.

103
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:58,290
What kind of a job is that for God?
It'd take him all day. I'm gonna throw up.

104
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:01,297
Fine. Throw up.
Go ahead, you have your fun.

105
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:04,334
- What about me?
- Why don't you just consider adopting?

106
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,165
Come on, Oz.

107
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:10,298
How many adoption agencies
are gonna give a kid to a professional killer?

108
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:14,105
- You may have a point there.
- Maybe I could just steal a kid.

109
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,510
They're small. How hard can that be?

110
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:19,015
That's the thinking
you gotta get away from.

111
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:22,484
But I'd be a great father, Oz.
I would. I'd be a great dad.

112
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,850
I'd teach the kid how to play baseball.

113
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,219
- I've always been good with a bat.
- True.

114
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:31,124
And, I mean, when I was kid,
I had this cool little slingshot, right?

115
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:35,233
And I could make a slingshot
for my little boy.

116
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:39,394
And I could teach him how to use it.
And if he couldn't get it right away...

117
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:44,100
...I'd be patient. I wouldn't yell at him.
I wouldn't make him cry.

118
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,483
Jimmy, there's a lot of people looking.

119
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,623
Things with the husband
not so well going?

120
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,891
I was thinking...

121
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,402
...if you were to have sex
with another man...

122
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,905
...it would make Jimmy jealous.

123
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,310
Oh, yeah?

124
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:25,209
- Like with who?
- Well, let's say...

125
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,283
...with me, for example.

126
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,553
You look good with a gun.

127
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:45,428
Did you have a good relationship
with your father, Oz?

128
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,233
- We were like pals.
- Like to kill my father.

129
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:51,468
Like to take an ice pick
and stick it right in his eyeball.

130
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,669
Still wanna throw up.

131
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:57,248
Can you help me?
Can you tell me? I mean, what the...?

132
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,681
What the hell is going on here?!

133
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:03,686
Why are we all on this big,
spinning ball that we call Earth?!

134
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:06,791
Why? Why?

135
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,956
You ever hear of avoidance behavior?
I don't wanna talk about that...

136
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,622
Let's talk about avoidance behavior.
Like sitting here in a bar...

137
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:18,430
...drinking shots instead of saving Cynthia?
- She'll be fine, Oz.

138
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:21,095
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you one thing:

139
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:24,801
I am not gonna go out there
and risk my ass for my wife...

140
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:27,138
- My wife!
- Whatever!

141
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,180
I'm not risking my ass before I get
a few things off my chest.

142
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,547
Fine. Say them. What do you wanna say?

143
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,588
- You know I was a bed wetter?
- You don't do it anymore, do you?

144
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,818
At 12, I saw my dad
naked in the shower.

145
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:46,090
Well, that's probably why you wet the bed.
Very Freudian. Jungian.

146
00:09:46,265 --> 00:09:48,893
- We had some great times.
- You and your father?

147
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,729
No! Me and Cynthia!

148
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:55,472
- That's almost vomit.
- What was it like when Cynthia told you...

149
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:59,407
...she was pregnant?
- Oh, well, that was a beautiful moment.

150
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,049
- She's got a great rack, doesn't she?
- I'm sorry?

151
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:06,082
I mean, she was so wild.

152
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,777
So wild. I mean...

153
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,356
...one time we wrecked
an entire suite at the Hotel Drake.

154
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:17,087
- Seven thousand dollars' worth of damage.
- Let's stop talking about you and my wife.

155
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:20,596
I mean, we didn't
come out of the room for four days.

156
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,997
But I don't gotta tell you, do I?

157
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,366
You're married to her,
you lucky son of a bitch.

158
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,608
- What is this thing?
- What we've been building.

159
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:31,107
- Get it out of here!
- Why?

160
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:34,269
Because I hate it!
It makes me sad.

161
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:39,114
What's happening?

162
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:42,049
What's happening now?
Where are you going now?

163
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:54,222
Check.

164
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:13,281
Good morning...

165
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,028
What the hell is this?

166
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,364
Just give me five more minutes, baby.

167
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:41,507
You are really noisy in the morning.

168
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:45,042
Jimmy, what the hell happened
last night?

169
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:49,184
And why does my ass hurt?

170
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:53,851
- You fell down the stairs.
- Oh, good. So nothing happened.

171
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:57,189
Of course not. Not really.

172
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,897
- What does that mean?
- We were just a couple of guys...

173
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:05,060
...helping each other out. That's all.
- I'm sorry, but what does that mean?

174
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:08,298
It was a really magical night, Oz.
Don't ruin it.

175
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,576
- What is it now?
- That thing.

176
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,769
- Oh, this?
- I knew it.

177
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,915
- Oh, my God.
- You guys enjoy your slumber party?

178
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,745
This is not what it looks like. Right?

179
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,149
- Where's Strabo?
- He got away.

180
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:27,624
- I'm kidding. He's right here.
- Okay, well, I'm gonna put some clothes on.

181
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:30,318
- You want some help?
- I think I'm fine. Thank...

182
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,135
- A little male bonding?
- Just like C block, huh, Strabo?

183
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:39,897
I fell down the stairs, Strabo.

184
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,534
Going out to get some coffee.

185
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,211
I should probably
put some clothes on first.

186
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,711
Yeah.

187
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,492
- Hey, Oz, can you come in here for a sec?
- Yes.

188
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,902
Listen, that was not what you...

189
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:13,504
Let me close that.

190
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:17,366
Why are you bottomless?

191
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,773
I hated that skirt.

192
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,117
- You don't like that shirt too?
- Came with the skirt.

193
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,618
I see. I mean, I really see.

194
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:40,698
What are you doing?

195
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,105
Oz.

196
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:50,105
You like my perfume? Smell it.

197
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:55,513
- I've been a little stuffed up, feeling nasally.
- Smell it.

198
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:01,447
Yes. Yes, I do.
It's...

199
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,250
You like my bra?

200
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:11,018
This... Here it is. It's a purple shirt.

201
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,300
- Give me your hand.
- What are you gonna do...

202
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,096
Give it!

203
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,504
Feel my heart.

204
00:14:22,742 --> 00:14:24,642
I don't think that's your heart.

205
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,803
Isn't your heart in between all that?

206
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:31,472
My heart is broken.

207
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:34,014
Can you feel that?

208
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,819
Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I...

209
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:44,890
It's so broken, Oz!

210
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,089
- Jill!
- Oz!

211
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,326
- I'm so sad. Oz!
- Don't be sad.

212
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,095
What's all this?

213
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:58,199
First my ex-wife and now my wife-wife.

214
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:00,641
No, no, no. She just hated her outfit.

215
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:05,410
- He wants to talk to you for a second.
- No, you.

216
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,522
I've been waiting a long time for this, Oz.

217
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:24,065
Oz? I think Oz is gonna be out
for a good half-hour, 45 minutes, Jill.

218
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,337
I didn't... I just...

219
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,742
Jimmy, I...

220
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:39,741
You do love me, don't you?

221
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:58,933
Up on your toes. Stand up.
Come on, tippy-time, tippy-time.

222
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,869
- Why can't I stay in here?
- There you go. Sit down.

223
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,407
Read a nice book.

224
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,146
Oh, God!

225
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,751
- Yeah, baby!
- That feels so good!

226
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,683
She just hated her outfit.

227
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:20,225
Yippee ki-yay!

228
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,592
Yeah!

229
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:35,272
You believe I fell down the stairs, right?

230
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,671
What stairs?

231
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:05,067
- Hello?
- Bring me the phone.

232
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,104
- Put Liberace on.
- Is this who I think is this?

233
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:11,675
- Back from the dead?
- Yeah, Lazlo, skip the formalities.

234
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:15,109
Call you at 2:00 and tell you
where we'll make the exchange.

235
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:19,650
Well, it better be 2 on the dot
or I start cutting off the batch's fingers...

236
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,515
...one at a time! Wouldn't that be nice...

237
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,918
...to get little pieces of the girl?

238
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,081
One, two, three...

239
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:29,921
...little tiny pieces.
- Drop dead.

240
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:32,330
- What'd he say?
- He said hi.

241
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,431
- We'll need more firepower.
- I got guns. All you need.

242
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:38,126
Oz, you stud.

243
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:02,153
- Here they are. What do you think?
- Oh, my God!

244
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:05,991
- Oh, my God, you have an H and K MP5K.
- Can we hurry? It's almost 2.

245
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,690
We're gonna be fine.
Oh, wait, can I see this?

246
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:11,268
- Allow me. I got it.
- Okay.

247
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:14,167
Gotta be careful with these things.

248
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,502
I got it.

249
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,283
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, topnotch.

250
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:35,257
It's almost 2. We've gotta
load them up and move them out.

251
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:37,861
- Don't screw around.
- Careful.

252
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,520
- All right.
- There.

253
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,903
I got it. I got it.

254
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,971
Hold on, Oz.

255
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:10,059
Would you be careful of the fixtures?

256
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:16,232
I hurt the side part of my head.

257
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:21,468
Nice guns. Put them in the back seat.

258
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,477
You made her carry all the guns, Oz?

259
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,780
Okay, can we call Lazlo? It's after 2.

260
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:32,314
Jimmy, you're late.

261
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:34,418
Bring Cynthia to the Beverly Center.

262
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:38,050
- Meet at the food court in an hour.
- I wanna talk to my son.

263
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:40,817
You're gonna have to
hold on a minute.

264
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,188
- Go get Strabo.
- I'll get Strabo.

265
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,421
- I just said that.
- Right.

266
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,525
Go.

267
00:19:58,143 --> 00:19:59,440
Strabo.

268
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:02,141
Damn it!

269
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,111
I can't find Strabo.
I think he's gone.

270
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:08,182
- What?
- He's not where we left him.

271
00:20:08,354 --> 00:20:09,878
Hold on.
What do you mean?

272
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,454
I'm holding, I'm holding.

273
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:13,523
There's just pieces of wood...

274
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,354
- Where the hell is Strabo, people?
- In the trunk.

275
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:21,433
Okay. How did Strabo
get in the trunk, Oz?

276
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:25,164
- I don't know.
- Well, get him out.

277
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,004
- Where are the keys?
- In here, with me.

278
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,473
- It keeps getting better.
- Why's he in the trunk?

279
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:35,306
I don't know! You were
supposed to be watching him!

280
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,743
Tulip!

281
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:39,145
- Hold on, Lazlo.
- All right, you know what?

282
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:42,185
No more holding.
Put my son on the phone now!

283
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,684
- Your son's...
- Strabonitz?

284
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,654
- Your son's in the trunk right now.
- The trunk? I wanna talk to my son!

285
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:59,471
Strabo, your father
wants to talk to you.

286
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,504
What?

287
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,378
- Did you get the gist of that?
- Yes.

288
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,473
You locked my son in the trunk?

289
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,345
No, no, sir. No, sir.
He locked himself in there.

290
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:20,016
This I believe. Fine.
You have a spare key?

291
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,127
- A spare key?
- No. Car Ranch Rentals only gave us one.

292
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:26,196
- Negative on the spare key.
- What about a locksmith?

293
00:21:26,432 --> 00:21:29,560
- Do you know of one in the area?
- It's your town, dentist.

294
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:34,434
You should know where a...
Fine, you know what, Mr. Brain?

295
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,569
The trunk release button,
how about that?

296
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:40,906
Every car since 1985 has
a trunk release button.

297
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,345
Find it, open the trunk
and let my boy out.

298
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:48,680
There's a button on the driver's side.
Every car since 1985...

299
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,326
We kill them the moment we
see them. In the head.

300
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:58,721
- I can't find it.
- What kind of piece of shit car is this?

301
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:01,263
- Well, Car Ranch Rentals.
- It's a hitter!

302
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:05,062
- A hitter. Lazlo's got a hitter on us.
- Did you hire a hitter?

303
00:22:05,237 --> 00:22:08,297
Did I? I don't remember, really.

304
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:12,035
- Is someone shooting at you?
- Your hitter is hitting at us!

305
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,404
That's bad. My son is there!

306
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:19,210
- Tell the hitter to stop.
- Your boss says to stop.

307
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:21,579
- His son's with us. Stop!
- This is Lazlo.

308
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:24,415
- Stop shooting!
- That's a direct Hungarian order!

309
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,723
Let me find speakerphone.

310
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,120
- Cease fire!
- What's going on? Talk to me.

311
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:31,592
He's not listening to you.

312
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,323
Well, you should fire him.

313
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:38,263
- Are you kidding?
- That was me.

314
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:40,371
- Try not to shoot Oz, honey.
- Yeah.

315
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:47,837
Let's go, kids!

316
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,955
Get up!

317
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,261
You are in no danger.

318
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,627
If she moves,
put your cane through her eye.

319
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,211
Unbelievable.

320
00:23:27,686 --> 00:23:30,519
- How did you do that?
- Every car since 1985...

321
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:32,623
...had a little button right here.

322
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:39,388
All right, come on out of there...

323
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:49,638
- What is this?
- That's a dead hostage, Oz.

324
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,106
- That is what that is.
- That can't be good.

325
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,211
No, you're right. That's not good.

326
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:58,179
It looks like he got shot in the foot.
Who dies from a shot in the foot?

327
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,944
He probably got shot when
the hitter was shooting.

328
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,815
That's really great. Well done, Jill.

329
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:05,854
Hey, look, shit happens.

330
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:07,821
That's right.
Shit happens, to you.

331
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:09,426
All the time!

332
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:13,053
You know why? Because you don't
follow the ABC's of killing.

333
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,223
- There's an ABC's of killing?
- Shut up!

334
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,096
How was I supposed to know
he'd climb in the trunk?

335
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,999
- That's a good question.
- I mean...

336
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,265
I know! How about you
just watch him...

337
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,341
...and you don't let him
climb in!

338
00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:28,775
I am a professional marksman.
It's not my job to babysit...

339
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,814
You know what? I think
you have to hit something...

340
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:34,248
...to count as a marksman.
- Ozzie. Harriet.

341
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,580
Can we stop fighting and go get my wife?

342
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:40,851
Well, you can just forget about
that, Oz. Cynthia is as good as dead.

343
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:43,017
- What? Don't say that.
- I am saying it.

344
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,629
She's as good as dead.
We have nothing...

345
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:48,994
...thanks to Jill. Look at this guy.
- Don't pin this on me!

346
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:51,792
If I'm a screwup,
what are you doing with me?

347
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,461
You know what?
That's a really good question.

348
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,301
I'm out of here.

349
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,568
Well, you're not going, are you?

350
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:04,072
Hold on a minute.
You're gonna need the keys.

351
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:07,414
- Bye-bye.
- I'm serious.

352
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:11,519
If I get in that car, you're
never gonna see me again.

353
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,022
Careful backing out, hon.

354
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:17,184
Let's go.

355
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,364
Bag.

356
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:25,797
Why don't you take your pal Strabo
with you. Remember him?

357
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:28,337
The Hungarian mobster
that you let die?

358
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,498
He's sorry. He's very sorry!

359
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,680
She's coming back. I mean,
she's gonna come back, right?

360
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:41,444
- I don't think so.
- Oh, well, this is just great.

361
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,212
What are we gonna do now?

362
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:45,151
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

363
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,451
You're on your own, Oz.

364
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:52,530
I thought we were friends.

365
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:58,093
Well, that's what you get
for trusting a contract killer, Oz.

366
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:09,272
You son of a bitch.

367
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:16,516
You can't do this to Cynthia. Okay?

368
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:21,022
Not okay. Your darling Cynthia's
not completely innocent in all this, Oz.

369
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:25,721
- What? What does that mean?
- Shit, shit, shit! Jill took my bag!

370
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:28,593
So?
- So there was something really important...

371
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:30,667
...in the other bag, okay, Oz?

372
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,255
Great.

373
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,795
- Hello.
- Dentist, you hung up on me.

374
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:01,194
- Are you insane?
- Lazlo.

375
00:27:01,366 --> 00:27:04,563
- Hey, there was a button in the trunk.
- That's great news.

376
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:08,635
- Put my son on the phone, damn it!
- He's...

377
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:12,072
We're gonna have to
push back that meeting, Lazlo.

378
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:14,439
No, no. No pushing.
Put him on the phone.

379
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:18,379
I'm sorry, what? I can't hear you.
There seems to be a little static.

380
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,111
- Are you going through a canyon?
- Am I going through a canyon? No.

381
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:23,749
Hello?

382
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,049
- Hello?
- Lazlo? Lazlo?

383
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,052
Dentist! Can you hear me?

384
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:33,963
You're seconds from dead.

385
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:39,799
Strabonitz.

386
00:27:58,623 --> 00:27:59,920
Hey, Jill.

387
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:02,582
- It's me. How you doing?
- Let me ask you something.

388
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:04,991
If you hadn't taken the wrong bag,
would we be talking?

389
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,290
- Are you mad or something?
- Get real.

390
00:28:07,466 --> 00:28:08,899
- I mean, seriously.
- No.

391
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,433
All right? You happy now?

392
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:14,071
I chased you away
so I could protect you, Jill.

393
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,231
- I don't know why you don't believe that.
- I don't believe you.

394
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:18,933
- Jill.
- I don't trust you.

395
00:28:19,144 --> 00:28:22,272
How am I supposed to have a kid
with somebody I don't trust?

396
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:26,847
Forget it. I don't even know if
I wanna have a kid with you anymore.

397
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:28,649
Hold on a minute.

398
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:32,915
I think that if I were pregnant
right now, I wouldn't even tell you.

399
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:36,925
If you had a son and l...
And you were his mom and I was his dad...

400
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,790
...you wouldn't let me see him?

401
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:40,591
- Not once.
- Don't say that.

402
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,823
- Take it back right now.
- I'm not.

403
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:46,266
You better tell me everything now
or I'm not gonna help you.

404
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,133
How far back does this thing go?

405
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,206
Like a couple days or something.

406
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:54,311
You're so full of it.
You're gonna lie to me more?

407
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:56,504
All right, months.
You happy now?

408
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:58,478
And why was Cynthia in on it?

409
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,140
I wanted to keep you
out of harm's way.

410
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,377
- You trusted her not to get hurt.
- Jill.

411
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:06,149
I gotta go help Oz. For me to do that,
I've gotta go up there.

412
00:29:06,324 --> 00:29:09,987
- Just do everything I told you, all right?
- Don't worry.

413
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:13,688
I'll remember everything you told me.

414
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,839
Call Mrs. Himelfarb,
remind her to floss...

415
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:30,106
...cancel my appointments
for the rest of my life...

416
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,842
...send in as much nitrous as you can,
call the FBI.

417
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:34,485
- What?
- Call the FBI!

418
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,283
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

419
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:40,287
I'll tell you.
Everything's wrong.

420
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,551
Take a look around you.
Nothing's right.

421
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:47,462
Cynthia got kidnapped by Hungarian killers.
And instead of calling the FBI...

422
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:50,658
...or the police,
like every other rational man, I thought:

423
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:55,329
"Hey, let's try to get in contact with
somebody else that kills a lot of people."

424
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,943
So I went down to Mexico,
which is heavily underdeveloped...

425
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,135
...and I asked him to help me.
Did he?

426
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:04,407
No, he didn't help me out.
He didn't help me out!

427
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:06,915
Know what he did?
He put on bunny slippers...

428
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:10,077
...he shot at me and then
he cooked me some chicken!

429
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:14,955
I'm gonna be okay.

430
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:16,457
I'm gonna calm down...

431
00:30:16,628 --> 00:30:21,065
...I'm gonna go downstairs and I'm gonna
take a nice, leisurely drive in my Porsche.

432
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:25,134
Wait a minute. I can't drive my Porsche,
because I don't have one anymore.

433
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,771
That's gone, that's history,
that's archives!

434
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:31,568
We left the Porsche so we could get
on a bus and rent some other car.

435
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,041
And you know why?
Because I don't. Do you?

436
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:37,272
Some kind of GPS,
I don't know, system.

437
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:43,544
- What's that smell?
- I'll tell you what that smell is. It's me.

438
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:45,849
I smell. And you know why?

439
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:49,255
I've been wearing this suit
for three days. I smell like ass.

440
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:51,952
Or foot. Or some kind of foot...

441
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,829
...that's been lodged up deep, deep, deep
inside an ass. I'll tell you the worst thing:

442
00:30:57,002 --> 00:31:01,371
I woke up naked next to another
naked man who admittedly wets the bed.

443
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:04,531
So if you talk to anybody
or anybody calls here...

444
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:08,840
...you tell them I fell down
a flight of stairs.

445
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:11,107
- Yes, sir.
- Don't "Yes, sir" me!

446
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:14,183
- Call the FBI.
- Calling. I'm calling.

447
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,183
Dial F-B-I.

448
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:20,217
Call the FBI and tell them
I fell down a flight of stairs!

449
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:41,009
Going to the feds is the thing
that's gonna get Cynthia killed.

450
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,174
What are you doing here?
I don't need you anymore.

451
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,875
I can handle this on my own.
I'm an adult.

452
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,488
You okay?

453
00:31:56,661 --> 00:31:58,094
Thanks.

454
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:03,826
Let's face it, Oz. Kicking ass is not
your expertise. That's my job.

455
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:07,932
Hanging on to the woman you love
is where I fall a little short.

456
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:10,639
- How do you do that?
- What?

457
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,743
That. That.

458
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:16,371
One minute I wanna kill you,
the next minute you got me...

459
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:20,046
...feeling sorry for you.
- Oz, you really are a good guy.

460
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:24,086
And I don't want you, Cynthia or anyone
else paying for my past sins.

461
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:26,985
I thought you said friendship
was overrated.

462
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,718
I'm a liar.

463
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:34,062
- So, what do we do?
- Go get Cynthia.

464
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:36,757
- How?
- You just leave that to Jimmy Tudeski.

465
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,592
- God, Julie. Julie, Julie...

466
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,829
...don't call the FBI!
- Julie who?

467
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:43,997
My receptionist.
Your wife's replacement.

468
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:50,738
- Julie, what did you do?
- I chloroformed his ass.

469
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:52,712
Why?
You don't have to tell me why.

470
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:56,217
Now, you can go quietly or your ass
can get the chloroform too.

471
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:00,783
- What kind of receptionist are you?
- The kind that doesn't forget...

472
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,792
...who murdered her brother.
- What?

473
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:06,590
Look, I'm gonna get
the temp agency on the phone.

474
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:10,599
Don't you dare make a move,
Dr. Oseransky. Keep your ass right there.

475
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,932
Julie. Julie, if that is your real name...

476
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:17,131
My name is Jules. Jules Figueroa.

477
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:26,373
- Frankie Figs?
- Frankie Figs.

478
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:30,954
You remember that? He was my brother.
And I do believe you knew him.

479
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,653
- I'll take that chloroform now.
- Yeah, I know you will.

480
00:33:53,945 --> 00:33:58,109
- You smell great, baby.
- Oz.

481
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:02,779
You know, I don't have to be
at work today. We can:

482
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:07,481
Oz.

483
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:18,869
Jimmy.

484
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:22,198
Jimmy. Jimmy!

485
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:29,240
It's been a long time since
I've been chloroformed.

486
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:31,712
Still got that little zing to it,
though.

487
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:36,346
Tastes like they put a bunch of pennies
in your mouth, doesn't it?

488
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:39,119
Jimmy, I'm sorry.

489
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,780
- I didn't find it.
- What?

490
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:42,449
You've been here three days.

491
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,891
- I got into the safe. It's not there.
- Safe?

492
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:47,327
- It's here somewhere.
- This isn't exactly...

493
00:34:47,498 --> 00:34:50,126
...what we talked about, either.
- Calm down.

494
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:53,134
- What do mean, "Calm down"?
- All right? I'm on it.

495
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:57,400
What safe? Why are you guys
talking together so much?

496
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:14,186
Have you been involved in this
from the beginning?

497
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,689
- Oz...
- Correct me if I'm wrong...

498
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:18,692
...but we took vows.

499
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:21,889
One was you're not
supposed to pretend you're kidnapped...

500
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:25,331
...and get your husband shot at
while he's trying to save you.

501
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:28,232
- That was uncalled for.
- I'm not a lawyer...

502
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:31,170
...but I believe this is grounds for divorce.

503
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:33,606
And what is that sound?

504
00:35:33,778 --> 00:35:37,214
- That's chain saws.
- Chain saw. Check.

505
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:39,580
Hack tub.

506
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:43,115
What is that for?

507
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:46,784
- What is it?
- They hack us up into pieces in that...

508
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:50,359
...so blood doesn't get everywhere.
- I see.

509
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:54,262
They put the hacked-up
pieces in those bags.

510
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:57,924
- Are you done?
- Yes, he's done.

511
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:05,075
Jimmy Tulip.
The rat-shit scum of Chicago.

512
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,372
Mr. Tough Guy...

513
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:12,175
...served up to me on a platter
by the pretty black girl.

514
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:15,451
That stings.

515
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,383
I made you who you are
and you stab me in the heart...

516
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:22,118
...with something sharp.

517
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:23,885
He made you who you are?

518
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:28,531
Oh, yes. Could not fire a slingshot
until I taught him how.

519
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,294
"Pay attention, little boy. Hold it firm.

520
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:34,802
Stop crying and watch.
Like this."

521
00:36:39,243 --> 00:36:42,838
- Where's Strabo?
- I'm pretty sure he's with Janni right now.

522
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:50,815
Where is my son?

523
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:59,930
- Where's my boy?!
- All right, that's it. I've had enough.

524
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:02,328
- Oz.
- No. If you ever wanna see your son...

525
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,764
...alive again, you'll let
us go right now.

526
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:06,870
Is that right?

527
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:09,199
Yeah, that's right.

528
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:12,070
And if we're not out of here by 11:00...

529
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:17,340
...Jill's gonna put one in Strabo's forehead,
just like Jimmy put one in Janni's forehead.

530
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:21,944
- It wasn't pretty.
- Give me a gun.

531
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,951
- Not bad, Oz.
- Thanks.

532
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,555
- I think it's Jimmy's wife.
- What?

533
00:37:28,726 --> 00:37:30,193
No. That was going so well.

534
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,090
- What is this?
- I wanna come in...

535
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:33,924
...and talk business with you.

536
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:35,793
- Or else.
- Or else what?

537
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:39,562
Or else I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to blow Strabo's head off.

538
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:42,035
Oh, no, no, no.
Strabo, you all right?

539
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,140
He's fine.

540
00:37:49,814 --> 00:37:52,715
He can't talk, he's duct-taped.

541
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,344
I got this car wired with explosives.

542
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:58,981
- You let me in, he'll be fine.
- Fine.

543
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:03,958
Come in, do whatever you want, apparently.
Get the broad! Get the car! Get the Strabo!

544
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,392
Wait a minute.
What is in the big purse?

545
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,195
- Nothing, it's... I'm good.
- It's what?

546
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,837
- Take a right.
- This way.

547
00:38:14,005 --> 00:38:17,338
What the fook are you
assholes up to now?

548
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:19,703
Look who's here.

549
00:38:20,912 --> 00:38:23,710
Can I ask you a questionnaire
how you found this place?

550
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,246
Nice Porsche you got.

551
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,407
You still have the Porsche?

552
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:30,349
Let me explain when we all get
a moment together...

553
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:33,183
...the concept of the secret hideout.
- All right!

554
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,757
Drop your weapons now
and slide them to me...

555
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:40,023
...or I press the button and Strabo gets
blown to little Hungarian meatballs.

556
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:43,565
- Don't push nothing.
- I'm gonna push it. Drop them! Now!

557
00:38:43,734 --> 00:38:45,065
- Drop them!
- Drop it.

558
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,227
- Go ahead. Come on.
- On the floor.

559
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:49,805
Kick them over. Step away.

560
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,802
- Untie Oz and Cynthia.
- No untying...

561
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,709
- Do it! Untie them.
- Let's see where it's going.

562
00:38:57,882 --> 00:39:00,112
All right. Come on, come on.

563
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:04,482
Aren't you forgetting something?

564
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,317
Am I forgetting something?
I don't think so.

565
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:09,993
- They had a terrible fight.
- Did they?

566
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:15,360
- What if I had something you want?
- I would be baffled, to begin with.

567
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:17,057
Or, more precisely...

568
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:21,568
...half of something you want.

569
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,702
Don't.

570
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:27,440
You have Jimmy's half.

571
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:32,373
- Would you cut me in for a slice?
- You want a slice of the pee?

572
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,582
Maybe...

573
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,417
- Keep talking.
- I wanna work for you.

574
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,491
- Of course you do.
- I don't have any allegiances.

575
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,096
I'm all yours. And I could be your
most valuable hitter.

576
00:39:48,466 --> 00:39:51,162
You shut up or I'll
blow your brains out!

577
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:56,597
First thing I'm going to need
is my son Strabo in my company.

578
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,639
Secondly, maybe a little test.

579
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:01,710
I'm thinking, kill Jimmy.

580
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:05,138
In the melon. One shot.

581
00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:07,682
- What do you say?
- Name the time and place.

582
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:10,883
Is now good for you?

583
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:18,484
- Right here, right now?
- Right now.

584
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:26,834
- You gotta be kidding me, right?
- What the hell are you doing?

585
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,231
Take your little cross back.

586
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:32,433
What'll you do without
your good luck charm?

587
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,544
- Stop screwing around.
- Shut up, Oz!

588
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:38,648
That's right, Jill, stop screwing around.
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

589
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:41,876
Just tell me you're not
still in love with Cynthia.

590
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,021
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?

591
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:47,817
She's my ex-wife. I still have feelings
for her and I always will.

592
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:50,493
- That's a really bad answer.
- Shut up, Oz.

593
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:53,289
You can't even just say it, can you?

594
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:54,761
Just say it.

595
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:58,767
This is reminding me now
of my favorite soup opera:

596
00:40:58,936 --> 00:41:01,234
The Hourglass of My Sand Children.

597
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:07,607
Listen, you're either a shooter
or you're not.

598
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:10,440
I am. I am.

599
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:12,246
I am.

600
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,275
Here's an idea for you:

601
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:17,717
- Got an elevator shaft around here, Lazlo?
- I'm sorry?

602
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:21,692
Because I could fall down that,
you know. Die that way.

603
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:24,623
- Stop.
- That would be the only way to get killed.

604
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:27,854
- Shut up!
- You couldn't even hit that lamp over there.

605
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:31,927
I'll give you a tip. You wanna hit that
lamp, you should aim at me.

606
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,295
She aimed and hit the lamp.

607
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:36,997
She aimed and hit the lamp.

608
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:40,302
- Lucky shot.
- I'm gonna give you one last chance, baby.

609
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:42,139
You don't have the balls.

610
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,009
- This from a guy who rarely gets it up.
- We never had that problem.

611
00:41:46,183 --> 00:41:48,549
Not helping.
Why isn't anybody helping?

612
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,382
I think you have to be in love
with someone to get it up, Jill.

613
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,020
Shoot him.

614
00:41:55,192 --> 00:41:57,057
You're never gonna be a hit girl...

615
00:41:57,228 --> 00:42:01,927
...just a stupid, stumbling, bumbling,
can't-kill-anything ex-dental assistant.

616
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,902
- Jimmy, Jimmy.
- He's dead?

617
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,275
- Yes?
- He's dead. He's dead!

618
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:22,385
He's dead! I didn't think you
had it in you, quite frankly.

619
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,920
Don't cry. Everything's going
to be fine. Go get Strabo, now.

620
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,390
Give me this. For the record,
this is, what, a garage door opener?

621
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:32,526
Very clever.

622
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:38,033
So clever, I want you to keep
that aimed at her, please.

623
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:41,638
- Wait. I thought we had a deal.
- "I thought we had a deal." No.

624
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:45,704
Locked.

625
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:54,651
Lazlo, the car is loaded with Primacord.

626
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:58,652
I'm sure it is.

627
00:42:59,256 --> 00:43:03,056
The first dollar
I ever stole is back together.

628
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:21,072
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

629
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:27,884
You killed Strabonitz.

630
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:32,751
Oh, look what I did.

631
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,521
Good work, Jimmy.
"Jammy, Jammy."

632
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,199
Nice work with that chair, Oz.
Way to go, Cyn.

633
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,268
- Come here, baby.
- You're alive?

634
00:43:46,437 --> 00:43:47,995
I mean, good, but you...

635
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:54,845
Don't even think about it. You were
in on this whole thing from the beginning!

636
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:58,106
Of course. It's an old routine.
It's the Skokie Switcheroo.

637
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:01,911
"The Skokie Switch..."? Where do
you guys come up with these names?

638
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:04,850
I just watched my friend
get shot through the heart.

639
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:08,549
- Larry's House of Halloween.
- And what is the deal with that lamp?

640
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:10,694
I saw her shoot the lamp.

641
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:14,194
The first round was live, the rest
were blanks. Try and keep up.

642
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:17,664
- We are gonna have such a talk later.
- Sons of batches!

643
00:44:19,103 --> 00:44:22,834
So how far back does this go?
Hell, you were shooting at me in Mexico.

644
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:25,066
Was that all part of the plan?

645
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:27,369
As a matter of fact, it was, yeah.

646
00:44:28,012 --> 00:44:31,971
- You killed my Strabo!
- Actually, Strabonitz was already dead.

647
00:44:32,149 --> 00:44:34,674
Your hitter got him
when she was shooting at us.

648
00:44:34,919 --> 00:44:38,150
- This true?
- Lazlo, shit happens.

649
00:44:38,322 --> 00:44:39,721
Shit...

650
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,482
Yeah, watch this shit happen.

651
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:47,889
- All right. Take it easy.
- Was that real? Is she really dead?

652
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:49,930
I mean, was that a fake bullet?

653
00:44:50,801 --> 00:44:55,795
Jimmy, let me propose something
before you start the killing.

654
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:59,875
Regroup the Gogolak gang.
Fifty-fifty, you and me.

655
00:45:00,044 --> 00:45:04,538
Like the old days.
Murder, mayhem, a couple of laughs.

656
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:09,317
I don't think so, Lazlo.
Jill, tie him up.

657
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,512
- Wait.
- What am I gonna tie him up for?

658
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,554
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, he said...

659
00:45:13,724 --> 00:45:15,248
I said that, but we can't.

660
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:18,418
Of course you can't.
You can't kill anybody for real.

661
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:20,120
I can. It's point-blank range.

662
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:22,458
I didn't mean you can't shoot him...

663
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:25,067
...I mean you just can't shoot him.
- Come on.

664
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:27,761
- You said I'll make my bones.
- On somebody else.

665
00:45:27,938 --> 00:45:30,338
- You can't kill him.
- How do you "make bones"?

666
00:45:30,508 --> 00:45:32,703
She wants to make a name for herself.

667
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:34,208
You said I could!

668
00:45:34,411 --> 00:45:36,743
- Will you just listen?
- Tell me why.

669
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:39,348
- You heard what he said!
- Tell me why not!

670
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:41,678
Because he's my father!

671
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,788
- Even I didn't know about this.
- See? See?

672
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:50,222
It doesn't feel good to not be involved
in the plan, to not know what...

673
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:54,357
- He's your father?
- I raised you as one of my own.

674
00:45:54,899 --> 00:45:57,834
- That's far enough.
- I made him a man!

675
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:02,568
A man who can't kill his papa.

676
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:09,175
Step aside, Jill. It could go right through.

677
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:14,607
Jimmy.

678
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,853
- Jill, shoot Papa in the foot.
- Straight through or leave a souvenir?

679
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:25,790
- Souvenir.
- Wait.

680
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,260
That's gotta hurt.

681
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:34,929
- Who is that? The fake police?
- Okay, we gotta go.

682
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:38,768
I'm not going anywhere until somebody
tells me what this is all about.

683
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:43,175
Cynthia, help me get Oz out of here.
Thanks for the inheritance, Pops.

684
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:47,672
- Way to go, Cyn.
- You'll never live to spend a dime, Jimmy!

685
00:46:58,729 --> 00:47:01,391
We're rich! We're rich!

686
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,229
- Baby, you were so good.
- I had a good teacher.

687
00:47:06,403 --> 00:47:10,362
I'm so glad we're so overjoyed.
I've never been this confused in my life.

688
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,906
I think you dropped this a while back.

689
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:16,604
No, just borrowing it
from an old friend, that's all.

690
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,647
- Don't need it anymore, Cyn.
- Okay.

691
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:21,808
Would somebody tell me
what's going on?

692
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:25,147
This is what's going on.
See that number right there?

693
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:28,519
That is Lazlo Gogolak's main account
in the Grand Caymans.

694
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:32,594
Somewhere around 280 million dollars,
half of which is yours.

695
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,157
Your tooth-pulling days are over, Oz.

696
00:47:35,332 --> 00:47:37,266
- That was the plan?
- Yes!

697
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:40,469
- Were you in on it?
- I didn't know until this afternoon.

698
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:42,503
Why couldn't I have been involved?

699
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:44,937
I could have played a part.
I minored in theater.

700
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:47,509
Two hundred and eighty million dollars?

701
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,978
That's it. This is too much.
It's great, but it's too much.

702
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:54,912
- Any more surprises?
- Just one.

703
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:57,076
- What?
- I guess the doctors were wrong.

704
00:47:57,554 --> 00:47:59,351
- What do you mean?
- I'm pregnant.

705
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:01,320
Oh, my God, congratulations!

706
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:03,521
Oh, my God, are you serious?

707
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,317
I'm gonna be a dad?

708
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:17,030
We're not gonna start
with that again, are we?

709
00:48:22,946 --> 00:48:25,847
Put the top up, okay?
It's just... It's embarrassing.

710
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:34,883
- Come on, come and get me.
- Freeze, right there!

711
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:39,796
- Cross, cross.
- Watch it, buster.

712
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:45,162
Anybody for cookie, coffee, tea?

713
00:48:45,335 --> 00:48:47,496
Mother, please.

714
00:48:48,772 --> 00:48:52,970
One of you, could
you just shoot me? Please.
