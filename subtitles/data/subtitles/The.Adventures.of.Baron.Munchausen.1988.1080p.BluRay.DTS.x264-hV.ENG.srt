1
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,575
Help me.

2
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,375
And so, as the sun rose...

3
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:26,606
over the island of Cheese...

4
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,671
casting long shadows
through the sausage bushes...

5
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:33,651
illuminating the tops
of the honey trees...

6
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,382
and warming the fields
of smoked salmon...

7
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,687
I, Baron Munchausen...

8
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,059
who am renowned first and foremost
for telling the truth...

9
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,964
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

10
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,569
For while it has been
my privilege...

11
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,403
- Tighter! Tighter!
- Hold steady!

12
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:59,707
How can you become
a great actress like me...

13
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,213
poor darling,
if you get blown to pieces?

14
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:05,307
- Come on!
- Native land.

15
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,976
Oh, yeah!

16
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:13,892
There to attempt the education...

17
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,690
of their provincial
and narrow-minded...

18
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:20,562
and stupidly incredulous
fellow countrymen...

19
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:23,193
we heaved anchor
and set sail.

20
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:35,169
We heaved anchor
and set sail!

21
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:39,144
The waves!

22
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:42,745
- Oh, bugger!
- We heaved anchor.

23
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:45,086
- We are actors!
- And set sail.

24
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:46,988
Where the devil
are the stagehands?

25
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:49,220
- Dead!
- They can't all have been killed!

26
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:50,762
Not killed, ducky.
Suicide!

27
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,264
Nothing to do
with your acting.

28
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,932
We heaved anchor...

29
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,966
But ill luck pursued me...

30
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,975
and I was blown towards
the waiting jaws...

31
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,774
of a whale of such prodigious size
and length...

32
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:12,716
that I could not,
even with a telescope...

33
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:14,719
see the end of him.

34
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:21,088
What will become
of the baron

35
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,493
Surely this time
there is no escape

36
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:27,897
What will become
of the baron

37
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:31,095
Surely this time there

38
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,434
Is no escape

39
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:38,307
I have learned
from experience...

40
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,402
that a modicum of snuff...

41
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,811
can be most efficacious.

42
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,602
Hells bells...

43
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,501
and buckets of blood!

44
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:08,938
Where were the waves?

45
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:12,603
The waves!
You've stabbed my vitals!

46
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:16,273
- You incompetent imbecile!
- It wasn't me!

47
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,146
It was her!

48
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:22,119
It wasn't me!
It was him! You big pintle!

49
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,683
We are supposed
to be professionals!

50
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:29,717
And we're trying
to stay alive!

51
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,854
- Sally!
- All right.

52
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:37,767
Now stay in here
or I shall lock you up.

53
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,668
- Where's my brother?
- What?

54
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:41,639
You haven't got a brother.

55
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:46,838
Then you just tell me why it says,
"Henry Salt and Son."

56
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:49,779
- I'm your daughter.
- I shouldn't have taught you to read.

57
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,876
"And Son" is traditional.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

58
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,607
No. The sultan's demands
are still not sufficiently rational.

59
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:19,304
The only lasting peace is one based
on reason and scientific principle.

60
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:22,006
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Jackson.

61
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:24,311
The first act didn't go
quite as we would have liked.

62
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:26,874
One or two little
technical problems.

63
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:30,911
Oh, please don't apologize, Mr. Salt.
I'm sure you're doing your best...

64
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,049
in very trying circumstances.

65
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:37,388
- Your attention.
- Hmm? Ah, excuse me.

66
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:41,632
The officer
who risked his life...

67
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:45,068
by single-handedly destroying
six enemy cannon...

68
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:48,937
and rescuing ten of our men
held captive by the Turk.

69
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,441
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:55,113
- The officer we've heard so much about.
- I suppose so, sir.

71
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:58,207
Always taking risks
far beyond the call of duty.

72
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,218
I only did my best, sir.

73
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,653
Have him executed at once.

74
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:05,987
- Yes, sir.
- Come along.

75
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:09,550
This sort of behavior is demoralizing
for ordinary soldiers and citizens...

76
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:13,689
who are trying to lead normal,
simple, unexceptional lives.

77
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:17,759
Things are difficult as it is without
emotional people rocking the boat.

78
00:08:42,228 --> 00:08:43,752
Constantinople.

79
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:47,523
The court of the grand Turk.

80
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,795
What a surprise...

81
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:54,101
that a passing zephyr
should waft me here.

82
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,697
Perhaps fate wishes me...

83
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:59,108
to teach the sultan
a lesson or two.

84
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:06,714
His highness the sultan
loved a good wine...

85
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:10,244
and could never
resist a wager.

86
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:13,553
Characteristics
that were to cost him dear.

87
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,321
Lies!

88
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:17,692
Those scoundrels!
I won't put up with it!

89
00:09:17,763 --> 00:09:19,492
It's intolerable!

90
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:21,328
Stop this travesty!
Stop it!

91
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:25,236
It's an insult!
An indignity!

92
00:09:25,304 --> 00:09:29,297
I've never seen so much rubbish
in all my life!

93
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,969
You don't know
what you're talking about!

94
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,342
One day,
after a sumptuous dinner...

95
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:38,975
- Is this supposed to happen?
- The sultan bade me to accompany him...

96
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,518
to his private apartments.

97
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:43,384
Uh, please. No, don't.
Please.

98
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:45,685
This blackguard's an impostor!

99
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:49,489
I am the Baron Munchausen,
and I won't be made a fool of!

100
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:51,655
- Please! You cannot come up here!
- No, no!

101
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,190
- We are presenting a performance!
- You are presenting a mockery.

102
00:09:56,268 --> 00:10:00,068
You present me as if I were
ridiculous fiction. A joke!

103
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,572
I won't have it!

104
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,572
What the devil's going on?

105
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:22,526
Curtains!

106
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:24,426
Boo!

107
00:10:24,496 --> 00:10:25,963
Get him off!

108
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:29,932
Old fool!
You're ruining the show!

109
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:31,492
Quick! Jeremy, Bill,
do something!

110
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,198
I must talk with my audience.

111
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,506
Ladies and gentlemen, I must...

112
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:42,445
I must apologize
for this most dreadful occurrence.

113
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:43,947
I can assure you that...

114
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,617
- Hello.
- Hello.

115
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,659
Beautiful ladies.

116
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,263
Hello.

117
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,300
Beautiful ladies.

118
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:06,430
You have really
great taste, sir.

119
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:08,871
Otherwise,
it's all quite wrong!

120
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,671
Listen, cocky.
We've got a show to do.

121
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:14,645
Good lord! Berthold!

122
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:16,806
Who's Berthold?

123
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:20,682
How on earth?
It's marvelous to see you!

124
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:23,586
How are you?
Where've you been?

125
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,954
How are your legs?

126
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,357
Where are the others?
Albrecht!

127
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:33,129
Adolphus!
Gustavus!

128
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,826
I can't believe it!
This is miraculous!

129
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:39,671
- I'm Bill.
- He's Bill.

130
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:42,468
Is he still here? Will you get rid
of him, for goodness sake!

131
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,737
- What is the matter?
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.

132
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:50,270
- We were about to start the second act.
- Who is this?

133
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:52,946
I've no idea.
Some old lunatic.

134
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:55,612
He's Baron Munchausen.

135
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:57,656
Oh, I see.

136
00:11:57,723 --> 00:12:00,521
The real Baron Munchausen.

137
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,762
Yes, indeed.
And who, sir, may I ask are you?

138
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,597
A public servant.

139
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:12,694
I am responsible for,
among other things...

140
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,705
the licensing of this theatre.

141
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:20,037
This, sir, is the Right Ordinary
Horatio Jackson who just happens...

142
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:22,444
to be winning the war
and saving the city.

143
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,910
Now please leave us!

144
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:32,515
- He's an ass. Only I can end this war.
- Explain yourself.

145
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,923
I can end it
because I began it.

146
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:37,788
I am the cause.

147
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:43,028
I'm afraid, sir, you have
rather a weak grasp of reality.

148
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:48,039
Your reality, sir,
is lies and balderdash...

149
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:52,601
and I'm delighted to say
that I have no grasp of it whatsoever!

150
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,586
This man obviously
needs a doctor.

151
00:13:02,654 --> 00:13:04,952
A doctor?

152
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,421
We will continue
with the show.

153
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:11,930
Thank you very much,
Your Ordinaryness. Off!

154
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:15,091
Please be reasonable.

155
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,432
If we don't get on with it,
he'll throw us to the Turks

156
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:21,166
I'll get on with it!

157
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,537
Show them how it should be!

158
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:30,080
My lords...

159
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,674
ladies and gentlemen...

160
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:35,777
Baron Munchausen,
at your service.

161
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,822
Pruned any noses recently?

162
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:42,454
- Give us a song!
- No. Please.

163
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:46,396
Most of you won't remember me
or my adventures...

164
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:49,332
but I assure you...

165
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,801
they are true.

166
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,303
The truth is...

167
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:56,170
I am the cause of this siege.

168
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,436
- Don't be stupid!
- What about the Turks then?

169
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,172
You're the cause
of the border dispute, are you?

170
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:03,373
What? It's the sea routes
we're fighting for!

171
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,007
No, it isn't!

172
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,143
That was last time!

173
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:11,155
You poor deluded fools!

174
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,589
If you'll only
do me the courtesy...

175
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,753
of accepting the word
of a gentleman...

176
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:20,230
I will reveal the true cause...

177
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,233
of this war.

178
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:26,570
After my...

179
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:28,805
Oh, dear.

180
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:32,033
After my return from Egypt...

181
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,602
I was most warmly welcomed...

182
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,376
by the grand Turk...

183
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,882
his highness, the sultan...

184
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:43,854
who knew of my reputation...

185
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:47,050
and held me in high esteem.

186
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:51,822
In fact, so delighted
was he with my company...

187
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,957
that he offered me access
to his harem.

188
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:58,794
- One day...
- Go on!

189
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:03,308
The sultan brought me a bottle
of his favorite Tokay.

190
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,038
What do you think of that, eh?

191
00:15:34,106 --> 00:15:36,040
Not bad.

192
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:38,542
Not bad?
My dear Munchausen...

193
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,578
it's impossible
to find better.

194
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,547
Humbug, Your Majesty.

195
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,742
What do you wager
that I won't procure...

196
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:50,117
within the hour, a bottle of Tokay
far superior to this...

197
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:53,124
from the imperial cellar
in Vienna...

198
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:55,422
a mere thousand odd miles away?

199
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:57,618
Accept my challenge.

200
00:15:57,696 --> 00:16:00,722
If I don't succeed,
you may cut off my head.

201
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,359
These are my stakes.
What are yours?

202
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:04,959
I accept.

203
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:06,732
And if you succeed...

204
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:11,765
you may take as much treasure
as the strongest man can carry.

205
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:16,576
Agreed. Give me pen and ink, and I
will write to the empress immediately.

206
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:25,080
Berthold!

207
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,418
Coming!

208
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:32,554
Oh, blast!
Sorry, chaps.

209
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,394
I've got to go.

210
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:59,987
Take this to Vienna,
to the empress.

211
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:03,585
She will give you a bottle of wine.
Bring it straight to me.

212
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:05,095
Right-o.

213
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:57,415
Perhaps you would care for a little
light entertainment while you wait.

214
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:12,352
I have been composing
a short opera.

215
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,763
- Would you like to hear a song or two?
- No, thank you.

216
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,563
Oh, you'll love it.
It's a comedy.

217
00:18:17,636 --> 00:18:19,570
It's called,
"The Torturer's Apprentice."

218
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,600
Here's the overture.

219
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,164
The curtain...

220
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:53,234
The curtain rises on a typical
everyday torture chamber.

221
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:57,241
Yosrick, the young apprentice,
sings of his joy in his job.

222
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:04,306
A torturer's apprentice
went his merry way to work one day

223
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:08,376
I bend and stretch and ply my trade

224
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:10,318
Making people all afraid

225
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:13,256
But things look black
Business is slack

226
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:16,624
There's no one on the rack but me

227
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:21,889
Act four
is set in an abattoir.

228
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:25,428
I see a lot of slapstick.

229
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:28,667
We begin with the arrival
of the eunuchs' chorus who sing...

230
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,332
"Cut Off in My Prime."

231
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,708
Cut off in my prime

232
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,751
Surrounded

233
00:19:39,818 --> 00:19:44,152
By beautiful women
all the time

234
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:47,783
A eunuch's life is hard

235
00:19:56,301 --> 00:20:01,762
And nothing else

236
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,273
Excuse me a moment.

237
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,571
Oh, you won't want
to miss this aria.

238
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:08,442
It reminds me
of my school days in England.

239
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:19,885
Life is rather like a game

240
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,621
It's important that you win

241
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:28,492
And though it seem
a terrible shame

242
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,831
If you lie and cheat

243
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:33,370
And sin

244
00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:34,905
Lay up and win

245
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,873
The game

246
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,375
Steady.

247
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:41,311
Where the hell's Berthold?

248
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,438
- Don't know.
- I though he was with you.

249
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,107
Well, if he's not here
in three and a half minutes...

250
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,344
the sultan
will cut off my head!

251
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:50,718
- And?
- And?

252
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:53,121
Is that all?

253
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,352
I'm sorry,
I don't find that funny. Do you?

254
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,863
This isn't a joke!
It's a wager!

255
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,363
A wager!

256
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,698
He's asleep.
I can hear him snoring.

257
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,203
- About 900 miles away.
- Come on.

258
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:17,409
He's under a tree!
Near Belgrade.

259
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:20,576
- What?
- There's a bottle beside him.

260
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:23,280
- Hope he hasn't been at it.
- So do I.

261
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,723
What's the wind speed, Gus?

262
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,225
Three knots.

263
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:02,622
I'm a modern man

264
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:05,993
These days I find
you have to be

265
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:07,964
Awfully cruel to be kind

266
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:10,433
I'm a modern man

267
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:13,164
You will agree

268
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:15,832
It's either you or me

269
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,300
Well!

270
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:23,074
Time's nearly up, I think.

271
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:38,589
Ready.

272
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:51,536
Now!

273
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,949
- Not late, am I?
- No.

274
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:11,222
Not late,
thank you very much.

275
00:23:13,932 --> 00:23:16,059
Thanks.
I needed a trim.

276
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,205
- Much obliged.
- From the empress.

277
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:41,023
Delicious!

278
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:42,525
You win.

279
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:46,052
Treasurer, allow my friend here
to take from the treasury...

280
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:49,862
as much as the strongest man
can carry.

281
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,663
Yes.

282
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:21,164
That's it.

283
00:24:57,502 --> 00:24:58,935
Thanks, squire.

284
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,094
I must speak
with the sultan.

285
00:25:25,063 --> 00:25:28,191
- What is it?
- Excellency! They've taken everything!

286
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,961
What?

287
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:57,660
Gustavus!

288
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,789
Stop them!

289
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:15,302
Bring them back!

290
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,644
Gustavus! Again!

291
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:31,261
Fire!

292
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:35,824
Don't shoot!

293
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:40,202
- Stand firm!
- Take cover, my friends.

294
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,368
Regroup!

295
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,152
Let me in!

296
00:27:01,492 --> 00:27:02,925
And so...

297
00:27:02,994 --> 00:27:06,794
as you can see,
the sultan is still after my head.

298
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,804
Hey, wait!
Stop! Don't go!

299
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:18,536
Come back!
There's more!

300
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,439
I haven't finished!
Don't leave now!

301
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:35,315
We're about to make off
with the sultan's treasure.

302
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,258
You can't just stop.

303
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:40,630
The name's Desmond, mate.

304
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:45,032
We're actors, not figments
of your imagination! Now get a grip!

305
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:48,766
Oh, come back!

306
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:58,676
What the devil is the sultan playing at?
It's Wednesday, isn't it?

307
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,550
I'm terribly sorry about the show.
One or two minor setbacks here, sir.

308
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,851
This theatre's closed. I want you
and your company out of the city.

309
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:07,983
Oh, no, sir! No!
No, sir. Please!

310
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,325
Give us a say! Sir, look at these
favorable endorsements from Europe.

311
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:16,527
"Mr. Salt's company holds a mirror
up to nature." "Vienna Clarion."

312
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,865
"Great value for money."
"Paris Echo."

313
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:22,270
"A good night out." "Glasgow Herald."
Just give us one second.

314
00:28:37,689 --> 00:28:40,419
Here, boy.
Good boy. It's all right.

315
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:46,362
Here, boy!

316
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,652
Are you all right?

317
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:26,794
Am I dead?

318
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,661
No.

319
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,833
Blast!

320
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:33,737
Who are you really?

321
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,705
Baron Munchausen isn't real.

322
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:42,405
- He's only in stories.
- Go away! I'm trying to die.

323
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,970
Why?

324
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:47,916
Because I'm tired
of the world.

325
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,519
And the world
is evidently tired of me.

326
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,491
But why? Why?

327
00:30:58,729 --> 00:31:04,031
Because it's all logic
and reason now.

328
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:07,094
Science. Progress.

329
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,974
Laws of hydraulics. Laws...

330
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:14,807
of social dynamics.

331
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,040
Laws of this, that...

332
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:18,548
and the other.

333
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,977
No place
for three-legged cyclops...

334
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:26,023
in the South Seas.

335
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,523
No place...

336
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:30,857
for cucumber trees...

337
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:34,022
and oceans of wine.

338
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:36,225
No place for me.

339
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,133
- What happened in the story?
- What?

340
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:42,229
In the sultan's palace.
Did you escape?

341
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:44,536
- Were you killed?
- I don't know.

342
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:49,205
It was all a long time ago.
Who cares?

343
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,005
I do.

344
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:57,920
I'm very tired. Good-bye!

345
00:31:57,989 --> 00:32:00,924
- Please tell me.
- No.

346
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:03,153
- Go on.
- Buzz off!

347
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:05,195
Tell me!

348
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:10,399
Please.

349
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:17,004
You really want to know,
don't you?

350
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,444
Stop it!

351
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:27,244
We'll all be killed!

352
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,752
And then I'll never know
the end of the story!

353
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,414
Wait! Where are you going?
Come back!

354
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,221
Stop it!

355
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,763
Wait! Come back!

356
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,801
Take cover!

357
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,271
Wretched child!

358
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:13,891
Get that powder under cover!

359
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:15,398
Yes, sir!

360
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:28,077
No!

361
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:31,414
Stop it!

362
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,952
Get away!

363
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:38,682
Stop it!

364
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:40,189
Head down!

365
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:45,184
- No!
- You'll get us both killed.

366
00:33:45,263 --> 00:33:47,663
I thought you wanted to die.

367
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:51,190
Yes, but I'm old enough.
Gentlemen!

368
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:56,802
Don't you think it would be a good idea
to silence those enemy cannons?

369
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:01,010
- No, sir.
- No?

370
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,680
It's Wednesday.

371
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:07,047
Oh, my... Wednesday!

372
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,198
Oh, no!

373
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,473
The Turks are about
to storm the walls.

374
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:43,144
You really are Baron Munchausen.

375
00:35:57,828 --> 00:36:02,128
That's it. The end.
It's all over.

376
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:06,636
Generations of theatrical expertise
snuffed out...

377
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:09,070
in the twinkling of an eye.

378
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:12,231
Sally?

379
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:16,245
Get off!

380
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:20,178
Come here.

381
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:23,584
You cretinous, senile
old fart!

382
00:36:26,056 --> 00:36:29,355
Thanks to you,
we're to be thrown to the Turks!

383
00:36:29,427 --> 00:36:32,294
But he is Baron Munchausen!

384
00:36:32,363 --> 00:36:34,297
The real one!

385
00:36:34,365 --> 00:36:37,664
- You must believe me!
- Hurry!

386
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:40,602
No, honestly! He is!

387
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:44,539
- Shut up!
- But he is!

388
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,769
And he can save us!

389
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:49,108
Can't you?

390
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,775
He jumped onto a cannonball.

391
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:56,251
He really did!
And he flew miles up into the sky!

392
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,915
- Above the elephants and soldiers...
- God! Stop lying!

393
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,323
I'm not lying! Am I?

394
00:37:04,295 --> 00:37:05,728
As a matter of fact, you are.

395
00:37:07,064 --> 00:37:08,497
But he did.

396
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:11,626
And those soldiers saw him too!

397
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:14,698
They'll tell you!

398
00:37:14,772 --> 00:37:17,297
Oh, they're dead.

399
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:22,143
- But he did!
- No, I didn't.

400
00:37:22,213 --> 00:37:24,044
Now you're lying!

401
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:27,713
I never lie!

402
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,355
Stay here!
What's got into you?

403
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:44,132
I didn't fly miles.

404
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,403
It was more like
a mile and a half.

405
00:37:48,472 --> 00:37:50,736
And I didn't precisely fly.

406
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:55,575
I merely held on to a mortar shell
in the first instance...

407
00:37:55,646 --> 00:37:58,376
and then a cannonball
on the way back.

408
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:02,579
You maniac!
You've done for us!

409
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:05,713
Actually, it doesn't matter
whether you're thrown out or stay here.

410
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:08,383
The Turks
are about to take the town.

411
00:38:08,459 --> 00:38:10,518
Quickly!
Bring those guns out!

412
00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:16,794
I'm just coming
into my prime!

413
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:20,803
I'm just on the cusp
between Romeo and King Lear.

414
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:24,967
My public will kill me
for dying at a time like this.

415
00:38:25,809 --> 00:38:27,743
- Save us!
- Yes.

416
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:30,045
Save us!

417
00:38:31,382 --> 00:38:35,716
- Don't disappoint me!
- Please, Baron. Please.

418
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:40,120
- You are a baron, aren't you?
- You're our only hope!

419
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,556
You are my only hope.

420
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:45,060
Ladies! Please!

421
00:38:48,365 --> 00:38:50,492
I swear that as long as I...

422
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:55,403
Heronomous Carl Frederick,
Baron von Munchausen live and breathe...

423
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:58,635
you shall come to no harm.

424
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:02,645
You so remind me
of Catherine the Great...

425
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:05,341
empress of all the Russia's...

426
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:08,817
whose hand in marriage
I once had the honor to decline.

427
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:10,581
They all remind you?

428
00:39:11,689 --> 00:39:13,850
Yes, why not?

429
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:17,826
Some bits here, some bits there.
I have a plan!

430
00:39:18,562 --> 00:39:20,427
I will set forth immediately...

431
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:28,470
find my extraordinary servants...

432
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,943
with their help,
raze the siege and save the town.

433
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:37,003
Oh, brilliant.
Oh, very good. Bravo!

434
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:41,609
- How?
- Ladies, I'll require your assistance.

435
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:43,118
Of course.

436
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:46,315
- Anything!
- Just tell us what to do.

437
00:39:47,224 --> 00:39:51,524
Kindly be so good
as to remove your knickers.

438
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:25,061
Yes, well done there.

439
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:28,122
Look at all that underwear.

440
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:32,601
Isn't it beautiful?
It's like a dream come true.

441
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:36,134
It's the dawning of the age...

442
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:39,141
of lovely, intimate things.

443
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:42,610
But it's madness.
He'll kill himself.

444
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,649
- Yeah, but well worth it, eh?
- What are you doing?

445
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:48,150
Enough nattering.
Keep pumping!

446
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:06,096
Hey.
Better report this.

447
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,637
You're right.

448
00:41:23,654 --> 00:41:27,385
We need a very simple plan.
These are far too complicated.

449
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:30,427
- Simplicity is of the essence.
- Sir.

450
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:32,724
Those actors
have made an air balloon.

451
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:34,491
They're trying to escape.

452
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:38,290
Arrest them at once.

453
00:41:38,368 --> 00:41:40,302
Thrown them
out of the town.

454
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,895
We can't open the gates, sir.

455
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:46,634
Well, throw them
over the walls, then.

456
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,644
Yes, sir.

457
00:41:49,813 --> 00:41:52,179
We can't start escaping
at a time like this.

458
00:41:52,249 --> 00:41:54,911
What would future generations
think of us?

459
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,894
Right.
Follow me!

460
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:31,320
Just hold it!
Don't let it go!

461
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:36,318
Hold it, Adolphus!

462
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:38,122
Bring it down.

463
00:42:38,195 --> 00:42:40,891
Yes.
Bring the ladder over here.

464
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:44,567
Take care!

465
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:49,505
Baron!

466
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:55,437
- Oi! Have you seen Sally?
- No!

467
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:59,739
- Oh, thank you, my dear.
- Stop!

468
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,078
- You're under arrest!
- Let go!

469
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:08,053
Quickly!

470
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,990
Quickly! Let go!

471
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:16,595
Take aim!

472
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,100
Fire!

473
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,238
Ladies and gentlemen...

474
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:28,904
I shall shortly return
with reinforcements.

475
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:30,606
Don't lose heart.

476
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:32,581
And for all those ladies...

477
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:35,413
to whom I am indebted
for half a ton...

478
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:38,318
of frilly silk
and lacey linen:

479
00:43:38,388 --> 00:43:41,448
Don't catch cold!
Au revoir.

480
00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:45,859
Stay, Argus!
I'll soon be back.

481
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,058
I will wait for you!

482
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:52,934
Come back soon!

483
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:05,541
He won't get far
on hot air and fantasy.

484
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:21,426
Blast!

485
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:25,334
Hang on!

486
00:44:26,904 --> 00:44:28,337
Keep...

487
00:44:38,715 --> 00:44:42,173
- Thanks.
- Now you've ruined everything!

488
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:45,119
I'll have to douse the fire
to let you down.

489
00:44:46,123 --> 00:44:49,456
- I'll never get off again!
- I'm going with you.

490
00:44:49,526 --> 00:44:53,519
I absolutely utterly refuse!

491
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:56,623
If we go down now,
we'll land on the Turks.

492
00:45:58,095 --> 00:46:00,393
We've got to find
your servants...

493
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:02,398
and get back here quickly.

494
00:46:02,466 --> 00:46:04,900
That is what I had in mind.

495
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:39,596
- Where are we going?
- To the moon.

496
00:46:39,669 --> 00:46:42,900
What? That'll take ages!

497
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:46,409
- No, it won't.
- Of course it will.

498
00:46:47,244 --> 00:46:52,238
- Why are we going there?
- That's where I last saw Berthold.

499
00:46:52,315 --> 00:46:54,749
Have you ever been
to the moon?

500
00:46:54,818 --> 00:46:58,845
- No.
- Ah! Interesting place.

501
00:46:58,922 --> 00:47:01,982
The king and queen
are charming.

502
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,994
You know
about their detachable heads...

503
00:47:05,062 --> 00:47:06,495
don't you?

504
00:47:06,563 --> 00:47:08,428
No.

505
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,626
Their heads go off
for intellectual pursuits...

506
00:47:11,701 --> 00:47:15,000
while their bodies engage
in more...

507
00:47:15,072 --> 00:47:16,937
bodily activities.

508
00:47:17,507 --> 00:47:22,171
The trouble is their heads and bodies
don't always see eye to eye.

509
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:29,017
You do believe me,
don't you?

510
00:47:30,387 --> 00:47:32,651
I'm doing my best.

511
00:47:48,738 --> 00:47:50,467
Are you scared?

512
00:47:51,942 --> 00:47:53,876
Certainly not!

513
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:58,810
- You?
- Certainly not!

514
00:48:22,873 --> 00:48:24,500
Grab the rope!

515
00:49:39,649 --> 00:49:41,913
We're here!

516
00:49:43,386 --> 00:49:46,913
You look different.
Younger.

517
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,824
I always feel rejuvenated
by a touch of adventure.

518
00:49:50,894 --> 00:49:55,661
Heaven's sake. Don't you get any younger
or I'll have to find a wet nurse.

519
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:58,166
Look!

520
00:50:07,344 --> 00:50:10,677
You'll find that I'm one
of the king's special favorites.

521
00:50:12,315 --> 00:50:14,681
We shall receive
a right royal welcome.

522
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:56,157
Now what?

523
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:01,322
I got you at last.

524
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:08,962
Your Majesty, what a great pleasure
it is to see you again.

525
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:11,667
May I introduce
my friend Sally?

526
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:16,508
Sally, King of the Moon.
Well, his head at any rate.

527
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,514
I'm sorry, you must refer to me
by my complete title...

528
00:51:19,582 --> 00:51:21,015
King of Everything...

529
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:23,450
Re di Tutto,
but you may call me "Ray."

530
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,047
The moon is a very insignificant
part of my domain now.

531
00:51:27,123 --> 00:51:30,058
There is so much, much more.

532
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:35,359
My old friend, you seem to be
in some discomfort.

533
00:51:35,432 --> 00:51:37,024
What ails you?

534
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,163
Nothing ails me. Can you not see
that I am at one with the cosmos?

535
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,569
I tell you that,
and all you can say is, "ah"?

536
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:49,942
What are you blind?

537
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:52,208
Baron, let me explain it to you.

538
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:56,685
Since you were last here, I, that is
my head, that which is left of me...

539
00:51:56,753 --> 00:51:58,983
where the brilliant
and important parts are located...

540
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:02,320
is now ruling and governing
the known universe.

541
00:52:02,392 --> 00:52:05,327
And that which I don't know,
I create.

542
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:10,432
I just created spring.

543
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,267
But seriously, without me,
there would be nothing. Not even you.

544
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,035
I think, therefore you is.

545
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:23,777
Your old friend's a lunatic.

546
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:25,815
So it would seem.

547
00:52:25,882 --> 00:52:29,215
Certainly fallen prey
to delusions of grandeur.

548
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:33,016
Being in tune with every molecule
in the universe...

549
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:36,081
requires a great deal
of concentration.

550
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,424
That is why having you on the loose,
Baron, does not help.

551
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:43,227
You see, your little stories
are somewhat of a distraction to me.

552
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:46,462
You are like a mosquito
in the Taj Mahal.

553
00:52:48,037 --> 00:52:53,100
I must inform you, My Liege, without
my adventures, you wouldn't be here.

554
00:52:53,176 --> 00:52:57,476
Well, so I am now part
of your adventures.

555
00:52:58,314 --> 00:53:00,646
Well, we shall see
about that, huh?

556
00:53:18,535 --> 00:53:21,129
Now, Baron.
Who created who?

557
00:53:21,204 --> 00:53:24,173
I hope you'll be
very comfortable. Ciao.

558
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,708
There goes my revolting body
with the queen.

559
00:53:27,677 --> 00:53:31,443
Oh, stop it!
Oh, I'm tired!

560
00:53:31,514 --> 00:53:34,381
- I'm exhausted!
- Go away! Damn it. He can't hear me.

561
00:53:34,451 --> 00:53:38,285
Please, oh!
Oh, you stinking horrible man!

562
00:53:38,354 --> 00:53:40,618
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

563
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:44,285
Please don't look.
Maybe he will go away.

564
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,954
It is hard to believe
my body and I were ever attached.

565
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,463
We are totally incompatible.

566
00:53:48,531 --> 00:53:51,796
He is dangling from the food chain,
and I am in the stars.

567
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:55,326
It is so unmetaphysical.
No! No, go away!

568
00:53:56,573 --> 00:53:59,201
I despise you!
Let me go!

569
00:54:11,354 --> 00:54:12,787
I'm back!

570
00:54:12,856 --> 00:54:16,815
I got lips again,
and I'm going to use them, baby!

571
00:54:17,894 --> 00:54:20,920
It's me!
I'm your elephant of joy!

572
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:28,861
- Give me bacio, baby!
- Yes, but eat first, darling!

573
00:54:30,206 --> 00:54:34,302
That's right.
You've got to mangia before bacio!

574
00:54:39,716 --> 00:54:42,810
You can't do that
when you don't got no mouth!

575
00:54:42,886 --> 00:54:44,751
Baron!

576
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:46,755
I'm back in business.

577
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:49,324
Oh, yeah.

578
00:54:50,226 --> 00:54:51,818
You don't go nowhere.

579
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:02,562
- Baron.
- Oh, most wondrous Majesty.

580
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,072
Hey, I know you.

581
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,270
You're the little guy tried to make off
with my queen the last time.

582
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:09,606
- Huh?
- Moi?

583
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,274
We have no more of that,
piccolo Casanova.

584
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,284
What are you looking at?

585
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:23,987
There you go, lovebirds.

586
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,585
I'm sure you'll be
very uncomfortable.

587
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:42,572
I am free again.
Free to concentrate on higher things.

588
00:55:47,684 --> 00:55:50,812
Why don't you go back
and amuse yourself with this slime?

589
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:52,479
Oh, you missed me!

590
00:55:52,555 --> 00:55:55,991
I'm blind! Wait! My kingdom
for a handkerchief! Wait!

591
00:55:57,527 --> 00:56:01,657
Let me go! I've got tides to regulate!
Comets to direct!

592
00:56:01,731 --> 00:56:03,790
I don't have time
for flatulence and orgasms!

593
00:56:03,866 --> 00:56:05,800
I hate that face
you make me make. That...

594
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:09,304
Please. Please, no!
I don't want any more bodily functions!

595
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:13,201
Oh, no.
Please let me go!

596
00:56:13,276 --> 00:56:16,211
- I don't have time for this!
- Farewell, Baron.

597
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:30,349
One of the king's favorites?

598
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:34,291
This cage isn't real.

599
00:56:34,364 --> 00:56:37,333
It's just part
of the king's lunacy.

600
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,392
It seems solid enough to me.

601
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,439
I see we're not in a very helpful
frame of mind.

602
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:46,532
How are we supposed
to save the town from here?

603
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:49,737
The town is perfectly all right.

604
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:52,474
The peasant assault is over.
Everyone is quite safe.

605
00:56:52,548 --> 00:56:54,413
How do you know?

606
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:57,653
I just know.

607
00:57:07,397 --> 00:57:08,830
What the devil?

608
00:57:08,898 --> 00:57:11,025
All right. I'm coming.

609
00:57:12,068 --> 00:57:13,501
My hand!

610
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:17,301
Come out.
Come out of there.

611
00:57:22,945 --> 00:57:25,880
- Come out of there!
- Ow! Stop that!

612
00:57:26,683 --> 00:57:30,175
- What did you do that for?
- I thought you might be unfriendly.

613
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:32,778
Of course I'm unfriendly.

614
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:36,291
- You'd be unfriendly if I prodded you.
- Who are you?

615
00:57:39,362 --> 00:57:40,795
I can't remember.

616
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,354
- I've been here so long.
- We'll be like that...

617
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:45,458
if we don't escape.

618
00:57:45,535 --> 00:57:47,230
Why are you here?

619
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:49,635
Oh, I'm a very wicked criminal.

620
00:57:50,606 --> 00:57:54,440
- What have you done?
- I can't remember.

621
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:56,307
How do you know you're wicked?

622
00:57:57,346 --> 00:57:59,940
Well, for one thing...

623
00:58:00,016 --> 00:58:01,881
I'm in here.

624
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:04,317
And for another...

625
00:58:05,722 --> 00:58:07,713
I've got these shackles on.

626
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,588
- Berthold!
- Eh?

627
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,321
It's Berthold!

628
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:17,761
It's me! The baron!

629
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:20,064
I knew I'd find you
on the moon.

630
00:58:20,136 --> 00:58:22,900
I'm going to take you back to Earth
to help us fight the sultan!

631
00:58:22,972 --> 00:58:24,940
Get off me!

632
00:58:25,007 --> 00:58:27,908
You're Berthold!
My old servant.

633
00:58:27,977 --> 00:58:32,607
Those leg irons are to slow you down.
Stop you tearing off all over the place.

634
00:58:32,682 --> 00:58:36,311
- You must be joking.
- You always wore them. Remember?

635
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:39,286
- You're crackers!
- I'm Baron Munchausen.

636
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:42,518
Hmm. That sounds nasty.
Is it contagious?

637
00:58:42,592 --> 00:58:46,028
We're wasting time!

638
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:55,033
Darling Baron!

639
00:58:55,104 --> 00:58:57,504
Ariadne.

640
00:58:58,341 --> 00:59:01,742
I'm sorry I couldn't
speak with you before...

641
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:05,713
but Roger's so difficult.

642
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:09,377
Where exactly is Roger?

643
00:59:09,452 --> 00:59:11,852
In bed with my body, of course.

644
00:59:14,056 --> 00:59:17,423
Stop it!

645
00:59:17,493 --> 00:59:20,257
If he discovers my head's with you...

646
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,925
Quickly!

647
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:25,194
Climb into my hair.

648
00:59:27,503 --> 00:59:30,768
Why is she making those funny noises?

649
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:35,978
Her body is with the king...

650
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:37,979
and he is...

651
00:59:39,115 --> 00:59:41,811
tickling her feet.

652
00:59:41,884 --> 00:59:44,250
- Oh, no!
- Berthold.

653
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,083
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

654
00:59:46,155 --> 00:59:48,123
- You're coming with us.
- No chance.

655
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:50,955
- Why not?
- I can't remember.

656
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:52,824
- Are you frightened?
- That's it!

657
00:59:52,895 --> 00:59:55,455
- Come on. Help me.
- Stop it!

658
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,824
Quickly.

659
00:59:58,901 --> 01:00:02,803
Climb aboard.
Give me your hand.

660
01:00:04,507 --> 01:00:07,442
- Hold tight.
- I don't want to escape!

661
01:00:11,948 --> 01:00:15,577
- Here we go!
- Gosh! I can't hold on!

662
01:00:25,528 --> 01:00:29,089
I love these!
I tickle you till dawn, darling.

663
01:00:29,165 --> 01:00:30,962
There we go!

664
01:00:32,335 --> 01:00:35,532
There! I wipe everything away.
There! Tickley! Tickley!

665
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,274
Darling, you love this!
I know you do!

666
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:42,971
But you don't say anything!
Why you don't say anything?

667
01:00:43,045 --> 01:00:44,740
You are a pillow biter!

668
01:00:44,814 --> 01:00:46,304
Hey! Tickley! Tickley!

669
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:59,157
Baron, I must get back to Roger
before he notices I am headless!

670
01:00:59,228 --> 01:01:01,059
I quite understand.

671
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,499
Darling. Take me with you.

672
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:09,800
- Back to Earth?
- Oh, yes!

673
01:01:11,407 --> 01:01:12,897
Without your body?

674
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:17,879
I thought you loved me
for myself!

675
01:01:17,947 --> 01:01:20,040
I did.

676
01:01:20,116 --> 01:01:22,448
I mean, I do!
Of course, I do.

677
01:01:22,518 --> 01:01:24,383
- It's just...
- We have to go!

678
01:01:24,453 --> 01:01:28,981
I think you're right, aren't you?
It's impossible.

679
01:01:29,058 --> 01:01:31,993
Oh! Take a lock of my hair.

680
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:39,267
Just a lock, cocky.
Not the whole carpet.

681
01:01:39,335 --> 01:01:40,893
I'll treasure it.

682
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:45,031
The king! I must go!

683
01:01:45,942 --> 01:01:48,911
Au revoir, my dear Baron.

684
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:57,612
Yes! I'm coming, Roger!

685
01:01:59,522 --> 01:02:02,355
Darling, I'm going to drive you
to China!

686
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:03,756
Let it out!

687
01:02:03,826 --> 01:02:06,920
Oh, my God! Where is your head?

688
01:02:06,996 --> 01:02:09,396
No wonder you're so quiet.

689
01:02:09,465 --> 01:02:12,593
I'm too rough. I knock it off?
It's around here.

690
01:02:12,668 --> 01:02:14,636
I find it. We play "head and seek."

691
01:02:14,704 --> 01:02:17,798
Hold on! Oh, you play a trick?

692
01:02:17,873 --> 01:02:19,568
Darling, come out!

693
01:02:21,744 --> 01:02:23,871
You're not here!

694
01:02:23,946 --> 01:02:25,413
Where you...

695
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:28,973
You are with the baron.

696
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:32,179
You are with that little man.

697
01:02:32,254 --> 01:02:34,620
You told me
size don't make a difference!

698
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,181
You puttana!

699
01:02:37,259 --> 01:02:38,726
No head to hit!

700
01:02:38,794 --> 01:02:42,389
I'll find you, Baron!
And then I kill you!

701
01:02:42,465 --> 01:02:45,434
Fetch me my radish club!

702
01:02:48,004 --> 01:02:50,438
Faster!

703
01:02:50,506 --> 01:02:53,600
I make a baron brochette! Sybil!

704
01:03:01,117 --> 01:03:03,108
Come on! Faster!

705
01:03:03,185 --> 01:03:06,780
But he can't! Berthold can hardly move!

706
01:03:06,856 --> 01:03:08,517
Take his weights off.

707
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:11,355
- I have!
- What?

708
01:03:11,427 --> 01:03:15,625
- He's old! He can't run anymore.
- Nonsense!

709
01:03:15,698 --> 01:03:18,189
He's just out of practice.

710
01:03:22,938 --> 01:03:24,872
Come on, Berthold!

711
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:28,976
Look for him!

712
01:03:29,045 --> 01:03:32,845
Nowhere to run to!
Nowhere to hide for you, Baron!

713
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:35,315
What are you looking at?
Look down there!

714
01:03:35,384 --> 01:03:38,114
Come on!

715
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:40,212
There he is, Sybil.

716
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:42,120
Down there.

717
01:03:42,191 --> 01:03:44,318
I got you now, Baron!

718
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,833
Wait, Sybil!

719
01:04:00,776 --> 01:04:02,266
Whoa!

720
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:07,011
Wait! There they are!

721
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,051
Are you hungry, my darling?

722
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,178
All right. You take the baron.

723
01:04:12,254 --> 01:04:14,154
You take the bald one.
And for you, my sweet...

724
01:04:14,223 --> 01:04:16,191
the little girl
because you're my favorite.

725
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:18,590
All right! Dinner is served!

726
01:04:21,831 --> 01:04:24,493
- Teamwork, Sybil!
- You go that way. I'll go this way.

727
01:04:24,567 --> 01:04:26,933
- You're the last of your species!
- Go on!

728
01:04:27,002 --> 01:04:28,697
Work with me! Stay together!

729
01:04:32,408 --> 01:04:34,774
No, girls! Don't split up on me now!

730
01:04:36,779 --> 01:04:38,440
Mayday!

731
01:04:38,514 --> 01:04:41,176
We're going down! Mayday!

732
01:04:45,087 --> 01:04:48,853
Sybil! Don't desert me now!

733
01:04:49,725 --> 01:04:51,556
I love you!

734
01:05:00,436 --> 01:05:01,767
I'm free!

735
01:05:01,837 --> 01:05:04,965
I'm free at last!
The body is dead!

736
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,942
The body is dead! Long live the head!
It's finished!

737
01:05:09,011 --> 01:05:10,911
Bye, body!

738
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,575
I shall prove a head
does not need a body to survive!

739
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:16,811
I am omnipotent!

740
01:05:16,886 --> 01:05:19,719
Yes! Oh, no! I got an itch.

741
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:34,266
Well done, Sally!

742
01:05:35,671 --> 01:05:37,195
Thanks!

743
01:05:41,277 --> 01:05:44,440
How great to see you!
What are you doing here?

744
01:05:44,513 --> 01:05:46,447
- Get off me!
- It's me!

745
01:05:46,515 --> 01:05:49,211
Berthold, your old servant! Remember?

746
01:05:49,285 --> 01:05:54,018
- Yes! We've been through all that.
- Where are we?

747
01:05:54,089 --> 01:05:56,523
On the Moon.

748
01:05:56,592 --> 01:05:59,789
Oh, yeah. Same old baron!

749
01:05:59,862 --> 01:06:03,093
- Can we go now?
- Get weaving.

750
01:06:03,165 --> 01:06:04,598
Hang on.

751
01:06:05,935 --> 01:06:08,529
It's all coming back.

752
01:06:08,604 --> 01:06:12,131
I've been stuck here
for over 20 years!

753
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:15,109
Ever since you were last here
on the moon!

754
01:06:15,177 --> 01:06:18,476
You abandoned me here!
You swine!

755
01:06:18,547 --> 01:06:20,913
You toddled off
with that old queen of tarts...

756
01:06:20,983 --> 01:06:24,111
and left me to rot
in that parrot cage, didn't you?

757
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:26,984
And now you come back,
just because it suits you...

758
01:06:27,056 --> 01:06:28,990
after wasting half my life...

759
01:06:29,058 --> 01:06:32,323
and expect me to follow you
to the ends of the Earth!

760
01:06:32,394 --> 01:06:33,986
Yes!

761
01:06:35,064 --> 01:06:36,224
All right.

762
01:06:55,651 --> 01:06:59,644
Do you know where
the rest of the gang are?

763
01:07:00,723 --> 01:07:02,213
Not a clue.

764
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:16,227
This is precisely the sort of thing
that no one ever believes.

765
01:07:17,072 --> 01:07:19,006
Right, Berthold.

766
01:07:23,445 --> 01:07:25,379
You go first.

767
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:28,149
Then Sally.

768
01:07:34,957 --> 01:07:36,390
Careful.

769
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:42,530
Off you go.

770
01:07:54,476 --> 01:07:56,376
That's it!

771
01:07:57,813 --> 01:08:00,373
There's no more rope.

772
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:03,816
- Mind now. I'm going back up.
- Wait a moment.

773
01:08:04,753 --> 01:08:07,551
Here! Tie this to the end of it.

774
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:10,155
Where'd you get this?

775
01:08:10,225 --> 01:08:12,216
I cut it from the top.

776
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:15,921
Naturally!
Where else would I get it?

777
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:18,125
- But...
- Yes, yes!

778
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:22,295
Splice it to the ends
so that we may continue our descent.

779
01:08:23,772 --> 01:08:26,138
Very clever. Great.

780
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:28,301
Why didn't I think of that?

781
01:08:28,377 --> 01:08:31,869
That's why he's a baron
and I'm a prole.

782
01:08:37,986 --> 01:08:40,750
We'll never rescue them now!

783
01:08:49,264 --> 01:08:51,664
21/2% on the basic rate!

784
01:08:51,734 --> 01:08:54,532
- That's not enough!
- That's what I got to offer!

785
01:08:54,603 --> 01:08:57,936
And a separate agreement for overtime!

786
01:08:58,006 --> 01:08:59,303
Six percent!

787
01:09:03,579 --> 01:09:06,480
21/2%! Take it or leave it!

788
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:09,984
Five percent or no increased production!

789
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:15,954
We want more!

790
01:09:25,701 --> 01:09:28,226
I'm still in one piece!

791
01:09:28,303 --> 01:09:31,932
- I think.
- I can't imagine why.

792
01:09:32,007 --> 01:09:36,671
Our descent, in what I take to be
the volcano of Mount Etna...

793
01:09:36,745 --> 01:09:40,841
should have been slowed
by a rising cushion of warm air.

794
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:43,918
Damn thing seems to have gone out.

795
01:09:45,254 --> 01:09:48,917
Oh, no! Not more giants!

796
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,756
Can I help you tiny mortals?

797
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:58,522
I sincerely hope so.

798
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,693
I'm Baron Munchausen.

799
01:10:02,504 --> 01:10:04,495
You may have heard of me.

800
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:06,438
My friends and I are looking
for three men:

801
01:10:06,508 --> 01:10:09,204
One with exceptional eyesight.

802
01:10:09,278 --> 01:10:12,679
One with superb hearing
and powerful lungs.

803
01:10:12,748 --> 01:10:14,909
One who is extremely large and strong.

804
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,279
We're all extremely large
and strong here!

805
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:35,763
I am Vulcan, the god.

806
01:10:36,839 --> 01:10:38,807
And these...

807
01:10:38,874 --> 01:10:42,708
are my giant employees...

808
01:10:42,778 --> 01:10:45,747
the cyclops...

809
01:10:45,814 --> 01:10:49,614
who even now are going back to work!

810
01:10:49,685 --> 01:10:51,619
Go slow!

811
01:10:53,856 --> 01:10:59,522
I'm willing to supply arms and equipment
to anyone prepared to pay the price!

812
01:10:59,595 --> 01:11:03,861
Greeks, Trojans, Romans, Huns.

813
01:11:03,932 --> 01:11:07,925
It's not my fault if they're
crazy enough to slaughter each other!

814
01:11:09,738 --> 01:11:12,764
You mankey crew!

815
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:15,901
You go-slowers don't impress me!
I'm God.

816
01:11:15,978 --> 01:11:20,142
I've got all the time in the universe!
You hear that?

817
01:11:20,215 --> 01:11:21,944
All the time! Me!

818
01:11:22,017 --> 01:11:23,780
You know, in the old days...

819
01:11:23,852 --> 01:11:27,015
the staff used to get paid on the dot
every thousand years.

820
01:11:27,089 --> 01:11:29,683
This lot expect them every century.

821
01:11:29,758 --> 01:11:31,988
That is outrageous!

822
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:35,154
What's this?

823
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:37,698
This is our prototype.

824
01:11:37,766 --> 01:11:41,702
RX Intercontinental...

825
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:43,761
Radar Sneaky...

826
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:46,103
Multiwarheaded Nuclear Missile.

827
01:11:49,745 --> 01:11:52,373
- What does it do?
- Do?

828
01:11:52,447 --> 01:11:54,847
Kills the enemy.

829
01:11:54,917 --> 01:11:57,852
- All the enemy?
- Aye. All of them.

830
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,515
All their wives,
children, sheep, cattle.

831
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,854
And all their cats and dogs.

832
01:12:03,926 --> 01:12:07,054
All of them gone for good.

833
01:12:07,129 --> 01:12:08,619
That's horrible!

834
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:17,269
Well, you see, the advantage is...

835
01:12:17,339 --> 01:12:21,799
you don't have to see
one single one of them die.

836
01:12:21,877 --> 01:12:24,402
You just sit comfortably...

837
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:27,710
thousands of miles away
from the battlefield...

838
01:12:27,783 --> 01:12:30,775
and simply press the button.

839
01:12:31,853 --> 01:12:33,844
Well, where's the fun in that?

840
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:40,819
We cater to all sorts here.

841
01:12:40,896 --> 01:12:43,524
You'd be surprised.

842
01:12:43,599 --> 01:12:47,501
Would you care for
a little fodder, perhaps?

843
01:13:00,048 --> 01:13:04,781
- Delicious!
- It's not a bad drop of tea...

844
01:13:04,853 --> 01:13:08,186
as far as nectar of the gods go.

845
01:13:08,256 --> 01:13:11,692
You can stay as long as you like.
It's nice to have company for tea.

846
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,752
Thank you. It'll be a pleasure.

847
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:18,596
I'm sorry, but we have to go soon.

848
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:20,601
We're in a hurry.

849
01:13:25,107 --> 01:13:28,508
Here comes my midget manservant...

850
01:13:28,577 --> 01:13:30,602
with the petit fours.

851
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:33,914
Albrecht!

852
01:13:36,351 --> 01:13:40,583
- Berthold! What are you doing here?
- Looking for you!

853
01:13:40,656 --> 01:13:43,454
I haven't got the treasure anymore!
I spent it!

854
01:13:43,525 --> 01:13:45,652
I mean, I gave it all to charity.

855
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,661
I don't want the treasure.

856
01:13:47,729 --> 01:13:50,755
Albrecht, this is Sally.
Sally, Albrecht.

857
01:13:50,832 --> 01:13:51,958
Hello.

858
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:56,266
I want you to help us
fight the Turk again.

859
01:13:57,139 --> 01:13:58,834
No. I couldn't do that.

860
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:01,239
Not since I found myself.

861
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:05,268
I never really wanted to be
big and strong...

862
01:14:05,347 --> 01:14:07,281
and lug heavy things about.

863
01:14:07,349 --> 01:14:11,342
I now know I want to be dainty
and sensitive.

864
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:15,652
They call me their midget down here.
I love it. It's bliss.

865
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:17,858
He's gone funny.

866
01:15:13,582 --> 01:15:15,379
Hello.

867
01:16:01,163 --> 01:16:03,529
My darling.

868
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:05,657
My dearest.

869
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:17,573
Excuse me. May I introduce you
to Baron Munchausen...

870
01:16:17,646 --> 01:16:20,945
and his little friend over there...
Sally.

871
01:16:23,485 --> 01:16:25,578
And Berthold.

872
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:31,482
This is Venus.

873
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,551
The goddess.

874
01:16:33,628 --> 01:16:35,289
My wife.

875
01:16:36,598 --> 01:16:38,657
Madam.

876
01:16:38,733 --> 01:16:40,792
I am overwhelmed.

877
01:16:45,006 --> 01:16:46,837
Oh, my love!

878
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:48,671
My life.

879
01:16:48,743 --> 01:16:51,610
The alpha and the omega
of my existence.

880
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,910
I've got something here for you.

881
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:18,004
A diamond.

882
01:17:18,073 --> 01:17:21,065
For you, my precious.

883
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:26,205
You're so sweet.
Another diamond.

884
01:17:34,122 --> 01:17:35,612
Madam...

885
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:40,821
I am, alas, unable to offer you
so splendid a gift.

886
01:17:40,896 --> 01:17:44,161
But allow me to say
that you excel in beauty...

887
01:17:44,232 --> 01:17:47,326
even the magnificent
Catherine the Great of Russia...

888
01:17:47,402 --> 01:17:49,700
Here we go.

889
01:17:49,771 --> 01:17:53,798
Who's hand in marriage
I once had the honor of declining.

890
01:17:53,875 --> 01:17:57,641
- Baron, you flatter me.
- Not one jot, madam.

891
01:17:57,712 --> 01:17:59,646
Not one tittle.

892
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,852
What a handsome...

893
01:18:13,929 --> 01:18:15,362
moustache.

894
01:18:18,733 --> 01:18:22,328
Shall we dance?

895
01:18:51,967 --> 01:18:54,435
Come and see the ballroom.

896
01:19:26,501 --> 01:19:28,765
Nice, isn't it?

897
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:31,067
We've just had it done!

898
01:19:31,139 --> 01:19:33,073
You know that?

899
01:19:43,885 --> 01:19:46,183
I can dance.

900
01:19:46,254 --> 01:19:48,654
Here. Watch this.

901
01:20:38,807 --> 01:20:40,741
Sally, you can dance, can't you?

902
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:42,902
No.

903
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:44,911
Thanks a lot!

904
01:20:55,723 --> 01:20:57,156
Stop!

905
01:21:03,932 --> 01:21:06,457
Can we go now?

906
01:21:07,802 --> 01:21:09,235
Hello!

907
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:19,107
Stop it! Come down!

908
01:21:20,048 --> 01:21:22,539
We've got to get back!

909
01:21:22,617 --> 01:21:26,849
We've got to get back
and save the town!

910
01:21:27,789 --> 01:21:29,586
Please, Baron!

911
01:21:29,657 --> 01:21:31,591
Please!

912
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:34,628
Don't fret!
The town is in no immediate danger.

913
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:01,887
The baron's kissing your wife.

914
01:22:03,024 --> 01:22:04,116
What?

915
01:22:07,829 --> 01:22:09,763
I mean... What?

916
01:22:39,127 --> 01:22:41,789
You're a harlot!

917
01:22:41,863 --> 01:22:45,264
Whore! Did you hear? Whore!

918
01:22:48,736 --> 01:22:53,833
That's enough of that!
You stop it!

919
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:57,134
Wait. Please!

920
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,010
- But darling!
- Don't you "darling" me!

921
01:23:07,155 --> 01:23:10,454
Do something! Save him!

922
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:14,495
Darling, don't be jealous!

923
01:23:14,562 --> 01:23:18,658
Jealous! I'm not jealous!

924
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:23,693
- Give him back to me!
- Excuse me.

925
01:23:25,473 --> 01:23:27,134
You never let me have any friends!

926
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:31,144
I won't have you wiggling
at philanderers, you floozy!

927
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,874
- Sir, I must assure you...
- Floozy!

928
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:37,509
I am a goddess!
I can do what I like!

929
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:41,248
And I am the god, so shut up!

930
01:23:44,926 --> 01:23:48,089
- Excuse me...
- Put him down, you brute!

931
01:23:49,597 --> 01:23:52,532
- Ungrateful mortal!
- Please don't!

932
01:23:53,268 --> 01:23:54,929
You'll pay for this!

933
01:23:55,003 --> 01:23:58,461
- You hear me?
- I insist that the lady is blameless.

934
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:04,707
Please! Put the baron down!

935
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:08,180
- Let's not be too hasty!
- He's always like that!

936
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:21,759
- What have you done to them?
- You small-minded, petty, bourgeoise...

937
01:24:21,829 --> 01:24:24,696
Shut up, you trollop!

938
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:29,897
- What have you done to the baron?
- You want the baron?

939
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:31,939
You can have the baron!

940
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:35,874
No, thanks. It's okay!
I don't need him!

941
01:24:47,322 --> 01:24:49,449
Did you enjoy that?

942
01:24:53,161 --> 01:24:55,186
Did I...

943
01:24:55,263 --> 01:24:57,197
excite you?

944
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:24,043
I can't swim!

945
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:33,758
What's happening?
You've got old again.

946
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:35,887
What do you expect?

947
01:26:35,963 --> 01:26:38,523
I've just been expelled
from a state of bliss.

948
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:42,535
- It's all your fault!
- Where are we?

949
01:26:42,603 --> 01:26:45,367
Answer me!

950
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,672
The most probable explanation...
if you're not a sceptic...

951
01:26:49,744 --> 01:26:53,703
is we've dropped through the center of
the world and come out the other side...

952
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:55,646
somewhere in the South Seas.

953
01:26:55,716 --> 01:26:57,775
That's miles away.

954
01:26:57,852 --> 01:27:00,446
Oh! Well done.

955
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:03,684
- I was happy in my volcano.
- So was I.

956
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:06,249
Look! An island!

957
01:27:09,597 --> 01:27:13,089
- Is there a volcano in it?
- Shut up about your poxy volcano!

958
01:27:17,238 --> 01:27:20,867
I think there is a volcano on it.

959
01:27:27,014 --> 01:27:28,572
It's moving!

960
01:27:28,649 --> 01:27:31,447
I spy with my little eye...

961
01:27:31,519 --> 01:27:33,453
something beginning with "M."

962
01:27:34,489 --> 01:27:36,389
It's the demon of the deep!

963
01:27:36,457 --> 01:27:39,358
That begins with "D," you klutz!

964
01:27:39,427 --> 01:27:41,987
It's "M" for monster!

965
01:27:47,835 --> 01:27:49,598
Will it eat us?

966
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:51,433
With any luck.

967
01:29:08,215 --> 01:29:09,682
Baron!

968
01:29:18,259 --> 01:29:20,193
Give me a hand.

969
01:29:21,429 --> 01:29:23,522
He looks dead to me.

970
01:29:23,598 --> 01:29:26,032
He can't be dead!

971
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,863
Go ahead.

972
01:29:27,935 --> 01:29:29,869
Let's put him there.

973
01:29:32,974 --> 01:29:35,875
He doesn't look very perky, does he?

974
01:29:37,778 --> 01:29:39,439
Is there a doctor in the fish?

975
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:44,884
No doctors.

976
01:29:48,556 --> 01:29:52,219
We've got to get him warm and dry.

977
01:29:52,293 --> 01:29:54,261
What's that noise?

978
01:29:54,996 --> 01:29:57,521
It's music.

979
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:00,767
That's not music.

980
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:02,601
Look!

981
01:30:04,538 --> 01:30:06,267
There's a light.

982
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:08,274
Come on!

983
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:17,150
This way.

984
01:30:17,218 --> 01:30:18,651
Careful.

985
01:30:54,188 --> 01:30:57,123
Once I had a sweetheart

986
01:30:57,191 --> 01:30:59,352
A sweetheart, once I had

987
01:30:59,427 --> 01:31:02,624
She was the truest

988
01:31:02,697 --> 01:31:04,358
Excuse me!

989
01:31:04,432 --> 01:31:05,865
Hello!

990
01:31:07,768 --> 01:31:09,929
We need some help.

991
01:31:11,138 --> 01:31:12,867
Excuse me!

992
01:31:16,177 --> 01:31:18,873
- We need some help.
- No doctors.

993
01:31:22,183 --> 01:31:24,515
Once I had a sweetheart

994
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:28,385
Do I hear the baron?

995
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:29,889
Eh?

996
01:31:31,559 --> 01:31:33,493
Do I hear the baron?

997
01:31:34,495 --> 01:31:36,622
No doctors.

998
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:38,927
Do I hear the baron?

999
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:40,933
I just said that!

1000
01:31:41,001 --> 01:31:43,936
Use your trumpet!

1001
01:31:48,209 --> 01:31:50,803
Adolphus! Gustavus!

1002
01:31:50,878 --> 01:31:53,073
Is it really you?

1003
01:31:53,147 --> 01:31:55,172
Baron! Berthold!

1004
01:31:55,249 --> 01:31:59,185
- Albrecht!
- I don't believe it!

1005
01:31:59,253 --> 01:32:00,982
It's Berthold!

1006
01:32:03,891 --> 01:32:08,123
Sally, this is Adolphus, who used
to be able to hit a bull's eye...

1007
01:32:08,195 --> 01:32:10,527
from halfway 'round the world.

1008
01:32:10,598 --> 01:32:12,725
And this is Gustavus...

1009
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,997
who could blow over a whole forest
with just one breath!

1010
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:19,198
Those were the days! Aye?

1011
01:32:19,273 --> 01:32:24,176
When we were young and alive!

1012
01:32:25,412 --> 01:32:26,936
How do you mean?

1013
01:32:27,014 --> 01:32:29,505
It's no good fighting it.

1014
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:32,609
- We're not dead!
- You have to accept it.

1015
01:32:32,686 --> 01:32:37,089
We're all dead here.
This is hell!

1016
01:32:37,158 --> 01:32:39,388
- Heaven.
- Hell!

1017
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,791
Heaven!

1018
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:43,022
Don't be stupid.

1019
01:32:45,699 --> 01:32:49,567
Well, sit down. Relax.
Have a game.

1020
01:32:49,637 --> 01:32:54,734
You're dead for a very long time.

1021
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,804
Come on. Sit down.

1022
01:32:57,878 --> 01:33:00,346
Let's have a nice game.

1023
01:33:00,414 --> 01:33:02,575
What are you doing?

1024
01:33:04,885 --> 01:33:06,853
You're giving up, aren't you?

1025
01:33:07,922 --> 01:33:10,891
You can't give up!
I won't let you!

1026
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:12,858
Go away. Clear off.

1027
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:20,423
What about Rose and Daisy
and my father...

1028
01:33:20,501 --> 01:33:22,298
and all the others?

1029
01:33:22,369 --> 01:33:26,430
- You promised to help them!
- They are perfectly safe.

1030
01:33:33,447 --> 01:33:36,075
They can look after themselves.

1031
01:33:40,754 --> 01:33:45,282
Besides, there are
more important things.

1032
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:47,520
Such as?

1033
01:33:47,595 --> 01:33:49,028
Well...

1034
01:34:05,112 --> 01:34:07,046
You horrible little brat!

1035
01:34:12,219 --> 01:34:16,656
Can't you let me die in peace
once in a while?

1036
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:45,741
Bucephalus!

1037
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:49,550
My Bucephalus!

1038
01:34:51,258 --> 01:34:53,886
You must have heard me shouting.

1039
01:34:54,828 --> 01:34:57,661
This is a good omen, what?

1040
01:34:57,731 --> 01:34:59,323
Oh, yeah.

1041
01:35:02,303 --> 01:35:04,897
Prepare a rowing boat
and be ready to leave.

1042
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,370
Come on, boy.

1043
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:11,911
I have learned from experience...

1044
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:16,712
that a modicum of snuff
can be most efficacious.

1045
01:36:22,716 --> 01:36:25,014
I'll never eat fish again.

1046
01:36:27,654 --> 01:36:29,645
Where's the baron?

1047
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:47,373
Baron, where are you?

1048
01:36:58,085 --> 01:37:00,451
It's the baron!

1049
01:37:07,094 --> 01:37:08,288
Come on.

1050
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:12,291
I can't keep this up forever!

1051
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:38,053
Look! The town!

1052
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:40,059
We're here!

1053
01:37:42,496 --> 01:37:43,929
Look!

1054
01:37:45,499 --> 01:37:47,729
The flag's still flying!

1055
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:50,702
I told you there was nothing
to worry about.

1056
01:37:52,906 --> 01:37:53,838
Fire!

1057
01:37:55,576 --> 01:37:57,441
Oh, my God!

1058
01:37:57,511 --> 01:37:59,376
It's the sultan's army!

1059
01:37:59,446 --> 01:38:01,846
Quick! Back in the fish!

1060
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:07,017
They're inviting us to defeat them.

1061
01:38:07,087 --> 01:38:10,352
We must oblige them.
On the count of three!

1062
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:17,357
Gustavus! Blow them back to Asia Minor.

1063
01:38:17,431 --> 01:38:20,696
Adolphus, find the sultan
and shoot him!

1064
01:38:20,767 --> 01:38:23,065
Albrecht, row for the shore!

1065
01:38:23,137 --> 01:38:26,766
Berthold, make yourself useful!

1066
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:28,603
One, two, three!

1067
01:38:28,675 --> 01:38:30,233
Could you make that four?

1068
01:38:33,013 --> 01:38:34,913
We're going down!

1069
01:38:37,317 --> 01:38:38,944
Abandon ship!

1070
01:38:41,522 --> 01:38:43,581
I think the ship's
abandoning us, mate!

1071
01:38:48,295 --> 01:38:50,160
Jump!

1072
01:38:54,067 --> 01:38:55,125
Attack!

1073
01:39:04,044 --> 01:39:05,978
I still can't swim.

1074
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:19,523
- This is absolutely dreadful!
- It's hopeless.

1075
01:39:19,593 --> 01:39:23,188
I've never before been
in such a disastrous rout!

1076
01:39:23,263 --> 01:39:25,527
I'm usually on the winning side!

1077
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:28,693
If you weren't so competitive,
you wouldn't get so upset!

1078
01:39:28,769 --> 01:39:31,101
Albrecht's useless!

1079
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:34,106
We might as well give up now.

1080
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:39,004
You mustn't say that! Not you!

1081
01:39:44,818 --> 01:39:47,946
If we begin attacking
in two directions simultaneously...

1082
01:39:48,021 --> 01:39:50,649
we confound surprise with confusion.

1083
01:39:50,724 --> 01:39:54,717
Albrecht and Gustavus will provide
the major themes to the battle...

1084
01:39:54,795 --> 01:39:56,990
- while Adolphus and...
- Baron.

1085
01:39:57,064 --> 01:40:00,329
Don't interrupt. What is it?

1086
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,630
This isn't going to work.

1087
01:40:02,703 --> 01:40:07,333
- What do you mean?
- They're all old and tired now.

1088
01:40:07,407 --> 01:40:09,466
It isn't like it used to be.

1089
01:40:10,744 --> 01:40:12,371
Don't you see?

1090
01:40:20,087 --> 01:40:22,681
Where are you going?

1091
01:40:22,756 --> 01:40:25,350
- To give myself up.
- What?

1092
01:40:25,425 --> 01:40:29,361
I gave my word I'd raze the siege
and save the town.

1093
01:40:29,429 --> 01:40:31,226
I gathered you for that purpose.

1094
01:40:35,769 --> 01:40:38,636
If you want to see
Baron Munchausen again...

1095
01:40:38,705 --> 01:40:41,071
you'd better do something about it.

1096
01:40:44,678 --> 01:40:46,543
You can't give yourself up!

1097
01:40:46,613 --> 01:40:49,013
They might kill you!

1098
01:40:49,082 --> 01:40:53,246
We'll have spent all that time
in that smelly fish for nothing.

1099
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,753
Well!

1100
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:29,084
So it's agreed.
Friday, the 28th...

1101
01:41:29,156 --> 01:41:32,148
you surrender...
that's three weeks from tomorrow.

1102
01:41:32,225 --> 01:41:34,455
We can fix the details later.

1103
01:41:34,528 --> 01:41:39,261
- No. You surrender.
- We've been through all this.

1104
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:42,131
- You surrender.
- But we're winning.

1105
01:41:42,202 --> 01:41:44,636
- We surrendered last time.
- So?

1106
01:41:44,705 --> 01:41:46,400
Now it's your turn.

1107
01:41:46,473 --> 01:41:49,340
Oh. What about the virgins?

1108
01:41:49,409 --> 01:41:52,469
Please. Forget the virgins.

1109
01:41:52,546 --> 01:41:54,776
We're out of virgins.

1110
01:41:54,848 --> 01:41:57,612
Let us, instead, concentrate
on reaching a rational...

1111
01:41:57,684 --> 01:41:59,618
sensible, civilized agreement...

1112
01:41:59,686 --> 01:42:03,452
which will guarantee a world
fit for science, progress and...

1113
01:42:03,523 --> 01:42:05,286
But not Baron Munchausen!

1114
01:42:07,361 --> 01:42:11,161
- You! You old lunatic!
- I'm afraid so.

1115
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:13,722
Help! Guards! Murder!

1116
01:42:14,868 --> 01:42:17,496
- Who let this man into my tent?
- Sultan!

1117
01:42:17,571 --> 01:42:22,440
If you are still interested
in my head, it's yours.

1118
01:42:22,509 --> 01:42:24,443
I'm tired of it.

1119
01:42:24,511 --> 01:42:26,809
Send for the executioner!

1120
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,313
So, Mr. Jackson.

1121
01:42:28,382 --> 01:42:31,146
Still the rational man?

1122
01:42:31,218 --> 01:42:35,587
How many people have perished
in your logical little war?

1123
01:42:35,655 --> 01:42:39,386
There are certain rules
to the proper conduct of living.

1124
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:43,327
We cannot fly to the moon.
We cannot defy death.

1125
01:42:43,397 --> 01:42:45,228
We must face the facts.

1126
01:42:45,298 --> 01:42:50,167
Not the folly of fantasists like you
who don't live in the real world...

1127
01:42:50,237 --> 01:42:54,173
and who consequently come
to a very sticky end.

1128
01:43:32,112 --> 01:43:34,876
Have you any famous last words?

1129
01:43:34,948 --> 01:43:36,939
Not yet.

1130
01:43:37,684 --> 01:43:40,551
"Not yet"?
Is that famous?

1131
01:43:42,289 --> 01:43:44,018
The man's a buffoon.

1132
01:43:45,959 --> 01:43:47,017
Executioner...

1133
01:43:48,528 --> 01:43:49,688
execute.

1134
01:44:11,685 --> 01:44:12,811
Now!

1135
01:44:20,393 --> 01:44:22,384
He did it!

1136
01:44:29,336 --> 01:44:30,803
Bring him back!

1137
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:36,739
- Stop that man!
- Hey!

1138
01:44:58,498 --> 01:45:00,864
I knew we could do it!
All together now!

1139
01:45:22,722 --> 01:45:24,553
Steady!

1140
01:45:27,561 --> 01:45:29,358
Well blown, Gustavus!

1141
01:45:46,246 --> 01:45:48,908
- They're coming!
- Go on!

1142
01:45:48,982 --> 01:45:51,473
Hurry!
Quickly now!

1143
01:46:22,115 --> 01:46:23,673
Come on!

1144
01:46:35,862 --> 01:46:37,796
Berthold, run!

1145
01:47:38,091 --> 01:47:41,527
Damn it, man! Make yourself useful!
I can't do everything!

1146
01:47:46,866 --> 01:47:49,926
- This way!
- Careful!

1147
01:48:01,381 --> 01:48:03,713
That's the way.

1148
01:49:03,977 --> 01:49:05,945
Watch it!

1149
01:49:16,689 --> 01:49:18,623
Gently this time.

1150
01:49:20,794 --> 01:49:22,227
Gently.

1151
01:50:01,067 --> 01:50:02,500
Help!

1152
01:51:15,074 --> 01:51:16,666
We did it!

1153
01:51:32,792 --> 01:51:35,625
Hurray!

1154
01:51:35,695 --> 01:51:37,822
Look! They don't believe it!

1155
01:51:37,897 --> 01:51:40,229
We've won!

1156
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,860
We beat them!

1157
01:51:49,475 --> 01:51:52,137
Yipee! Thank God!

1158
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:55,442
- Good riddance! And don't come back!
- We won!

1159
01:51:55,515 --> 01:51:58,382
But of course!

1160
01:52:28,681 --> 01:52:31,775
We won! Oh, the joy!

1161
01:53:05,685 --> 01:53:07,949
Get me down!

1162
01:53:16,195 --> 01:53:17,924
Oh, my goodness!

1163
01:53:20,533 --> 01:53:22,364
- In the church tower!
- He's dying!

1164
01:53:36,215 --> 01:53:37,978
- There he is!
- Shoot him!

1165
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:40,548
Oh! Damn!

1166
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:44,818
Bring a doctor! Quickly!
Fetch a doctor!

1167
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:47,189
Don't leave me, Baron. Please!

1168
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:51,959
- Don't leave me!
- Get off him! Give him some air!

1169
01:53:55,368 --> 01:53:58,997
- Here is a doctor.
- Sally!

1170
01:54:02,375 --> 01:54:04,809
Take care of Sally.

1171
01:54:04,877 --> 01:54:07,869
No doctors.

1172
01:54:29,135 --> 01:54:31,535
- Get away!
- Stop!

1173
01:54:31,604 --> 01:54:33,071
Leave him alone!

1174
01:54:36,075 --> 01:54:39,408
- She's having a fit!
- Go away!

1175
01:54:44,951 --> 01:54:46,509
Stop it!

1176
01:54:59,132 --> 01:55:00,929
He's dead.

1177
01:56:07,066 --> 01:56:12,026
And that was only one of the many
occasions where I met my death.

1178
01:56:12,104 --> 01:56:16,837
An experience which I don't
hesitate strongly...

1179
01:56:16,909 --> 01:56:18,740
to recommend.

1180
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:23,475
And so, with the help of my
inestimable servants...

1181
01:56:23,549 --> 01:56:27,645
I defeated the Turks
and saved the day.

1182
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,847
And from that time forth...

1183
01:56:29,922 --> 01:56:33,483
everyone who had a talent for it...

1184
01:56:33,559 --> 01:56:36,687
lived happily ever after.

1185
01:56:36,762 --> 01:56:40,664
Stop this nonsense at once!

1186
01:56:40,733 --> 01:56:42,758
You, sir, are under arrest...

1187
01:56:42,835 --> 01:56:47,272
for spreading ridiculous tales
at a time of great danger.

1188
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:49,740
When the enemy is at the gate.
Arrest him.

1189
01:56:50,943 --> 01:56:53,036
Open the gates.

1190
01:56:55,414 --> 01:56:57,882
I order you to arrest that man
at once!

1191
01:56:59,652 --> 01:57:03,748
Am I or am I not
the elected representative?

1192
01:57:03,823 --> 01:57:06,223
- Arrest him!
- Open the gates!

1193
01:57:10,096 --> 01:57:11,358
This way!

1194
01:57:13,432 --> 01:57:14,922
Come on!

1195
01:57:16,068 --> 01:57:18,593
Do not open the gate!

1196
01:57:18,671 --> 01:57:22,129
The Turk is outside,
and we are not about to surrender.

1197
01:57:23,376 --> 01:57:25,310
Open the gates!

1198
01:57:28,047 --> 01:57:32,916
Come on, dear ladies!
Forward, the players!

1199
01:57:32,985 --> 01:57:35,112
Do not open the gate!

1200
01:57:36,956 --> 01:57:39,220
Keep up! Steady as you go.

1201
01:57:39,292 --> 01:57:42,591
Get back! I'm warning you!
Do not open those gates!

1202
01:57:43,596 --> 01:57:45,530
- This way!
- Anyone who opens those gates...

1203
01:57:45,598 --> 01:57:47,259
is guilty of treason!

1204
01:57:49,001 --> 01:57:51,663
Follow me!

1205
01:57:52,805 --> 01:57:55,740
This way, my friends!

1206
01:57:59,312 --> 01:58:01,644
The gates will remain closed.

1207
01:58:01,714 --> 01:58:03,648
Open the gates!

1208
01:58:05,251 --> 01:58:08,982
- Shoot anyone who disobeys my orders!
- Ready!

1209
01:58:09,055 --> 01:58:10,317
Aim!

1210
01:58:13,192 --> 01:58:15,592
Hold your ground!

1211
01:58:15,661 --> 01:58:17,424
Open the gates, dear friends...

1212
01:58:17,496 --> 01:58:20,363
and let's seize the day!

1213
01:58:20,433 --> 01:58:24,267
Or close our minds up
with inventions, death and fear.

1214
01:58:24,337 --> 01:58:26,328
There's nothing so
destroys a man...

1215
01:58:26,405 --> 01:58:28,532
as ignorance and conformity!

1216
01:58:28,607 --> 01:58:30,768
Grasp for the mantle!

1217
01:58:30,843 --> 01:58:33,778
- Grasp the...
- No!

1218
01:58:33,846 --> 01:58:35,609
Quite wrong!

1219
01:58:35,681 --> 01:58:38,047
Open the gates!

1220
01:58:39,752 --> 01:58:41,310
Shoot them!

1221
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:47,716
Shoot these people at once!

1222
01:58:56,902 --> 01:59:00,998
Aye! So! It's treason, is it?

1223
01:59:01,073 --> 01:59:03,098
Treason!

1224
01:59:03,175 --> 01:59:04,870
Right!

1225
01:59:04,944 --> 01:59:07,606
You're all under arrest!
All of you!

1226
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:09,477
This is all your fault!

1227
01:59:09,548 --> 01:59:11,243
Get inside my office now!

1228
01:59:40,579 --> 01:59:42,911
Cheers for the baron!

1229
01:59:42,982 --> 01:59:45,382
Hooray!

1230
01:59:59,932 --> 02:00:02,196
My Bucephalus.

1231
02:00:02,268 --> 02:00:04,202
Good boy.

1232
02:00:10,109 --> 02:00:11,770
Come on.

1233
02:00:16,615 --> 02:00:19,743
Beautiful ladies.

1234
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,574
It wasn't just a story, was it?
