1
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,190
<i>You once said, talking
about your childhood,</i>

2
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,199
<i>"I grew up with seriousness
all around me. "</i>

3
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,532
<i>Yeah. My parents
were very, very strict.</i>

4
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,973
He thinks
I put up 100,000

5
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,985
to watch it
go down the toilet?

6
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,487
<i>He doesn't care
about your money.</i>

7
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,387
I want him to know
it's every cent I've got.

8
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,891
It represents
pocket change.

9
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,325
I can't get hit harder.

10
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,556
Does he know what this
can do to me and Karen?

11
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,326
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

12
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,832
Does he know it?

13
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,902
Michael...

14
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,937
Listen, Roger, that does it.

15
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,006
Sounds good.
Fax it to me.

16
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,507
I'll look at it,
talk to you tomorrow.

17
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,871
I tried to keep it quiet.

18
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,377
I heard a noise
from downstairs.

19
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,448
Didn't you hear it?

20
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,449
No. I was on
the phone with Roger.

21
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,018
It's probably the wind,

22
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,018
Fuzzface here.

23
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,021
Why does he hate me?

24
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,523
If you paid more
attention to him,

25
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,024
he'd like you better.

26
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,027
If I fed him goodies
like you do.

27
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,029
I think you're jealous
ofTiny.

28
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,691
Of course. He sleeps
with you more often.

29
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:03,967
Is that...

30
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,970
Um, I'll go down.

31
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,632
Maybe we should
call the police.

32
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,969
No, that's O.K.

33
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,976
I'll just check it out.

34
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,484
Don't worry.
If it's anything serious,

35
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,281
I'll come back
for my driver.

36
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,993
Michael,
is everything all right?

37
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:43,993
There's somebody
in the house.

38
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,085
Call the police.

39
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,460
Call the police.

40
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,726
Michael!

41
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,574
No!

42
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,269
Stop it.

43
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,880
Stop!

44
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,279
Stop, motherfucker!

45
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,315
Back off.

46
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,612
Back off.

47
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,617
Back off!.

48
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,618
O.K.

49
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,188
Drop it! Drop-drop it!

50
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,221
Drop it.

51
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,451
Drop it!

52
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,220
Just take anything
you want, all right?

53
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,454
You can have my watch.

54
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,995
I don't want
that goddamn watch.

55
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,258
Please don't hurt her.

56
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,028
I'll give you
anything you want.

57
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,429
Aah!

58
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,504
Karen!

59
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,137
Police, sir.

60
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,979
Hi. Come on in, guys.

61
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,139
Hi. I'm Officer Cole.

62
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,479
This is my partner
Officer Davis.

63
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,643
Mike, how are you?

64
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,980
What happened
to your foot?

65
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,988
I knocked a beer bottle
down in the kitchen.

66
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,490
I stepped in it.
It's nothing, really.

67
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,494
So, Mr. Carr, can you
tell us what happened?

68
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,724
Yeah. We were, uh,
we were upstairs in my office,

69
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,992
my wife and I,

70
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,624
and we, uh, heard a noise.

71
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,568
This is my wife Karen.

72
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,536
Thanks for coming
so quickly.

73
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,006
What happened after
you heard the noise?

74
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,510
Michael went down,
and I-I, uh...

75
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,513
I- I heard another noise.

76
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,550
I went down, and, uh...

77
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,852
It's O.K., Mrs. Carr.

78
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,512
Just take your time.

79
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,524
Well, this man jumped
out of the closet,

80
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,457
and he and Michael fought.

81
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,462
It wasn't much
of a fight, really.

82
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,031
I just grabbed his leg.

83
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,032
He was trying
to get away.

84
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,533
Got out in the kitchen.

85
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,036
He got ahold of Karen
and went out back.

86
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,436
He put a knife
to her throat.

87
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,905
You O.K.?

88
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,907
Yes.

89
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,272
You need a doctor?

90
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,276
No.

91
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,277
You sure?

92
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,347
Yeah, thanks.

93
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,142
Tiny.

94
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,580
Tiny?

95
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,448
Come here, Tiny.

96
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,818
Not a very good
watch cat, are you, Tiny?

97
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:58,890
He's useless.

98
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,620
Well, I guess
he likes policemen.

99
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,995
We'll have someone over in
the morning to dust for prints.

100
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,730
Try and not disturb
too much.

101
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,238
We've had several break-ins
in this area lately.

102
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,502
We're pretty sure
it's the same guy.

103
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,668
On this street?

104
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,338
In this general area,
but we'll get him.

105
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,005
Wouldn't mind
being there for that.

106
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,173
Does anybody want coffee?

107
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,513
Yes. I never
turn down coffee.

108
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,551
Whoa! Watch-

109
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,745
Watch the glass.

110
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,822
Oh.

111
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,015
Excuse me.

112
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,091
Thanks.

113
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,524
If this guy's been
doing this around here,

114
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,755
is there any chance
he's going to come back?

115
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,525
We were told this
was a safe neighborhood.

116
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,225
All things considered,
Mrs. Carr,

117
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,029
this is a safe neighborhood.

118
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,037
Mr. Carr probably scared
the hell out of the guy,

119
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,367
so he won't come back.

120
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,702
I'm getting a gun.

121
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,707
What?

122
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,868
I'm getting a gun.

123
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,535
No guns in this house.

124
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,546
Maybe she'll listen
to you guys.

125
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,910
Don't get a gun.

126
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,246
You can say that.
You've got one.

127
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,784
And I'm trained to use it.

128
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,875
I've done some shooting.

129
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:02,851
At targets.

130
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,853
Not people.

131
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,150
Look, take our advice.

132
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,417
Get an alarm.

133
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,925
Get a dog.
Forget about guns.

134
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:11,496
The wrong people
always get hurt.

135
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,500
Nice people.

136
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,504
Hey, I know what
you're thinking.

137
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,133
What-what am I
thinking, Roy?

138
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,520
I'm never going
to be able to sleep.

139
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,021
Me, either.

140
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,928
I thought he-

141
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,533
When he grabbed me,
I thought...

142
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,538
It's all right.

143
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,541
I don't think
I can stay here, Michael.

144
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,042
It's just so weird.

145
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,544
We'll get
some things together

146
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,977
and go to a hotel.

147
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,983
No. I mean I don't think
I can live here anymore.

148
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,986
I think we should
sell the house.

149
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,487
Wait. You love this house.

150
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,648
I know, but we
really don't need this.

151
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,656
Slow down.

152
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,726
Michael,

153
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,351
we're in way
over our heads.

154
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,293
We can barely
afford this place.

155
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,625
Don't get carried away.

156
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,030
Know what
we're going to do?

157
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,932
We're going to take
that cop's advice.

158
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,495
Tomorrow morning
I'll make a few phone calls.

159
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:32,043
We'll get the best security system
known to man, all right?

160
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,544
If that doesn't do it,
we'll just-we'll-

161
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,047
We'll get
a killer watchdog.

162
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,049
I mean, a vicious...

163
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,550
pit bull...

164
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,711
with fangs...

165
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,379
with a studded collar.

166
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,420
Come on, honey.

167
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,049
We'll be all right.

168
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,652
Come on.

169
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,960
You chased him around
with a fucking putter?

170
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,468
You're a hero.

171
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,902
Dirty Harry
and Arnold Palmer

172
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,996
all wrapped into one,
that's me.

173
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,165
Sounds pretty intense.

174
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,004
With me, boom.
Heart attack. Done.

175
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,510
You did O.K.
You guys all right?

176
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,012
Yeah. Well, Karen's upset.

177
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,513
Shit. Here he comes.

178
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,683
We have to kiss him?

179
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,490
Gentlemen.

180
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,528
I read your prospectus.
Demographics look good.

181
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,033
Well, I'll tell you,Jerry.

182
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,535
I'm not a big believer
in demographics.

183
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,696
It's a lawyer's tool.

184
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,034
No offense, Roger.

185
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,038
None taken.

186
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,199
Quite an amazing place.

187
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,209
The potential here's
fantastic, huh?

188
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,541
I've learned to go
with my instincts.

189
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,547
The one time
I used demographics,

190
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,707
I went belly up.

191
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,045
That wasn't Denver, was it?

192
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,209
He's done his homework.

193
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,547
You weren't the only one.

194
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,555
I put a lot of my
clients' money there.

195
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,557
All those buildings
are still empty.

196
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,058
That won't happen here.

197
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,718
This downtown area
has undergone

198
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,296
some amazing revitalization.

199
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,558
Those new buildings
over the last 10 years?

200
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,792
All filled with people,

201
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,994
all within shouting distance
of this place here.

202
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,003
O.K. Here's what
I want to do,

203
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,005
what worked
the other three times.

204
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,007
Put on a backers' party-

205
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,170
It's mine.

206
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,179
Hello.

207
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,340
Hi. It's me.

208
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,347
Hey.

209
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,382
Bad timing?

210
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,181
We're in the middle of it,
but we're getting close.

211
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,687
What's going on?

212
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,519
Those security people
haven't shown up yet,

213
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,526
neither have the police
to dust for prints.

214
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:30,856
Did you call?

215
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,523
Yeah. All I get
is the runaround.

216
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,099
Great.
I'll tell you what.

217
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,599
Here's what you do.

218
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,862
Call the police.

219
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,030
Ask to talk to those cops
from last night.

220
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,040
Those guys can help, O.K.?

221
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,200
O.K. I'll try.

222
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,437
I'll be home soon.
You all right?

223
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,443
Uh-huh.

224
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,535
You sure?

225
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,046
I love you. Bye.

226
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,716
Michael, this guy's good.

227
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,048
I'm being grilled here.

228
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,713
Michael, this area's high-crime.

229
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,313
So you get people in.

230
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,450
How do you keep
the bad element out?

231
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,892
I'm into that as we speak.

232
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,987
I'm working
on security right now.

233
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,523
Ha ha ha!

234
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,526
Michael, you remember
Officer Davis?

235
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,027
Oh, yeah.
How you doing?

236
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,530
I didn't recognize you
out of uniform.

237
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:41,690
You did all this?

238
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,858
It's no big deal.

239
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,526
It is.
We appreciate it.

240
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,604
It's the least I could do.

241
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,536
Mrs. Carr called my captain

242
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,541
and said nice things
about me and my partner.

243
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:52,905
Usually people call to bitch.

244
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,536
It was nice.
I'm grateful.

245
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,273
Can I get you something?

246
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,781
Sure. That would be great.

247
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,714
- Great.
- Thanks.

248
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,484
There's going
to be contact switches

249
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,489
on every point of entry.

250
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,991
A breeze won't
get into this house

251
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,492
without you knowing it.

252
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,995
Here you'll have
an infrared motion detector.

253
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,997
This right here
will be tripped

254
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,498
if anybody
breaks the glass.

255
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:19,002
Hey, w-what's he doing
in the bathroom here?

256
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,002
Oh.

257
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,003
Um...

258
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,007
It's-it's just
an extra precaution.

259
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,508
It's a safe room.

260
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,512
These old houses are great

261
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,515
because the doors
are like solid rock!

262
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,518
We put a heavy dead bolt
on each entrance here.

263
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,178
In case there's an intruder,

264
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,519
you lock yourself in
and wait for the cavalry,

265
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,024
which is us.

266
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,529
You just have to pick out
a code word now.

267
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,361
It's got to be seven letters.

268
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,000
Pyramid.

269
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,006
Pyramid?

270
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,307
Uh, this is
the Michael Carr residence,

271
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,905
and the code word's
going to be "pyramid. "

272
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,483
Right.

273
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,109
O.K. Thank you.

274
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,486
That's it.

275
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,985
Oh, yeah.

276
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,992
440 cubes, 500 horses.

277
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,686
Jesus.

278
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,490
You do the work yourself?

279
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,497
Uh-huh.
Every nut and bolt.

280
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,328
Installed the alarm.
Relaxes me.

281
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,334
That is nice, really nice.

282
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,233
Thanks.

283
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,010
You got a knack for
this security stuff.

284
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,013
Did you ever think about
consulting as a sideline?

285
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,013
Consulting?

286
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,014
Yeah.

287
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,141
Homes, businesses.

288
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,515
I got a club
I'm putting together downtown.

289
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,019
It's what you're doing today,

290
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,181
but you get paid
for your time.

291
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,689
I never thought about it.

292
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,986
Staying for dinner?

293
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,424
Yeah.

294
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,428
- You doing anything?
- Not tonight.

295
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,020
I'd be crossing the line-

296
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,091
Cops on one side,
everybody else on the other.

297
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,363
Come on in.

298
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,176
This has really been nice.

299
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,677
Usually, dinner for me

300
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,974
is a bunch of us
sitting around

301
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,982
boring each other
with war stories.

302
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,483
That's why cops
stick together.

303
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,984
Nobody else
could stand us.

304
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,486
You've never been married?

305
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,748
No. Nope.

306
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,518
She'll try to line you up
with one of her friends.

307
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,527
I'll get her,Jack!

308
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,597
Sorry, Michael.

309
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,495
She smells that meat
and goes crazy.

310
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,500
Meet me around the front.

311
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,503
I'm sorry.
I'm still a little freaked.

312
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,630
That's O.K.

313
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,502
That's understandable.

314
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:43,479
I can't believe you've never
been serious about anyone.

315
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,645
No.

316
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,348
Cops and marriage
are a tough combination.

317
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,017
I can't believe
how much I'm talking.

318
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,618
When I was a kid,
I hardly ever talked.

319
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,027
When I was in school,
I never talked.

320
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,394
I was famous for it.

321
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,025
Oh, well,
take it from a teacher.

322
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,036
We love those
quiet little boys

323
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,833
in the back of the class.

324
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,170
Don't you believe her, Pete.

325
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,537
She loves all kids.

326
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,311
Oh, that's what's missing.

327
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,539
I'm surprised you two

328
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,047
don't have a few
running around.

329
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,549
Michael, I'm-I'm sorry
about bringing up kids.

330
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,556
That's really none
of my business.

331
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,057
I just wanted
to thank you.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,061
You really went out
of your way.

333
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,564
I can't tell you
what you did for Karen.

334
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,724
She'll bounce back.

335
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,064
She'll bounce back quicker
because of you.

336
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,071
What about you?
Have you bounced back?

337
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,573
I don't know.

338
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,576
Guy gets his hands
on your wife like that,

339
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,077
you feel pretty helpless.

340
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,579
You did what you could.

341
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,080
You showed
a lot of balls

342
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,582
going up
against that guy.

343
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,652
There was one moment
there where, uh,

344
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,084
he had ahold of her,

345
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,588
and I had that
stupid golf club,

346
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,090
but I thought
I could just-

347
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,991
I didn't-didn't
take the shot.

348
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,530
A fucking nightmare
when you think

349
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,532
about what could've
happened to her.

350
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,534
I wouldn't mind
one more shot

351
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,536
at that son of a bitch.

352
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,536
Really?

353
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,628
Hell, yeah.

354
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,174
I'd like to kick
the shit out of him.

355
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,174
I'm sure you would.

356
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,209
Wouldn't you?

357
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,041
I already know
what I would do.

358
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,205
I was just wondering

359
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,749
about a nice
civilized guy like you.

360
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,546
After what he did to Karen,

361
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,053
I think all the rules
are out the window.

362
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,248
I'd rip his fuckin' heart out.

363
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,052
Michael.

364
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,558
You're a scary guy.

365
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,401
Hey...

366
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,594
You know,

367
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,570
I bet you'd enjoy
coming on a ride-along.

368
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,571
What's that?

369
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,074
Ride along with us
on patrol one night.

370
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,234
You can do that?

371
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:54,175
We do it all the time
for writers,journalists.

372
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,406
Yeah. That sounds-

373
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,073
Yeah. I could do that.

374
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,912
I'm going to set it up.

375
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,679
Come watch us
kick some butt.

376
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,651
When?

377
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,016
Tomorrow.

378
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,282
Ugh.

379
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,322
Come on.

380
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,858
It'll be fun.

381
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,857
Yeah.

382
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,858
Why not?

383
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,861
Great. I'll see you then.

384
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,770
Sign this so your old lady
can't come after the city

385
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,346
if you get killed,
maimed, or dismembered.

386
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,847
Nothing will
happen to him.

387
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,973
He's with me.

388
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,949
Hey, Pete.

389
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,246
O.K., Mike,

390
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,348
a dope dealer, a public
defender, and my ex-wife

391
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,225
all get thrown off
the Empire State Building.

392
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,559
Which one hits
the cement first?

393
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,064
I don't know.

394
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,565
Who lands first?

395
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,067
- Who cares?
- Who cares?

396
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,574
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, my gosh.

397
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,074
Look at this.

398
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,701
Think she's
a real blonde, Roy?

399
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,017
Officer...

400
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,418
was I going too fast?

401
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,649
Mm-hmm.

402
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,522
Do you have a license
and a registration, ma'am?

403
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,026
Yes.

404
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,530
Certain types of women
just have a thing for cops.

405
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,532
They think
we're like movie stars.

406
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,057
We ever search any one
of these assholes here,

407
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,565
we'd be up to our butts
in drugs and guns.

408
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,067
This place is one giant
supermarket of shit.

409
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,228
Isn't that right, Leon?

410
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,565
Whatever you say, Officer.

411
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,730
I ain't into nothing.

412
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,171
This is Mr. Clean.

413
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,503
That's right.
That's me.

414
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,736
Yes, sir. Mr. Clean.

415
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,841
<i>Maria, como esta?</i>

416
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,846
<i>Bien.</i>

417
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,847
Everything O.K.?

418
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,848
It's O.K.

419
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,849
No problemos?

420
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,884
<i>No. No problemas.</i>

421
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,853
If there is, you
let me know, O.K.?

422
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:18,854
All right.

423
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,525
I don't think you'll
be finding any clientele

424
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,027
for your club
around here, Michael.

425
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,404
Try it.

426
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,029
Best in L.A.

427
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,041
You know,
I ate before I came out.

428
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,542
I'm really full.

429
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:41,844
So...

430
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,177
you enjoying yourself?

431
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,274
Yeah. Yeah.
It's an eye-opener.

432
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,443
Something occurred to me

433
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,044
when you were
over at the house

434
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,214
for the barbecue, Pete.

435
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,350
I don't know how it works
in Los Angeles,

436
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,054
but when I was in Phoenix
and Kansas City,

437
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,630
I hired off-duty
police officers

438
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,959
to work the club.

439
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,091
Hear that? Mike's offering us
moonlighting money.

440
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,998
I'd like to talk about it.

441
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,502
Hi.

442
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,004
Hi.

443
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,006
So how are you?

444
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,009
Are you, like,
the captain or something?

445
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,169
Lieutenant.

446
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,271
Rosa...

447
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,781
<i>Come on. Vamonos.</i>

448
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,512
Can't you see the lieutenant's
a married man?

449
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,518
Oh, yeah?

450
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:23,519
Oh.

451
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,021
Oh, well.

452
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,023
<i>Te amo, roy.</i>

453
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,023
Bye, Pete.

454
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,525
See you later, Rosa.

455
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,823
These bitches can't
get enough of us.

456
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,696
Michael, stay here.

457
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:47,876
Keep away.

458
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,376
Police. Everything
all right in there?

459
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,386
No! Everything
isn't all right!

460
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,048
Fucking asshole
hitJim in the face!

461
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,556
Fuck you!

462
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,591
Fuck you!

463
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,024
In the fucking face!

464
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,026
Shut up!

465
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,840
There you go.

466
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:19,501
You all right?

467
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,509
Attaboy.

468
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:22,512
Just stay here with me

469
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,206
and hang on
for a second.

470
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,715
Roy, I'll take him now.

471
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,218
Take that piece of shit
back to the jailhouse

472
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,583
where he belongs!

473
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,621
Aah!

474
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:32,917
Mom!

475
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:33,922
Mommy!

476
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,492
See? They got him.

477
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,548
Why don't you go up and
get yourself cleaned up?

478
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,484
Me and Mike
will put the car to bed.

479
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,986
Works for me.

480
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,488
Later, gentlemen.

481
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,614
Take care.

482
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,996
It's a hell of a life,
huh, Mike?

483
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,497
Is it always like this?

484
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,999
Oh, yeah.
Day in and day out.

485
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,160
Hop up in front.

486
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,998
Uh, yeah.

487
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,005
And your wife
wants to know

488
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,507
why I can't meet
a nice woman.

489
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,510
You guys handled it all
pretty well.

490
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,512
Listen, where are we headed?

491
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,515
Just got one more
errand to run.

492
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,754
Come on!

493
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:44,760
Move!

494
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,626
Michael!

495
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,029
Aah!

496
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,194
Stay there.

497
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,466
Michael, meet Ernie Pike.

498
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,768
Come out and I.D.
This piece of shit.

499
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,275
Come on,
motherfucker!

500
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,436
Hey, that's him!

501
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:02,877
You got him.

502
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,471
Goddamn it!
That's him!

503
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,641
Did you hear that?
You just been made.

504
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:10,050
You just been made,
scumbag!

505
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,988
Picked up
a crackhead pal of his.

506
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,490
Turned in Pike here.

507
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,493
You broke into
my friend's house?

508
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,653
Huh?

509
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,323
Did you scare him
and his pretty wife?

510
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:24,334
Did you do that?
Did you do that?

511
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,063
O.K. I'm sorry, man.

512
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:27,160
O.K.?

513
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,069
Shut the fuck up!

514
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,735
He doesn't want to hear
about you being sorry.

515
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,006
He wants to kick your ass,

516
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,014
and guess what, scumbag?

517
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,243
I'm going to let him.

518
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,011
Ready?

519
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,315
What?

520
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,413
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

521
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:47,422
Are you serious?

522
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,457
Yeah, I'm serious.

523
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,959
You said you wanted

524
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,722
to rip his
fucking heart out.

525
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,231
Well, yeah, but I mean,
that was, you know-

526
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,028
I was just talking.

527
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,193
Tell him.

528
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,704
Say it. Say how you wanted
that uptown pussy.

529
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:02,636
Say it!

530
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,039
Is that what
you wanted? Say it!

531
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,132
Say it!

532
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,142
O.K. I...

533
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,143
Tell him!

534
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,645
Whatever you say, man.

535
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,045
Whatever you say.

536
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,343
Come here.

537
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,350
Don't you
fucking resist me.

538
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,249
Don't you resist me!

539
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,484
Now walk.

540
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,286
I said walk.

541
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,995
He just gave you the O.K.

542
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,861
Here. You don't even
have to touch him.

543
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,162
I wasn't going to
hurt nobody, man.

544
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,167
Shut up.

545
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,168
Come on.

546
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,000
Come on, Michael.

547
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,801
It's O.K. Listen.

548
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,569
He resisted.
He gets hit.

549
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:39,643
Shit happens.

550
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,837
Come on, Pete.
Y- you got him.

551
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,846
Nice going.
Let's take him in.

552
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,475
Michael, he put a knife
to Karen's throat.

553
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,611
You're going to let him
get away with that?

554
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,121
Hit the motherfucker!

555
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,121
Pete.

556
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,623
Hit him! Hit him!

557
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,717
No. I'm not doing this.

558
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,528
Hey!

559
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,026
Aah!

560
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,162
Motherfucker!

561
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,498
Aah!

562
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,367
Aah! Aah!

563
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,838
Hey, Pete!

564
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,535
Pete!
Jesus, that's enough!

565
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,490
Honey?

566
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,255
Michael?

567
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,955
Yeah. It's me.

568
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,497
How'd it go?

569
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,942
Boy, what a screwed-up night.

570
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,604
What happened?

571
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:52,615
Ah, it was just-
It was weird.

572
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:56,118
I went with the guys
on a few calls,

573
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,086
got to watch them be cops.

574
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,089
Then we dropped Roy off,

575
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,024
and Pete had
a little surprise for me.

576
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,527
The guy who broke in here.

577
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,858
He caught him?

578
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,432
He did more than that.

579
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,932
The guy's in jail.

580
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,865
Hospital's more likely.

581
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,371
He really beat the living shit
out of this guy,

582
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,873
which is what I
was supposed to do.

583
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:18,874
What?

584
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,877
Pete was showing off for me.

585
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,879
Had the whole thing set up

586
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,881
so I could nail the guy.

587
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,144
I'm just glad it's over.

588
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,651
Yeah.

589
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,490
Are you sure
you're O.K.?

590
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,082
Yeah.

591
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,563
What's the matter?

592
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,065
I just...

593
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,067
I think our cop friend

594
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,070
is a little too tightly
wound, that's all.

595
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:52,575
Well, do you think you might be
overreacting a little bit?

596
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,076
Not really.

597
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:58,080
You know, I feel like
a big weight's been lifted.

598
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,174
Yeah. Well, I'm glad
you feel better, honey,

599
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:04,119
but I don't want him
around here anymore.

600
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,019
Honey, you're upset.
I understand.

601
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,024
But shouldn't
we give him

602
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,491
the benefit
of the doubt?

603
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,859
You're acting like Pete's
the criminal.

604
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,522
Oh, am I?

605
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,533
I was there, Karen.
I saw it, O.K.?

606
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,535
I don't care
what you think.

607
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,037
You don't care
what I think.

608
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,539
Fine. I won't
bother thinking.

609
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:24,869
Knock it off.

610
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,375
No, you knock it off!.

611
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,877
I'm sorry, but I don't
share your sympathy

612
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,383
for the man who broke in
and put a knife to my throat!

613
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,373
Hi. Uh, sorry.

614
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,503
I didn't mean
to scare you.

615
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:36,602
That's O.K.

616
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,975
Can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

617
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,418
Just let me
get my robe, all right?

618
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:57,567
You know, you really should
put a lock on that gate.

619
00:33:57,668 --> 00:34:01,570
I don't think you came here
to discuss my gate.

620
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:02,502
No.

621
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,310
Did you hear
I arrested the burglar?

622
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,608
What happened?

623
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,114
What happened was,

624
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,615
the burglar
knocked me down

625
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,117
and took off running,

626
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,120
and when I caught him,
he resisted,

627
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,282
and it-it got ugly.

628
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,293
I don't think Michael
took it too well.

629
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,363
He didn't quite
put it that way.

630
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,865
It's not a TV show
out there, Mrs. Carr.

631
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,867
The reality gets to people

632
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,870
who've never seen it
up close like that.

633
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,132
You mean the violence.

634
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,200
Look...

635
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:43,045
When I first started out,

636
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,479
uh, I went
on a routine call.

637
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,550
All right?

638
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,552
It was a young kid.
He was high on drugs.

639
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,054
He was beating
on his girlfriend.

640
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,057
She couldn't have been
more than 15, 16.

641
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,559
Sweet girl-
blond hair, blue eyes,

642
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,563
so I didn't pay her
much attention.

643
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,998
I was reading the kid
his rights

644
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,502
when she took out a gun

645
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,734
and she shot me
right here in the chest.

646
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,242
So now I restrain
felons first

647
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,209
with whatever it takes-

648
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,908
Whatever it takes,
and that's how it was last night.

649
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,917
I don't need
another bullet in the chest,

650
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,350
and you don't need
a dead husband.

651
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,389
I'm very sorry
if Michael's upset.

652
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,891
I was just doing my job.

653
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,187
Pete. Pete, wait.

654
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,660
I- I'm...

655
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,228
I'm glad you got him.

656
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,537
That guy's
not going to forget

657
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,199
the night he made the mistake
of breaking in here.

658
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,536
That's for sure.

659
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,578
O.K. Enjoy your swim.

660
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,638
This is the chromalite,

661
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,141
and it serves
as the backdrop

662
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,643
for the dance floor area here.

663
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:24,647
With this chromalite,
we can create any environment.

664
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,148
We've got cityscape here,

665
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,310
but this could be a desert
or mountain. Anything.

666
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,919
Yeow!

667
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,928
I didn't know Michael had
so many good-looking friends.

668
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,429
Are you kidding?

669
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,432
We don't know
any of these people.

670
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,933
They're all
potential investors

671
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,527
or friends
of Michael's lawyer.

672
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,299
That's too bad.

673
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,206
Oh, now, there's one
I'd like to meet.

674
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,546
That's the guy I was
telling you about.

675
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,546
Your cop?

676
00:36:58,649 --> 00:36:59,547
Mmm.

677
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,548
Really?

678
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,159
Candace said
the music's too loud.

679
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,160
Who?

680
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:13,662
Candace. My wife.

681
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:17,165
Roger, I got a question
only you can answer.

682
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,998
I got an I RS auditor
and a lawyer-

683
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,503
Another lawyer joke.

684
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:25,007
Divorce lawyer-jump off
a building at the same time.

685
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,167
Who lands first?

686
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,676
- Who cares?
- Who cares?

687
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,507
Hi. How you doing, Mike?

688
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,512
Pete.

689
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,014
This place is great.

690
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,014
Thanks.

691
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,017
Pete Davis.
Los Angeles Police.

692
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,518
Hello, Pete.
Jerry Lurie.

693
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,519
Excuse me.

694
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,680
Jerry.

695
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,518
- My wife Candace.
- Hi, Pete.

696
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,592
Roger Graham.

697
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,523
Mike's been talking to me

698
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,528
about security
for the club.

699
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,030
Are you working
the area tonight?

700
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,533
No. I did the precheck
of the exterior.

701
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,834
I know it's normal to have
your entrance under the marquee,

702
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,340
but it's too open.
It's hard to control.

703
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,343
Be better to put
the entrance in the alley.

704
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,310
Make people line up
and file in.

705
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,815
If things get crazy
and we have to get heavy,

706
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,613
only a few people
will see it.

707
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,187
Something to think about.

708
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,190
Why don't you get
yourself a drink?

709
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,386
I'll be with you
in a minute.

710
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:21,397
Yeah. Good idea.
I know you have business to discuss.

711
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,228
I'll fill you in later.
Take care.

712
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,928
He makes a lot of sense.

713
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:26,935
Yeah.

714
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,437
You guys aren't bullshitting.

715
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,939
No. I take security
very seriously.

716
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,476
Yeah. We're really on top of it.

717
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,246
Hi, there.

718
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,247
Oh, Penny.
This is Pete.

719
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,247
Pete, Penny.

720
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,250
Hi, Penny.
Nice meeting you.

721
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,649
Hi. Nice meeting you.

722
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,152
We teach together.

723
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,187
Oh. Oh.

724
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,519
The kids at school
would be so impressed

725
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,354
I'm talking to
a real policeman.

726
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,518
They love cops.

727
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,324
They're young.
Give them time.

728
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:57,492
Maybe you'd like to come and
give them a talk sometime.

729
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,296
Um...

730
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,461
Yeah. Sure.

731
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,903
Public relations
loves stuff like that.

732
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,443
Well, speaking of public relations,
do you dance?

733
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,808
Honey, can you rescue Roger-
Help me out?

734
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:09,845
Hey, Penny.

735
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,211
Come on, Pete,
let's get that drink.

736
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,553
Here's to your club, Mike.

737
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:20,488
Pete, uh, I want to get
something straight here.

738
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,990
I'd like you to leave.

739
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,993
Michael,
what's with you tonight?

740
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,962
Why did you even
invite me here?

741
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,965
Oh, no. Telling you
and inviting you

742
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,967
are two completely
different things.

743
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,468
You seem so uptight.

744
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:37,007
Relax. Is it because
you were up late last night?

745
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,507
How do you know?

746
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,510
I was driving
by your house on patrol.

747
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,513
<i>I saw your lights on
till well after 3:00.</i>

748
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:48,517
You don't have to protect us
anymore. You caught him.

749
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,779
You think that's it?

750
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,787
You're not
a virgin anymore.

751
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,790
You saw how much
evil shit's out there.

752
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,953
What kind of friend wouldn't try
to protect you and Karen?

753
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,964
You listen to me
'cause I'm telling you-

754
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,158
You leave us alone.

755
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,667
You know, I think
I understand

756
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,670
where this is coming from.

757
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,171
Oh, do you?

758
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,639
Yeah. Just cut the shit, O.K.?

759
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,142
Nobody expects you to be me.

760
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,544
I make my living going up
against guys like Pike.

761
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,674
You don't. You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

762
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:23,185
Is that what you think
this is about?

763
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,549
Yeah, I do.

764
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:29,558
I bet you had one hell of a night
when you got home.

765
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,060
A friend would be
thanking me.

766
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:35,064
I'm not your friend.
I'm nothing to you.

767
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,565
You're a sick guy.

768
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,568
I don't want you
around me or my wife.

769
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,967
Michael, your guests-

770
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,470
I'll be right there.

771
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,009
Michael needs to get
some things off his chest.

772
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,907
- Michael, Roger-
- Honey, please.

773
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,411
Kicking me out, Michael?

774
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,572
Honey, please don't
keep them waiting.

775
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,842
If I have to.

776
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,351
Tell Roger I'll be there
in a second, O.K.?

777
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,751
<i>Everybody's free</i>

778
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,019
<i>Everybody's free</i>

779
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,024
<i>To feel good</i>

780
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,118
What are you going to do?

781
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,357
You going to call the cops?

782
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,525
Get the fuck out!

783
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:11,601
Lower your voice.

784
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,600
Fuck you!

785
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,330
- Lower your voice.
- Fuck you!

786
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,338
Your pigeon's watching.

787
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,578
Hope he doesn't
fly away on you.

788
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,636
Hey, need your car, man?

789
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,573
Ticket.

790
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,516
Don't you think
you were rough on Pete?

791
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,525
I told you I don't
want him around.

792
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,527
I wanted to make that clear.

793
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,028
Well, you succeeded.

794
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,462
Come on, guys,
it's time for our toast.

795
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,464
Come on.

796
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,040
Uh, good health,

797
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,541
good fortune,

798
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,544
and the time
to enjoy it.

799
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,580
That's an old
Castilian toast.

800
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:31,613
Translated.

801
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,114
Honey, looks like

802
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,708
you've just made
these two people very happy.

803
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,719
Candace, I know three people

804
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,686
your husband's
made happy tonight.

805
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,692
We'll all be happy when
everything falls into place, Roger.

806
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,194
What's not to fall into place?

807
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,061
That is a nice ride, dude.

808
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,566
I thought you were about to propose

809
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,570
another one of those wonderful
continental toasts.

810
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,072
To the two most
charming women here-

811
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,074
Your beautiful wife
and mine.

812
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,080
Ohh...

813
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:41,616
Ohh...

814
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,848
Mmm...

815
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,252
Mmm...

816
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,704
I'm glad you called.

817
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,713
I been thinking
about you a lot lately.

818
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,190
Leave it.

819
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,153
Sorry.

820
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,492
Still sensitive, huh?

821
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,570
You get shot
or something?

822
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:40,508
It was a fishing accident.

823
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,044
Yeah.

824
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,638
Who fishes with guns?

825
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,556
Are you all right?

826
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,095
'Cause we can go
to a motel

827
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,096
on a nice, cozy bed.

828
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,031
I mean, if you're having
a problem...

829
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,102
A problem?

830
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,811
The only problem
that I have...

831
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:26,521
is sleazy,
lowlife whores like you.

832
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,285
That's my problem.

833
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,624
What the hell's
wrong with you?

834
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,628
Get out.

835
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,221
I'm not getting out here!

836
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,697
Just get the fuck out!

837
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,667
Are you crazy?
I don't know where the fuck I am.

838
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,705
That's exactly
your fucking problem, isn't it?

839
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,205
Isn't it?

840
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,549
So, being a policeman

841
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,024
is really
all about helping people.

842
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,027
It's about
being a friend.

843
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,996
It's not about shooting
it out with bad guys.

844
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,498
That's what
you see on TV.

845
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,002
That's not why
I wanted to become a cop.

846
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,504
I became a cop
to protect people-

847
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,508
To make them
feel happy and safe.

848
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,009
Everybody understand that?

849
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,009
Yes.

850
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,012
Does anybody have
any questions?

851
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,012
What?

852
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,106
Do you wear
bulletproof vests?

853
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,345
Uh-huh. Have to
to protect myself.

854
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,352
Who else?

855
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,854
In the police car,

856
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,856
are you always
with somebody?

857
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,860
Mm-hmm. I have a partner
named Officer Roy Cole.

858
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:43,023
We've worked together
for the past 7, 8 years.

859
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,532
He's a very good friend.

860
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,602
O.K. You.

861
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,364
Can you show me how
to use your handcuffs?

862
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,871
Ha ha ha.

863
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,372
Sure. Come here.

864
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:52,874
What's your name?

865
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,874
Matthew.

866
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,706
Matthew?
All right, Matthew,

867
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,542
put your hands out.

868
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,550
Think I could get him
to use those on me?

869
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,983
There you go.

870
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,986
You're under arrest,
Matthew.

871
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,494
Hi. I couldn't take off
without saying thanks

872
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,996
for letting me
impress the kids.

873
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,498
That was really
a lot of fun.

874
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,501
Penny really set it up.

875
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,434
Yeah. I talked
to Penny before.

876
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,336
I'd like to apologize
for the other night.

877
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,339
Michael's behavior,

878
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:28,002
that kind of took me
by surprise.

879
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,272
I would've
never shown up.

880
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,780
Pete, it's not you.
It's him.

881
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,283
He's just not
been himself lately.

882
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,287
Would you like to go
get a cup of coffee?

883
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,290
I- I don't go on
for a while.

884
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,293
That's not a good idea.

885
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,863
You're safe with me.
I'm a cop.

886
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,865
Just for a little while?

887
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,434
Yeah. Just...

888
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:01,042
Is everybody in here a cop?

889
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,475
Yeah, pretty much.

890
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,480
About a year ago,
some jerk came in here

891
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,483
and tried to rip
this place off.

892
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,485
He didn't do too well.

893
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,488
When he come crashing
through the skylight,

894
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,490
I say, " How's your dick?"

895
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,992
I'm sorry. We should go
somewhere else.

896
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,494
No. This is great.

897
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:20,494
Really?

898
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:21,655
Yeah.

899
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,996
I think it's really nice
you got a place to go.

900
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,501
I'd like one.

901
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,503
Just-this is...

902
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,041
this is my least favorite
time of the day.

903
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,074
Why?

904
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,044
Uh... well, 'cause
it's getting dark out

905
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,875
and Michael's
not home yet.

906
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,979
How'd you and Michael
get together?

907
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,987
I was a waitress
at his first club.

908
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,253
Really? You were a waitress?

909
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,261
It was the first job
I ever had-

910
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,694
The first one I needed.

911
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,028
We were
kind of well-off.

912
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,534
My father,
as it turned out,

913
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,696
had sort of a gambling
problem, so...

914
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:05,468
You know, then people
started coming over

915
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:09,204
and taking our cars
in the middle of the night.

916
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:12,214
It-it was
kind of a scary time.

917
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,149
And Michael took you
away from all that?

918
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,618
Things always came
really easily to Michael.

919
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,121
Is that why
you married him?

920
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:26,927
I married him because
I fell in love with him.

921
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,497
Hmmph.

922
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,860
This is, uh...

923
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:41,009
I hardly know you,
and I'm talking like this.

924
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:45,013
Karen, all the things that come
so easily to Michael-

925
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,015
Were you one of them?

926
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:51,213
'Cause there's no man that deserves
that much good fortune.

927
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,016
I mean that.

928
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:57,025
A woman like you a man
should never take for granted,

929
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,893
and you should
never feel unsafe.

930
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,523
And I want you to know

931
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,033
that if you ever
need anything-

932
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,536
You're feeling bad
in any way

933
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,038
or you just need to talk-

934
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,041
That I'm there for you, O.K.?

935
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,044
As a friend...
as a real friend,

936
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,704
I'm there for you.

937
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,708
O.K.?

938
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:28,556
Come on. Let me
get you out of here.

939
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,034
How was your afternoon?

940
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,535
Hey. Good.

941
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,538
It was fine.

942
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,666
You and Mrs. Carr
getting along O.K.?

943
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,516
We seem to be.

944
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,292
When I was a kid
at Erasmus,

945
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:42,058
I didn't have a single teacher
that looked like Karen.

946
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:45,066
I mean,
they all had blue hair

947
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,568
with names like Mushbutt
or Silvercrone.

948
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,105
Silvercrone's my maiden name.

949
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,076
She had me.

950
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:56,577
Thank you.

951
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,079
The good news is

952
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,581
Frank Taft
was so taken with you,

953
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,017
he's considering kicking in
half the capital himself.

954
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,520
Frank Taft?
Booyoo Records?

955
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,021
Yeah.
We handle him.

956
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,025
There's a company
that's on a roll.

957
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,025
Major roll.

958
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,527
The kids love it.

959
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,187
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry.

960
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,026
Do you have
another card?

961
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,361
What's the problem?

962
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,365
It's canceled.

963
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,696
That's impossible.

964
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,897
Computer glitch.
Happens to me all the time.

965
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,405
This is unbelievable.

966
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,272
Relax.
You'll get the next one.

967
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,776
If you insist.

968
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,107
Don't worry about it.

969
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,114
All right. Now, we're on
for Tuesday night.

970
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,114
Bye.

971
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,616
Take care, Roger.

972
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,118
Michael, what's that?

973
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,053
Looks like you're having
a bad night, Michael.

974
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,561
Look, all I know

975
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,961
is what's on the
computer print-out,

976
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,761
and the computer says
you got parking tickets.

977
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,267
And the computer is wrong,

978
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,272
so I'm not paying 600 bucks
for tickets I didn't get.

979
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,739
I've worked here five years.

980
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,241
The computer's never wrong.

981
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,506
Do you want the boot off
your car or not?

982
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:07,014
Ha ha.
This is unbelievable.

983
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,176
Here.

984
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,346
Wait a minute.
Not that one.

985
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,515
Honey, you sure about this?

986
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,527
Remember the night we went
to the Minzers' house?

987
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:20,527
What?

988
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,030
They had the party
on Caon Avenue.

989
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,532
I got one ticket.

990
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:26,226
600 bucks?
Come on. Jesus.

991
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,032
Sorry, pal. You're over
the limit on this card.

992
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,548
It's a computer thing,
like Roger said.

993
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,117
Yeah. Right.

994
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,553
600 bucks.

995
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,555
Oh, Michael, drop it, O.K.?

996
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,683
Things went pretty well,
didn't they?

997
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:51,692
Yeah.

998
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:54,457
I thought
it went pretty good.

999
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,963
You know what?

1000
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,566
It went great.

1001
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,603
You really charmed
the pants off the Luries.

1002
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,696
Oh, please.

1003
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:06,799
Thanks.

1004
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,004
Stay here
and lock the door.

1005
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,804
Michael, what are you doing?

1006
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,928
Karen, it's all right.

1007
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:46,373
Hello.

1008
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,875
Yes.

1009
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,376
It's Michael Carr.

1010
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,447
Uh, code word is pyramid.

1011
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,849
Well, we just had our cat

1012
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,816
knock over a screen is all.

1013
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,944
Thank you. Bye.

1014
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:02,514
You know, I never thought
I'd be so happy to see him.

1015
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,332
Look, I thought it was
the right thing to do.

1016
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,868
Thanks for making that decision
for both of us

1017
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,369
without my having a say.

1018
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,873
Goddamn it, you know
how I feel about those things.

1019
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,374
You know how I feel

1020
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,274
watching a man
attack my wife

1021
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,779
and I can't do
anything about it?

1022
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,577
I'm not going to be
in that position again.

1023
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,084
I don't care
what the police say.

1024
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,585
I'm keeping that gun.

1025
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,857
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

1026
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,196
You all right?

1027
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:44,197
Yeah.

1028
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,460
Are you?

1029
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,238
Aah!

1030
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,510
Jesus Christ!

1031
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,341
Just a goddamn minute! Hey!

1032
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,347
What the fuck
are you doing?

1033
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:09,350
I was responding
to your alarm, Michael.

1034
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,147
Bullshit!
You tripped it yourself!.

1035
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,243
What?

1036
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,255
The credit cards,
the boot on my car-

1037
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,757
You did that, too,
didn't you?

1038
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,259
Everything all right
in here?

1039
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:19,589
False alarm.

1040
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,561
False alarm, my ass.

1041
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,564
I'm as embarrassed
as you are.

1042
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,829
Get the fuck
out of my house!

1043
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,836
I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Carr.

1044
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,549
Oh, man.
That son of a bitch is crazy.

1045
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,758
Hello.

1046
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,759
Yeah. Roger.

1047
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,886
Michael?

1048
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,965
I know it's late.
I'm sorry.

1049
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,762
Listen, how do I get
a psycho cop off my back?

1050
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,972
And you're
the same Michael Carr

1051
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,474
that I O.K.'d
to do a ride-along

1052
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:09,477
with Officer Davis
and Officer Cole?

1053
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,012
Yes, sir. That's right.

1054
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,481
The same Michael Carr whose wife
called to commend officer Davis?

1055
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:15,983
Yeah.
The same two people

1056
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,484
that are now
being terrorized

1057
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,953
by this out-of-control sicko.

1058
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,853
Out-of-control sicko.

1059
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,825
Sure there's nothing personal
in this, Mr. Carr?

1060
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,828
There's no question
that it's personal.

1061
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,331
What do you call it when an officer
busts into your bedroom

1062
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,334
while you're having sex
with your wife?

1063
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:34,334
Yes, well...

1064
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,303
Officer Cole's report says

1065
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,807
he and Officer Davis were
responding to an alarm.

1066
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,309
That was verified
by your security company.

1067
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,472
Sure. How about the boot,
my credit cards?

1068
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,981
What about them?

1069
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,483
Got any proof that this guy
did those things?

1070
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,487
You know, you're accusing
a highly decorated officer.

1071
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,989
I don't care
how many medals he has.

1072
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,991
I want this
taken care of.

1073
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,151
Or else?

1074
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,660
You're not
giving me anything.

1075
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,423
You didn't
bring any evidence.

1076
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,431
You don't have
any witnesses,

1077
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,966
not even a home video.

1078
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:08,128
These days, everybody's got
a goddamn home video.

1079
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,035
O.K. Fine. You're just going
to bury this thing.

1080
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,198
Mr. Carr,

1081
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,401
this is a professional
organization here,

1082
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,002
and we're going to do
a professional investigation, O.K.?

1083
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:21,311
Mac, bring me
the complaint forms, will you?

1084
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:26,320
If there's any truth to your
allegations, we'll take care of it.

1085
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,890
Thank you.
