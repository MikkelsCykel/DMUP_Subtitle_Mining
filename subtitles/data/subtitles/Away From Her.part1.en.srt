1
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:40,161
She said,

2
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,814
"Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

3
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,411
And what did you say?

4
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:46,427
I took her up on it.

5
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,250
I never wanted to be
away from her.

6
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,171
She had the spark of life.

7
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,628
Careful.

8
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,808
When did we last
wash that sweater?

9
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,235
Right after the war.

10
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:29,603
Christmas.

11
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:31,195
In the '50s sometime or the '60s.

12
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,348
Shut up.

13
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:04,091
I'll go make the fire.

14
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,249
"You climbed the bank and said,

15
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:44,317
"'This is how you touch
other women,

16
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:48,349
"the grass cutter's wife,
the lime burner's daughter.

17
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,827
"And you searched your arms

18
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:51,551
for the missing perfume
and knew..."

19
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,174
Don't worry, darling.

20
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:56,546
I expect I'm just losing my mind.

21
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,015
"What good is it to be
the lime burner's daughter,

22
00:04:02,085 --> 00:04:03,874
"left with no trace

23
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:06,559
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,

24
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:11,298
"as if wounded without
the pleasure of a scar.

25
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:13,852
"You touched your belly
to my hands in the dry air

26
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:18,660
"and said, 'I am
the cinnamon peeler's wife.

27
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,449
Smell me."'

28
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:25,822
When I look away,
I forget what yellow means.

29
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:28,282
But I can look again.

30
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:32,514
Sometimes there's something
delicious in oblivion.

31
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,720
I think you're supposed to be able

32
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:38,237
to put your fingers
inside the curled petal

33
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,830
and feel the heat.

34
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:42,723
Well?

35
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:47,741
I can't be sure.

36
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:50,431
I can't be sure if what I can feel

37
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:54,079
is the heat or my imagination.

38
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,822
The heat attracts the bugs.

39
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,948
Nature never fools around
just being decorative.

40
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:38,778
Yes?

41
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:40,893
I don't quite know
how to introduce myself.

42
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:44,577
I used to see your husband
at Meadowlake.

43
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,620
I'm a regular visitor there myself.

44
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:52,900
Those are lovely flowers.

45
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:58,238
I've never seen
those purple ones before.

46
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,179
The earth there must
really appeal to them.

47
00:07:08,293 --> 00:07:09,187
What?

48
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,458
You could just open the drawers.

49
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:12,638
Remind yourself.

50
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:13,887
What?

51
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,675
Maybe all the labels and lists
are defeating the purpose.

52
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,794
If you stopped thinking about things
the moment you write them down,

53
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:26,302
maybe that's the end
of your need to recall.

54
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,643
I heard a story at a dinner party

55
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,717
about the German soldiers
on border patrol

56
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,888
in Czechoslovakia during the war.

57
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,129
I heard it from that
Czech student of yours.

58
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:37,539
Veronica.

59
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:40,606
We spoke once at a dinner party.

60
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,882
Don't be nervous.

61
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,186
It's a good story.

62
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:49,726
She told me that each
of the German patrol dogs

63
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:53,475
<i>wore a sign saying "hund."</i>

64
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,199
"Why?" said the Czechs.

65
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,539
And the Germans replied,
"Because that is a hund."

66
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,958
It was one of those craft shows

67
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:23,877
where you look around and wonder
that the laws of supply and demand

68
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,843
can allow for the production
of so many macramé ducks.

69
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,544
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.

70
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:31,395
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.

71
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:33,218
You use it as a... what do you call it...

72
00:08:33,286 --> 00:08:34,596
a light fixture holder or som...

73
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:35,971
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...

74
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:37,532
Oh, yes. Wait a second, I do.

75
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:39,166
Fiona gave it to me.

76
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,507
Yes, I did.

77
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,069
Would anybody like some more?

78
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:57,948
Ween...

79
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:06,659
Wai... Wain...

80
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,701
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.

81
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,083
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.

82
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,491
Some more wain.

83
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,893
The thing is...

84
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,755
half the time I wander around

85
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,435
looking for something
which I know is very pertinent.

86
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:29,468
I can't remember what it is.

87
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:35,811
Once the idea is gone,
everything is gone.

88
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:39,169
I just wander around

89
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:43,580
trying to figure out what it was
that was so important earlier.

90
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:50,622
I think I may be
beginning to disappear.

91
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,380
And what year is it?

92
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:02,046
2003.

93
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:07,333
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street,
addressed, with a stamp on it,

94
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,285
what would you do with it?

95
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,527
I'd mail it.

96
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:12,454
And where would you put it to mail it?

97
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:27,010
And if there was a fire
in a movie theater,

98
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:30,590
and you were the first person
to spot that fire,

99
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:32,385
what would you do?

100
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:37,380
Well, we don't go
to the movies much anymore,

101
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:39,006
do we, Grant?

102
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:42,177
All those multiplexes showing
the same American garbage.

103
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:56,325
Have you seen my coat?

104
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,277
There it is, dear.

105
00:10:58,342 --> 00:10:59,488
It's on your chair.

106
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:02,660
Oh, yes.

107
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:05,922
Fiona, would you mind
if I asked you a few more questions?

108
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,478
Would you mind taking a seat?

109
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,988
I was just feeling
a little cold, that's all.

110
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,398
What an ugly baby.

111
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,085
When did we move into this cottage?

112
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:48,606
Was it last year
or the year before?

113
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,300
No. It was longer than that.

114
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,214
It was when I left the university,

115
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:03,326
20 years ago.

116
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,740
Well, that's shocking.

117
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:28,355
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?

118
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,252
How is your husband doing?

119
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,747
Okay.

120
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,189
He and my wife struck up
quite a close friendship.

121
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,067
I heard about that.

122
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,708
So, uh,

123
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:46,238
I'd like to speak to you
about something.

124
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,174
If you have a minute.

125
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,964
My husband did not try
to start anything with your wife,

126
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:54,372
if that's what you're getting at.

127
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,129
He did not try to molest her.

128
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:57,605
He's incapable of it.

129
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,044
And anyway, he wouldn't.

130
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,980
From what I hear, it was the other way around.

131
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,941
No, uh, that isn't it at all.

132
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:07,204
I didn't come here with any complaints.

133
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,409
Oh.

134
00:13:09,478 --> 00:13:11,366
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.

135
00:13:15,398 --> 00:13:16,609
Maybe you should come in.

136
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,573
It's not as warm a day as it looks.

137
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:28,929
"Never let a person make you feel guilty
for your anger with God."

138
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:32,800
Hmm. Random.

139
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:38,596
I can't even see what the point is.

140
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:41,729
We can't be certain this is what...

141
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,076
You're far too young.

142
00:13:43,143 --> 00:13:44,801
"Should the patient
afflicted with the disease

143
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,489
"remain at home...

144
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,820
the caregiver will very often be the spouse."

145
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:55,003
"The caregiver must preside
over the degeneration

146
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,534
"of someone he or she
loves very much,

147
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,232
"must do this for years and years

148
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,888
"with the news always
getting worse, not better,

149
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,682
"must put up sometimes
with deranged

150
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,620
"but at the same time
very personal insults,

151
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,029
"and must somehow learn
to smile through it all.

152
00:14:09,094 --> 00:14:10,588
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose

153
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,702
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments

154
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:14,662
"under extraordinary circumstances.

155
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:16,865
"Imagine the person
you love the most

156
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,461
"suddenly upset about something,

157
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,673
"but completely unable
to communicate the problem

158
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:23,710
or even to understand it himself."

159
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,229
Sounds like a regular marriage.

160
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,660
Hello, there!

161
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:06,178
Oh!

162
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,069
Hello, there.

163
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,774
We are at that stage, Grant.

164
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:01,696
We are at that stage.

165
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,673
Well...

166
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:18,116
if we do think of it...

167
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,085
if we do...

168
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,895
then it must be as something
that isn't permanent.

169
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:32,485
A kind of experimental treatment or...

170
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:37,411
a rest cure of sorts.

171
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:50,626
All right.

172
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:51,710
All right.

173
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:54,368
We can think of it that way.

174
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,123
We have to sit in the kitchen,
where I can hear Aubrey.

175
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,589
Well, you might as well
have a cup of coffee.

176
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:12,486
Thank you.

177
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:18,181
My son put him on the Sports Channel
a year ago Christmas.

178
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:20,157
I don't know what we'd do without it.

179
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,173
Must be a struggle.

180
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,285
Well, you know.

181
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:28,101
You know what
struggle is by now.

182
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,902
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

183
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:38,341
You don't want to just get
a sense of the place?

184
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,644
I don't want to make
this decision alone.

185
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,568
What place?

186
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,072
Just kidding!

187
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:53,599
Fuck off.

188
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:05,446
You're not making
this decision alone, Grant.

189
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,813
I've already made up my mind.

190
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:13,886
Okay.

191
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,294
It's time to go home now.

192
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,952
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...

193
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,746
- Hi. Is this your son?
- Yeah. I'm her son.

194
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:50,718
Hi. I'm Betty. It's time for your bath.

195
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,864
- Bath.
- Yeah.

196
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,463
You have to have a bath now.

197
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,161
Mama.

198
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:58,882
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.

199
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:00,807
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.

200
00:21:00,872 --> 00:21:03,655
I'm just going to take you
on the quick tour of the facility,

201
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,174
and then we can sit down
and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition

202
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:08,898
and the appropriate time
for admitting her.

203
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:14,114
As you can see,
we get a lot of natural light.

204
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:16,517
Yes, I can see that.

205
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:18,242
This is my favorite room.

206
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,838
Look, over there, as you can see,

207
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,668
they have a puzzle on the go.

208
00:21:21,736 --> 00:21:23,045
They always have
a puzzle on the go.

209
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:25,380
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here

210
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:27,815
that our residents
maintain social function,

211
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,116
so a lot of our activities
and our whole layout

212
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:31,198
is really geared toward...

213
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:32,799
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.

214
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,781
Hello, Michael.

215
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,711
Now, as you can see,
we're coming into our common room,

216
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:39,493
and again, we're really emphasizing
everybody being social.

217
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,869
So you can bring the family.

218
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:42,213
Everybody can come and visit.

219
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,549
We have a state-of-the-art
entertainment system

220
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:47,005
so the residents can gather
and watch together.

221
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,672
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.

222
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:50,718
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.

223
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,614
Aren't you festive!

224
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,935
And this is our quiet corner
for crafts and reading and reflection.

225
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,513
We have a lot of activities
for physical activity.

226
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:03,552
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.

227
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,723
And here we have our
lovely new dining room.

228
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:10,338
We can accommodate
any dietary preferences or restrictions.

229
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:14,084
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner
early for the families.

230
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,007
The old Meadowlake is just next door,

231
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:18,973
and that's a day center
now, but, um...

232
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,869
this for the permanent residents.

233
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,245
This is brand-spanking new.

234
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:24,254
So let's go upstairs, shall we?

235
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:29,154
Just taking my tea for a ride.

236
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,968
Oh, look at this one, Flo.

237
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:35,269
He's a real charmer, isn't he?

238
00:22:35,336 --> 00:22:37,987
Would you say,
are you a charmer?

239
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,998
I think you could say
I was kind of a charmer.

240
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,275
You're a rascal.

241
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,581
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.

242
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:46,853
I should have known it.

243
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,309
At this age, it's...

244
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:53,053
What do the kids call it, Flo? It's...

245
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:55,135
It's a real clusterfuck.

246
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,216
All the charmers are taken.

247
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:59,557
Or dead. Mostly dead.

248
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:01,664
You're kind of charming
yourself, sweetheart.

249
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,096
Shall we?

250
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:14,943
This is our second floor,
the extended care wing.

251
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:16,161
The elevators, of course,

252
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:17,280
have the lockdown system,

253
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,359
and this is where
the patients can move to

254
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,341
once they become more progressed.

255
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,067
Interesting choice of words.

256
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,103
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here,
while we're at it?

257
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:29,216
Then we can go back down
and see the regular rooms

258
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:30,564
where Mrs. Andersson will be living.

259
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,837
No, that will not be necessary.

260
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:35,009
My wife will not be
progressing to this floor.

261
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,317
All right.

262
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:40,133
Who chooses the music?

263
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,607
I'm sorry?

264
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:42,981
I'm assuming it's not the residents.

265
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:46,179
I don't see any of them
singing along.

266
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:49,696
Yeah, well. You know the rooms on the regular
floors all have their own stereo systems

267
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,841
so the patients can listen
to whatever they like.

268
00:23:51,912 --> 00:23:52,926
How kind.

269
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:58,085
Now, we don't admit anyone
during the month of December,

270
00:23:58,152 --> 00:24:00,061
so Mrs. Andersson will
have to wait till January

271
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:01,959
to make the big move.

272
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:06,333
Just December, Christmas, you know, too
many emotional pitfalls.

273
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,001
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.

274
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,731
I'm looking for those documents
on Aubrey Burke.

275
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,294
Sure. Go ahead.

276
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,335
Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy,
our new managing nurse.

277
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:16,579
Against some people's
better judgment.

278
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:18,591
Now, now.

279
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:20,672
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife,
Mrs. Andersson,

280
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:22,119
who will be joining us in January.

281
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,231
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

282
00:24:23,304 --> 00:24:24,319
We also have a policy,

283
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:25,822
which I'm sure you saw
in the brochure,

284
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:27,685
that our new residents
are not allowed visitors

285
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:29,694
or receiving phone calls
during the first 30 days,

286
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,557
just to give them a chance to settle in.

287
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:32,802
What sort of visitors?

288
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,361
Everyone. Even close relatives.

289
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,862
I couldn't just leave her here.

290
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:43,108
We understand,
it is very difficult

291
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,795
to leave a loved one
in a new environment for so long,

292
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:49,061
but most people need
that time to settle in.

293
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:50,819
Before we had this rule in place,

294
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:52,481
residents would forget
again and again

295
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:53,959
why they were being left here.

296
00:24:54,024 --> 00:24:55,104
Whereas we find,

297
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,729
you give them the month
to settle in,

298
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,807
and they're happy as clams.

299
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,183
And after that, a little visit home
every now and then, perfectly fine.

300
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:07,231
We'll take good care
of her, I promise.

301
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,827
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no! Not again.

302
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:16,896
Knock-knock. Boo.

303
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,623
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?

304
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:29,631
She's got a new baby,
four months old.

305
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,799
Smells good.

306
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,432
I was going to go for a ski,
but I thought I shouldn't chance it,

307
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:20,774
what with the Alzheimer's and all.

308
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:21,987
Why didn't you wake me?

309
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,912
What are these, Grant?

310
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,427
Those are the documents
you're supposed to sign

311
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:38,247
if you decide to go to Meadowlake.

312
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:40,222
That is exactly
what I have decided.

313
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:43,014
You were to go and sign these
and leave them there.

314
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:46,595
I wouldn't be allowed
to visit you for 30 days.

315
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:58,851
30 days isn't such a long time
after 44 years.

316
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:00,644
I don't think I like the place.

317
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:10,274
I don't think we should be looking
for something we like, Grant.

318
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:13,312
I don't think we'll ever find that.

319
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:17,218
I think all we can aspire
to in this situation

320
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,745
is a little bit of grace.

321
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:05,023
I suppose I'll be
dressed up all the time.

322
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:11,269
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.

323
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,773
How do I look?

324
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:17,954
Just like always.

325
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,651
Just as you've always looked.

326
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,576
And how does that look?

327
00:30:23,978 --> 00:30:25,887
Direct and vague...

328
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:29,477
sweet and ironic.

329
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:36,869
Is that how I look?

330
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:51,556
Oh. Remember?

331
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,005
Surprised, Grant?

332
00:30:56,073 --> 00:30:57,480
No, I'm not surprised.

333
00:30:57,545 --> 00:31:00,861
I'm just grateful
you can remember that.

334
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:03,807
I'm not all gone, Grant. Just...

335
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:06,118
going...

336
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:11,327
There are things
I wish would go away.

337
00:31:13,257 --> 00:31:18,210
But won't. You know.
Things we don't talk about.

338
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:25,858
You never left me.

339
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,239
You still made love to me,

340
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:29,956
despite disturbing demands elsewhere.

341
00:31:33,866 --> 00:31:38,917
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.

342
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:44,805
What could you do but be a part of the time
you were a part of?

343
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:47,176
All those pretty girls.

344
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,761
Didn't seem like anyone
was willing to be left out.

345
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,255
I think you did all right,

346
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:57,664
compared to some
of your colleagues.

347
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,072
Those who left their wives.

348
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:04,835
And the women who
wouldn't put up with it.

349
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:12,744
I think people are too demanding.

350
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,039
People want to be in love
every single day.

351
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:20,546
What a liability. And then that silly girl.

352
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:22,373
That silly girl Veronica.

353
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:26,147
Girls that age
are always going around

354
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:29,478
saying they're going
to kill themselves.

355
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:31,040
But that was that.

356
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,505
Promised me a new life.

357
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,674
We moved out here,

358
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,007
that is exactly what you gave me.

359
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:44,038
How long ago was that?

360
00:32:44,105 --> 00:32:47,008
20 years.

361
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:52,774
God, that's shocking.

362
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:59,071
So you see, I'm going...

363
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:01,633
but I'm not gone.

364
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:31,462
- Fiona.
- Grant.

365
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:35,423
Don't go.

366
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,776
That's what is happening, Grant.

367
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,816
It's happening... right now.

368
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:12,832
Fiona.

369
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,680
Hello. I'm checking in today.

370
00:34:16,746 --> 00:34:18,469
My name is Fiona Andersson.

371
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:19,683
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.

372
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,542
We have your room
all ready for you.

373
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,105
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,

374
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:24,258
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.

375
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,631
I'll go fetch her. She's expecting you.

376
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:27,778
Thank you.

377
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:29,920
Fiona.

378
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,392
Grant.

379
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:34,018
I can't go away from you like this.

380
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:38,793
We had nothing
to tie us down, Grant.

381
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:41,541
You could have just driven away
and forsaken me.

382
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,912
But you didn't.

383
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,075
I thank you for that.

384
00:34:51,914 --> 00:34:53,769
- Mrs. Andersson.
- Oh, hello.

385
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:55,809
- How do you do? I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.

386
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:57,408
Should I give you two a moment?

387
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,337
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.

388
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:01,126
All right, then, well,
we'll get you settled in your room,

389
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:03,103
and then I'd like to give you
a tour of the facility.

390
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,633
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.
- Right this way.

391
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:15,070
So, as you can see,
we get a lot of natural light.

392
00:35:16,522 --> 00:35:18,824
Here we go.

393
00:35:25,962 --> 00:35:29,126
Yes. This'll do just fine.

394
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,496
Good. I'm so glad
you like it. Now, is...

395
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,154
is this all you brought
with you today?

396
00:35:33,226 --> 00:35:34,981
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.

397
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,744
Well, if you need any help arranging things,
you just let me know.

398
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:43,941
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.

399
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:47,327
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say
good-bye to my husband.

400
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:51,712
We haven't been apart for a month
for the last 44 years.

401
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:52,964
It could be quite something.

402
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:54,560
Okay.

403
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:02,915
Please, Fiona.

404
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,513
Grant.

405
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:11,106
Fiona...

406
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:13,218
You know what I'd like?

407
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:18,372
I'd like to make love,

408
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:21,541
and then I'd like you to go.

409
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:22,920
Because I need to stay here,

410
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:24,775
and if you make it hard for me,

411
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:27,231
I might cry so hard
I'll never stop.

412
00:36:59,114 --> 00:37:00,576
Go now.

413
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:04,772
Go now.

414
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:49,505
"All of the officers

415
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,953
"were from outside
the local area,

416
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,928
"and it probably had not
entered their minds

417
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:55,556
"that almost all of us
were named McDonald.

418
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,830
"Nobody moved except for
the shuffling of feet.

419
00:37:57,898 --> 00:38:00,167
The red roo"...Hey.

420
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,406
- Hello, there.
- Kristy. We met on your tour.

421
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:03,936
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?

422
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:06,050
I'm wondering if I could have

423
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:08,097
a moment of your time
to ask your advice?

424
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:10,342
Oh, sure. I was just
reading to Mr. Burke here.

425
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,621
Maybe when we finish this chapter,

426
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,545
I can come find you
in the dining room?

427
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,650
Sure. That's fine.

428
00:38:17,578 --> 00:38:20,611
"The red roof lights
revolved in the afternoon sun,

429
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,537
and even the dogs were
temporarily quiet."

430
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:40,639
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?

431
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:42,570
Going down the center
of the dining room...

432
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:45,537
That's Frank. He used to be the play-by-play
guy for the Winnipeg Jets.

433
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:47,585
- Really?
- Yeah.

434
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,441
He loved his job too much to retire.

435
00:38:50,507 --> 00:38:52,416
Frank's on the second floor.

436
00:38:56,203 --> 00:39:03,687
I just... My wife has always been
sort of a different sort of person.

437
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:08,294
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be
confirmed until after...

438
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:10,599
And on our way here today,

439
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,325
we passed this conservation area

440
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:15,461
where we went
for a walk last spring.

441
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:17,670
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.

442
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:19,528
Oh, those are
beautiful, aren't they?

443
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:22,311
Yes, they really made
an impression, see?

444
00:39:22,378 --> 00:39:24,615
And even though the whole
place was covered in snow,

445
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:27,235
she said, "Oh, remember?"

446
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:31,745
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.

447
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:35,048
And isn't the short-term memory
the thing that goes first?

448
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:39,424
Well, yeah, but not all at once.

449
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:40,873
And what's comforting

450
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,939
is the long-term memory sometimes
stays for quite a long time.

451
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:48,968
Yeah, her long-term memory
seems quite intact.

452
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:52,450
But when she mentioned that,
about the skunk lilies,

453
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,206
it was all I could do not
to turn the truck around.

454
00:39:55,275 --> 00:40:01,570
What if this is just her
just being herself?

455
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:03,814
She's far too young to...

456
00:40:05,354 --> 00:40:07,078
She is young.

457
00:40:07,146 --> 00:40:09,864
And it is hard.

458
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:12,352
No doubt about that.

459
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:14,466
A month is a real long time.

460
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:20,166
I mean, between you and me,
I don't know about the policy myself.

461
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:23,169
I think it makes it easier for the staff
is what I think.

462
00:40:23,242 --> 00:40:27,203
Look. I'll give you my pager number.

463
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:30,112
You can call me
whenever you want.

464
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:32,608
You can call me every day
if you feel like it.

465
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:38,215
I don't know what to do.

466
00:40:39,947 --> 00:40:42,697
Mr. Andersson,
your wife wrote you this note,

467
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:44,836
and she asked me to pass it along.

468
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,651
Okay.

469
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,718
Thank you so much.

470
00:41:27,307 --> 00:41:30,373
"Throughout much of the thinking brain,

471
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:35,364
gooey plaques now crowd neurons
from outside the cell membranes."

472
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,625
"And knotty tangles

473
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:44,512

474
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:57,031
"All told, tens of millions
of synapses dissolve away."

475
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,833

476
00:42:01,899 --> 00:42:03,907

479
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:22,308
"It is like a series
of circuit breakers

480

481
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,223
That's a great-Iooking coffee maker.

482
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,463
I always meant to get one of those.

483
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:32,489
I saw they had them on sale
at Canadian Tire.

484
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:35,687
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.

485
00:43:35,755 --> 00:43:37,795
They live in Kamloops, B.C.

486
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:41,128
They send us more stuff
than we can handle.

487
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:44,971
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money
to come see us instead.

488
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:49,161
I suppose they're busy
with their own lives.

489
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,562
Not so busy they couldn't
go to Hawaii last year.

490
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:52,937
I mean, you could understand it

491
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:55,786
if there was someone
in the family closer at hand,

492
00:43:55,852 --> 00:43:59,300
but, uh... he's the only one.

493
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:06,531
People do get Ionely,

494
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:10,019
especially when they're deprived
of seeing someone they care about.

495
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:16,293
Fiona, for instance.

496
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:20,743
My wife.

497
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:23,233
I thought you said
you went and visited her.

498
00:44:25,771 --> 00:44:27,910
I do.

499
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,500
No, that's not it.

500
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:32,644
She's really settling in well.

501
00:44:32,716 --> 00:44:34,058
Good. Good.

502
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:35,912
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow,
Mr. Andersson.

503
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:38,216
Right. So I'll see you
tomorrow morning, then.

504
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:41,317
Now, remember,
she may be a little surprised to see you.

505
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:44,742
Don't be shaken by that.

506
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:46,984
Just... She hasn't seen you in a while.

507
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:49,026
She's sort of settled in here.

508
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,393
I understand.

509
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:08,609
There you are. I'll walk you down to her.

510
00:45:08,683 --> 00:45:10,985
Wow. Narcissus this early.

511
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:13,091
You must have spent a fortune.

512
00:45:13,163 --> 00:45:15,684
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.

513
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,697
It's great to see you.

514
00:45:17,772 --> 00:45:20,324
I'm gonna help you find
your sweater, Mrs. Albright.

515
00:45:20,395 --> 00:45:23,876
All right. Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.

516
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:26,216
You remember from last time
you were here, don't you?

517
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:29,317
Her nameplate's right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.

518
00:46:08,844 --> 00:46:11,975
There she is. Now you just
go over and say hello,

519
00:46:12,044 --> 00:46:15,753
and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...

520
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:17,762
Well, just go ahead.

521
00:46:36,076 --> 00:46:39,305
Bridge. Deadly serious.

522
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:42,600
Quite rabid about it.

523
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,865
I can remember being like that
at college for a while.

524
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:50,666
My friends and I would cut class
and sit in the common room and smoke

525
00:46:50,732 --> 00:46:52,935
and play like cutthroats.

526
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:54,564
One's name was Phoebe.

527
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:56,098
I don't remember the others.

528
00:46:56,173 --> 00:46:57,666
Phoebe Hart.

529
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,391
Oh, you knew her, too.

530
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,177
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?

531
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:05,862
I'm afraid the coffee's
not up to much here.

532
00:47:05,933 --> 00:47:07,110
I don't drink tea.

533
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,002
Oh.

534
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:10,693
I brought you some flowers.

535
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:13,579
I thought they might do
to brighten up your room.

536
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:15,913
I went to your room,
but you weren't there.

537
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,314
Well, no, I'm here.

538
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:22,378
So you've made a new friend.

539
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:26,150
Oh, that's just Aubrey.

540
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:31,173
The funny thing is I knew
him years and years ago.

541
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,805
He used to work in the store,

542
00:47:32,876 --> 00:47:36,422
the hardware store where
my grandpa used to shop.

543
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:39,209
He and I were always kidding around,

544
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:42,593
but he never could get up
the nerve to ask me out.

545
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:45,702
Until the very last weekend,
he took me to a ball game.

546
00:47:45,772 --> 00:47:50,594
But my grandpa showed up
to drive us home.

547
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:53,865
I was up visiting for the summer.

548
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:56,868
Visiting my grandparents.

549
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,012
They lived in a cottage on a lake.

550
00:48:00,716 --> 00:48:03,465
Fiona, I know where
your grandparents lived.

551
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:05,223
It's where we lived. We live.

552
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:07,814
Really?

553
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:11,106
I'd better go back.

554
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,668
He thinks he can't play
without me sitting there.

555
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:16,555
It's silly. I hardly
know the game anymore.

556
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,594
I'm afraid you'll have
to excuse me.

557
00:48:18,668 --> 00:48:19,748
Will you be through soon?

558
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,729
We should be. I mean, it depends.

559
00:48:21,804 --> 00:48:24,422
If you asked that grim-Iooking
lady over there nicely,

560
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:26,794
she'll get you a cup of tea.

561
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:29,797
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?

562
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:33,097
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.

563
00:48:33,164 --> 00:48:35,717
But you'll be surprised
how soon you get used to it.

564
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,276
You'll get to know who everybody is,

565
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:42,374
except that some of them
are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?

566
00:48:42,444 --> 00:48:47,398
Can't expect them all
to get to know who you are.

567
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:06,115
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?

568
00:50:06,189 --> 00:50:09,058
Do you think I'd look
good with red hair?

569
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,922
You caught her at sort of a bad moment,
involved in a game.

570
00:50:30,988 --> 00:50:33,192
She isn't even playing.

571
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,431
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.

572
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,483
Now, who is Aubrey?

573
00:50:36,557 --> 00:50:38,596
That's who he is, Aubrey.

574
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,098
You know, they get
these attachments.

575
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:41,961
That kind of takes over for a while.

576
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:43,916
Best buddy kind of thing.

577
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,289
Sort of a phase.

578
00:50:46,317 --> 00:50:48,106
Does she even know who I am?

579
00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:51,563
No, she might not.

580
00:50:51,629 --> 00:50:54,945
Not today, and then,
tomorrow you never know.

581
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,890
Things change back and forth all the time.

582
00:50:57,965 --> 00:51:00,779
You'll see the way it is
once you get used to coming here.

583
00:51:00,844 --> 00:51:02,503
You'll learn not to take it so personal.

584
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:05,355
Learn to take it day by day.

585
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,192
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:31,498
I'll have to go and fix that now.

587
00:52:00,141 --> 00:52:02,562
Here's Yung Menenikenaha,

588
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:06,149
desperately clinging
to his one-stroke lead.

589
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,747
Here's the swing.

590
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:09,480
It doesn't look good.

591
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:12,069
Looks like he's pushed it
out to the right.

592
00:52:12,141 --> 00:52:13,963
It lands 25 feet from the green.

593
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:15,622
This must be disappointing.

594
00:52:15,693 --> 00:52:18,114
It doesn't look good
for Yung Menenikenaha.

595
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:20,098
He was three strokes
on the happy side of par

596
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:21,220
until these last three holes.

597
00:52:25,997 --> 00:52:29,706
Look at you, Mr. Andersson.

598
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:32,293
I think you might be
one of our most frequent visitors.

599
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:42,251
Hi, Fiona.

600
00:52:42,317 --> 00:52:44,292
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?

601
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:46,187
I brought you some books.

602
00:52:46,253 --> 00:52:48,641
They don't seem to have
an awful lot around here.

603
00:52:48,717 --> 00:52:50,888
<i>Letters from Iceland by Auden.</i>

604
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:54,121
We always meant to read that together,
didn't we?

605
00:52:54,189 --> 00:52:56,426
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?

606
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:57,737
Well, I don't know.

607
00:52:57,805 --> 00:53:00,423
Um, Aubrey's card game
starts in a few minutes,

608
00:53:00,493 --> 00:53:02,249
and then we usually go walking,

609
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:03,746
and then he does his drawing...
