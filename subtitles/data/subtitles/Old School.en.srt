Listen, I'm going to take off, okay?
I'm gonna try and catch the 2:00 back.

You're leaving the seminar now?
It's not even intermission.

00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,235
- I don't think you can do that.
- No, it's fine. Just cover for me, okay?

8
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,575
- Get it all.
- I guess.

00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,377
- Listen, could we have your badge?
- Yeah.

Hello.

12
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,832
I'm going to the airport.
I'm kind of in a hurry, too.

00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,272
Sir, your seat belt
seems to be broken.

00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,139
What do you recommend I do?

15
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,703
I recommend you stop being such a faggot.

16
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,240
You're in the back seat.

What are you doing home?
You totally scared me!

33
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,752
I scared you?
Because for a second, I thought...

34
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,423
I don't even want to say it.

That's, like, pretty hard-core.

38
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,638
Yeah, I know.

39
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,145
No, I'm not judging.
Don't be embarrassed.

40
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,307
This is a major turn-on.
Let's go with this.

- Is this what you do when I'm gone?
- Mitch, wait.

42
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,754
No, I mean, I do it myself every once
in a while, but to magazines.

43
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,722
Okay, Mitch, we need to talk.

Be honest.

Please tell me this is the first time
this has happened.

49
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,596
Well, do you want me to be honest, or you
want me to tell you this is the first time?

50
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,610
- Jesus, what is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me!

51
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,646
I've tried to tell you about this.

52
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,647
What? When?

53
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,949
- All the time!
- Like when?

54
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,116
- Like, when we're in bed and stuff.
- In bed?

55
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,724
I thought you were just talking dirty.

56
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,990
I was, but I was being serious.

57
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,228
You've said some really sick stuff.

exciting lives in the world.

This is a totally different kind
of satisfaction for me.

61
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,471
It's purely sexual.

Let a little blood up in your face there,
will ya?

- I don't want to breathe.
- You should be proud of yourself.

Do you have any idea how hard it is to land
a girl as sexually enlightened as Heidi is?

74
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,183
A girl like that comes around, what,
once every hundred years?

75
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,519
I wasn't looking for a girl like that.

but that seemed to work out for everybody.

You know what I mean?

Hey, I just want to thank you
one last time for being here.

It's the best day ever.

Don't even start with me, Franklin, okay?
You need to walk away from this ASAP.

- You need to get out, Frankie.

to get out of here while you're still single.

84
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:03,912
- I'm not single.
- She's 30 yards away, you're single now.

Come on, Marissa's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

Why don't you give that six months.
You don't think that'll change?

Do I seem like a happy guy to you,
Frankie?

Let it go.

Let me be the first to say
congratulations to you then.

- What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

131
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:29,232
The last time that I had heard,
you had moved to...

- What do you call it?
- Denver.

133

No, I'm...

Yeah, Marissa told me about your
girlfriend. I'm very sorry.

142
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,295
The thing about that one is,
is it's not just that.

143
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,667
It's a combination of things.

I think you should have some of this.

- No, Mitch!
- What are you doing to this poor girl?

Mitch, stop it!
I got it.

154
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,130
No. Inappropriate.
Stop it right now.

- Thank you.

Why don't you go get some air, okay?
Walk it off.

158
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,643
No, wait a second.

00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,181
Yeah?

- Put in a good word for me.
- Yeah, okay.

161
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:58,115
[yodeling]
# Lay, oh-de-lay, oh-de-lay hee hoo!

162
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,787
# Sparkling, clear and lovely

163
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,688
# You're my

164
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,756
# Lady

165
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:11,765
Hey, Marissa!

166
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,702
You're the lady.

167
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,465
[applause, clinking glasses]

168
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,713
Can't hear you!

169
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:30,877
Excuse me.

170
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,983
I'd like to say I'm really glad
and proud to be here tonight.

171
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,488
I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.
I haven't seen him in eight years.

172
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,397
That's great.
Congratulations.

173
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:44,492
I love you, Dad!

174
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,232
True love is hard to find.

175
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,399
Sometimes you think you have true love,

176
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:52,841
and then you catch the early flight
home from San Diego,

177
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:56,142
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

178
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,311
Iike a goddamn magic show,
ready to double-team your girlfriend...

179
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:04,151
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

180
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,590
because I think what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

181
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,860
Let's raise our glasses,
whatever we got in front of us.

182
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,921
Salute. Health and happiness.

183
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,864
Cheers, everybody.

184
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,403
I love you so much, Frankie.
I love you.

185
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,336
I'm not a talker.

186
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,704
I love you.
Congratulations.

187
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,124
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

188
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,396
- This is great.
- How did you land this place?

189
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,370
I don't know, it was pretty easy, actually.

190
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,067
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

191
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,506
That's awesome!

192
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,971
That's awesome.

193
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,311
A little housewarming.

194
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,317
To new beginnings.

195
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,845
Thanks.

196
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,325
Actually, I gave this to you
for your wedding.

197
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,658
This model?

198
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,061
No, this exact one.

199
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,865
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,868
I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,164
It's okay.

202
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,967
I hope you like it.

203
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,041
I love it.
Thank you.

204
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,100
This place is unbelievable.

205
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,237
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

206
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,715
This is the probably the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

207
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,376
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

208
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,319
Do not get selfish on me here, okay?
Now stay with me.

209
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,322
You put a bar in over there, right?

210
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,588
Couple La-Z-Boys to fill it out, a smarter
couch. You could put a hot tub anywhere.

211
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,390
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

212
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,462
We're gonna get so much ass here,
it's gonna be sick.

213
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,593
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

214
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,967
That sounds like a lot of fun, but

215
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,030
I need a little time to get
my life back together.

216
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,975
We need to throw a big
kick-ass party to start things off.

217
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,309
Absolutely.
Break it in a little, meet the neighbors.

218
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,315
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

219
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,645
Break it in.

220
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,176
The real estate guy was really
adamant about not having...

221
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,155
I don't think you realize what
a huge opportunity this is for you.

222
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,920
Girls love a guy who's in your
particular situation.

223
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,153
What situation?

224
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,287
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

225
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,730
You're like an injured fawn
nursed back to health,

226
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,632
who's finally gonna be rereleased
into the wilderness.

227
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,260
[glass breaking]
Sorry.

228
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,929
[baby crying]
Please be careful.

229
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,667
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Don't say sorry to me, say it to the baby.

230
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,334
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

231
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,310
It's okay. It happens.

232
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,677
We should go tropical with this thing.

233
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:45,013
Like sand from wall to wall. I know a great
sand guy, we'll get it at price.

234
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,142
Sand in here?

235
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,813
Or foam, whatever.
Something in here.

236
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,516
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

237
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,185
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

238
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,787
I'm messing with you guys!
It's a joke!

239
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,264
[baby cries]

240
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,233
It's not funny.
And now the baby is upset.

241
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,326
[loud music]

242
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,964
[engine revs]

00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:12,437
[music continues]

244
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,742
[shouts:] Hey!

245
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,076
Hey!

246
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,479
Hey, honey!

247
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,581
I brought you an iced tea!

248
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,885
No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.

249
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,152
Can you turn that off for a second?

250
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,886
[music stops]
[engine sputters]

251
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,126
Wow. That's really loud.

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,531
Yeah. Thanks.

253
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,729
I took the restrictor plate off,
give the Red Dragon a little more juice.

254
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:43,037
But let's keep that on the down low.
She's not exactly street legal.

255
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,269
Hey, Mike!

256
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,469
Right.

257
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,605
- So, what's up?
- Nothing much.

258
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,514
I was hoping we might get to those
thank you notes tomorrow night.

259
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,109
Honey, I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.

260
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,519
Oh, that's right.
I totally forgot.

261
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,352
But I can skip it.

262
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,449
Oh! No.

263
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,023
Don't be silly.

264
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,963
I mean, I wouldn't want you changing
your whole life just for me.

265
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,700
I'll give Lara a call
and we'll plan a girls' night.

266
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,068
- lt'll be fun.
- Thanks.

267
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,868
You're the best.

268
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,768
Just as long as you promise to take it easy,
you know.

269
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,109
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

270
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,215
You've come a long way since Frank the
Tank, and we don't want him coming back.

271
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,879
Honey, Frank the Tank
is not coming back, okay?

272
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:32,083
That part of me is over.
It's water under the bridge.

273
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,785
I promise.

274
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,197
[crowd cheering]

275
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,666
Nice, right?

276
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,674
This is incredible.
How did you do this?

277
00:16:50,742 --> 00:16:53,336
With all the people here,
and the speakers.

278
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,880
I thought we were having
a small get-together.

279
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,610
It's one of many
small get-togethers.

280
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,584
That's why you got the house, brother.

281
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,176
You're having fun?

282
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,779
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

283
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,850
What else have you got planned?
A student band or something?

284
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,258
Yeah, that's it.

285
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,765
I got a student alt rock band
coming on stage next.

286
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,459
I own six Speaker Cities.

287
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,367
I'm worth $3.5 million,
that the government knows about.

288
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,372
I got more electronics up there
than a damn KlSS concert.

289
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,809
You think I'd roll out that kind of red carpet
for a fuckin' marching band?

290
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,368
Just make sure you can see the stage.

291
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,847
Excuse me. Pardon me.

292
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,112
I just want to get through this door,
if you don't mind.

293
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,345
Thank you.

294
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,149
This is the guy I was talking about.
This is his house.

295
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,658
- What's up, man?
- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

296
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,194
My friend Mitch, he owns the house.

297
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,959
Anyway, come hit this right here.
You need to hit this.

298
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,661
No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight.

299
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,501
Besides, I've got a big day tomorrow.
But you guys have a great time.

300
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,064
A big day? Doing what?

301
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,043
Well, actually,
pretty nice little Saturday.

302
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,704
We're going to Home Depot.

303
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,243
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

304
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,276
Stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath
and Beyond, I don't know.

305
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,844
I don't know if we'll have enough time.

306
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,317
You know what? Give me that thing.
I'll do one.

307
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,626
He gonna do one!
He gonna do one!

308
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,431
That's a talented man right there.

309
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,642
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fill it up again!

310
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,942
God, that's good.
It's so good!

311
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,608
Once it hits your lips,
it's so good.

312
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,242
Thank you very much, guys. This will be
happening at this house all year.

313
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,380
So just get ready,
don't burn yourselves out tonight.

314
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,324
I wanna thank you very much for coming to

For those who don't know
who Mitch Martin is,

316
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,893
he's the very successful,

317
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,063
very disease-free gentleman
standing by the mini-bar.

318

# You know what

325
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,802
# I'm thinking of a master plan

326
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,697
# Cuz ain't nothing but sweat
Inside my hand

327
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,070
# So I dig into my pockets
All my money is spent

328
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,371
# So I dig deeper
But still coming up with lint

329
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,934

Frank the Tank!

00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,659
Frank the Tank!

335

You know it!

336
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,730
You know it!

337
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,873
# A pen and a paper
A stereo, a tape

[rapping, indistinct]

339
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,283
You're that guy.

340
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,340
What?

341
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,353
Mitch-a-Palooza, from the poster.

342
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,854
Yeah, that's me.

343
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,356
This party is great.
Nice work.

344
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,791
My friends put it on for me.

345
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,387
They're kind of rereleasing me
out into the wild.

346
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,728
What are you talking about?

347
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,358
Nothing. Sorry.

348
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:41,031
# Got to have some thangs
So what you need is some game

We're going streaking!

00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
[screams, disgusted groans]

359
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,325
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:15,567
We're going streaking through the quad
and into the gymnasium.

361
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,971
Come on, everybody!

362
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,600
Come on, Snoop!

363
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,400
Snoop-a-loop!

364
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,468
Snoop!

365
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,940
No, it's cool. I'm cool.

366
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,949
Bring your green hat. Let's go.

367
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:28,417
Come on, everybody, we're going!

368
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,977
Here we go!

369
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,819
Man, man.
Man, put the music back on.

370
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,451
Let's get
the party back cracking up in here.

371
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,289
[crowd cheers]

372
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,023
Whoo! Come on!

373
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,361
We're streaking.
Come on!

374
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,163
Come on, every...
We're... come on!

375
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,966
Whoo! Whoo!

376
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,405
We're streaking.
We're streaking!

377
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,500
Whooo!

378
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,238
Come on!

379
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,706
Oh, tell her!

380
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,649
Marissa, I totally forgot.

381
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:03,017
I know it's a little belated, but we got you
the perfect wedding present!

382
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,182
Come on, you guys, I told you,
you don't have to get me anything.

383
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:10,194
Our friend Ashley had this guy come over
and teach a blow job class.

384
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,929
- It was incredible.
- A class?

385
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,796
And he's really good,
so we had to book him way in advance.

386
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,494
Why should I go to a class?

387
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,403
Bernard should be the one going to class.
I swear, the man is orally challenged.

388
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,771
- Wait a second, is that guy...
- [Frank whooping]

389
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,675
Oh, my God.

390
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,246
That's disgusting!

391
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,015
Why am I looking at that?

392
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,647
Why are you slowing down?

393
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:39,485
Just drive. Go.
[horns honking]

394
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,247
Frank?

395
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,689
No way.

396
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,853
Frank!

397
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,156
Hey, honey.

398
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,327
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:56,500
We're streaking. We're going up
through the quad to the gymnasium.

400
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,240
Who's streaking?

401
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,142
There's more coming.

402
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,780
Frank, get in the car.

403
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,748
- Everybody's doing it.
- Now!

404
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:06,806
Okay.

405
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:14,683
Whoa! Scooch over.

406
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,592
Hey, ladies.

407
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:25,324
Hey, Frank.
Looks like it's a little cold out there, huh?

408
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,099
[girls giggling]

409
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,963
Please, guys.

410
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,239
Honey, do you think KFC is still open?

411
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,211
[girls laughing]

412
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,982

[alarm buzzes]

414
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,929
Oh, shit.

415
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,657
Good morning.

416
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,128
Now, that was a party.

417
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,075
Since when are you so shy?

418
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,908
No, I'm not.
I just...

419
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,472
Did I snore last night?
Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.

420
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,912
I don't remember.

421
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,046
I don't think so.

422
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,788
Listen, about last night.

423
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:27,029
I just got out of a very serious
and traumatic relationship.

424
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,031
I'm kind of in a weird place right now.

425
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,335
What?

426
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,703
Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.

427
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,439
Mitch, with an "M."

428
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,673
Right. Look.

429
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:47,985
Whatever. We were just having a little fun.
You have nothing to worry about.

430
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,350
No.

431
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,889
Yeah, you're right.
I'm okay with it.

432
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,221
It's casual. I was just...

433
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,023
I got to go to class, so...

434
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,361
So, how do we do this? Shall l...

435
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,525
You want to leave me your number?

436
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,263
You don't even have to worry about it.

437
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,008
See you around.

438
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,738
Bye.

439
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,043
I love you.

440
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:21,917
At Speaker City, we're slashing prices
on everything from DVD players

441
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,080
to camcorders,
and everything in between.

442
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,421
Our courteous staff will educate you
on a wide selection of state-of-the-art

443
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,484
home theater equipment and accessories.

444
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:32,156
Show us a competitor's price.
We'll beat it.

445
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,997
If we can't beat it, I'll give you
the keys to the store. Literally.

446
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,399
Figuratively, I mean.

447
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:40,734
The only thing that sounds better
than our speakers are our prices!

448
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,103
Hi, silly kid.

449
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,975
What do you think? Honestly.
Shoot me straight.

450
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,307
Really good.

451
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,370
- You look great.
- Really?

452
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,448
God, I went a little bit...

453
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,851
Got crazy last night.

454
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,049
Yeah, I still haven't heard from Frank.
I'm a little worried.

455
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,024
Hello?
[cans clink]

456
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,592
Come on in. Jesus!

457
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,631
Is this one of your guys here?

458
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,463
- About three fire hazards over here.
- What are you doing, man?

459
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:17,064
Cheese, is that you?

460
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,774
Hello, Mitch, Bernard.
I see you guys haven't changed much.

461
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:22,814
Who is this?

462
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,111
Remember Cheese,
Rodney's kid brother?

463
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:29,086
Actually, my name isn't Cheese anymore.
It's Gordon Pritchard.

464
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,382
Oh, yeah!

465
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:32,390
Cheese!

466
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,983
Didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?

467
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,618
I got out.

468
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,721
Cool, man.
I'm glad you did.

469
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,365
- You had a good time last night?
- Yeah.

470
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,837
There might be some whippits
lying around if you want them.

471
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,431
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

472
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,669
Campus patrol?

473
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,978
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

474
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:56,844
- [Beanie and Gordon laugh]
- I'm the dean.

475
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,940
Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

476
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,146
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

477
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,281
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

478
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,882
What are you talking about?

479
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,521
You can't just do that. I've already paid
the first and last month's rent!

480
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,859
Take a look at that.

481
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,699
You have a week to vacate the premises,
and I thank you for your cooperation.

482
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,067
Great.

483
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,339
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

484
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,899
It's been good seeing you guys.
It looks like you're doing great.

485
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,885
Frank, this is a safe place.

486
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,893
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

487
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:47,398
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

488
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,989
We can say anything here.

489
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:50,993
Anything?

490
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,566
It's okay, honey.
That's why we came.

491
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,539
Well, I guess l...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

492
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,675
I mean, suddenly you get married

493
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,313
and you're supposed
to be this entirely different guy.

494
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,220
I don't feel different.

495
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,083
Take yesterday, for example.

496
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:20,222
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

497
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,993
And...

498
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:27,027
I happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order,

499
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:32,304
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

500
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,701
Her panties.

501
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:42,113
Odds are they're probably
basic white, cotton underpants.

502
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:46,817
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties."

503
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,621
"Maybe it's a thong."

504
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:54,097
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about."

505
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,657
You know? And I started feeling...

506
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,058
What?

507
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:02,796
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest. Are we not?

508
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,570
- We are. It's okay.
- Okay?

509
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,808
It's okay. Please continue.

510
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,842
I don't know
where I was going with that.

511
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,451
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

512
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:22,323
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

513
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:26,558
that I'm gonna have sex
with only one person

514
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,294
for the rest of my life.

515
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,766
Walsh tells me
your San Diego trip was a blast!

516
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,135
Yeah.

517
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,640
How was Hooters?

518
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,768
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

519
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,436
Yeah, right.

520
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,980
Skittles?

521
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,413
No, thanks.

522
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,973
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

523
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:51,148
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

524
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,746
What's wrong with it?

525
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,282
Well, for one thing, it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth

526
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,990
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1 966.

527
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,795
Most notably, clause four.

528
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,129
Shall I continue?

529
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,727
- Actually, I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

530
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,796
- Hi, Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

531
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,572
I don't think you've met my daughter.
Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

532
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,681
Nice to meet you, Mitch.

533
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,774
Hi. Nice to meet you.

534
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,183
- How was the slumber party?
- Great. You know,

535
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,414
movies and popcorn.

536
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,421
She's an angel.

537
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,726
It makes me sound an old man, but I can't
believe how fast she's growing up.

538
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,593
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry honey, but it's true.

539
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:38,159
To think that in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school!

540
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,931
[coughs violently]

541
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,837
You okay?

542
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,841
I thought you said high school.

543
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,900
Yeah.
Shocking, isn't it?

544
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,774
Yes, it is.

545
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,354
Give me a break.

546
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,017
Hey, Mitch.

547
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:09,127
Hey, man. Did you have a good day?

548
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,031
Not too bad.

549
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:13,670
What's going on?

550
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:17,936
I thought maybe I could crash here
tonight, if that's all right.

551
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,910
Marissa is going through
some personal stuff.

552
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:26,850
Personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked?

553
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,479
That and some other stuff.

554
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,957
No problem.
Make yourself at home.

555
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,253
Thanks.

556
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,562
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

557
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:39,690
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

558
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:45,294
In other words, forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society,

559
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,134
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

560
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:52,370
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

561
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,413
where community status
and more importantly, age,

562
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,710
have no bearing whatsoever.

563
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,979
Yeah? From the guy who probably
won't get in.

564
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,749
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

565
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:07,781
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

566
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,986
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

567
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:13,395
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

568
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,832
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

569
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:20,861
As well as provide no public service
of any kind. This much I promise.

570
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,169
What the hell is going on here?

571
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,732
Guys, this is a very special occasion.

572
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:29,770
The Godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence.

573
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,179
- The Godfather!
- [applause]

574
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,582
This is his damn house.
He lives here, he sleeps 20 feet away.

575
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,856
We need to talk.

576
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,113
Kitchen.

577
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:44,526
Sit good for me. I'm gonna talk
to Uncle Mitch for a second.

578
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,388
There you go, buddy.

579
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,662
- How long have these people been here?
- All day.

580
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,329
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

581
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,167
What are you talking about?

582
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,675
This is called "rush."
We're officially starting a fraternity.

583
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,734
I like it. It's genius!

584
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,438
You've got to be kidding me.

585
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,606
You heard Pritchard, all right?
We're obligated to do this.

586
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,778
This house, he says, is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

587
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,684
Fraternity solves both of those.

588
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12,451
But this is my house.
I live here, Beanie.

589
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,857
I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

590
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:19,590
I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

591
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,634
Did you or did you not
have a good time at the party?

592
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,498
I had an awesome time.

593
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,962
I know you had an awesome time.

594
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,507
The entire town knows
you had an awesome time.

595
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,134
I'm trying to ask Mitch whether
he had an awesome time.

596
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,905
- I had a good time.
- Okay, that's good.

597
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:36,004
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

598
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,413
- More good...
- God. I mean...

599
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:42,249
I don't understand. I don't know why it's
so hard for you to admit you want this.

600
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,687
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

601
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,021
Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

602
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:51,995
I know you guys are trying to help,
but the truth of the matter is,

603
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:55,898
I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

604
00:33:55,967 --> 00:34:00,028
And the fact is,
I've got 40 strangers out in my living room

605
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,835
and all I want to do is
get some fuckin' sleep.

606
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:07,174
So, I'm sorry, but we're not
starting a fraternity.

607
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,442
I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "F'ing."

608
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,608
All you got to do is
say "earmuffs" to him.

609
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,709
Then you can say,
"fuck, shit, bitch," whatever you want.

610
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,117
Cock. Balls.

611
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,986
I'm just proving a point.
You don't have to celebrate it, Frank.

612
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,457
- Sorry.
- Don't say sorry to me.

613
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,154
You let down Frank, you let down me,
you let down Max, most importantly.

614
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,424
And right about now,
I'm having a real hard time

615
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,059
trying to figure out why I take my time out of
my schedule to try to help you get over...

616
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,160
Earmuffs. That whore that you dated.

617
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:37,072
Wanna go out and see the other guys?
Uncle Mitch is sorry.

618
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,211
Say "yes."

619
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,370
Yes.

620
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,976
[squealing tires]

621
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,378
Here's the deal.
Listen up!

622
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,323
All together, we've picked
1 4 pledges.

623
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,326
Wait, who's this guy?

624
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,827
That's Blue.

625
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:59,261
He's an old Navy vet
who hangs around my store a lot.

626
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,060
But don't worry about it.
He's legit.

627
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,658
He looks like he's 1 00 years old.
He wants to pledge?

00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,597
You tell anyone about this,
I'll fuckin' kill you!

635
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:46,610
I'm kidding. We'll have him back tonight.
Okay, sweetie?

Congratulations, gentlemen.

643
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,532
You should all be
very proud of yourselves.

644
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:19,577
Each and every one of you
has been hand-picked

645
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:23,137
to represent our inaugural
pledge class.

646
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,775
Over the next 21 days,

647
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:32,415
you're all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain.

648

[screams:] D-ahhh!!

649
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,095
Frank, just pace yourself.

650
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,058
Copy that. Just got
a little overexcited. Sorry.

651
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:45,365
At this point
you may be asking yourself,

652
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:50,170
"Why am I holding
this 30-pound cinderblock in my hands?"

653
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,209
You might also ask yourself,

654
00:36:55,247 --> 00:37:00,583
"Why does this cinderblock
have a long piece of string

655
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,147
tied to it?"

656
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,019
And finally,

657
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:11,919
"Why's the other end of this string
tied securely

658
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,397
to your penis?"

659
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,933
And the answer, ladies, is trust.

660
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:23,203
This is your first test.

Do you trust we've provided you
with enough slack

663
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,606
so your block will land safely
on the lawn?

664
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,206
Sir, yes, sir.

665
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,081
- And Blue!
- Yes, sir?

666

Do you trust that I do not want
to see you die here tonight?

We have an illegal off-road vehicle

They've already been called, sir.

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,264
Call them again.

694
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,543
It's been two weeks.
How are these guys still a fraternity?

695
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,374
They're not a fraternity, sir.

696
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,382
They've been approved for temporary
status by the student council.

Half these guys don't even
go to the school.

You see the one guy, he's like 90.

699
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,685
Technically, that doesn't matter.
They found a loophole.

700
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,247
- A loophole?
- Yes.

701
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,883
Well, it's interesting, sir.

702
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,327
As stupid as they appear,
they're actually very good at paperwork.

703
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,126
It's quite an anomaly.

I'm sorry, is that funny?
Are you a standup comic?

Hey, Mitch, hang on a second.

I heard you guys are
starting up a fraternity.

Who told you that?

Nobody. Is it true?

- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Right.

It sounds cool, man.
I want in.

Listen to me.
There is no fraternity.

what you're talking about.

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,653
I hate golf.

Don't blackball me, Mitch.
Please.

725
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,726
I am not blackballing you.
We work together, Walsh.

726
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:39,999
And I don't want to mix work
with whatever it is I do at home.

Trust me, you're not
missing anything, anyways.

Really?

729

with Goldberg's daughter.

Sorry. Sorry.

731
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,309
That is untrue!

732
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,780
Hey, Mitch, all I'm saying is
think about it, okay?

733
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:01,257
Think about it!

734
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,586
So what?
Who cares if you work with the guy?

735
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:06,096
I do. I mean, I have a career
to worry about.

736
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:10,191
You're killing me. You really need
to start embracing this whole thing here.

737
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:13,203
The frustrating thing is I don't think
you appreciate everything I did for you.

738
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,262
- For me?
- Yeah, for you.

739
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,571
You think I like avoiding my wife and kids
to hang out with 1 9-year-old girls all day?

740
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,338
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, I don't, man.

- I'm doing this whole thing for you.
- Hello.

Who's this?

This is my daughter, Amanda.
Say hi, sweetie.

744
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:30,652
Hi, Amanda.
You remember Nicole, right?

745
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:34,180
Yeah, we did a little chicken dancing
at the wedding, actually.

746
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:36,420
- How you been?
- Fine, thanks.

747
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,290
Good.

748
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,297
I actually wanted
to apologize to you about the wedding.

749
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:42,230
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

750
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,235
It's okay.
You just embarrassed yourself.

751
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:48,932
- I brought you a housewarming gift.
- That is really nice.

752
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,773
It's just a CD holder, you know, for your
desk or whatever. I thought it was...

753
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,438
No, that thing's a piece of crap.
Awful.

754
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,478
- I stopped selling it six months ago.
- Please, hey, Beanie.

755
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,178
- Thanks.
- A lot of complaints.

756
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,550
- But it's a nice gesture, I think.
- No, this is cool.

757
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,111
Hey, Godfather!

758
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,590
- What's up?
- Yo, you the man, dog!

759
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,092
See you around, homey!

760
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,151
Did that guy just call you
the Godfather?

761
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,891
Must be joking around or something.

762
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,626
Where are you guys living now?

763
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,794
We're staying with my dad for awhile,
until I find something better.

764

The move's been a little rough on Amanda.

765

My son Max is turning six on Sunday.
We're having a birthday party for him.

766
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:28,043
Just like, petting zoo and clowns,
stuff like that.

767
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,047
But you guys are welcome to come,
if you like.

768
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:32,174
- Great idea! You should definitely come.
- Okay.

769
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,811
What do you guys like better?
Nurse or cheerleader?

770
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,087
Hi, Nicole.

771
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,091
Hi, Frank.

772
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,650
It's a nice doll you have there.

773
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,821
Yeah, thanks.
She's okay.

774
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:48,321
Did you have fun at the wedding?

775
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,031
Yeah, it was fun.

776
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,233
I'm just staying here, for right now.

777
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,035
Anyways, we'll see you Sunday then.

778
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,008
Sunday, right. Okay.

779
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,908
- Bye. Say bye.
- Bye.

780
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,341
Bye.

781
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,650
- Hi, you've reached Marissa.
- And Frank!

782
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,090
We're not here,
so leave us a message.

783

Hey, honey, it's me.

If any of these little fuckers decide to freak
out on the kids,

941
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,573
I get to take them down.

942
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,144
Ain't that right, mother?
What?

943
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:57,305
That's what I thought. Shut up.

944
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,911
Hey, be careful with that.

945
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,713
That's the most powerful
tranq gun on the market.

946
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,378
Got her in Mexico.

947
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,786
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

948
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,792
They say it could puncture
the skin of a rhino from a hundred...

949
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,057
Oww! Oh...

950
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,499
Yes!

951
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,126
That's awesome!

952
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,333
What?

953
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,400
You just took one
in the jugular, man!

954
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,672
Ha! Whoa.

955
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,271
Yes!

956
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,813
[laughing]

957
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,679
Oh, my God.

958
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,246
Oh, my God, I did.
Is this bad?

959
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,282
Is this bad?

960
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,086
You should pull that out.
That shit is not cool.

961
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,225
Wait.

962
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,821
[distorted voice]
Wait. Pull what out?

963
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:52,426
The dart, man.
You got a fuckin' dart in your neck.

964
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,407
You're craz... You're crazy, man.

965
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:00,340
You're crazy.

966
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,105
I like you.

967
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,574
But you're crazy.

968
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,016
I feel tired.

I'm so glad you're back.

I've missed you too, honey.

Don't worry, it'll work.

996
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:18,477
Here she comes.
Her name is Megan Huang.

997
00:55:18,547 --> 00:55:19,980
She's student council president,

998
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:23,780
prelaw, star of the tennis team,
a very promising young woman.

999
00:55:23,852 --> 00:55:25,752
A young woman with a lot to lose.

1000
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:27,379
- Megan, hello.
- Hi.

1001
00:55:27,456 --> 00:55:29,048
Have a seat.

1002
00:55:35,397 --> 00:55:37,922
I'm sure you know Dean Pritchard.

1003
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,490
Don't turn around.

1004
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:45,866
Megan, this little fraternity
over on Brook Street

1005
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:49,775
has become quite an inconvenience
for us, okay?

1006
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:54,009
And as student body president,
you approved their temporary status.

1007
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:58,076
Unfortunately, you alone
have the ability to revoke it.

1008
00:55:58,153 --> 00:56:00,587
So, we're gonna need you to
go ahead and do that.

1009
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:03,989
Revoke it? Why?
Everybody loves those guys.

1010
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:08,359
They throw the sickest parties.
I met my boyfriend at their casino night.

1011
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,295
Uh-huh, that's great.

1012
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,767
It says here you are applying
to Columbia Law School.

1013
00:56:13,836 --> 00:56:16,566
Wow, that's a tough school
to get into.

1014
00:56:16,638 --> 00:56:20,631
You know, Dean Pritchard has
some serious connections at Columbia.

1015
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:23,001
Are you bribing me?

1016
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:28,278
Don't make life
harder on yourself, Chang.

1017
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:29,874
It's Huang.

1018
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:33,646
Whatever.
How's the tennis season going?

1019
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:37,787
I made some minor changes,
but overall it's okay.

1020
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,658
- It's a pretty standard lease.
- Okay, great.

1021
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:44,756
Thank you for taking a look at it for me.
This stuff always confuses me.

1022
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,027
Anytime.

1023
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:49,932
So, you and Mark are
moving in together?

1024
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:54,703
Yeah.
Well, financially it makes sense, so...

1025
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:59,772
You know, there's something
I think you should know...

1026
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:02,512
about Mark.

1027
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:04,074
What is it?

1028
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,819
Well...
[sighs deeply]

1029
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:12,325
Relationships are a lot of work.

1030
00:57:12,394 --> 00:57:15,420
And, I guess what I'm saying is...

1031
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:21,793
Good luck.

1032
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:25,339
Oh, okay.
Well, thank you.

1033
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:27,238
Yeah. Listen.

1034
00:57:27,309 --> 00:57:31,678
I was thinking maybe sometime
we could get some dinner or something?

1035
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:33,738
- Yeah.
- If that's okay with you.

1036
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:35,647
- I'd like that.
- Yeah.

1037
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:40,313
Of course, leave it to me to wait until
you've got a boyfriend

1038
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:42,186
to finally ask you out.

1039
00:57:42,257 --> 00:57:44,020
Timing was never your thing.

1040
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,424
No.

1041
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:49,430
Okay, so, thank you.

1042
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,566
And, call me about dinner.

1043
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:55,865
- I will.
- Excuse me, sir!

1044
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:57,900
We have a situation, sir!

1045
00:57:57,973 --> 00:58:00,203
What are you guys doing here?
I said never at work.

1046

But it's an emergency.

1047
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:04,312
We can only buy KY Jelly
in the 4-ounce tubes.

1048
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:09,373
Industrial size cans will take up to
3 to 4 business days, so we're screwed.

1049
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:10,577
What's all that for?

1050
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:12,779
It's Blue's birthday.
We're having a KY wrestling match.

1051
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:16,188
You know what?
Can we talk about this later, please?

1052
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:23,031
I'm going again, baby!

1054
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:34,636
Yeah! Yeah!

1055
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,702
This doesn't seem fair!
I'm on a roll!

I don't usually like fraternity guys.
They're such losers.

00:59:16,952 --> 00:59:21,082
But, you're like... mature.

Mature?

1067
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,186
Yeah.

1068
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,627
So, where do you sleep, anyway?

1069
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:30,392
Usually, I sleep at home.

You had Mitch look at the lease?

I didn't want to get into this, but...

1165

I walked in on him, and he was
harassing one of the caterers.

- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:23,979
He was being aggressive
and grabbing her and stuff.

1169
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:26,782
It was disgusting.
I didn't want to say anything

Hi, Mitch.

I was thinking, if you're not too busy,

1174
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:37,761
maybe I'd take you up
on that cup of coffee.

1175
01:05:38,299 --> 01:05:41,393
- Now's not really a good time.
- Look.

1176
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:46,366
I'm really sorry about the other day.
I want the chance to explain everything.

1177
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:49,342
- I don't think so.
- It's...

1178
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:52,341
It's been kind of a tough day,

1179
01:05:52,414 --> 01:05:54,814

I wanted to clear up,

1182
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:05,951
because I get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who I am.

ever give you that idea?

Okay, that's one pecan pie
and two coffees.

it's always on the house.

No offense, though. He is the king.

You are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend.

That's very kind,
but I insist, I'll pay.

Your money, it's not good here.

- Okay.
- I look forward to pledging next semester.

1194
01:06:36,157 --> 01:06:39,923
Okay, now don't you think
this is going a little far?

1195
01:06:39,994 --> 01:06:43,122
I heard one of your pledges died.
Is that true?

1196
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:46,801
Well, yes.
But he was really old.

1197
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:49,701
And I feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back,

1198
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:52,001
it'll show that it was probably
of natural causes.

1199
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:56,339
Look, to be honest, you're really not
the person I thought you were.

1200
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:58,845
But it's okay. It's not a big deal.

1201
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:01,211
I think that I am that person.

1202
01:07:01,282 --> 01:07:04,911
And I feel more like myself now
than I have in a really long time.

1203

So, that's why you go around
harassing young women?

- The caterer.

who was acting inappropriate.

to worry about my dad.

Right, I'm sure you can.

I love you. Frank.

1233

Due to these infractions,
not only will your house be repossessed,

1234
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:11,368
but those of you who are students
will be expelled from the university

for your participation in
a non-sanctioned fraternity.

Good. Believe me,

But unfortunately, there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:16,340
Yes, she is. I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

1254
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:21,610
When I left, she said,
"Weensie, if you screw this up, I'll kill you."

1255
01:10:21,983 --> 01:10:24,008
She showed me the knife.

1256
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:27,551
- [Weensie sobbing]
- [Beanie: ] Shhh.

1257
01:10:27,889 --> 01:10:32,223
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.
He's gonna take care of this thing, okay?

1258
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:33,954
It's gonna be all right.

1259
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:39,259
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

1260
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:41,962
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

1261
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:47,032
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

1262
01:10:47,108 --> 01:10:49,338
Good. I need your help with something.

1263
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:52,038
Off the record.
You do this, you're in.

1264
01:10:52,113 --> 01:10:53,546
Sir, yes, sir.

1265
01:10:53,615 --> 01:10:57,483
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7-A,

1266
01:10:57,552 --> 01:10:59,611
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

1267
01:10:59,687 --> 01:11:02,019
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

1268
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,957
Booker, make two copies of this petition,
have it notarized,

1269
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:07,586
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then I need-

1270
01:11:07,662 --> 01:11:11,063
Listen, Donald tells me you got these guys
working prep for the arbitration.

1271
01:11:11,132 --> 01:11:14,329
I told you five times, I want them working
the Sunshine Square deal.

1272
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:16,996
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

1273
01:11:17,071 --> 01:11:19,335
so now I have them helping
with the arbitration,

1274
01:11:19,407 --> 01:11:22,035
and I'd appreciate it if you let me
handle my own team,

1275
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,204
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

1276
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:28,171
All right.

1277
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:30,240
Wanna make sure
you're on top of it.

1278
01:11:30,318 --> 01:11:31,751
Well, I am.

1279
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:34,014
Well, good. Carry on.

1280
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:37,148
See? That's why they call him
the Godfather.

1281
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:38,055
Hey.

1282
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:41,388
Just take care of it.

1283
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:48,331
Gentlemen, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

1284
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:50,268
Did a little research.

1285
01:11:50,338 --> 01:11:53,705
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

1286
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:55,766
We have the right to a formal evaluation

1287
01:11:55,843 --> 01:11:58,505
before they can deny
our official application.

1288
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,516
However, we're now subject to
a charter certification review

1289
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,051
given by the board of trustees.

1290
01:12:04,118 --> 01:12:05,483
Damn it.

1291
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,185
Wait. Wait, what does
that mean exactly?

1292
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:13,159
According to university bylaws,
it's a thorough inspection of the fraternity,

1293
01:12:13,227 --> 01:12:15,218
and our contribution to the community.

1294
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:17,560
Focus is on five categories:

1295
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:20,965
Academics, athletics, community service,

1296
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:23,663
debate, and school spirit.

1297
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:26,905
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

1298
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:28,875
And I'll see you around campus.

1299
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:31,878
Actually, all of us are
being tested. Yeah.

1300
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:34,938
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

1301
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:38,611
It's in the bylaws. Every member
of the fraternity is subject to review

1302
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:41,154
in every category,
including academics.

1303
01:12:41,222 --> 01:12:44,123
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

1304
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:46,820
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

1305
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:49,057
This is unbelievable.

1306
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:52,930
What happened to, "needing brotherhood
now more than ever?" They need us.

1307
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,060
Come on, college is
overrated anyway.

1308
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:58,367
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

1309
01:12:58,439 --> 01:13:02,466
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

1310
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:04,534
and now people's lives are ruined.

1311
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:07,046
Ruined? Like, whose life is ruined?

1312
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:09,174
Well, let's see.

1313
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:10,975
Blue's dead.

1314
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:13,020
Frank's divorced.

1315
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:16,921
I've lost my house.
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

1316
01:13:16,991 --> 01:13:21,291
And now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school,

1317
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:23,557
and you're not even gonna
help 'em out.

1318
01:13:37,311 --> 01:13:41,509
Is this thing gonna go down smooth or
what? I'm missing 1 8 holes of golf here.

1319
01:13:41,582 --> 01:13:44,415
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

1320
01:13:44,485 --> 01:13:46,009
It should make for
a very entertaining day.

1321
01:13:46,087 --> 01:13:48,681
I'm going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus.

1322
01:13:48,756 --> 01:13:49,620
Ditto.

1323
01:13:51,058 --> 01:13:55,051
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

1324
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,630
Unfortunately,

1325
01:13:58,699 --> 01:14:02,931
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

1326
01:14:03,004 --> 01:14:06,701
So, we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

1327
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:11,975
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's Crossfire,

1328
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:15,538
famed political consultant,
the Raging Cajun,

1329
01:14:15,616 --> 01:14:17,345
Mr. James Carville.

1330
01:14:17,451 --> 01:14:19,510
[applause]

1331
01:14:22,123 --> 01:14:23,886
- Thank you.
- Don't clap.

1332
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:27,155
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here, sir.

1333
01:14:27,228 --> 01:14:29,355
Topic number one.

1334
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:34,159
What is your position
on the role of government

1335
01:14:34,235 --> 01:14:38,103
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

1336
01:14:38,906 --> 01:14:41,340
Well, Dean, I'm glad you
asked that question...

1337
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:44,537
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

1338
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,039
Have at it, hoss.

1339
01:14:48,115 --> 01:14:50,049
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

1340
01:14:57,224 --> 01:14:59,920
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

1341
01:14:59,994 --> 01:15:02,622
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited.

1342
01:15:02,697 --> 01:15:05,860
And as a corollary, the market
for technologies is shrinking.

1343
01:15:05,933 --> 01:15:08,424
As a world leader,
it is important for America to provide

1344
01:15:08,502 --> 01:15:10,663
systematic research grants
for our scientists.

1345
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:14,674
I believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well-articulated innovation policy

1346
01:15:14,742 --> 01:15:18,041
with emphasis on
human resource development. Thank you.

1347
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:20,075
[applause]

1348
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:23,778
Where'd that come from?

1349
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:25,512
What happened? I blacked out.

1350
01:15:25,586 --> 01:15:27,110
It was awesome.

1351
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:29,986
That was interesting.
Thank you very much.

1352
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:33,356
And your rebuttal,
Mr. Carville?

1353
01:15:33,427 --> 01:15:37,454
We have no response.

1354
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:39,732
That was perfect.

1355
01:15:42,937 --> 01:15:46,270
That's the way you do it!
That's the way you debate.

1356
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:58,208
Number 1 2.

1357
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:03,386
Which of the following is
a generally accepted graphical technique

1358
01:16:03,457 --> 01:16:06,915
for determining first order
system parameters?

1359
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:11,995
Is it, A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics?

1360
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,401
B, Pythagorean triplets?

1361
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:19,633
Or C, the migration method of graphing
quadratic functions?

1362
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:24,611
Harriot's method of solving cubics.

1363
01:16:24,678 --> 01:16:27,670
The answer is A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics.

1364
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:35,615
Good test.

1365
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:47,097
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

1366
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:49,635
Go Harrison!

1367
01:16:49,703 --> 01:16:51,102
# Everybody dance now!

1368
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:59,970
# Everybody dance now!

1369
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:09,250
# Give me the music

1370
01:17:11,659 --> 01:17:13,456
# Give me the music

1371
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:16,996
# Everybody dance now!

1372
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:26,000
# Everybody dance now!

1373
01:17:29,143 --> 01:17:31,111
- Yes!
- Wow.

1374
01:17:31,178 --> 01:17:32,509
[drumming]

1375
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:41,188
Go, Cougars!

1376
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:46,455
[pained screams]
Oh, no!

1377
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:51,127
Help me! Help me!

1378
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,361
[laughing]

1379
01:17:55,002 --> 01:17:57,334
Dean Pritchard,
can I talk to you for a second?

1380
01:17:57,404 --> 01:17:58,996
Megan, I'm a little busy.

1381
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:01,701
I didn't get into
Columbia Law School.

1382
01:18:01,775 --> 01:18:03,333
How awful.

1383
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:06,504
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

1384
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,672
You're right, I did say that.

1385
01:18:07,748 --> 01:18:09,841
No one at Columbia
has even heard of you.

1386
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:11,179
Oh, Megan.

1387
01:18:11,652 --> 01:18:14,780
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

1388
01:18:14,855 --> 01:18:17,187
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work.

1389
01:18:17,258 --> 01:18:19,749
I bribe people all the time,
but I changed my mind. It's a free country.

1390
01:18:19,827 --> 01:18:21,886
Lesson learned.

1391
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:25,532
[banging on locker]

1392
01:18:25,599 --> 01:18:27,123
Damn it!

1393
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:32,038
Sorry, guys, I lost my composure out there.
I'm an idiot.

1394
01:18:32,106 --> 01:18:35,405
Frankie, don't worry about it.
We'll make those points up, I promise you.

1395
01:18:35,476 --> 01:18:37,706
- Your skin's gonna grow back, too.
- [wincing]

1396
01:18:37,778 --> 01:18:39,245
I'm sorry.

1397
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:41,508
Okay, how many events
do we actually have left here?

1398
01:18:41,582 --> 01:18:45,211
One. Frank's accident
definitely set us back.

1399
01:18:45,286 --> 01:18:49,245
But if we pass...
If we pass athletics, we're in.

1400
01:18:49,323 --> 01:18:52,190
All right, everybody!
That's what I'm talking about, guys.

1401
01:18:52,259 --> 01:18:54,750
We've made a great effort so far.
Let's just keep it up!

1402
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:58,663
That's right! We can't have anyone
freak out out there, okay?

1403
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:02,032
We've got to keep our composure!
We've come too far.

Let's make it official then, jackass!

1560
01:29:05,205 --> 01:29:06,968
Let's make it official!

1561
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:10,867
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

1562
01:29:10,944 --> 01:29:13,003
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

1563
01:29:13,747 --> 01:29:16,716
Is that Frank the Tank?

1564
01:29:16,783 --> 01:29:18,876
Hey. Heidi.

1565
01:29:19,753 --> 01:29:22,688
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

1566
01:29:22,756 --> 01:29:25,589
I got into body painting.

1567
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:27,490
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1568
01:29:27,561 --> 01:29:28,653
That's great.

1569
01:29:28,729 --> 01:29:31,391
Well, you're looking
very healthy.

1570
01:29:31,465 --> 01:29:34,764
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, so are you.

1571
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:36,769
Oh, thank you.

1572
01:29:36,837 --> 01:29:40,204
So, I heard you and Marissa
split up. Is that true?

1573
01:29:40,273 --> 01:29:42,138
Yeah, we did.

1574
01:29:42,876 --> 01:29:44,810
You poor baby.

1575
01:29:45,612 --> 01:29:47,170
You know, I'm having
this get-together

1576
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:48,839
at my place
tomorrow night.

1577
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:52,747
Like a few lnternet friends.
You should swing by.

1578
01:29:52,819 --> 01:29:54,810
- Really?
- Totally.

1579
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,089
- Okay.
- All right.

1580
01:29:57,157 --> 01:30:00,320
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

1581
01:30:03,163 --> 01:30:04,494
Awesome.

1582
01:30:04,564 --> 01:30:05,997
Yes!

1583
01:30:08,902 --> 01:30:10,767
I am back!

1584
01:30:10,837 --> 01:30:12,532
[whooping]

1585
01:30:14,841 --> 01:30:16,706
You know it!
