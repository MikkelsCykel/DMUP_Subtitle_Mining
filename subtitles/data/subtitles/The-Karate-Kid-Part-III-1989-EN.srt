1
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,400
Fear does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

2
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,700
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

3
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,900
Pain does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,200
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,300
Defeat does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

7
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,000
Fear does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,700
Pain does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

10
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,200
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,800
Defeat does not exist in this <i>dojo</i>.
Does it?

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,300
No, <i>Sensei</i>!

13
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,000
Prepare!

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,800
We do not train to be merciful here.
Mercy is for the weak.

15
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,700
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he's the enemy.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,700
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Class, we have visitors.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,900
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,300
Afraid the facts mixed up.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,300
Now you get your boy on the mat
or you and I will have a major problem.

21
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,800
Too much advantage, your <i>dojo</i>.

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Name a place.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,900
Tournament.

24
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,500
Come on, Johnny, kill him!

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,400
<i>Point! Chop! That's two for LaRusso!</i>

26
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,100
Time out, time out.

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,600
Go to your <i>sensei</i>. Turn. Kneel.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,500
Hey, Johnny, you're a cream-puff!

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,600
Sweep the leg.

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
You have a problem with that?

31
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,300
No, <i>Sensei</i>.

32
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,400
No mercy.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,800
Warning for illegal contact to the knees.

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,300
Ready?

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,500
No mercy! No mercy!

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,400
Weigh the fist, Johnny.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,900
Finish him!

38
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,600
Winner!

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,400
Now who's the loser?

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,200
You're really sick, man.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,500
How does second place feel now?

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,700
- He can't breathe.
- Mind your business.

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,100
- You're gonna kill him.
- <i>Sensei</i>, please. You're hurting him.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
He's sorry, okay? He really is.

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
Let him go.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

47
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,100
"Mercy is for the weak.

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,200
"We do not train to be merciful here.

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,100
"A man face you, he is enemy.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,900
"Enemy deserve no mercy."

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Come, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

52
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,600
Time go home.

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
- You could have killed him, couldn't you?
- <i>Hai.</i>

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
Why didn't you then?

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,100
<i>Because, Daniel</i>-san<i>,</i>
<i>for person with no forgiveness in heart...</i>

56
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,100
<i>... living even worse punishment</i>
<i>than death.</i>

57
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,800
Sensei <i>Kreese, this is Pat Johnson</i>
<i>from the All Valley Tournament.</i>

58
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
<i>We're sorry you lost all your students.</i>

59
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
<i>I guess the Cobra Kai won't</i>
<i>enter the tournament this year.</i>

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,700
<i>We've made repeated requests</i>
<i>for payments of dues...</i>

61
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>... but since you've failed to respond...</i>

62
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,300
<i>... we have to drop the Cobra Kai</i>
<i>from our membership rolls.</i>

63
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,500
<i>If you have any questions, give me a call.</i>
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

64
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,400
<i>Mr. Kreese, this is Pacific Bell.</i>

65
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,700
<i>This is the final call regarding your bill,</i>
<i>and if you do not pay immediately...</i>

66
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Mr. Kreese, good morning.
What a surprise. Some coffee?

67
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,100
- Where's the boss?
- He's upstairs.

68
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Thanks.

69
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,400
Come on!

70
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,100
You're telegraphing that wheel kick.

71
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,500
Johnny!

72
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,900
What a surprise, man!

73
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Yes!

74
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,600
What's this? You moving in?

75
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,300
This is "I give up." I came to say good-bye.

76
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,900
- Here are the <i>dojo</i> keys.
- What are you talking about?

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,600
I'll pay you that back rent soon.

78
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,800
You think I bought that place for the rent?
I bought it for you.

79
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,100
- Mr. Silver?
- What?

80
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,700
The plutonium deal.

81
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,100
Johnny, every business has a slump
at one time or another.

82
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,600
Ten years ago
nuclear was the preferred waste.

83
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,500
You could dump it anywhere.
Now, everybody's a detective.

84
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,500
I'm lucky if I make one deal a year
without being indicted.

85
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Thank you.

86
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,900
Let's get some air.

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's been nine months since a student
walked through my doors.

88
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,900
You're not listening to me.
Come on, snap out of it.

89
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,200
I can't.

90
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,100
I'm broke and I'm going nowhere.

91
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
You're wrong.

92
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,100
You're going to Tahiti.

93
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,200
Now.

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,100
All right, I've made up my mind.

95
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
This slope, Miyagi, and that punk kid...

96
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
...I'll get them for what they did to you.

97
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
They made you suffer,
so I'll make them suffer.

98
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,600
When I think they've suffered enough,
then I start with the pain.

99
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,200
- Terry, you don't have to do that.
- Don't have to? I want to.

100
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
It's not over. We're Cobra Kai.

101
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,400
Come on, say it. Cobra Kai.

102
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,400
Say it! Cobra Kai.

103
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,800
- Never dies.
- You bet your ass.

104
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,000
- I owe you, man.
- You don't owe me anything.

105
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't owe you anything?
What about Vietnam?

106
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,900
How many times did you save my ass?

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,700
I don't know. I lost count.

108
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,600
Get the hell out of here.

109
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,900
Have a good trip, Captain.

110
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,900
<i>The White Zone is for the immediate</i>
<i>loading and unloading of passengers only.</i>

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
Smog.

112
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,600
Smells like home, huh, Mr. Miyagi?

113
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,400
Daniel-<i>san</i>,
why mother not here to meet you?

114
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
You tell her right flight number?

115
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I told her the right flight.
I just told her the wrong day.

116
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,900
I told her we were coming in tomorrow.
She loves surprises.

117
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Hope so.

118
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,000
We take taxi apartment house.
Then Miyagi go back to work.

119
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
<i>106 Los Angeles. Crank it up!</i>

120
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,200
What are you doing in my cab?

121
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,700
- We just came from the airport.
- I thought that was the cab I ordered.

122
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,700
- Mrs. Milo, what's going on?
- What does it seem? Progress.

123
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,100
I got a message for you from your mother.

124
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,600
I told you that bum would sell the place
and you'd be out of a job someday.

125
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,500
You wouldn't listen to me.

126
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
- What's the message?
- What message?

127
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,600
- The one from my mother.
- She said call her at your Uncle Louie's.

128
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,900
No worry nothing, Mrs. LaRusso.

129
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,600
Daniel-<i>san</i> room all finished.

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Yeah, I take good care of him.
You just look out Uncle Louie.

131
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,900
I might be here for a few months.

132
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,800
A 70-year-old man gets emphysema,
it's no joke, you know.

133
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,700
Are you sure there's no problem
for him to stay with you?

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,200
No problem.

135
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,400
Pleasure.

136
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,100
<i>Mr. Miyagi, thank you.</i>

137
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,000
Welcome. Bye-bye. Here Daniel-<i>san</i>.

138
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,500
Nice mama.

139
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,900
You sure you don't need me there?

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
<i>No. You stay with Mr. Miyagi</i>
<i>and start college.</i>

141
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,700
I can't believe it, "Mr. College Man."
When's registration?

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,100
<i>It's this Tuesday.</i>
<i>And classes start Thursday.</i>

143
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,100
And when is Kumiko arriving?

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,100
She's not.

145
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,700
She got this great job
with a dance company in Tokyo.

146
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
I guess she just couldn't say no, so...

147
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,200
You're disappointed, huh?

148
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Yep. But that's life, I guess.
I'll survive.

149
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
You'll do more than just survive.

150
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
I gotta go, okay?

151
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,900
Listen, Uncle Louie says hi,
and I love you.

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,700
Okay, say hi to Uncle Louie.
I love you, too.

153
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,400
The little maple's still in there.
I'll get it.

154
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,400
No. I go.

155
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,500
Mr. Miyagi, you okay?

156
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,200
Just remembering.

157
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,500
I'll bet there are a lot of memories
here for you.

158
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,200
So what are you going to do now?

159
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,200
Don't know.

160
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,300
Well, did you ever think about
opening a <i>bonsai</i> store?

161
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,100
<i>Hai</i>, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

162
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,200
In my dream.

163
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
My retirement.

164
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
What do you call this?

165
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,900
Call "time to go."

166
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,900
You know, I've been thinking about
the <i>bonsai</i> shop idea.

167
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,100
You already have all the stock.
How hard can it be?

168
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
Not too hard, Daniel-<i>san</i>...

169
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,500
...if Miyagi have money for lease,
deposit, fix-up.

170
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,700
But since we build house
for Yukie in Okinawa...

171
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,900
...money very short supply.

172
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
"Supply"?

173
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,100
Supplies are us.

174
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,600
Thank you, Daniel-<i>san</i>,
but that not money.

175
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,600
It looks like money. Smells like money.
Good money. Smell that.

176
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,700
Smell like college education.

177
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,000
I know, Mr. Miyagi,
but I have a great idea...

178
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Daniel-<i>san</i>.

179
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,400
No idea.

180
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,700
Discussion closed.

181
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,200
But what about your dream?

182
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,700
And, Mr. Miyagi, no offence,
but if you miss the train this time...

183
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,500
...there may not be another one
for a long time.

184
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
Then Miyagi take bus.

185
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,300
Revenge? Of course you want revenge.
I'm gonna get it for you.

186
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,300
The day you step off the plane, you're
the biggest <i>dojo</i> operator in the valley.

187
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,200
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

188
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,500
I bought 20 locations today.
Yours, 100 percent.

189
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,600
You are back, my man,
bigger and badder than ever.

190
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,500
<i>You're a sweetheart, that's great!</i>

191
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
But what about those two jerks?

192
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,400
<i>Those two jerks are taking up</i>
<i>100 percent of my time from now on.</i>

193
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,400
So just have patience.
I'm just getting things rolling.

194
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,500
When I'm finished with that kid,
he'll be begging me to be his teacher.

195
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
You know what he's gonna learn from me?

196
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,600
Pain in every part of his body
and fear in every part of his mind.

197
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,900
And here's the kicker:
he's gonna thank me for it.

198
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,500
What about the old man?

199
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,300
Him I hurt for the kid.

200
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,900
By the time that little twerp
steps into the ring to defend his title...

201
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,700
...I'm gonna have him thinking
he's invincible.

202
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,100
Then he's gonna find out
what pain and fear really mean...

203
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,300
...right in front of a thousand people.

204
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,400
How do you know he'll compete?

205
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,400
He'll compete. Don't worry about it.
You just have fun.

206
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,200
<i>Go give Mimona and her girlfriend</i>
<i>a squeeze for me.</i>

207
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,500
How do you know about her?

208
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,100
I know.

209
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,600
<i>Anything else you want?</i>

210
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,300
Yeah.

211
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,000
Make his knuckles bleed.

212
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,300
I like that, Johnny.
I'm gonna use that.

213
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm going to be working full-time
on this from now on.

214
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,000
Very good, sir.

215
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,200
No, it's too nice.
I gotta look poor.

216
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,000
This isn't bad. Fix the collar.
Make me look humble.

217
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
- About the Borneo call?
- All right, but that's the last one.

218
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,600
For the next few weeks,
my business is revenge.

219
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,500
Everything is in place, sir.

220
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,200
All right,
let's see what you've got for me.

221
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
Cute but wrong.

222
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,500
It's got no character.

223
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,200
A truck.

224
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah, I like it. Make sure it runs.

225
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,600
Yes, sir.

226
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,500
- Where are the magazines I ordered?
- Right here, sir.

227
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,000
- Have a very pleasant evening, sir.
- Thank you, Margaret.

228
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,400
"Karate's bad boy.

229
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,100
"Mike Barnes."

230
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,900
Perfect.

231
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Mr. Miyagi, I'm home.

232
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,700
Daniel-<i>san</i>, just in time.

233
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
How was fishing?

234
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,900
We find out pretty soon.

235
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,100
So, how first day at college?

236
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,500
College?

237
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,300
College...

238
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
College is...
Well, you know college, Mr. Miyagi.

239
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,100
It's a place that I didn't go to today.

240
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
What?

241
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,400
Mr. Miyagi,
may all your dreams come true.

242
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,500
What this?

243
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,800
There's only one way to find out.

244
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,200
All right, I'll tell you.

245
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
It's my college diploma.

246
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,800
- What?
- I'm only joking.

247
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,500
Daniel-<i>san</i>, you have sense humour.

248
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,000
"Lease."

249
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,600
For your new <i>bonsai</i> store.
Congratulations.

250
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,500
"One month security, two month rent."

251
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Yes. With just enough left over
for renovations, if we're careful.

252
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,000
Daniel-<i>san</i>, thank you very much,
but cannot accept.

253
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,100
But it's your dream, Mr. Miyagi.
Why not?

254
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,100
Because money in pocket
was not for Miyagi dream.

255
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
Was for college education.

256
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,500
I know, just listen to me for a minute.

257
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,200
I know me. I just can't take courses
to take courses.

258
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,900
I'll get bored.
Once it happens, forget about it.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,700
It's bye-bye college.

260
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,900
I've been going to school non-stop
since I'm five. I could use the break.

261
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,600
- I don't know, Daniel-<i>san</i>.
- I do.

262
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,900
- Just come with me a second.
- Where?

263
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
- Come with me.
- What about fish?

264
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,200
The fish is not going anyplace.
That fish is dead.

265
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,200
What a moment!

266
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,700
You are now crossing over
to the right side of the tracks.

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,200
- What that?
- That's opportunity knocking.

268
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,100
Straight ahead. Right up there.

269
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,000
Your dream come true,
and there's plenty of free parking.

270
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,700
Right here, Mr. Miyagi.

271
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,900
- This place?
- This place. Wait till you see it up close.

272
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,100
So, is this the opportunity
of a lifetime or what?

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,300
Now, I know you're worried
about this area...

274
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,100
...but the landlord says
this neighbourhood is up and coming.

275
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,300
We're in on the ground floor over here.
Look, a pottery shop across the street.

276
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,600
We could set a deal,
get some planters made up for the <i>bonsai</i>.

277
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,600
Wait till you see inside, man.
This is going to be great.

278
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,600
This is going to be great.

279
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,500
Come on in.

280
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,400
Mr. Miyagi, welcome to your dream.

281
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,700
Now don't let this throw you.
Looks can be deceiving.

282
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,600
We have to think potential here.

283
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,500
Think potential, all right?

284
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
You see all this stuff? Everything in here?

285
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,100
You own it. Everything.
It's all yours. You could use this stuff.

286
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,500
This is good wood.
We can make shelves out of this stuff.

287
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,200
Back here,
I thought this would be a great spot...

288
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,000
...up here, to do like a <i>bonsai</i> display.

289
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,600
All those pine trees you have?
We could show them in different stages.

290
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,000
You know, the possibilities are endless.

291
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,600
Over here, right,
I thought this would be a great spot...

292
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
...for a little work area.

293
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Over here we got like a <i>bonsai</i> hospital.
The little guys get sick. Take care of them.

294
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,700
I work for free. And I thought of a name.

295
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,900
Check it out.

296
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,300
"Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees."

297
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,000
Simple, direct, catchy.

298
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,800
It doesn't look it now,
but this place is a gold mine.

299
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,500
I know you can make it work, Mr. Miyagi.
If anyone can, you can.

300
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,800
What did I do? Did I forget something?

301
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,100
Well, what did I miss?

302
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,700
Your name on lease, next to mine.

303
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,300
- Partner.
- Partner?

304
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,900
Yes! Mr. Miyagi, this is gonna be great.

305
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,200
You're welcome.

306
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
What?

307
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
Don't bullshit me.

308
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,700
What do you mean
you can't dump it in Borneo?

309
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,900
Who in Borneo
knows what chloride sludge is?

310
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,100
Just do it!

311
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,600
Do it!

312
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,600
Call me when it's dumped.

313
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,100
Where were we, Margaret?

314
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,300
"And, in conclusion,
I reject your final offer.

315
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,900
"If you proceed,
I'll sue your collective asses accordingly."

316
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,900
Best to Lorna and the kids. Sincerely...

317
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Yeah?

318
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Good, bring him in.

319
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,200
What else?

320
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,800
The grand jury.
What do you intend to do about them?

321
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,400
Bribe them, as usual.

322
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,700
Lighten up, Margaret.

323
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,300
- Who's the DA on the case?
- Mr. Cole.

324
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,500
Good.

325
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Let's invite Willie to dinner Tuesday night.
We'll have his favourite.

326
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,000
- Poached salmon.
- Very well.

327
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,300
Mr. Silver?

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,300
You must be Mike Barnes. Welcome to LA.

329
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,600
Thank you for bringing me down,
Mr. Silver.

330
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,600
Milos, call the boys.

331
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
This place is intense.

332
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,000
- Consider it home.
- Thanks.

333
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,100
Snake, Dennis.

334
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Mike Barnes.

335
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,100
Dennis will take care of your training.
Snake takes care of everything else.

336
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,900
If you're looking to be a bad boy in LA,
Snake's the boy to be bad with.

337
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,300
You know it.

338
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,700
You get a weekly draw and a car.
Any questions?

339
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,100
Remember on the phone you said
if I come here...

340
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,100
...and I beat this LaRusso
in the All Valley Tournament...

341
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,300
...that you'd give me 25 percent ownership
in your new <i>dojo</i>s?

342
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,700
Which I think is more than generous.

343
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,000
But I've been giving it some thought.

344
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,900
For me to do my absolute best,
which is what I want to do for you...

345
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
...l'm afraid I'm gonna need 50 percent.

346
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,700
Fifty percent?

347
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,000
Well, I don't know
if I can afford more than 35.

348
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,000
I understand. I guess I'd better get going.

349
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
It was nice meeting everybody.

350
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,100
- Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?
- Harder.

351
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
You got your 50 percent.

352
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,600
- And I get that in writing?
- By noon today.

353
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,000
You just bought yourself a champion.

354
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,900
You remember that.

355
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,200
- Snake, show him to his room.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,900
See you later, Mike.
Milos, my blue pinstripe.

357
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,000
So, what do you think?

358
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,600
He's obnoxious.

359
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,500
Yeah, he's perfect.

360
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,300
Very good. This make special <i>bonsai</i>.

361
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,800
You really see a <i>bonsai</i> in here?

362
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Where?

363
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,500
Inside.

364
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,900
Inside?

365
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,900
Hello, any <i>bonsai</i> in here?

366
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,000
Daniel-<i>san</i>, not inside. Inside you.

367
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,600
Same place your karate come from.

368
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
But my karate comes from you.

369
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,300
Only root karate come from Miyagi.

370
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,600
Just like <i>bonsai</i> choose own way grow.
Because the root is strong.

371
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,400
You choose own way.
Do karate same reason.

372
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,700
Yeah, but I do it your way.

373
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,500
One day you do own way.

374
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,000
Remember what you said before about
<i>bonsai</i> being free to grow as they choose?

375
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,200
All <i>bonsai</i> aren't free to choose.

376
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,100
We tell them how to grow
by using clippers and then the wire.

377
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,200
But, Daniel-<i>san</i>,
our <i>bonsai</i> not true <i>bonsai</i>.

378
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,800
True <i>bonsai</i> grow wild. Very rare.

379
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,300
You ever seen any?

380
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,000
Okinawa.

381
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,500
What about here?

382
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
I only know of one.

383
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,100
What did it do, immigrate?

384
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,100
With Miyagi.
Only thing Miyagi bring from Okinawa.

385
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,100
Where's the tree now?

386
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,300
There.

387
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,100
Devil's Caldron.

388
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,200
Devil's Caldron?

389
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,700
No can see <i>bonsai</i> from here.

390
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,500
Good place. Very safe. Nobody bother.

391
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
Why did you put it
in such a hard place to get to?

392
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,300
True original <i>bonsai</i>
worth many thousand dollar.

393
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,300
Come, time learn special
Miyagi-family <i>kata</i>.

394
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,800
Now you ready.

395
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,500
Like all <i>bonsai</i> found in tree,
all karate found in this <i>kata</i>.

396
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,100
Come, together we do <i>kata</i>.

397
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,800
Hi, Mr. Miyagi.

398
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
I brought this tree,
the one you were working on this morning.

399
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,200
I thought you might want
to give it another try.

400
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,100
Thank you.

401
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,300
A change of scenery
might bring what's inside outside.

402
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,700
- Where should I put it?
- Over here.

403
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Very good.

404
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,100
You've done a lot of work here.
This place is bigger than I thought.

405
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,700
- There's your charcoal.
- Thank you.

406
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,000
Perfect.

407
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,200
I hope you don't mind...

408
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,000
...but I opened that letter.

409
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,100
The one that came today
from the All Valley Tournament.

410
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
There's a new rule this year.

411
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
- Would you like to read about it?
- No.

412
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,500
That's okay because I got it memorised.
It says:

413
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
"Under the new rules...

414
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,400
"...the defending champion
only needs to fight in the final match."

415
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,900
Isn't that great?
That limits my fights to just one.

416
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,400
That's better
than what I had to put up with last year.

417
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,400
And let's face it, it's another year.

418
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,200
It's a year later.
I'm a lot more experienced.

419
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,700
So I think we should
seriously reconsider this.

420
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,900
- Right?
- Wrong!

421
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Wrong?

422
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Should consider get
new pot for <i>bonsai</i>.

423
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,000
I don't know what the big deal is.
I mean, what is your problem with this?

424
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,400
If karate used defend honour,
defend a life...

425
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,200
...karate means something.

426
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,400
If karate used defend plastic metal trophy...

427
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,700
...karate no mean nothing.

428
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,600
Understand?

429
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
I wish I did.

430
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Go find a nice pot for <i>bonsai</i> across street.

431
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,500
Here's your pen.

432
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,900
Before I forget.

433
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,200
And if you have a minute,
just in case you change your mind...

434
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,900
...here's the application.

435
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,100
Okay?

436
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,700
It's no rush.
I mean, it says at the bottom...

437
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,000
We have a couple of weeks
before we have to send it in.

438
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,400
I'm sorry if I made it seem
like we had to do it today.

439
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,000
We have some time.

440
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,800
Hello?

441
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Hi. Could you turn that off?

442
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
Sure.

443
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,700
Thanks.

444
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,300
Hang on, I'm almost finished.

445
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,500
That's okay.

446
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
It's okay. Take your time.

447
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,500
That's pretty cool.

448
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,900
Thanks.

449
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,100
So, what can I do for you?

450
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,500
Actually, I was looking to buy some pots.

451
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,700
Yeah, what size?

452
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,900
This would be good. Like this.

453
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,800
They're for <i>bonsai</i> trees.
We're opening a shop across the street.

454
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,000
Great. Welcome to the neighbourhood.

455
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,200
Thanks.

456
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,500
Yeah, I love <i>bonsai</i>.

457
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,000
They're so perfect, you know?

458
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,700
Maybe when we get our trees in
you could come visit the shop.

459
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,500
And meet my partner, too.

460
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
I haven't even really met you yet.

461
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,300
I'm sorry.

462
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,400
- Daniel LaRusso.
- Jessica Andrews. Hi.

463
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
Hi. Is that you in that...

464
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,900
Yep, that's me.

465
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,700
What happened to the guy
who lost his head?

466
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Elizabeth Anne Rooney happened to him.
The traitor.

467
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,400
The pots?

468
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,400
You know what we could do?

469
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,700
Could you put like a <i>bonsai</i> tree
on the side of the pot?

470
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,800
- It's sort of like our trademark.
- Like embossed?

471
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,700
Right on the side.
I'll draw a picture of it for you.

472
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
That would be great.

473
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,100
- Jessica, come on. I'm late, hurry up.
- Listen, I got to deal with this guy.

474
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,000
Thanks, I'll see you soon then.

475
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,500
How soon?

476
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,300
How soon? Well, I don't know.

477
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
- Busy tonight?
- No.

478
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,200
No?

479
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,800
Well, then I'll see you tonight.
If that's okay with you?

480
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,600
Okay. About 7:00?

481
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,700
Well, sure. 7:00 is good.

482
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,900
I just live right upstairs,
so go around the side, okay?

483
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
- I'll see you around the side, 7:00.
- Bye-bye.

484
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,300
Charles is going to get angry.
Open up the gate.

485
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
You found it, huh?

486
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,300
Thanks to you.

487
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,900
Thanks to me? I didn't do anything.

488
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,800
That looks great.

489
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,900
You find something?

490
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,100
Yeah. Yeah, actually I did.
I found a date.

491
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,300
You didn't send me over there
just to look at pots, did you?

492
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,900
Yeah, I knew it.

493
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,800
Did you sign it?

494
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
You didn't sign it.

495
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
No.

496
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,900
I understand your feelings on this.
But you have to understand mine.

497
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,500
This is the biggest thing
I've ever done in my life.

498
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,700
I'm proud of this title.
Why can't I defend it?

499
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,500
Daniel-<i>san</i>,
you no look answer Miyagi.

500
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:13,300
Just like a <i>bonsai</i> live inside the tree,
answer live inside of you.

501
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,800
The only thing living inside me right now
is a lot of confusion.

502
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,000
I have the chance
to be the champion again.

503
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,700
- All I have to do is put my signature to it.
- Or match to it.

504
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,000
A match to it?

505
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Then you watch confusion disappear
with the smoke.

506
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,100
"442nd."

507
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,100
What are you doing here?

508
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,500
- Forget something.
- What?

509
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,000
For shop. Bring good luck.

510
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,300
Well, I hope it brings good customers, too.

511
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,100
Daniel-<i>san</i> look good.

512
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,600
Thanks for the shirt. I love it, man.

513
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,000
What doing?

514
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,700
I've been thinking about what you said,
and I decided to take your advice.

515
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm going to let my confusion
go up in smoke.

516
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,000
I'm not entering the tournament.

517
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,300
I want my karate and your karate
to mean something.

518
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,200
Good decision, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

519
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,700
This way no more bruises.
Save money on Band-Aid.

520
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Get out of here.
They never laid a hand on me last year.

521
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,500
Just an elbow, a few feet.

522
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,200
I'll never forget that knee to the groin.
That was interesting.

523
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,500
I'll see you later, Mr. Miyagi.

524
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,500
So, you all set to go?

526
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,800
First I gotta tell you this.

527
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,100
After you hear this,
you just might change your mind.

528
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,000
What do you have, poison oak?

529
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,600
A boyfriend.

530
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,300
You see, he was in the headless picture.
You know, we broke up two months ago.

531
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,900
You mean Elizabeth Anne Rooney...

532
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
We were both a little dumb about it,
but we've been talking on the phone.

533
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,200
I don't know, we're gonna give it
another try when I go home.

534
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,900
- Where's home?
- Columbus. Ohio.

535
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,400
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
after Thanksgiving.

536
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,000
- I just didn't want to lead you on.
- No.

537
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,800
I did come on kind of strong.

538
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,200
No, don't worry about it. It's refreshing.
We could go Dutch.

539
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,700
That sounds great.

540
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,300
It's just that I've been here
for two months...

541
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,700
...with absolutely nothing to do
and I haven't even met any friends.

542
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Meet your first friend.

543
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,800
All right.

544
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,400
Yeah, this is wild.

545
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,400
Wait till he hears about this one.

546
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,600
Who?

547
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,100
Mr. Miyagi. He's my partner.
You wanna meet him?

548
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,300
Yeah, why not?

549
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,600
You are about to meet the greatest guy.

550
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,800
This guy, he's funny, he's smart.
You got a problem, he's got the answer.

551
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,500
He's like no one you'll ever meet.

552
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,900
On top of that,
he happens to be my best friend.

553
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,400
Why do you call him "mister"?

554
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,600
Mr. Miyagi.

555
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,400
Meet Jessica Andrews from
Columbus, Ohio, and across the street.

556
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
This is Mr. Miyagi
from Okinawa and Reseda.

557
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,500
- How do you do?
- Hi.

558
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
- Jessica's gonna make those pots for us.
- Very good.

559
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,500
- Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Thank you very much.

560
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,300
How's it going so far? Good?

561
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,600
I never know retirement
mean such hard work.

562
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,900
- You like to see inside shop?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

563
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,600
Partner show you around.
Don't forget lock up.

564
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,800
No, I won't.

565
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,900
- Good night. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

566
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,700
- I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

567
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,200
- You see why I call him "mister"?
- Yeah. He's nice.

568
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,200
He's the best. Come on in.

569
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,600
What's this?

570
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,000
That's Mr. Miyagi's.
He brought it for good luck.

571
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,200
What do you think?
It is going to be great.

572
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,000
- Yeah, it is.
- It needs a little work, but...

573
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,400
So where'd you meet him?

574
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,800
I met him when I moved out here.
He started teaching me karate.

575
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,100
Karate?

576
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,100
- You do karate?
- Yeah, I do.

577
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,400
He doesn't really look like
the karate-teacher type.

578
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,300
He doesn't act like it either.

579
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,200
Half the time he teaches me stuff,
I don't know what it is.

580
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,400
What do you mean?

581
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,100
It's like that vase
you were making this morning.

582
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,500
He'll make a whole karate lesson
out of that.

583
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,200
No, I'm not kidding.

584
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,900
Show me how you were making that...

585
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,200
- You go up and then you go down.
- Okay, now you do that.

586
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,700
Okay, go up.

587
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,100
Now, okay, right, see just like that.
Now go down.

588
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,600
Okay, now do that again. Go up.
I'm a mugger.

589
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,300
I'm gonna grab you,
now grab the back of my head.

590
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,500
Then pull down and bring your knee up.

591
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
Room for one more down there?

592
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,900
- What are you doing? We're not open.
- The door was.

593
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,600
I meant for business, pal.

594
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,300
I didn't come here for business.
Came here to talk to you.

595
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,100
We heard you weren't entering
the All Valley this year.

596
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Is that true, Daniel?

597
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
- Where'd you hear that?
- Is it true?

598
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,700
Yeah, that's true. So what?

599
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,400
- We'd like you to reconsider.
- Is that why you guys came down here?

600
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,600
- I need your title.
- Then enter the tournament and go for it.

601
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,100
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I need your title.

602
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,700
You don't enter
and that effects my financial future.

603
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,600
I won't let that happen. Get it?

604
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,200
I have nothing to prove.
I have no reason to fight.

605
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,000
I do. I got some money to make.
Give me the application.

606
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,900
Forget it. I'm not going to fight...

607
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,900
Sign it!

608
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,600
You sign it, man!

609
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,100
Come on, man! Right now!

610
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,300
Let's go, punk!

611
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Let LaRusso sleep on it.
Come on. Mike!

612
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,200
Yeah, you sleep on it.

613
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,800
And you can dream about me.

614
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,700
You slimeball.

615
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,600
Slimeball? That's cute.
Did your mother teach you that?

616
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,200
Come on, Mike.

617
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,900
You'll have to excuse him.
He's usually a very mellow guy.

618
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,500
See you later.

619
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,800
Do you know those creeps?

620
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,500
No.

621
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,300
And I wanna keep it that way.

622
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,700
Excuse me.

623
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,500
Mr. Miyagi?

624
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,700
My name is Terry Silver.

625
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,500
My master is Kim San Jang
of South Korea.

626
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,000
My teacher sends his respects.

627
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,000
John Kreese of the Cobra Kai <i>dojo</i>
was our school's number one student.

628
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,000
Word reached us in Korea
only two months ago...

629
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,600
...about what happened last year
at the tournament.

630
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,600
My teacher sends his apologies
for John Kreese's dishonourable actions.

631
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,600
Accept apology.

632
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,900
I was sent here
to help John regain balance.

633
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,000
Hope you can be successful.

634
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,900
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

635
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
I buried John last week.

636
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,700
He's dead? What happened?

637
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,500
His doctor said it was cardiac arrest,
but I knew John better than anyone.

638
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,000
Karate was his life.

639
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,000
And after he lost all his students,
it just broke his heart.

640
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,000
John was a hero.
He wasn't always like what you saw.

641
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,800
He saved my life in Vietnam.

642
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,100
War does something to a man.

643
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,900
You had to have been there
to know what I mean.

644
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,300
Have been.

645
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,900
Do know.

646
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,200
442nd?

647
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,400
Man!

648
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,300
More medals of honour
came out of the 442nd...

649
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,700
...than all World War II put together.

650
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,900
I bet you've been there.

651
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,100
Is this your student? The champion?

652
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,500
Yeah.

653
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,700
Our apologies to you, too.

654
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,000
John had vowed
to come and apologise himself.

655
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,800
He planned...

656
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,700
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to interrupt your training.

657
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,800
Mr. Silver...

658
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,400
...very sorry to hear about death of friend.

659
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,900
Me, too.

660
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,800
Thank you.

661
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,100
God, that's too bad.

662
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,300
Too bad, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

663
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,100
Come, we continue <i>kata</i>.

664
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,600
Hello?

665
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,300
- Eat yet?
- No, I haven't.

666
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,700
I was supposed to dine with my Aunt Pat.
She owns the shop.

667
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,700
She had to do some things, so I got stuck
with all this macaroni and cheese.

668
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,900
Macaroni and cheese?
You know what I like!

669
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I grew up on macaroni and cheese.

670
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,900
I never say no
when it comes to macaroni and cheese.

671
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,100
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

672
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,400
I used to eat this stuff by the ton.

673
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,300
I want you to try this, okay?
And be honest.

674
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,300
Okay.

675
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,300
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it as...

676
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,800
...eleven.

677
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,000
Let's eat. I'm starved.

678
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,200
I hope you like this.

679
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,600
I'm not sure if this is
exactly what you wanted, but...

680
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,700
Hey, this came out great.

681
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,400
- Look at the tree. You got it just right.
- Good.

682
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,700
- Wait until Mr. Miyagi sees it.
- Do you think he'll like it?

683
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,700
Like it? He's gonna love it. Here.

684
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,200
- I have something for you.
- For me?

685
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,300
What is this?

686
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,700
The Down Stairs? What is that?

687
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,000
It's a dance club. Yeah, it's great.
It's got live music.

688
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,800
It's for the night before you go back home.

689
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,600
I figured it would be
a nice going-away present.

690
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,100
Daniel, that is so sweet.

691
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,000
Come on, guys. This isn't funny anymore.
Come on, turn on the lights.

692
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,300
Danny, I hope you got some good news
for my friend Mike here.

693
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,100
- I hope so too, Daniel.
- I told you.

694
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,900
I can't help you. Forget about it.
Where are you going?

695
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,900
You haven't signed the application yet.

696
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,500
I'm not signing the application.
I won't compete.

697
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,400
Take your friends and get out of here.

698
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,700
Dennis, he didn't sign it yet.

699
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,100
Come on, guys.
This is getting out of hand now.

700
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,000
- I'm not signing the application.
- Sure you are.

701
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,800
I'm not going to be there.
You're wasting your time.

702
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,500
- Take off, all right?
- You take off!

703
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,400
- Come on, Dennis, take him out!
- Put his eye out!

704
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,300
Come on!

705
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,100
Come on, punk!
Let's see what you've got!

706
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,700
Nice kick. Not bad.

707
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,000
Better. Good, but not good enough.

708
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,000
Come on, get up!

709
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Why are you being so stubborn?

710
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,700
Don't do that!

711
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,900
I am running out of patience.
Now sign it and let's get on with it.

712
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,000
Stop it!

713
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,500
It's your ass!

714
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,600
Just get out of here!

715
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,100
- Save it for the tournament!
- Nail him!

716
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,500
Mike, come on, let's get out of here!

717
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,200
Come on, old man!

718
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,300
Mike, let's go!

719
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,600
Let's go! You wimp!

720
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,900
I'll be back, LaRusso.
I'm gonna get you.

721
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
You're finished!

722
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,400
You can't watch him forever, Buddha-head.

723
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,300
So, Daniel-<i>san</i>, time take Jessica home.

724
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,000
Yeah. Jessica, you all right?

725
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,300
Yeah. I just want to lie down.

726
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,000
I can't believe you're singing.

727
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Forget it.

728
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,200
Feel lucky, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

729
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Lucky? How could you feel lucky?

730
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,000
Feel lucky. <i>Bonsai</i> tree not in shop.
Safe at home.

731
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,500
That makes us real lucky.
I never felt luckier in my life.

732
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,200
Daniel-<i>san</i>, we can rebuild the shop.

733
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,300
Cannot rebuild stock.

734
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,300
We sell a few trees, fix <i>shoji</i> screen,
start over again.

735
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,600
What if those guys come back again?
What are we going to do then?

736
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,100
If they come back,
what are we going to do?

737
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,900
Just tell me,
what do we do if they come back?

738
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,100
Sing happy song.

739
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,700
Where are the trees?
Where'd you put the trees?

740
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,400
They stole them!

741
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,600
I can't believe it. They stole the trees.
Don't they get it?

742
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,400
I'm not going to sign this thing.
Mr. Miyagi, what are we going to do?

743
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,500
- Where are you going?
- Get fishing pole.

744
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,900
What?

745
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,400
Sometimes I don't get you.

746
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,000
The shop's wrecked. We've just been
robbed, and you're going fishing.

747
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,200
We're flat broke and you're going fishing.

748
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,500
You're just going to fluff it off?
Doesn't this even bother you?

749
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:13,700
Daniel-<i>san</i>, sometime better be bothered
on full stomach than empty one.

750
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,500
Great, another great thought, huh?
That really does me good.

751
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,300
You go fishing.
I'm going to the police to report it.

752
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,200
Show them the application
so they can arrest these jerks.

753
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,400
This is the '80s,
you gotta do something, Mr. Miyagi.

754
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,800
You can't be so damn passive.

755
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,400
Somebody's gotta do something
about these guys.

756
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,500
I bring the tournament application
to the police station.

757
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
As I walk in, they start laughing at me.

758
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,300
Finally the sergeant said,
"Son, we'll look into it."

759
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,900
We'll see. I hope.

760
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,800
I still think you should ask Mr. Miyagi
before going after his tree.

761
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,700
He wouldn't have hidden it
in the middle of nowhere...

762
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
...if he wanted people to dig it up.
- I don't have a choice.

763
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,300
If he doesn't sell this tree
we're looking for...

764
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,200
...he loses his business. He's broke.

765
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,400
His social security can barely cover
the expenses on his rowboat.

766
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,800
This tree is like money in the bank.

767
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,100
Great. So now we're robbing a bank.

768
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,300
How much do you think
this thing is worth?

769
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,000
I found out these original <i>bonsai</i> trees
start at $10,000.

770
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,200
- Seriously?
- See, that's why it is so important to me.

771
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,000
This one tree can set Mr. Miyagi up for life.
That's the least I could do for him.

772
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,800
It's a long way down there.

773
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,800
- You know what I think?
- What?

774
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:58,000
I think when the tide comes in,
the ocean fills up the bottom down there.

775
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah, Mr. Miyagi sure knows
how to pick 'em.

776
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,400
Yeah, no kidding.

777
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,700
How are we supposed to find
Mr. Miyagi's tiny little tree in all this?

778
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,700
He told me he put it halfway down
the steepest cliff...

779
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,300
...where it would catch
the first rays of the sun.

780
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,300
Good luck. We're never gonna find it.

781
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,000
- Wait! That must be it! I found it!
- Are you sure?

782
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,000
God, it's beautiful.
It's like the one on the back of my <i>gi</i>.

783
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,700
Come on, let me see.

784
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,500
You see that ridge, where the sun hits...

785
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,000
It's just like the one on the pot I made.

786
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,300
How are we going to get
all the way down there?

787
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,700
You leave that to me. I'll teach you.
Come on. We gotta go get the ropes.

788
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,300
- You sure you understand everything?
- Yeah, I got it.

789
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,400
I feed this through here
and I hold this back here and I pray to God.

790
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:50,100
Okay. Now, are you sure
you want to do this?

791
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,700
I wanna do this?

792
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,400
- I gotta do it. I'll be okay.
- You got it. You'll be fine.

793
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,500
Remember, the rope is your friend.
Everything will be great.

794
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,800
Friend? This rope's more than my friend.

795
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,300
I love this rope.
This rope and I are going steady.

796
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,100
Right, rope? Just you and me, rope.

797
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,000
Just lean. Okay, you got it. Don't worry.

798
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,700
Just sit back. Just lean back. You got it.

799
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,800
This is almost fun.

800
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,800
I'm coming, okay? Just keep going.

801
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,300
This isn't so hard.
You're a pretty good teacher.

802
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,600
Thanks.

803
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,300
Daniel! Look out! I got you, okay?

804
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,300
- I'm coming! Daniel, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

805
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,100
Hold on! Don't move, I'm coming.
Stay there.

806
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,700
Okay, I got you. I got you.
Put both hands on the rope.

807
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,800
Put your feet against the rocks
and push out. I got you.

808
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,300
Push out! There you go!
All right, I got you.

809
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,800
Okay, now guide your rope.
Slide your hands to the brake.

810
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,900
To the brake. Right here. All right?

811
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,100
You okay?
Listen, I'm so sorry about the rock.

812
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,300
- You sure you're okay?
- No, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

813
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,100
God, it's a lot steeper
than it looks from up there, huh?

814
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,900
- You've done this kinda stuff before, right?
- Yeah, but not from this high up.

815
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,100
Great!

816
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,400
Maybe we should go back.
Do you want to?

817
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,700
No, I gotta keep going.
I don't have a choice.

818
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,900
Well, just be careful, okay?
Watch your footing, there you go.

819
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,500
All right. God, you scared me.

820
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,100
I scared you?

821
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,500
- You can get killed doing this.
- Just think positive.

822
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,600
- How are we going to get back up there?
- Don't worry about it.

823
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,300
You're right. I got enough to worry about.

824
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,100
- What?
- Where's the tree?

825
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,700
It's right there, between the two ropes.

826
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,400
Come on.

827
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,700
It's a beautiful tree.

828
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,700
Mr. Miyagi must have looked like
Spider-Man coming down here, huh?

829
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,200
Yeah, no kidding.

830
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,300
Now, remember how I told you to lock off.

831
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,700
Take the rope
and you put it around your butt.

832
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,100
And you tie it around your leg.
Okay, get it?

833
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,200
- There you go. I got it!
- There you go. You got it.

834
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,000
- All right.
- Now you can use both your hands.

835
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,300
All right.

836
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,800
So he really planted this here, huh?

837
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,600
What, this tree? He brought this
all the way back from Okinawa.

838
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,600
What if he tells you to put it back?

839
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,400
What if he does?

840
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,000
He's not going to tell me to put it back.
Believe me, I know this guy.

841
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,000
That <i>bonsai</i> shop
was his dream come true.

842
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,900
- He won't have me put it back.
- I don't think we should be doing this.

843
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I saw his face when he lost his job.
Believe me, I know what I'm doing.

844
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,600
But what about the tree?
Isn't it going to die?

845
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,500
The tree will be fine. The most important
thing is to pack the roots well.

846
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,700
Believe me, he's taught me everything
about these trees.

847
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,800
- Do you want me to take this for you?
- No, I got it.

848
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,400
All I need is a bag to pack the roots in.

849
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,600
- Daniel! Help me up!
- Hang on!

850
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,500
Don't let go! Grab the rope!
Are you okay?

851
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,900
I got it!

852
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,200
Oh, my God! The tree's in the water!
I gotta get it!

853
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,300
It's gonna get washed out!

854
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,100
Move! Hurry up!

855
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,100
Get out of the way!

856
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,100
I gotta get it!
It's gonna get washed out!

857
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,000
The rope! Hurry!
Get the canteen, quick!

858
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,500
We gotta wash the roots off.
The salt water will kill them!

859
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,200
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Mr. Miyagi will know what to do.

860
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,300
- Just move it!
- I got the canteen. It's ready.

861
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
We gotta get out of here!
The tide's coming in!

862
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,500
Wash the roots off. Be careful.

863
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,600
All right, let me have it.

864
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,300
- It's soaked.
- You did good. Put it right in there.

865
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,000
Little fella,
I'll have you home in no time.

866
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,700
No big breaks. We're in good shape.

867
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,000
- I just should have tied off better.
- It's not your fault.

868
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,100
Look, it was my idea to...

869
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,300
The ropes.

870
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,700
LaRusso! How you doing?

871
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,300
Heads up, Danny-boy.

872
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,100
Here's something you forgot.

873
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,300
How'd they get here?

874
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,200
- Hey, this isn't a joke anymore.
- I know.

875
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,900
So let the ropes down.

876
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,200
First sign the application.

877
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,200
First sign the application.

878
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,100
Screw you, man!

879
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,200
See, I think you got it backwards,
buddy-boy.

880
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,600
I'm not the one who's screwed here.

881
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,000
Now I figure the tide's gonna come
in about 12 minutes.

882
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,600
Hope you brought a life raft.

883
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,200
How do we get out of here without a rope?

884
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,700
- Without a rope, we're dead.
- We're dead. Yeah, well, this guy's dead.

885
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,100
You're dead. You want me to sign it?
Fine, I'll sign it.

886
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,900
We'll get in the ring
and we'll see who's laughing then.

887
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,400
We'll see who's smiling.
You're gonna be dead meat.

888
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,800
I hate this guy.

889
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,200
Here. I signed it.

890
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,000
You want it? You work for it.
You pull us up!

891
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,600
All right! We'll send them down.

892
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,100
Let them go.

893
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,100
I never learn.

894
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,700
I should have just signed
the damn thing in the first place.

895
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,100
I should have signed it
and gotten it over with.

896
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,000
You didn't know this would happen.

897
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,100
With this guy, I should have known.

898
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,500
I should have known with that guy.

899
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,600
I should have just signed the damn thing.

900
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,300
We wouldn't be stuck down here.
The tree would be safe.

901
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm just such a jackass.
Come on, get us out of here!

902
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,800
Come on, pull!

903
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,300
All right, I got you.

904
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,100
You're one heavy wimp, Daniel.

905
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,900
Come on, don't stop. Keep pulling!

906
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,400
- What are you doing?
- Pull us up.

907
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,600
Leave him there. Get the application.

908
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,400
No, you get the application
when I get up there.

909
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,700
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

910
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,500
All right, here. Just hold us.

911
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,400
- Go get it.
- Here, take it.

912
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,400
Check it out.

913
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,800
It's cool.

914
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,200
That's it.

915
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,900
Don't even think about backing out, man...

916
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,900
...because then I'll really be pissed.

917
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,600
And this, well,
this'll all seem like a happy memory...

918
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,600
...compared to what I'd do to you.

919
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,600
And what we'd all do to her.

920
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,300
Now you're talking.

921
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,400
- Hey!
- Come on! Pull us up!

922
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,900
What, Tarzan?

923
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,400
Pull us up!

924
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:44,200
- What will you give me?
- I gave you the application.

925
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,200
Yeah, the stakes just went up.

926
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,300
- Give me the tree.
- Daniel, don't!

927
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,200
- No!
- Shut up!

928
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,100
All right.

929
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Just hold us. Don't let go.

930
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,300
Here. Now please be careful with it.

931
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,200
- Please, be careful.
- I will be.

932
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,600
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I'm gonna plant it down there!

933
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,700
- No!
- No, don't, please.

934
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,300
All right, enough. Give me it.

935
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,600
- You want it?
- Just don't throw it over.

936
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
Be careful with it, please.

937
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,900
Daniel...

938
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,400
...make a wish.

939
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,700
No!

940
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,000
Mr. Miyagi?

941
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,500
Daniel-<i>san</i>.

942
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,000
The trunk's split. See?

943
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:50,000
I put the roots in peat moss,
but they got salt water on them...

944
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,400
...and I washed it.

945
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,700
Will you be able to save it?
I didn't mean for this to happen.

946
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,800
I'm sorry.

947
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,200
I just figured maybe we could sell it...

948
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,900
...so we wouldn't have to close.

949
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,900
I didn't want it to be my fault
your dream didn't come true.

950
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,700
Whoever bought it would take good care.

951
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,400
Even better care than yourself.

952
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,800
- Tape. A wide one.
- That's so stupid.

953
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,900
How can someone take care of it
better than where you left it?

954
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,800
- I didn't mean for this to happen.
- Hold.

955
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,800
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
- Miyagi forgive you.

956
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,100
You do? I'm such an idiot.

957
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,500
- Is it gonna be okay?
- Depends.

958
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,000
If roots strong, tree survive.

959
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
Where do you want these <i>bonsai</i> trees?

960
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,400
Over there on rack, okay. Thank you.

961
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
- Trees?
- Peat moss.

962
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,200
Trees? What? What did you do?

963
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,200
Did you buy these?

964
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,000
With what?

965
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,200
Sell truck.

966
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,400
You sold the truck?

967
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,900
Well, why didn't you tell me
that's what you were going to do?

968
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,100
I wake up this morning, you gone.

969
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,000
Damn it!

970
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,900
Why am I so stupid?

971
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,000
No worry, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

972
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,800
Everything work out.
Everything okay now.

973
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,700
Mr. Miyagi,
I signed to fight in the tournament.

974
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,800
Why?

975
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,600
I don't know why.
Because I'm not you, that's why.

976
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,500
I don't always have the right answers.

977
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,800
We were at the bottom.
They pulled the ropes up.

978
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,200
I made a decision on the spot.

979
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,600
It was the wrong one.
What else was I supposed to do?

980
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,100
Understand.

981
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,800
You do?

982
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,700
Listen, Mr. Miyagi,
I gotta be honest with you.

983
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,700
I don't stand a chance against this guy
unless you train me.

984
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,800
Understand.

985
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,400
Well then, you'll train me, right?

986
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,500
Daniel-<i>san</i>, Miyagi always train you.

987
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,400
But for tournament, cannot.

988
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,000
Cannot?

989
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,200
Cannot? What?
What do you mean, cannot?

990
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,700
Mr. Miyagi, why not?

991
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,600
You know what the worst thing was:

992
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,600
When he told me he wouldn't train me
for the tournament.

993
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,800
- Then I knew I was dead.
- What a drag.

994
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,200
Great, let me get some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

995
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,600
- You can't swallow.
- I won't.

996
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,900
You can't keep stopping like this.
You gotta build up your wind.

997
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,100
So bonehead can knock more out of me?

998
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,500
You gotta have more confidence.

999
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,200
- Remember you are the champion.
- Yeah, I'd like to forget it.

1000
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,600
Jessica, this is...

1001
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,100
Hi, there.

1002
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,100
- Sorry, what's your name?
- Terry Silver.

1003
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,300
Terry Silver, this is Jessica Andrews.

1004
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,200
- You training for the Olympics?
- No, it's a tournament.

1005
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,600
The one you won last year?
What's it called?

1006
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,800
The All Valley.

1007
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,800
Right. Good for you.
A champion should defend his title.

1008
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,100
John Kreese told me you had a lot of heart.

1009
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,400
Listen, do you know how to front sweep?

1010
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,000
- Not really.
- Learn.

1011
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,800
Most tournament guys
are suckers for the front sweep.

1012
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,400
You can catch them every time.
Ask your Mr. Miyagi. He'll show you.

1013
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,300
I'm kind of training for this one myself.

1014
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,600
That's too bad.

1015
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,300
I got a good book on sweep techniques.
I'll drop it off for you sometime.

1016
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,500
Great.

1017
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,500
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Take care of our champion.

1018
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,700
All right, I will. 'Bye.

1019
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,500
That was a nice offer about the book.
Come on, you ready?

1020
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
- Let's go. Yes.
- No, I'm pooped.

1021
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,500
- All right, here I come.
- Come on. You're gorgeous. Hurry.

1022
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,300
- Okay, I'm running.
- You gotta get some muscle.

1023
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,900
Oh, man.

1024
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,400
Get out of here! I signed it!

1025
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,100
- Why'd you call the cops?
- Why'd you steal the trees?

1026
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,500
You have no proof.

1027
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,200
Who left the application, the tooth fairy?

1028
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,500
It's your ass, man!

1029
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,700
There's nothing you've got
that I can't counter.

1030
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,700
- Your karate's a joke.
- Let him up, punk!

1031
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,100
- Who are you, his mother?
- Maybe.

1032
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,500
Get up! Get up!

1033
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,900
You see this? You see it?

1034
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,000
Get your hands off me!

1035
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,700
If I see you even on the same street
as this kid...

1036
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,900
...I won't be so charitable with your health.

1037
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,200
- Understand?
- Yes!

1038
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,400
Get the hell out of here.

1039
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,800
Who is that guy?

1040
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:32,500
- That's the lunatic who wants my title.
- Come on.

1041
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,000
- I was hoping you would kill him.
- That's not what karate's about.

1042
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,000
- It's for defence.
- I know, you're right.

1043
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,600
- Here's your book.
- I brought that for you.

1044
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,200
Right. Thanks.

1045
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,800
There's only so much
you can learn from a book.

1046
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,300
You're telling me.

1047
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,500
Come on, stand up.
Let me show you a couple of moves.

1048
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,300
Help you deal with punks like that.
Make a strong stance.

1049
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:56,900
Back leg up a little more.
Okay, now sweep me.

1050
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,100
- Well, what do you mean, like that?
- I'm not made of glass. Do it right.

1051
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,000
Better.

1052
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:07,000
Now a little higher
and at the end twist your hip.

1053
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,200
Keep your hand up.

1054
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:13,900
Are you okay?

1055
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,500
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
- That's good.

1056
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,400
That's a strong move.

1057
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,100
Everyone needs a teacher, Daniel.

1058
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,700
I'm opening the Cobra Kai <i>dojo</i> again.
It's time to set things straight.

1059
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,800
Anytime you want to train,
I'll be there for you. No strings attached.

1060
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,700
Thanks. I appreciate that, but...
Listen, thanks for helping me out.

1061
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,300
It's my pleasure.
All right, I'll see you around.

1062
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,800
I'll see you.

1063
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,400
Thanks again.

1064
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,800
- Hi, Jessica.
- Hi, Daniel.

1065
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,300
Hey. Mr. Miyagi.

1066
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,500
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1067
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,400
- Look, Jessica make. Beautiful. You like?
- I stayed up all night firing them.

1068
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,500
I saw one the other night. They're great.
Listen, I have a favour to ask of you.

1069
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,400
I just want to ask you,
do you know how to sweep?

1070
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,200
Of course.

1071
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:21,200
Would you mind showing me?
I'm not asking you to train me.

1072
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,300
I don't want you to train me. One thing.

1073
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,500
I'd be so appreciative.
All you have to give me is one thing.

1074
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,600
That's it. Please, you gotta do it. Be a pal.

1075
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,100
You wait here. I be right back.

1076
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,200
Where you going?

1077
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,400
Just wait here.

1078
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,600
This is great.
Mr. Miyagi will teach me front sweeps.

1079
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,600
I found out from this guy, tournament guys
are suckers for front sweeps.

1080
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,000
- Really?
- I mean, if I get that down, man, I'm...

1081
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,100
Daniel-<i>san</i>, you hold like this.
First, left sweep...

1082
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,900
It's no joke, all right?

1083
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,600
You don't want to show me,
you don't show me.

1084
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,400
Just don't make fun of me, all right?

1085
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,100
I'm sorry for asking.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

1086
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,400
- Hey.
- Hi, that was great, man.

1087
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,200
- How you doing?
- Good.

1088
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,200
- Just trying to work the rust out.
- Listen, I gave your offer some thought.

1089
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,300
And?

1090
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,300
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to take you up on it.

1091
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,800
I mean,
you know, just on a short-term basis.

1092
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,800
Trouble, are you kidding?
lt'd be an honour.

1093
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,400
How does Mr. Miyagi feel about it?

1094
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,700
Well, Mr. Miyagi...

1095
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,800
...doesn't need to know about it, if...

1096
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,700
- But he knows you're competing?
- He knows that.

1097
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,600
He just doesn't approve.

1098
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,300
Everybody has a right to his opinion.

1099
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,300
- Look, I won't say anything.
- Thanks.

1100
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,500
So, when do you want to start?

1101
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,500
No, I mean, that's up to you.
Whenever it's...

1102
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,300
I got a <i>gi</i> hanging in the closet.
I think it'll fit.

1103
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,600
What do you say we go right now?

1104
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,800
Now?

1105
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,600
One more.

1106
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,500
Good. Catch your breath.
Come on over here.

1107
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,900
You're better than I thought.

1108
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,800
You're ready to move on, Mr. LaRusso.

1109
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,600
You're ready to move on.

1110
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,300
There are three things
that make a champion.

1111
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,800
The three "D"s:
Desire, devotion and discipline.

1112
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,700
The first two I can't give you.

1113
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,900
The last one I can,
but you have to be willing to receive it.

1114
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,800
Are you, Mr. LaRusso?

1115
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,700
Sure.

1116
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,300
The response you're looking for is,
"Yes, sir."

1117
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,800
- Right. Yes, sir. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Stand up straight.

1118
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:28,400
Now, over the years I've developed
a system of intensive short-term training...

1119
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
...for situations just like this.

1120
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,800
It comes in two parts and has three rules.

1121
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,700
- I call it "Quick Silver."
- That's good.

1122
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,600
You like that, huh?

1123
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,900
Rule Number One:

1124
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,500
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1125
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,900
Repeat it.

1126
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,200
A man can't stand, he can't fight.

1127
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,400
With conviction, Mr. LaRusso.

1128
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,500
- A man can't stand, he can't fight.
- Good. All right.

1129
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:59,300
Imagine these two-by-fours are legs.
Sweep them.

1130
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,200
What are you...

1131
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,900
That's too low.

1132
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,100
Any higher it'd be like hitting the knee.
Right?

1133
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,400
Did you come here
to teach or to be taught?

1134
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,800
We're not sweeping floors here. Harder.

1135
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,800
Come on, put your hip into it.
That's where the power is.

1136
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,900
That's it. Harder.

1137
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,700
Harder.

1138
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,300
"Ow" is not an acceptable <i>kiai</i> in this <i>dojo</i>,
Mr. LaRusso.

1139
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:57,100
Isn't this a little bit extreme, sir?
I mean, come on.

1140
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,300
Extreme situations
require extreme measures.

1141
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,600
Now, you come back tomorrow.
We'll start again.

1142
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,800
You did good for your first day.

1143
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,400
Thanks.

1144
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
I really appreciate all your help.

1145
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,000
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

1146
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,000
Who is it?

1147
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,400
Why don't you come in?

1148
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,200
Just catching up on some sit-ups here.

1149
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,500
You know, it's not easy
when you're training yourself.

1150
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,200
What happened foot?

1151
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,600
What foot?

1152
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,900
Look at that!

1153
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,200
I don't know.

1154
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,700
Maybe I banged it in my sleep.
I don't remember.

1155
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,600
- What's that?
- You soak foot.

1156
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,600
Be better tomorrow.

1157
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,800
- You got a new foot in there for me?
- No. Next best thing. New foot powder.

1158
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,600
Smells like old foot powder.
What's in there?

1159
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,400
Better you don't know. Give me foot.

1160
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,400
- It's hot!
- Hot, hot...

1161
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,000
Good.

1162
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,000
Maybe tomorrow
you remember what happened foot?

1163
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,700
Then you tell Miyagi.

1164
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,200
Tomorrow? No.

1165
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:40,300
I have so many things to do tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I'm busy.

1166
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:46,400
Tomorrow is a bad day.
In the morning, I'm supposed to...

1167
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,300
In the afternoon, I'm meeting with
a buddy of mine I haven't seen since...

1168
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,500
...we got back, you know, from Okinawa.

1169
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,600
What am I doing?

1170
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,100
What am I doing?

1171
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,200
Hope confusion end soon.

1172
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,200
Miyagi heart empty without you.

1173
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,200
The bruise on your foot is gone.
That's good. You're a fast healer.

1174
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:58,000
All right, let's go.

1175
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,500
That's a nice move.
Mr. Miyagi teach you that?

1176
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,000
- No.
- I didn't think so.

1177
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,400
- What was the last thing he taught you?
- We did <i>kata</i>.

1178
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,300
- <i>Kata</i>?
- Yeah.

1179
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,900
<i>Kata</i> is good for working up a sweat.
It won't win the tournament.

1180
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,100
Come on over here. Hold the bag.

1181
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,200
Rule Number Two
of the "Quick Silver" method:

1182
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,900
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.

1183
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,500
Now, imagine this is the enemy.

1184
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,500
These are his ribs, behind them his lungs.

1185
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,400
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1186
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,200
Good. You try it.

1187
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,600
Wait a minute. Let's do it over here.

1188
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,000
- Where?
- Right here, his ribs.

1189
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:43,600
Lay into him.

1190
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,200
Why do I have to do this with this thing?

1191
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,700
Because it's part of the training.

1192
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,600
Because I'm teaching you
techniques you don't have.

1193
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,100
Techniques you need
to win the tournament.

1194
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,200
What, do you think you can rely
on that crane crap?

1195
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,700
I did pretty well with it last time.

1196
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,600
Wake up and smell the coffee.

1197
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,500
Last time you weren't fighting this.

1198
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,000
You don't get it, do you?

1199
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,000
If you want to lose because of a little pain,
I can't be a part of that.

1200
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,900
I make wimps into winners,
not the other way around.

1201
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,100
Christ, I'm wasting my time.

1202
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,500
Yeah?

1203
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,600
Damn it! Can you come back later?

1204
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,000
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1205
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,300
Doing what?

1206
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,300
What you doing.

1207
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,500
Because...

1208
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:25,800
...extreme situations
require extreme measures, okay?

1209
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,000
That not sound like you talking.

1210
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,700
It is me talking, all right?

1211
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:36,900
I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but I got problems...

1212
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,500
...and if you won't be part of the solution,
don't give me a hard time.

1213
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,200
Okay? You got it?

1214
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:17,900
What are you wasting your time
with <i>kata</i> for?

1215
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,700
Didn't I tell you
it's useless in a tournament?

1216
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,600
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir. You're right. I'm sorry.

1217
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,200
All right. Come over here.

1218
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:30,400
Let's get back to learning something
that can do some real damage.

1219
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,600
Rule Number Three:

1220
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,200
A man can't see, he can't fight.

1221
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,900
If you hit him square in the nose...

1222
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:41,500
...he'll be blinded by his tears
and choke on his own blood.

1223
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,300
Here's how it works.

1224
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,300
You wait until your man is attacking
and when he's close enough...

1225
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,300
But that would be face contact.
I'd be disqualified.

1226
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,500
- He ran into your fist, not your fault, right?
- Right.

1227
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,500
He can't continue. That means you win.

1228
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,300
- You like that?
- I like that.

1229
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,100
Good. Give it a shot.

1230
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,600
Let's try it over here on your friend.

1231
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,400
Reverse punch.

1232
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,500
Visualise.

1233
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,900
This isn't a bunch of sticks
and pipes anymore.

1234
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This is a living fighting machine
that wants to detach...

1235
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:25,000
...your head from the rest of your body!

1236
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,300
It's blood. So what?

1237
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,800
Make believe it's his.
This guy wants to break you.

1238
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,300
Humiliate you. Stomp you into the ground.
What are you going to do about it?

1239
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,700
- Gonna nail him!
- Then do it.

1240
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:50,300
- Yes! You did it!
- I did it, man!

1241
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,200
You nailed him!

1242
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,300
- You're ready!
- I'm ready!

1243
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,100
- What new teacher?
- The guy who's been training me.

1244
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,200
You met him. We were jogging
and he pulled up in the car.

1245
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,000
I know who you are talking about.

1246
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,000
He's teaching me stuff
I thought I'd never be able to do.

1247
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,300
- That's what you said about Mr. Miyagi.
- But this guy's different.

1248
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,900
- How do you mean "different"?
- I'll show you sometime.

1249
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
- Come on, let's rock 'n' roll.
- All right, let's do it.

1250
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,700
What are you looking at?

1251
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,500
What are you doing
looking at other guys like that for?

1252
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,200
I don't play that.

1253
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,200
- I got some nerve?
- You got some nerve...

1254
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,000
What about you?

1255
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,800
- No, you get...
- Get out of my way, white boy!

1256
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,900
If I don't get something to drink,
I'm gonna die.

1257
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,100
Tell me. I could drink a horse.

1258
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,900
- Mr. Silver, what are you doing here?
- You told me you'd be here, remember?

1259
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,400
- Hold up, sexy lady.
- Who's your friend?

1260
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,800
- I've been watching you and you are hot.
- She's with me, man.

1261
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,800
- Says who?
- Says me.

1262
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,200
I'm taking her home.

1263
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,900
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

1264
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,400
What, are you nuts?

1265
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,500
Come on. We gotta get out of here!

1266
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,000
Up you go.

1267
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:43,300
- What happened?
- He broke my nose, man.

1268
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:45,400
Where's that guy with my money?

1269
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,800
Get out of the way!

1270
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,100
Man, that was beautiful.
You didn't even think.

1271
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,400
Something got in your way, bang!
Down it went!

1272
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,000
I gotta go back in there.

1273
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,000
- What are you saying?
- I gotta check that guy out.

1274
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,800
Technique and killer instinct.
You got it all now, kid.

1275
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,200
- No, I gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?

1276
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,700
What's wrong? You did the right thing.
You had no choice.

1277
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,300
Who is it?

1278
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,300
It's me, it's Daniel.

1279
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:23,700
What do you want?

1280
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,500
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm busy.

1281
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,800
Just give me a minute. Please.

1282
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,100
I want to apologise for tonight.
It shouldn't have happened.

1283
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,000
You should tell that to the guy
whose nose you broke.

1284
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,100
I am. I will.

1285
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,900
I just didn't want you leaving
thinking that was me.

1286
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,500
It wasn't you?

1287
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,200
Then who was it? Conan the Barbarian?

1288
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,400
I've been trying to be someone I'm not
and it's not working.

1289
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,400
I feel like I'm losing control of everything.

1290
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:58,000
The only thing I see you losing control of
is your temper.

1291
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,800
Well, and your friendship
and Mr. Miyagi's trust.

1292
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,100
I've lost everything.
I don't know what to do.

1293
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,600
I've wrecked everything with Mr. Miyagi.

1294
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,600
I know he's written me off.
And I can't blame him. I don't blame him.

1295
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,400
I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.

1296
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,800
Nobody's written you off.

1297
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:31,000
Just because I got upset
doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore.

1298
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,500
Mr. Miyagi, he loves you.
He has faith in you. He told me that.

1299
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,600
Let's see how much faith he has
when he hears about what I did tonight.

1300
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:44,300
- I think he should hear it from you first.
- It's too late. I blew it. It's blown.

1301
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:47,100
You're gonna blow,
unless you do something about it now.

1302
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,100
I know, you're right. It's easy to say.
It's just, I don't know if I could face him.

1303
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,500
You'll do fine.

1304
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,800
You just gotta do it.

1305
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,400
Well, I don't know if I can.

1306
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,700
I'm gonna miss you.

1307
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,900
Send me a Christmas card, okay?

1308
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,700
You got a deal.

1309
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,200
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1310
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:35,300
Thanks.

1311
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,300
Anytime.

1312
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,800
I just told the other nurse
that I don't know his name.

1313
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,600
I'm the guy who broke his nose.
I need to talk to him.

1314
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:50,600
I need to tell him I'm sorry
and that I want to pay for it.

1315
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:53,400
Please, let me speak with him.

1316
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,200
No, I can't wait until tomorrow, all right.
I gotta talk to him now, damn it!

1317
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:03,300
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
I don't mean to be rude, I'm...

1318
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,500
Hello, miss?

1319
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,200
Look at this.

1320
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:16,800
Look at my sweatshirt.
I got some poor guy's blood all over me.

1321
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,500
Everything you taught me,
I did the opposite.

1322
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,600
I couldn't have been worse.
I did everything wrong.

1323
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,100
I just feel like your tree.
You know, the one that I wrecked.

1324
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,900
I feel just like that.
I feel like I'm falling apart.

1325
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,400
Miyagi show you something.

1326
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,100
I feel like the whole world
is coming down on me.

1327
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,100
It's all my fault. I did it myself.

1328
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,700
Everything can heal. Just take time.

1329
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,100
Take patience.

1330
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:46,200
I'm sorry. When I started out
I never meant for it to end the way it did.

1331
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,900
Sometime when take trip,
better know where trip end.

1332
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,700
Otherwise better just stay home.

1333
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,700
It's budding.

1334
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,300
Look at that, it's gonna make it.

1335
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,800
Make it because have strong root.

1336
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,000
Just like you, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

1337
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,300
Inside you have strong root.

1338
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
No need nothing
except what inside you to grow.

1339
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,300
Understand?

1340
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,700
I do understand.

1341
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,500
You're right.

1342
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,800
I gotta go. I'll be right back.
I'll just be a little while.

1343
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:37,100
Where going?

1344
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:41,100
You remember that guy, Terry Silver?
He's the one that's been training me.

1345
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:44,200
He meant well,
but I want to tell him it's over.

1346
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:49,300
- It not wait for tomorrow?
- I'll feel better if I get it over with now.

1347
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,100
You like Miyagi come help you?

1348
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:55,200
No, I did it myself.
I'll get out of it myself, all right?

1349
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,600
I'll be back in a little while.

1350
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:15,900
Hello.

1351
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,500
Mr. Silver?

1352
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,900
Hello?

1353
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,200
Hello?

1354
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:40,900
Mr. Silver?

1355
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,900
Hey.

1356
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,800
- Hi.
- Here you are.

1357
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:50,300
- Where'd you go?
- I had to go think about some things.

1358
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,100
- And...
- And?

1359
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,000
And I've...
Listen, I've decided not to defend my title.

1360
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,500
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

1361
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,000
I mean, you've been great. I just...

1362
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,700
You know, when I hit that guy,
that's just not me.

1363
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:08,700
I just wanted to come here
and tell you in person...

1364
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,900
...'cause I figured after everything,
I owed you at least that.

1365
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,100
You owe me a lot more than that,
Danny-boy.

1366
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,000
I'm sorry.
I thought the lessons were free, but...

1367
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,200
No. Nothing's for free.

1368
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,900
You are going to defend.

1369
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,400
You're getting in that ring.

1370
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,000
Excuse me, Mr. Silver...

1371
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,200
...you can't make me do something
I don't want to do.

1372
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,800
Danny.

1373
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:40,800
Since you met me, I've made you do things
you didn't want to do.

1374
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,600
What are you talking about?

1375
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,700
- What am I talking about?
- Yeah, what?

1376
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,200
Let's show him what I'm talking about.

1377
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,500
I'm what he's talking about, shithead.

1378
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,900
- We have a simple agenda here.
- You're crazy.

1379
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,700
Either you fight one fight
or fight for the rest of your life.

1380
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,700
- You're sick!
- What's it gonna be?

1381
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,700
I'm not gonna be there.
So just forget about it, all right?

1382
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,800
Let's show Mr. Kreese
how he's going to get his business back.

1383
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:16,200
- I won't fight.
- You don't have to.

1384
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,100
You can just stand there
and let him kick your ass.

1385
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,900
- Do the crane, Danny-boy!
- You're doing this to yourself, man.

1386
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,600
Yes!

1387
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:34,600
- You wanna see some more?
- I wanna see a lot more.

1388
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,200
Bring him back.

1389
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,400
You see his face?

1390
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:41,600
See the trail? I think he peed in his pants!

1391
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,900
Well, look who's here. The big war hero.

1392
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:03,800
What are you waiting for?

1393
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,000
Party time.

1394
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,200
We're old friends.

1395
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,500
Come on, little man.

1396
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,100
Let's see how good you really are.

1397
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,600
You think this is the end of it, old man?

1398
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:35,600
I'm going to open Cobra Kai <i>dojo</i>s
all over this valley.

1399
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:38,100
Hell, I might even teach for free.

1400
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:40,700
From now on when people say
karate around here...

1401
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,100
...all they'll mean is Cobra Kai karate.

1402
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,600
John Kreese's karate.
You won't even be a memory.

1403
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,400
Yes, he will. You won't.

1404
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,700
Now will you train me?

1405
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,500
Now Miyagi train you.

1406
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,600
Come. Waste time here.

1407
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,000
We plant tree here.

1408
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
- You take tree.
- All set.

1409
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,700
- Careful.
- I got it.

1410
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,500
Happy to be home, old fella? Yeah, I bet.

1411
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,200
Let's get this crummy plastic bag off you.

1412
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,300
Put you back where you belong.

1413
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:11,200
There you go.

1414
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,500
Nice comfortable spot.

1415
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,800
- That feel good?
- Good spot, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

1416
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:21,500
I got just what you need.
A nice cool drink.

1417
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,800
Let some of your old roots soak that up.

1418
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:31,200
Daniel-<i>san</i>, this <i>bonsai</i> have strong root.

1419
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,300
Same you.

1420
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,900
This tree now choose how it grow.

1421
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:40,300
So must you choose how you grow.

1422
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,000
Miyagi have great faith in you.

1423
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,100
Understand?

1424
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,800
Come on, Daniel-<i>san</i>.

1425
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,100
See you around, old fella.

1426
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,000
<i>Point Barnes!</i>

1427
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,900
<i>The score is 2-0.</i>

1428
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:02,000
- Let's do it up, do it right!
- Ready? Begin!

1429
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,500
- Did you teach him that?
- No, that one is his.

1430
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:11,500
A warning for a kick to the groin.
Once more, costs you a point.

1431
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,400
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1432
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,000
<i>Three points for Barnes.</i>

1433
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:22,000
- Danny-boy's gonna get murdered up there.
- Winner!

1434
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,900
Face me. Bow.

1435
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,500
Shake hands.

1436
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,000
You're next, LaRusso. I own your ass.

1437
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:30,900
<i>While we wait for the challenger</i>
<i>to catch his breath...</i>

1438
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,200
T-shirts! Get your Cobra Kai T-shirts!

1439
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:37,600
<i>... I'd like to thank a new patron of ours</i>
<i>for the purchase and donation...</i>

1440
01:39:37,700 --> 01:39:40,900
<i>... of the permanent home</i>
<i>of the All Valley Championships.</i>

1441
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,500
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president</i>
<i>of Dyna-tox Industries, Mr. Terry Silver.</i>

1442
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,400
Yeah, Mr. Silver!

1443
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,100
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

1444
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,200
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1445
01:39:55,500 --> 01:40:00,200
<i>I've always lived my life by the rule:</i>
<i>"If you get, you give."</i>

1446
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:04,700
<i>For the last 20 years,</i>
<i>I've gotten from karate.</i>

1447
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,600
<i>I've gotten discipline...</i>

1448
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:10,700
<i>... health, self-confidence...</i>

1449
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,400
<i>... inner peace.</i>

1450
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:15,200
<i>Everything that makes me</i>
<i>what I am today.</i>

1451
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,100
<i>And today, it's time for me to give back.</i>

1452
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:25,800
<i>It's my pleasure to announce</i>
<i>my partnership with the greatest...</i>

1453
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
<i>... karate man I have ever known,</i>
Sensei <i>John Kreese.</i>

1454
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,500
Yeah, Mr. Kreese.

1455
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:42,300
<i>Together, we are about to open</i>
<i>a chain of Cobra Kai</i> dojo<i>s...</i>

1456
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:47,600
<i>... where young people can come</i>
<i>and learn the same values I've learned:</i>

1457
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,500
<i>Honesty...</i>

1458
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,100
<i>... compassion...</i>

1459
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,500
<i>... and fair play.</i>

1460
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:59,900
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>
<i>Enjoy the final match.</i>

1461
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,200
<i>Thank you, Mr. Silver.</i>

1462
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,800
<i>And thank you again</i>
<i>for your most generous contribution.</i>

1463
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,600
Remember the game plan.

1464
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:13,200
First you win a point,
then you lose a point.

1465
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:17,000
Keep the score 0-0.
Pulverise him for the full three minutes.

1466
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:20,000
Then in sudden death,
you get the point, we win.

1467
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,400
I want him to experience pain.

1468
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,200
- First he suffers.
- Then he suffers some more.

1469
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:29,800
<i>Representing the Cobra Kai,</i>
<i>the challenger, Mike Barnes.</i>

1470
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:37,100
<i>And in this corner,</i>
<i>someone who needs no introduction...</i>

1471
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,700
<i>... the defending champion</i>
<i>from the Miyagi</i> dojo...

1472
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,900
<i>... Daniel LaRusso.</i>

1473
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,600
<i>This match will have</i>
<i>a three-minute time limit.</i>

1474
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:06,100
<i>The first fighter to score three points</i>
<i>will be designated this year's...</i>

1475
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,700
<i>... All Valley Under-18 Champion.</i>

1476
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,400
- <i>Fighters to your marks!</i>
- Go out there and get him.

1477
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,200
Flatten him out, Mike. Fight him!

1478
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:18,700
<i>Remember, folks, the new rule this year</i>
<i>states that if there is no winner...</i>

1479
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,000
<i>... at the end of three minutes</i>
<i>the championship match will go...</i>

1480
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:25,300
<i>... into sudden-death overtime.</i>

1481
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,700
When it's over,
his mother won't recognise him.

1482
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:28,900
You both know the rules.

1483
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,800
Light contact is allowed to the body,
and I do mean light, Mr. Barnes.

1484
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,900
No face contact is allowed.

1485
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,300
Any violation of the rules
will result in a penalty point.

1486
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,100
On your lines.

1487
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,900
Come on, Daniel!

1488
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,800
Face this way, bow. Face each other, bow.

1489
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,600
I said bow.

1490
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,300
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1491
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,700
Break, break! Let's go.
Out of the ring. No point.

1492
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,000
Begin!

1493
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,500
<i>Point, Barnes.</i>

1494
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,700
<i>Score: 1-0.</i>

1495
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,400
Look over at the slope.

1496
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,000
Is that perfect?

1497
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,000
One point Barnes for the punch.
Fighting positions.

1498
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,500
Begin!

1499
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:25,500
Danny-boy, how are the family jewels?

1500
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,800
Get off the mat! Now! Get off the mat!

1501
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,400
Do that again, Barnes,
and you're disqualified.

1502
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:35,900
<i>That illegal groin kick</i>
<i>will cost Barnes his previous point.</i>

1503
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,100
<i>Score is now 0-0.</i>

1504
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,700
Kick to the groin. Penalty point.

1505
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,300
- Score is 0-0.
- You're dirty, Barnes.

1506
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:48,400
- He'll get you 'cause you're dirty.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1507
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,700
That's the one, Mike.

1508
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,800
<i>Barnes scores the point. Reverse punch.</i>

1509
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,300
Go, Daniel!

1510
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:05,800
Come on, Daniel.

1511
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,300
Let's go, LaRusso.

1512
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,300
Point Barnes.

1513
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,400
Score is 1-0. Ready?

1514
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:15,600
Come on, Mike, you got him.

1515
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,200
Begin!

1516
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,700
Break, break!

1517
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,600
On your line!

1518
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:26,700
That's it, Barnes.
One more violation and you're disqualified.

1519
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:29,900
<i>That illegal punch</i>
<i>will cost Barnes one point.</i>

1520
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,300
<i>The score is again 0-0.</i>

1521
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,400
You all right, LaRusso?

1522
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:38,000
Intentional face contact, penalty point.

1523
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,200
- Perfect.
- Score is 0-0.

1524
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,500
Fighting positions.

1525
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:44,400
Ready? Begin!

1526
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,700
Now the real pain begins, Danny-boy.

1527
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:53,800
On your lines.

1528
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,300
That's a warning
for running out of the ring.

1529
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,700
Come on, Barnes!

1530
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,600
Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1531
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:10,200
Break! Break!

1532
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,800
On your line.

1533
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,300
He'll get up.

1534
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,300
He's too dumb not to.

1535
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,300
LaRusso, on your line.

1536
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:22,000
Get up, you pansy-ass!

1537
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,200
- No point for kick to the back.
- <i>No point scored.</i>

1538
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:31,500
- This is beautiful. It's beautiful.
- Fighting positions. Ready? Begin!

1539
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,000
Break!

1540
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:40,000
What's the matter, you can't breathe?

1541
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,900
- On your line.
- I love it when he pounds him!

1542
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:46,900
- On your line.
- This is more fun than I thought.

1543
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,700
<i>No clean technique on that exchange.</i>

1544
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,600
<i>No point scored.</i>

1545
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,600
<i>The score remains 0-0.</i>

1546
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:57,200
<i>Ten seconds left in the match.</i>

1547
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:59,200
- Let's go, Danny.
- Fighting positions.

1548
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:02,000
- You gotta turn it around.
- Ready? Begin!

1549
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:04,500
Time!

1550
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,600
Break!

1551
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,800
<i>There will be a one-minute rest period.</i>

1552
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,700
<i>Then the match will continue</i>
<i>with sudden death.</i>

1553
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,100
- Daniel-<i>san</i>!
- Mr. Miyagi, it's over.

1554
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,900
- No!
- It's over, forget it.

1555
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,800
- No!
- I'm afraid. Let's go.

1556
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:21,600
- I want to go home.
- Can't! You must not!

1557
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,400
Is okay to lose to opponent.

1558
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:26,900
- Must not lose to fear!
- Yeah, well, I'm afraid!

1559
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:30,600
I'm afraid of him, all right?
What do you want me to do?

1560
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,400
You stay focused.

1561
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:38,100
Daniel-<i>san</i>,
your best karate is still inside you.

1562
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:40,300
Now time let out!

1563
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,000
<i>That's the end of the rest period.</i>

1564
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:47,900
- Fighters on your lines.
- Come on, get up!

1565
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,500
Get on that line!
Get on that line, LaRusso!

1566
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,100
You're worthless!
Your slope teacher's nothing!

1567
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,900
Get up, man!
You're no champion. Get up!

1568
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:58,500
You suck, LaRusso! You suck, man!

1569
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,700
And your teacher's karate is shit.
You hear me? He's shit!

1570
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,300
You're done, LaRusso.

1571
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,200
Your karate is a joke.
And your teacher's worth shit.

1572
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:11,900
He's nothing! And you're nothing!
I own you! I own you, LaRusso!

1573
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,200
Where's your little Jap teacher now?
He's a phoney, man.

1574
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:17,200
He's a fake
and he didn't teach you nothing.

1575
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:18,700
Your karate's shit. You hear me?
Get up!

1576
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Come on, Mike!
This is what we've been waiting for!

1577
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,400
Fighting positions.

1578
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:32,900
Ready?

1579
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,200
Begin!

1580
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,800
Mike! Take him out!

1581
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,300
Hit him!

1582
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,100
Get the point! Get the point!

1583
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:53,800
Hit him, Mike! He's hallucinating.

1584
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,700
Winner!

1585
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:08,900
<i>The winner and the first to ever win</i>
<i>two years in a row...</i>

1586
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:12,900
<i>... the grand champion, Daniel LaRusso. </i>

1587
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:17,800
Mr. Miyagi, forget about it!

1588
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,100
We did it! We did it!

1589
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:22,800
