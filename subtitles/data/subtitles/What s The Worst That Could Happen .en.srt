1
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,560
I start the bidding
at six hundred. Six fifty?

2
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
I have one thousand dollars
in the back. Thank you.

3
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
If you're here for the sports
memorabilia auction...

4
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,320
it's next Wednesday.

5
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh, well, thank you,
but I'm just here...

6
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,600
to look at
all the colorful pictures.

7
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,200
Well, good for you.

8
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,920
How about this one?
Isn't it exquisite?

9
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,680
Oh, yes, very exquisite.

10
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
Yes, it is--for a fake.

11
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,000
A fake?

12
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Yeah. See, it says here,
Lot 702...

13
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,880
Young Girl by Window...

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,360
is seventeenth century
Phoenician school.

15
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,720
-But it's not.
-It's not?

16
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
See, the shading
on the burnt umber is all wrong.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,000
I'd date this back
at the time...

18
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
they was usin' the White House
as a get down spot.

19
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,320
You know, when everybody
was up in there like that.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,640
When certain staff members
were backin' it up.

21
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,520
Sir, with all due respect...

22
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,160
I think you'll find that
the staff here at W. Boyle--

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,080
It's a fake, OK?

24
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,160
-I have an eye.
-An eye?

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,520
Yes. Just like them
glasses you got on.

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,520
I know when got up today,
you put 'em on.

27
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,720
You got in the mirror,
you thought you were stylin'.

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,840
You came to work, you know,
get a couple of more sales.

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,960
I know you thought they was,
what, $500 Boucherons?

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Nah, they knock-offs, darlin'.
Yeah, those are knock-offs.

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,440
They're fake... like this
piece of shit here.

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,600
702, Young Girl by the Window.

33
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,480
Sold to paddle number fourteen.

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,640
Next up, Lot 702,
Young Girl by Window...

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,680
has been pulled
from the auction.

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,280
So we'll move on to Lot 703...

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,800
The Hudson River Valley
lake scene.

38
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,600
A fine example of
nineteenth century American art.

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,840
You may find it of interest...

40
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,680
that the artist responsible
for this beautiful painting...

41
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,480
was a Boston native
who apprenticed right here...

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,960
on our very own
Commonwealth Avenue.

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,640
My colleagues and I
here at W. Boyle...

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,320
Excuse me.

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,600
Here, let me switch with you.

46
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Let me just try to slide by you.

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,160
Pardon me.

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Please, will you watch it?

49
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,840
All right, that's...

50
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,320
Um, let me try this.

51
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,840
-OK, OK. Slide over. Go.
-This is outrageous.

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Like that, see? Got it.

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,440
Excuse me. All right.

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,240
Deal a meal.

55
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,680
You OK?

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,160
Would you mind
just leaving me alone?

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,640
Now, if I leave you alone...

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
you sitting here
on the verge of tears...

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
how you think
that's gonna make me feel?

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
You wouldn't understand.

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,440
That painting is yours.

62
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,920
You don't want to sell it,
but you have to.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
Three fifty.

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,240
Give or take a pound.

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,080
Five hundred. Five hundred.
Do I have five fifty?

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,160
Five fifty I have. Five fifty.
Do I have six hundred?

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,720
My father
left me the painting...

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,440
and I love it, but I need
the money to pay a hotel bill.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,800
One thousand five hundred.

70
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,560
One thousand five hundred.
Thank you.

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,040
-Two thousand.
-I have two thousand dollars.

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
Two thousand five hundred
dollars.

73
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,400
I have 2,500. Do I have 3,000?

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,800
Two thousand five hundred
going once...

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
twice--sold.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,760
Paddle number fourteen.

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,160
Well, that's that.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,720
What's your name?

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,880
Amber Belhaven.

80
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
Oh, very pretty name.

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,360
Kevin. Kevin Caffrey.

82
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,200
Look...

83
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,920
I couldn't buy that painting...

84
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
but I can buy you
a cup of coffee.

85
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
So after I graduated
university...

86
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,320
I moved here from London
to take this great job...

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,080
with a new natural history
website, neanderthal.com.

88
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,080
-What?
-Yeah, I know, I know.

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,240
You can figure out the rest.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
They went under, so here I am.

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
So what are you gonna do now?

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
Get a job.

93
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm sure there are
plenty of opportunities...

94
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,880
for a girl with a degree
in anthropology.

95
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,640
OK. Now, anthropology...

96
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,160
that's, like,
the study of man's...

97
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,360
See, I'm glad I read that
in the dictionary...

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,520
or I wouldn't know.

99
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,440
So what do you do, Kevin?

100
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
I'm a--I'm a businessman.

101
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah. Matter of fact, I was late
for an appointment.

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,560
I hope this is not too personal,
but in your hotel room...

103
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,560
do they have one of those
little refrigerators?

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,240
And in that refrigerator, do
they have those little bottles?

105
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,920
Yeah, I guess.

106
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,440
Well,
when my appointment ends...

107
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
would you like me to come by
and check?

108
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,760
See if in fact they do?

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,200
Now, you wouldn't try
to sleep with me, would you?

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,920
-Why are you blinking?
-Just a little nervous tic.

111
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,760
I tell a lie, I blink.

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,520
Oh, that must keep you
very honest.

113
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,840
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
So, can you force yourself
to blink--

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,400
blink when
you're telling the truth?

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,880
So when you're not blinking...

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,520
it means you're definitely
telling the truth...

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,840
but when you are blinking,
it means you're either lying...

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,440
or it means that you're
forcing yourself to blink...

120
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,040
to make it look like
you're lying.

121
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,200
That's right.

122
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,160
That sounds very complicated.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
It's not, really.

124
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,480
So what's up?

125
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
Can I see you later?

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,160
Sure.

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,760
Wait.
But you're blinking, too.

128
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,880
You got the same thing
that I got...

129
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
and I don't know what you...

130
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
She's got it goin' on.

131
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
I will find you.

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
Who is it?

133
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,040
This is for you.

134
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,560
How much did he want
for that painting?

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,320
'Cause I'll pay you back
as soon as I get a job.

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,120
Well, it, uh...
it didn't cost me anything.

137
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,640
What, you stole it?

138
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,280
That's what I do.

139
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,480
But I thought
you were a businessman.

140
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
I am.

141
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm in the business of stealing.

142
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah,
that's why I go to auctions--

143
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
to learn what's worth stealing.

144
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,360
Connoisseur
of all things portable.

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,720
Wow.

146
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
I apologize if it's a shock.

147
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,320
Well, I dated a lawyer
for three years...

148
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,520
so ethically speaking,
I've seen a stretch mark or two.

149
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,440
Normally, I don't tell a woman
that on the first date.

150
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,040
Then again, I don't normally
have these feelings.

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Me, neither.

152
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,880
You see this ring?

153
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,240
My father gave this to me...

154
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,560
to remind me every day
how much he loved me.

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,800
My father believed in fate,
and so do I.

156
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,280
Used to be his lucky ring.

157
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,560
Now it's yours.

158
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,480
Well, how lucky was he?

159
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,200
Well, he was wearing it...

160
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
when he won that painting
in a card game.

161
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,600
Now I want something from you.

162
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Name it.

163
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,240
I want you to promise me
that you'll never lie to me.

164
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
I've been
in that kind of relationship...

165
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,320
and I'll never do it again.

166
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,560
So no lies, OK?

167
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,840
No lies.

168
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,480
Said without a blink.

169
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Oh, my God,
it's like needles in my eye.

170
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,880
I am too rich to have
a headache like this, Walter.

171
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
-You gotta get me out of this!
-G-get you out of this?

172
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
OK. I'll just undo
every single shady deal...

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,640
you've been a part of
for the last five years.

174
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,760
Sounds good to me!

175
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,360
There are no loopholes
this time.

176
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,960
Bankruptcy is the only option.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
Great! Screw it.
Screw everybody.

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,480
Just file the goddamn papers.

179
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
What's the worst
that could happen?

180
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,320
Bankruptcy, Max.

181
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,000
That's the worst
that could happen.

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,120
Poodle cakes, it's only
the real estate company.

183
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
This is no big deal.
Tell her, Walter.

184
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
This is a...

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,880
It's a tech-technical procedure.

186
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah, that's right--a simple
little technical procedure.

187
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
It's humiliating, and it'll be
in all of the newspapers.

188
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Well...

189
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Maybe my father was right
about my marrying you.

190
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There is no need...

191
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,960
to bring your daddy into this,
sugar lumps.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Walter and I,
we have this all worked out.

193
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,560
Our strategy is planned.
Right, Walter?

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,440
Fix it, Max, or else.

195
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,880
There is nothing to worry about,
snuggle bunny.

196
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
These things have a tendency...

197
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,280
to work themselves out
in the end.

198
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
They always do. Come on.
Come on, give me little kisses.

199
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,520
Come on, let me see 'em.
Let me see the lippies.

200
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,440
That's it. Wanna go to lunch?

201
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,760
Let's go. Come on.

202
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,360
Let's go.
We'll eat. We'll drink.

203
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,520
We'll forget all this crap.

204
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,200
Respect.

205
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,840
R-e-s-p--you know the rest.

206
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,800
That's what's missing.
Nobody respect anything now.

207
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,720
Nobody respect your work,
nobody respect your elders.

208
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,360
You know what I'm sayin'?

209
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,840
Nod your head, man,
if you're awake.

210
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,360
Yeah, respect. I hear you.

211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,600
If I want to talk to myself,
I'll leave myself a voice mail.

212
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,160
I know that good-lookin'
young man right there, baby.

213
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
I know that smile anywhere.

214
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,320
What you got
for good old Uncle Jack?

215
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,160
Uh, nothin'.
I just came by to see Amber.

216
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,160
-Where is she?
-She's workin'.

217
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,480
She loves to work.

218
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,680
She the best damn waitress
I ever hired.

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,960
All perky and shit.

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You'd like her,
you get to know her.

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
How I'm gonna get to know her,
speakin' that foreign language?

222
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,800
I know all I need to know.

223
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,160
You ain't pulled a damn job
since she moved in with you.

224
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,080
Look, Uncle Jack,
I can talk to you.

225
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
-You sure can.
-I can talk to you, right?

226
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,440
That's doggone right.

227
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,840
-All right, I think--
-What?

228
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
-I know--
-OK.

229
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,760
-I love her.
-No, no.

230
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,240
Son, son, she wrong for you.
She too decent.

231
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
What?

232
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,120
Whatever happened to Sharon,
that nice con girl from Chicago?

233
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
-Two years upstate.
-For what?

234
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,440
-For conning people.
-No.

235
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,360
Yeah. But, see, with Sharon,
it was just sex.

236
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,720
-That's good.
-But with Amber...

237
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,120
-Well, it's still sex.
-That's good.

238
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,840
-But we talk.
-Talk?

239
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,320
Yes. It's so amazing to wake up
with someone and just talk.

240
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
Talk? You ain't Oprah.

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Hey, honey bun, how are you?

242
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,080
-Mmm. How ya doin'?
-All perky and shit.

243
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,840
Hey, look what the cat drug in.

244
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,320
Hey, something cold
and Bavarian, barkeep.

245
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,960
-You got it, buddy.
-Berger.

246
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
-Hey, what's up, Kevin dog?
-What's up?

247
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,240
Everything's sweet now.

248
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,160
Hey, to all the women I loved
and who loved me back. Salud.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
You better not let Anne Marie
hear you talkin' that shit.

250
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,760
Aw, don't worry, man.
She'll nev--

251
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,800
It's Anne Marie.
What, does she have radar?

252
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,120
Berger, best thing
that ever happened to me.

253
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,040
Sweetheart.
Pleasure to meet you, Berger.

254
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,400
And any friend of Kevin's
probably works nights.

255
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,200
I gotta get back to work myself.
See you later.

256
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,720
-It's a delight and a pleasure.
-Sooner than later.

257
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,120
Nice ass.

258
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,440
Hey, man, what did I just say?

259
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,280
I'm sorry, dog.
I didn't know you meant it.

260
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,440
Come on, most of the girls
you go out with are, you know...

261
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
Yeah, well,
this one's different.

262
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,520
She got a degree
in anthropology.

263
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,080
I'll remember that if I ever
need to phone a friend, OK?

264
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,240
-Do that.
-Hey, Kevin, I got one.

265
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,680
-What?
-Tonight.

266
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,560
Big score. Safe as houses.

267
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,520
Safe as houses?
A paradox, as they say.

268
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,920
Yes. In fact,
it is a house of which I speak.

269
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,240
-Well, talk to me.
-You ever read the papers?

270
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,880
I used to,
but the news kept changin'.

271
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,760
-Ever hear of Max Fairbanks?
-The big tycoon?

272
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,720
Hey, this better be good.

273
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,400
Oh, you're gonna love this, man.
Check it out.

274
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,760
Come on.
I want you to read that.

275
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,080
"Billionaire Max Fairbanks
today put Trigram real estate...

into Chapter 11."

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
The man's broke,
and we gonna rob him?

278
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,800
Oh, don't cry for him,
Argentina.

279
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,160
This man would steal your moms
if he wanted corn bread.

280
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
This is one of those
legal heists.

281
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,560
Big business--that's where
they really teach you to steal.

282
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,440
No heavy lifting.
Do it while you're on vacation.

283
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,440
And brothers like us
don't even have a dental plan.

284
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,920
Come on, read on.

285
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,760

The man can't even

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,840
-Always makes me laugh.
-The old upstairs hall light.

Aren't they, man?

switched to rubber surgicals...

but for comfort and feel,
you can't beat the Isotoner.

297
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,720
First class, my man.

298
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,880
First class all the way.

299
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,240
Coming from you,
that means a lot. Serious.

300
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,240
It's all good. Let's do this.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,040
Oh, come on, Max.
You never let me do it.

302
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,200
I'm not done. I have more.

303

God, I can't believe you.

304
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,200
Max, will you please
listen to me?

305
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,880
I love the costume.

306
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,280
I'm naked.

307
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh, a joke.

308
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,640
Yeah, a joke.

309
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,760
Ah, baby. I did it. I did it.

310
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,280
What do you say?
What do you say?

311
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,320
Can we please get back to what
we were talking about before?

Tracey. Tracey Kimberly.

316
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm just not sure
I want to talk about it...

317
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,040
at this precise moment.

318
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,920
You know, I knew you'd say that
once we did it--

319
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,760
Don't say
what you're about to say.

320
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,680
Don't turn
a perfectly fun evening...

321
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,320
into something cheap and sordid
by talking business.

322
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,560
Here comes the little finger man
coming to get you, hmm?

323
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,840
Wow, check that out.
Ooh, look at that.

324
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,240
-Faberge.
-Oh, baby.

325
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,040
Gold enamel, diamond inlay.

326
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,520
Oh, yeah, I have it now.

327
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,600
Yeah, baby.
And I got the score, baby.

328
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,200
Is that not the score
or what, huh?

329
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,720
Fun, too.
Like an Easter egg hunt.

330
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,640
You want to hop upstairs,
and I'll just work this floor?

331
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,360
You called it. You called it.

332
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,080
Thanks.

333
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,680
All right. You wanna do it?
Let's do it. Here we go.

334
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
-Really?
-Yeah, sure.

335
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,040
Go. Ready? We're gonna do it.

336
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,400
Five, four, three, two...

337
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,640
Titanic heartthrob
Leonardo DiCaprio...

338
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,520
told me, Tracey Kimberly, in
an exclusive E.T. interview...

339
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,480
that he is currently
in negotiations...

340
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,480
to do a sequel
to the summer blockbuster...

341
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,320
which will be entitled
Titanic 2.

342
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,480
What is it...

343
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,400
the story of a dead guy
on the bottom of the ocean?

344
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,840
Who?

345
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,520
Well, lookie here.

346
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Monday...

347
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,280
Tuesday, Wednesday...

348
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
Every day of the week.

349
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,160
-What?
-Shh. Quiet. I hear somebody.

350
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,400
Oh, yeah. Now we're stylin'.

351
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,080
Berger, a tan suede newbuck.

352
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,400
Yeah, I like a thick sole
with a tailored suit.

353
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,400
Grounds it,
know what I'm sayin'?

354
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,000
I do.

355
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,440
-Oh, gosh.
-That's why I bought them.

356
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
Tracey,
come on, get out of here.

357
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,400
What do you think this is,
a photo shoot?

358
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,640
But I want to see
what's going on.

359
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
What does it look like
is going on?

360
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,320
The guy's robbing the house.
I got a gun on him.

361
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,160
Go on back in there.
Put your clothes on.

362
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,600
Damn. You must be rich.

363
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,320
That's right.
Eat your heart out.

364
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,720
Look, you caught me,
fair and square.

365
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,920
But how about
I walk out of here...

366
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,440
nothing taken, nothing harmed?
How does that sound?

367
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,120
You stay right where you are,
or I shoot you in the head.

368
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,600
-How's that sound?
-Violent.

369
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,480
But I see your point.

370
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,640
-So, he wasn't carrying a gun?
-No, sir.

371
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,800
-No I.D.?
-Nothin'.

372
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,920
-What's your name, bro?
-Petey Wonder.

373
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,120
I'm Stevie's little brother...

374
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,880
but I don't sing.

375
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
You know who I am?

376
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,080
You got a lot of balls, huh?

377
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,800
You come into my house,
into my bedroom...

378
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,840
and take my ring.

379
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,480
-What?
-That's my ring.

380
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,720
Stop trippin', all right?
This is my ring.

381
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,320
Ha! Son of a bitch! He was gonna
waltz out of here...

382
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,640
with my ring
on his little finger.

383
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Take off the ring,
give it to Mr. Fairbanks.

384
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
-Officer, this is my ring.
-Sure. Give him the ring.

385
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,280
Look, my girlfriend
gave me the ring.

386
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,720
If I don't come home
with my ring--

387
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,320
Give me the ring. Give me it.

388
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,680
This is my ring.

389
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
You expect us to believe that?

390
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,320
You...

391
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,600
I can go along
with some things, but...

392
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,800
some things make no damn sense.

393
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,480
-Let go of the damn ring.
-This ain't right.

394
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
Write a letter to the editor.

395
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,440
Oop. I forgot.
I own the newspapers.

396
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,840
We'll take care of everything.

397
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,560
Get him out of here.

398
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,840
Don't you worry,
Mr. Fairbanks.

399
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,280
This is a good ring.

400
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,840
This is a very nice ring.

401
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,720
All right, just hear me out, OK?
One more time.

402
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,240
I just feel if we were
to go back, you know...

403
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,280
and, uh, give him
a chance to confess...

404
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,600
you know, come clean...

405
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,600
he might just hand over what is
in fact my rightful property.

406
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,040
I could see how that sounds
all messed up, right?

407
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,240
Comin' out of my mouth.

408
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,000
But it's the truth.

409
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,080
Can I see my lawyer?

410
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,360
Seventeen,
with the robbery suspect...

411
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,360
at Twenty-five Harbor Heights,
Marblehead...

412
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,840
what's your twenty?

413
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,200
Yeah. That's it, 10-4. We're on
the corner of Camden and 4th...

414
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,200
en route to the station
with the perp in custody.

415
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,440
What? Hey! Hey, you! Stop!

416
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
Shit! What's going on?

417
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,760
That son of a bitch!

418
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,040
Anything?

419
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,480
Nothing. Clear. Let's go.

420
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,400
I want my damn ring!

421
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,400
You don't know what you started.

422
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,560
I'll take door number three.

423
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,040
Gotta go!

424
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,360
Hello, honey bun.
How was your day?

425
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,280
Good.

426
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,960
What's the matter?

427
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,200
Well, was it bad?

428
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,280
Go on.

429
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,720
I lost the ring.

430
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,360
Oh, Kevin,
I just gave you the ring.

431
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,920
Well, actually, it's worse
than that. The ring was stolen.

432
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,840
Stolen by who?

433
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,600
Of all the lousy, jerkological,
cheap-shot stickups...

434
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,720
this has gotta take the cake.

435
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,640
-You got that right.
-Robbed by a householder...

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
doing a robbery.

437
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,040
Terrible, Kevin, terrible.

438
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,120
-You laughing at me?
-Hell, yeah, I'm laughing.

439
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,000
It's embarrassing. You should be
ashamed of yourself.

440
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,280
Sixteen thousand.

441
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,000
What's in that cigar
you're smoking, huh?

442
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,640
Come on, the Fabergé egg alone--

443
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,920
Nice. Don't want it.
It's hard to move.

444
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,760
-Can't move it.
-The damn car, OK?

445
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,840
It's worth--

446
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,800
OK, I'll give you six and a half
for the car.

447
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Round it off to twenty-one five.

448
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,760
That's because
I raised you as my own...

449
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,720
and I'm happy to see you
back in the business.

450
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,440
-Sixteen.
-Sixteen.

451
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,960
-Plus six and a half.
-Half, right.

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,960
-Is twenty-one five?
-Man, look. Six...

453
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,120
Twenty-one, fifteen, twenty...

454
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
Don't worry about it.

455
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,760
Look here, it's late, all right?

456
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,640
I wanted to see
if you're on your game...

457
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,000
so I took a shot at you.
That's all I did.

458
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,760
Man...

459
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
I just feel like I'm getting
robbed by everybody tonight.

460
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,600
Come on, Kevin,
it's not that bad.

461
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,080
Why are you so upset?

462
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,840
Why am I so upset?

463
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,040
Baby, let me show you something.

464
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,120
You see this?

465
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,160
This is a Fabergé egg--
Russian, 1890.

466
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Now, some people get all freaked
and obsessed by these.

467
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,840
Why?
It's what it represents.

468
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,280
Power, taste, superiority.

469
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,520
That's all in the mind...

470
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,040
of the person
who puts a price on it.

471
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,360
What's it mean to me?

472
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
Not a damn thing.

473
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,360
Too hard to fence.

474
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Now, the ring,
on the other hand...

475
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,800
is priceless.

476
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,520
It symbolizes
the day my life changed--

477
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,120
the day I met you.

478
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,800
Wow.

479
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
Let's go, Monty.
Let's see what you got.

480
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,120
Ooh, bull's-eye!

481
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,720
Game, set, match.

482
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,080
Do we have a problem?

483
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,840
No. You have a problem...

484
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,080
from which I,
your long suffering attorney...

485
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,880
will once again
try to extricate you.

486
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,160
-So?
-So...

487
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,600
there was a break-in last night.

488
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,520
Oh, no. You're kidding.
Really?

489
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,680
Hmm. Did they get much?

490
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,800
A hundred fifty thousand dollars
in valuables, plus a car.

491
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,760
That's right, Max. He went back.

492
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,200
-Son of a bitch.
-Sir!

493
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,720
Shut up.

494
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,520
Does Lutetia
know about the, uh...

495
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,600
About the young lady?
So far not.

496
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,760
You've got bigger problems, Max.

497
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,960
The bankruptcy judge
is furious...

498
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,560
you disobeyed his order
not to use the house.

499
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,320
Can't you use a seedy motel,
like a normal philanderer?

500
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,800
What's so funny?

501
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,160
I was thinking
about the robbery.

502
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,600
Something funny
about the robbery?

503
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,000
Yeah, yeah, Walter, there is.

504
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,000
You think that shit's funny?

505
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
He boosted your ring
right in front of the cops?

506
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,800
Come on, you got to see
the humor in it, please.

507
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,520
I don't.
I don't see the humor.

508
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,720
I robbed a thief. How could you
not see the humor in that?

509
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,120
Because it's not funny.

510
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,800
It's more than just funny,
Walter. It's fate.

511
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,440
Here.
Take a look at this symbol.

512
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,000
It's my company logo
from the I Ching.

513
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,760
Omens, signs, throwing bones...

514
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,920
I don't throw bones, Walter,
but I do throw coins.

515
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
And I've been using the I Ching
for twenty years...

516
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,000
and look where it's got me.

517
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,640
This ring...

518
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,000
is a sign.

519
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,000
Everything
is gonna be just fine...

520
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,600
as long as I hold on
to this lucky ring.

521
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,520
Don't worry.
We'll get your ring back.

522
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,760
-Fairbanks is big game.
-Right.

523
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,160
We need a big game hunter.

524
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,240
Shelly Nix.

525
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,800
Shut the fuck up, man.

526
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,920
Thank you.

527
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,040
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

528
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,440
Can you find this asshole
or not?

529
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,560
Piece of cake.

530
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,360
It's no harder than shutting
down A.O.L. for an hour.

531
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Not that I'd have any interest.

532
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,200
All right. Check it out, y'all.

533
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,880
Usually, when you're trying
to track somebody down...

534
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,120
what you want to do is start
with airline computers...

535
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,320
car rental companies, big hotel
chains, stuff like that.

536
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
This guy's a high roller.
He's got his own personal jet...

537
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,040
when he's there from one way, (?)
so it's nothing but private limos...

538
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,200
and corporate hotel suites
from there on out.

539
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,520
How do you find him?

540
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,040
He's got a personal assistant
right here in Boston.

541
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,520
She e-mails his itineraries,
his schedules.

542
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,960
She practically knows
every detail of this guy's life.

543
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,440
Her name is Gloria.

544
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,000
The ring I told you about--

545
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm more convinced than ever
it's major mojo.

546
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,400
You know...

547
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,640
I wouldn't tell
anybody else this but you.

548
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,200
What, my musky teddy bear?

549
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,080
Tell mama.
You can tell mama bear anything.

550
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,560
Mama bear don't care.

551
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,480
Gloria, stop it.
We've discussed this already.

552
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,880
Screw you, Max.
Promises were made.

553
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,320
-Gloria.
-Never mind.

554
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,800
The past is the past.

555
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,640
What can I do for you, sir?

556
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,320
I was saying I was beginning
to go into one of my dips.

557
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,760
I was feeling
fear and anxiety and--

558
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,720
But this ring is like a sign
everything's turning around.

559
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,160
I was just wondering if,
you know, you could confirm--

560
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
All right, Max. All right.

561
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,440
Nine in the second place.
Tread a level course.

562
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,760
The perseverance of a dark man
brings good fortune.

563
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
Judgment, treading upon
the tale of the tiger...

564
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,960
it does not bite man.

565
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,920
What did the Boston Herald
just call me?

566
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,280
"The dark prince of plunder."

567
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,440
Perseverance of the dark man--
that's me.

568
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,960
Well, maybe.

569
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,400
Treading on the tiger's tale.

570
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,160
Taking mad chances
and getting away with it.

571
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,720
Like that time we were
in the elevator at T.U.I.?

572
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,360
Focus, Gloria, focus.

573
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,160
Let me consult my cards.

574
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,360
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

575
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,360
I will, Max.
It takes a little time.

576
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,040
What? What?
Gloria, what?

577
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,240
-Max, I'm losing you.
-Gloria, what?

578
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,360
You're cutting out.
I can't hear you.

579
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,480
I hope you got the e-mail that
Lutetia wants you to call her.

580
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,280
Lutetia? What does she want?

581
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Lutetia? What does she want?

582
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
The only person he's afraid of
is his wife Lutetia.

583
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
Here she is--
Design Times, June '98.

584
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,800
Beacon Hill townhouse
of Max and Lutetia Fairbanks.

585
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,320
Damn. Lutetia
looks more like Morticia.

586
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,240
What the hell were you doing
at the beach house...

587
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,880
and who the hell
were you doing it with?

588
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,480
Scandal and disease, Max.
These are the deal-breakers.

589
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm a monk.

590
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,080
Just because
you have the hairstyle...

591
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,360
doesn't mean
you lead the lifestyle.

592
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,280
And take off your shoes--
the white carpet.

593
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,520
Oh. Tell me again.
Why did I marry you?

594
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,160
Because I grew up
on Beacon Hill...

595
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,560
which gave you entrée
to wealthy family friends...

596
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,680
who could invest
in all your business ventures.

597
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
And you had a great ass.

598
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,000
Oh. Have a great ass.

599
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,320
Don't forget.

600
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,440
Picker is hosting
the botanical garden benefit...

601
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,800
at the Sheraton Boston
tonight

602
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,880
honoring me.

603
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,800
I'd like to pay tribute
right now.

604
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,040
Come over here.

605
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
Six o'clock sharp.

606
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,320
Picker hates it
when you're late.

607
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,760
Right.
Picker first, pecker later.

608
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,920
Boy, I need a massage.

609
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,040
Ah, hold up, hold up.
E-mail from Gloria--

610
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,320
benefit tonight at the Sheraton
Boston with his wife. Nice.

611
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,320
Let the games begin.
Ha ha. Yeah, Kevin.

612
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,720
Hell, yeah, baby.

613
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,520
Very hip, very cool.

614
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,000
Very Vegas in the sixties.

615
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,760
But how about you come over here
and we mess it up a little bit?

616
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,240
Let me entertain you first.

617
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,480
Give me dollars,
give me dollars.

618
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,480
Put 'em here.
Twenties go here...

619
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,960
hundreds go here.

620
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,480
During her eight years...

621
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,080
of involvement
with the botanical garden...

622
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,640
she has impressed us all with
her generosity and enthusiasm.

623
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,120
Evening. Evening.

624
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,280
Evening, sir.

625
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,280
Lutetia Fairbanks.

626
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
What's happening,
birdie, birdie?

627
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,160
You a talking bird?

628
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,080
Say, "Max, that's your ass."
Ooh!

629
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,840
Ooh, I'm sorry. Ladies!

630
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,800
Where have y'all been?
Lookin' good.

631
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,280
You know, I haven't seen y'all
since my polo accident.

632
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,600
Who does your eyes?

633
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,200
Yeah, yeah. Look at y'all.
Mucho eleganté.

634
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,880
Thank you.

635
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,240
And thank you all
for coming tonight...

636
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,880
and for
your ongoing commitment...

637
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,200
to the Boston
Botanical Foundation.

638
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,760
We have all sorts
of exciting plans lined up...

639
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,520
none of which would be possible
without your generosity...

640
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,440
Let me ask you something.

641
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,360
Is that Mrs. Fairbanks up there?

642
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
Their tireless team
of volunteers...

643
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,000
'Cause I'm confused.
I thought Mrs. Fairbanks...

644
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,760
was a young brunette
with, like, big soapy titties.

645
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,640
You're here to blackmail me?

646
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,720
Be cool.

647
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,480
I'm just here
to get back my ring, OK?

648
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,400
That's my lucky ring,
and I want it back.

649
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,880
No, it's not,
because now it's my lucky ring.

650
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,520
Spoils of war.

651
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,680
It means something to me.

652
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,560
Well, it means something
to me, too...

653
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,440
because I took it
off a little pissant...

654
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,600
who broke into my house...

655
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,560
while I was trying to nail
Miss September.

656
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,880
That was Miss September?

657
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,640
Yeah, it was Miss September.

658
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,480
Oh, damn. I got that issue.

659
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,360
So how rich are you?

660
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,960
You know...

661
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,880
it's guys like you
think you can just...

662
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,160
take whatever you want,
don't you?

663
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,120
-Guys like me?
-Yeah.

664
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
Who's the thief here?

665
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,000
I want my damn ring.

666
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,920
Well, you can't have
your damn ring.

667
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,800
You're gonna regret this.

668
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,320
Excuse me.

669
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,720
Total stranger.

670
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,240
Trés bizarre.

671
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,680
Are you gonna eat that?

672
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,160
I'm telling you, man.

673
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,040
When--when word gets out...

674
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,560
everybody
is gonna be laughing at me.

675
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
That's it.
His ass is going down.

676
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,720
-Take him down, man.
-Millionaire, billionaire.

677
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,080
It don't even matter.
He's out the game.

678
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,160
When I see him, what's up?
Pow! Boom!

679
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,960
But you know what?
That's just the start.

680
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,160
Guess where else I'm going.
I'm gonna do the ghetto smack.

681
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,520
-Oh, the ghetto smack.
-What's the ghetto smack?

682
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,440
Well, you hit him with anything.

683
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,960
Drum set, bam!

684
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,400
Piano, pow!

685
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,480
Stop it!

686
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,200
Sorry to break up the party...

687
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,080
but I thought you were trying
to get the ring back for me.

688
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Yeah, baby. That's right.

689
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,120
Kevin, are you blinking?

690
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,920
No. What it was, right--
I had something in my eye.

691
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,520
See, probably right here.

692
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,640
-See?
-I think I got it for you.

693
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,440
Oh, yeah, it's gone.

694
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,960
Do me a favor.
Keep out of trouble, will you?

695
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,560
No doubt.

696
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,200
Baby letting you know
when something in your eye.

697
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,960
-What you got?
-Check it out.

698
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,960
He and his wife are going
to some cocktail party...

699
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,160
ending by 8:00,
home by about 8:30.

700
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah, we'll be there
waiting for him.

701
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,960
Take the ring right off
his finger in his own home.

702
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And before that?

703
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,560
A complete removal
of all things portable.

704
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm sure we can work this out,
Judge Callahan...

705
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,720
if you just look
in your file there.

706
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,960
You have a sworn statement
from my client...

707
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
stating that he only went back
to the house in question...

708
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,120
to pick up
some very important stuff.

709
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,240
Very important stuff.

710
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,640
I have a good idea
what he picked up there.

711
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,080
Oh, you do, do you?

712
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,120
You don't think the rules apply
to you, do you, Mr. Fairbanks?

713
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,000
What?
What's he talking about?

714
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,040
All right, all right, all right,
that's enough.

715
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
Since you defied my order...

716
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,880
not to enter
the Marblehead beach house...

717
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,160
I have a good mind to reopen...

718
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,920
the entire Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceeding.

719
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,240
You know, you weren't so cocky
when you came to me...

720
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,840
with your hand out
asking me for money.

721
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,320
What did you say, Mr. Fairbanks?

722
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,120
What do you think I forgot how much
it cost me to get you elected...

723
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,200
by spreading stories...

724
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,680
about your opponent's
sexual preferences?

725
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,560
Oh, get some money.

726
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,000
I fork over, and what do you do?

727
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,960
You sit there
like a big, fat blob!

728
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,840
-Sell the house!
-Up yours, you fat pig!

729
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,400
And all the contents
at public auction.

730
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,080
Max, what did you get
so crazy for?

731
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,640
I'll tell you. He forgot
who the hell he paid off.

732
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,720
It was the other judge.
I told you.

733
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,360
Tread a level course.
You don't listen to me anymore.

734
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,200
So I forgot
we backed the other mutt.

735
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,600
Boy, this guy holds a grudge.

736
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,040
Max, you get one final visit...

737
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,400
to gather and remove
any personal effects.

738
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,760
-One final visit?
-Yep.

739
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,480
Max, I could come along
if you need some help.

740
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,200
Thanks just the same.
Dial Miss September.

741
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,800
Everything's gonna be fine.
The car will be here any second.

742
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,320
we'll go to Missy's party,
and we'll leave early.

743
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,000
-Right.
-Don't be so down, Maxie.

744
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,320
We still have
an awful lot of houses left.

745
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,720
Move your ass, Berger.
Don't start dragging on me.

746
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,080
-I got a bad feeling, Kevin.
-Come on.

747
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,240
Something's not right, man,
I'm telling you.

748
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,560
The only thing's not right
is you run out on me again, OK?

749
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,720
-I'm talking violence.
-I'm not leaving you, baby.

750
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,520
You can't get rid of me, man.
We're partners.

751
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,200
We're like Shaq and Kobe.
We're like Pippen and Jordan.

752
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,560
We're like
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

753
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,000
Ann Marie's been making me go
to theater lately.

754
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,160
-OK, I'm on the alarm.
-All right, good.

755
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,960
Alarm disabled.

756
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,480
And we're in.

757
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,040
Yeah, baby.

758
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,080
This is right out
of a Hitchcock movie.

759
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,280
I'm getting vertigo.

760
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,880
What's on your mind, Max?
Tell me.

761
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,000
Oh, it's that bum of a judge.

762
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,200
He's allowing me
one last visit to Marblehead...

763
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,640
to collect my belongings.

764
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,560
I thought maybe after the party,
I'd drop you off home...

765
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,480
and I'd go on out
for one last overnight.

766
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,360
You know what?
You've been through a lot today.

767
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
Let's forget about the party.

768
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,040
You go get your things.

769
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,360
Nobody knows me like you,
Lutetia.

770
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,560
All right.

771
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,080
OK, sounds good.

772
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,280
I'll just throw a few things
in an overnight bag.

773
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,200
-That's them, man.
-I'll come with you.

774
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,000
What?

775
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,680
In the elevator.

776
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,040
What the hell
are they doing back?

777
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,160
I don't know.

778
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,720
And then on to the beach house.

779
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,800
But--but, uh...

780
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,320
You know, there's no sense in
both of us going to the beach.

781
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,880
I insist.
That's the whole point...

782
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,560
It's been discussed. I'm going.

783
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,600
They're gone.

784
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,120
You don't even like
the beach house.

785
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,280
It's so suburban.

786
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,040
You are in a fragile state.

787
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,560
I can't bear to think of you
out there all alone.

788
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,320
Come on.

789
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,160
It'll be fun.

790
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,080
I--Give me a minute.

791
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,360
-Where the hell did they go?
-I don't know.

792
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,840
Dial Miss September.

793
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,360
Dial Miss September!

794
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,800
Tracey, forget about tonight.

795
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,560
Let's go, Max!

796
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,920
They're up there.
Come on, move it.

797
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,160
Hold it.

798
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,080
Sounds like there are voices
coming from the wall.

799
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,280
-Yeah, I don't get it.
-Stop. I'm going.

800
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,320
It's not too late
to change your mind.

801
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,760
Stop it. I insist.

802
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,120
Damn!

803
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,760
Quick, the alarm.
We gotta hurry.

804
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,440
Engage in three, two, one...

805
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,960
Damn.

806
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,080
Move one inch, and we're done.

807
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,840
There are motion detectors
everywhere.

808
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,880
Tell me about it, Berger.

809
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,480
Help me.

810
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,960
You sound like The Fly.

811
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,880
I'm sorry.

812
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,200
-I gotta call Windham.
-Hurry!

813
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,120
Windham!

814
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Shut up! Just shut up!

815
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,840
I'm telling you right now,
the brakes are shot!

816
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,000
Shut up, will you?
You are making me nervous.

817
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,120
You were born nervous, and
you're making me more nervous.

818
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,840
-Could you please?
-That rabbit is brand-new!

819
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,200
I can't be spending my time
running around getting--

820
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,080
Will you quiet down? I'm trying
to break in to this place.

821
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,720
How dare you drive that fast
when we got kids in the car.

822
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,840
Who the hell
do you think you are?

823
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,440
Don't yell at me about my driving.
I was barely going over the speed limit.

824
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Where the hell is he?

825
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,680
I can't hold on much longer.

826
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,840
I feel that way, too...

827
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,840
'cause my legs are dead.

828
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,920
I can't feel my ankles...

829
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,840
my knees...

830
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,480
Uh, my calf is swollen.

831
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,120
Kevin, I know this is not
the time to tell you this...

832
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,320
but I didn't have to pee
until right now.

833
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,720
Let it go, man. I won't tell.

834
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,600
That's what you said last time.

835
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,160
Why is it every time Kevin calls
we gotta drop everything...

836
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,240
but anytime I call,
you pretend you can't hear me?

837
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,800
Maybe because I like Kevin.

838
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,120
You take that back, or you'll
never saw me in half again.

839
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,360
We want ice cream!

840
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,280
You kids want to disappear?
I can make that happen!

841
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,760
Do not upset your father,
you get it?

842
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,600
I can never find
the right damn key.

843
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,320
Say thank you.

844
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,680
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

845
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,840
Yo, I need your help, man.
This bag is too damn heavy.

846
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
I need your help, man.

847
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,080
I'm trying to help myself.
I can't even move my neck.

848
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,200
Oh, man,
this thing's unbelievable.

849
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,040
-I got the numbers, honey.
-I got the lock.

850
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,480
You're the wind
beneath my wings.

851
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,000
Alarm disabled.

852
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,360
Security disarmed.

853
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,560
OK, she's fixed.

854
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,920
I can't feel my ass.
Numby-numb.

855
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,440
Yeah, can you believe it?
Me and Edwina together...

856
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,640
ten years this September.

857
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,760
Yeah, ten's a big number.

858
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,240
We're gonna have
a big anniversary party.

859
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,360
We hope you can make it.
There's gonna be--

860
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,320
-Come on!
-Shut up!

861
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
Sure. I should be walking again
by September.

862
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,480
I can't believe
it lasted ten years.

863
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,080
I couldn't even last
ten minutes with her.

864
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,320
Damn, this is nice stuff.

865
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,320
First quality, top drawer.

866
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,640
I can do one of two things.

867
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,080
I can give you
two hundred grand cash now...

868
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,640
or, if you're willing
to trust me...

869
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,280
I could pretty much guarantee
that I can fence...

870
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,960
most of the valuable stuff
for a much larger figure...

871
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,120
and square up
with you guys later.

872
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,640
It's totally up to you.

873
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,960
We'll take the cash.

874
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,760
Still no luck.

875
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,240
Total failure.

876
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,280
About sixty Gs.

877
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,720
Oh, I got something for you.

878
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,640
I knew it was
your favorite color.

879
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,760
It's beautiful.

880
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,040
Oh, my God!

881
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,840
Where is my painting?

882
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,280
-Gone.
-I can't believe--

883
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,680
Who would do something
like this?

884
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,720
That sneak thief.
Don't look down.

885
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,880
Oh, hey, get some water,
Gloria...

886
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,480
and shut that damn dog up
before I do.

887
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,120
Park it there, OK.

888
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,680
All right. Oh, sweetheart.

889
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,120
Oh, baby. Oh, sweetie.

890
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,560
Here you are.

891
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,320
Oh, thank you, Gloria.
Here you go.

892
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,800
I need a cigar. Give me my--
Where are my goddamn cigars?

893
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,800
Perhaps the thieves
also smoke cigars.

894
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,560
It's become so common,
hasn't it?

895
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,640
Who the hell are you?

896
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,320
Detective Alex Tardio...

897
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,240
nineteenth precinct--robbery.

898
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,400
Alex.

899
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,680
That's a...

900
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,520
Here, pumpkin, pumpkin.

901
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,080
I love dogs. I have three
Bichon Frise myself.

902
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,200
I love Bichon Frise.

903
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,040
Lovely, fluffy little--

904
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,400
Come on.

905
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,080
So, how can I help you?

906
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,120
Help me?
I'm here to help you.

907
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,120
Why don't you take it upstairs,
boys?

908
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,720
Hey, listen, uh...

909
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,640
You and your wife
went away together...

910
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,600
to your beach house
just for the one night?

911
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,360
Yeah, that's right.
We're giving it up.

912
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,680
Selling it. I suppose
we were saying good-bye.

913
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,680
We're sentimental.
You know how it is.

914
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,600
I'm a renter.

915
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,360
Why are you selling the house?

916
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,120
It's part of a court
settlement--technical procedure.

917
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,480
-Bankruptcy?
-Technical procedure.

918
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,440
So, let's see.

919
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,200
When did you and your wife...

920
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,000
decide to make this sentimental
journey out to your beach house?

921
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,400
Last night.

922
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,960
We were on our way
to a cocktail party.

923
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,800
-Missy Davidson's party, right?
-Pretty thorough, huh?

924
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,280
That's why I get the big bucks.

925
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,560
Wasn't there something else
that happened...

926
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,760
out at your beach house
recently?

927
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,280
Something else?

928
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,440
A robbery.
Wasn't there a robbery there?

929
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,960
Yeah, yeah. That's--
Yeah, it was a robbery.

930
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,760
I--Well, in all this,
I completely forgot.

931
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,680
Weren't you there? In fact,
weren't you there with--

932
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,680
That was perfectly innocent.

933
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,880
You were there with the burglar,
and it was perfectly innocent?

934
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,400
The burglar, yeah.
I was there with the burglar.

935
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,760
Just me and the burglar.

936
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,960
Scandal and disease, Max.

937
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,800
OK, so,
I read the police report...

938
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,560
and it's all very confusing.

939
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,680
Confusing?

940
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,240
Yes, and they're both
burglaries, aren't they?

941
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,200
You think maybe
it was the same guy?

942
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,840
-I didn't say that, you did.
-Then what are you saying?

943
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,440
Oh, I see
all sorts of scenarios.

944
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,320
That was a good place
for a picture.

945
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,760
Like?

946
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,360
Like there's a house
full of valuable objects...

947
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,280
out at the beach that
you're not supposed to be in...

948
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,120
but you are,
and a burglary occurs.

949
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,120
And then you talk your wife
into leaving this house...

950
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,360
for sentimental reasons...

951
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,200
and when the coast is clear,
it happens again.

952
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,160
Are you suggesting
that I hired a thief...

953
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,600
to burglarize my house...

954
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,920
so I could collect
the insurance money?

955
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,640
I'm not suggesting anything.
You asked for scenarios.

956
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,560
You're the one
that keeps saying things.

957
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,400
Watch it, Mister Detective.

958
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,840
You come into my house
and accuse me of things?

959
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,840
You think I need
the insurance money?

960
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,600
I could buy and sell
a thousand of you.

961
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,920
Here, come on, baby.

962
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,280
The Yorkie
is an independent dog...

963
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
but a devoted companion.

964
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:18,000
And despite his small size...

965
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,160
he is more than willing to act
as a guardian for his master.

966
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,160
Buy and sell a thousand of me?
Really?

967
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,880
Just out of curiosity...

968
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,360
how much would you get
for someone like me?

969
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,080
You know, wholesale like that.

970
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,760
I can't tell
if you're trying to trap me...

971
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,200
or you're looking for a bribe.

972
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,800
What the hell was that?

973
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,040
All right, boys,
let's take a good look around.

974
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,680
Dial Earl.

975
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,720
Incoming!

976
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,480
Earl Radburn,
head of security, T.U.I.

977
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,240
It's Fairbanks.
We got a situation here.

978
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,680
Yes, sir, Mr. Fairbanks.
I'll be there at 1400.

979
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,880
Speak English, Earl.

980
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,040
It's like 2:00, 2:30
at the latest.

981
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,800
All right. Move your fat ass.

982
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,360
What a fruitcake.

983
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,080
$2,500 for a skirt?
What, are you insane?

984
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,680
That's daylight robbery.
It's like I always say, Kevin.

985
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,400
Everybody's in on the game
in their own way. Am I right?

986
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,320
-Sure, you're right.
-See? See? Listen to that.

987
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,040
At least
we're up front about it, OK?

988
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,640
These guys
invite you to Paris...

989
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,080
turn out some 14-year-old models
who look like boys--

990
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,320
I mean,
who am I to judge, right?

991
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,760
Pretty soon you're light
a couple hundred Gs...

992
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,200
flyin' back to Dallas
to your big-assed wife--

993
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,640
Hey, you leave my ass
out of this one.

994
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,560
I was talking about
a hypothetical ass.

995
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,400
See why I married him?
Anybody?

996
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,920
Yo, yo, yo.
I got information on your boy.

997
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,280
Fairbanks has to be
in Washington on Wednesday.

998
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,920
He's appearing before
some Senate subcommittee.

999
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,160
Something about owning
too many television stations...

1000
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,280
in certain key markets.

1001
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,720
It's just a formality, because
from what I can gather...

1002
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,920
he's gonna grease up
the bums on the subcommittee...

1003
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,560
before he even gets there.

1004
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,120
See? It's just like I said.
Everybody's in on the game.

1005
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,920
Then we go to Washington.
Where's he staying?

1006
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,600
Homeboy keeps a crib
across from the Watergate.

1007
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,080
Hold on. I'm coming.

1008
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,160
Oh, no.
No, you're not coming.

1009
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,240
Ann Marie, we're going.

1010
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,160
We should go to Washington.
You're absolutely right.

1011
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,520
Please stay out of this.
Baby stay out of it. Thank you.

1012
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,600
You know what? Bottom line--

1013
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,200
you're not going.

1014
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,360
So nice you could get away
for a couple of days, boo.

1015
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,600
Very sweet of you
to insist, boo.

1016
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,960
Well, we're all here--
Fred, Ethel, Lucy, and Ricky--

1017
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
the Mertzes and Ricardos
go to Washington.

1018
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,960
Lucy, don' do that to me!

1019
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,600
Stress. That's the killer.

1020
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,520
You can't think straight.

1021
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,880
You get all tight and confused.

1022
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,520
Lower.

1023
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,520
That is as low
as I'm gonna go...

1024
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,880
until you make
a commitment, Max.

1025
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,960
You knew I was married...

1026
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,880
when we started
this relationship, Tracey.

1027
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,120
I meant a commitment
to getting me an audition...

1028
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,960
with Entertainment Tonight.

1029
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,040
Oh, that.

1030
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,680
Well, let me be perfectly clear
about that.

1031
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,120
You have no talent.

1032
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,600
What the hell
did you do that for?

1033
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,440
-You have no respect.
-Well, why should I respect you?

1034
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,680
Oh, my head's ringing. Oh, oh!
My whole head is ringing.

1035
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,920
Massaging you
is like kneading dough...

1036
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,520
and as for the sex,
let me be honest.

1037
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,920
It was like sleeping
with a damp sheep.

1038
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,320
Asshole.

1039
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,920
She's just upset
because I'm dumping her.

1040
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,240
Eleven more months
where she came from, sir.

1041
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,720
Right.
What I want to know, Earl...

1042
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,320
is what are you doing
about this schmeggege...

1043
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,720
keeps breaking into my houses?

1044
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,040
I have my people
working on it...

1045
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,640
people you don't need
to know about...

1046
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,320
and if they could find
a certain blue dress...

1047
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,000
and they by God did, they can
find this weasel like that.

1048
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,040
Max, why not just give back
the goddamn ring?

1049
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,480
We've got bigger fish to fry.
It's not your ring.

1050
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,200
-It's not mine?
-No, it's not your ring.

1051
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,200
You stole it. Give it back.

1052
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,400
This wacko breaks into my house
and tries to steal my stuff...

1053
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,960
and this isn't my ring, Walter?

1054
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,400
Spoils of war.

1055
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,160
Spoils of war.
Right. Goddamn right, Earl.

1056
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,840
Max, you've got
a lot of business...

1057
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,840
in gray areas at the moment.

1058
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,040
You're letting a small-timer...

1059
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,800
distract you
from the bigger picture.

1060
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,280
Sometimes you have to give back
a little to get a lot.

1061
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,600
It ain't gonna happen, Walter.
It is not gonna happen.

1062
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,640
I want to go home!

1063
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,480
What does this look like,
a taxi?

1064
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,080
Dial Lutetia.

1065
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,840
Ah! Now we're in business.

1066
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,800
OK.
To hell with the monuments.

1067
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,800
Here we go. Savvy shopping
in the nation's capital.

1068
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,640
We're gonna go to Georgetown.
You're gonna freak out.

1069
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,320
Oh, man, it's a bad angle.

1070
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,360
I can't get a clear look
at his place from here.

1071
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,200
So, hey, how are you guys
gonna get past the doorman?

1072
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,280
Nothin' fancy.

1073
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,600
Just stroll right in
like we own the place.

1074
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,240
Welcome to Potomac House.

1075
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,680
Our apartments
on the east side...

1076
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,840
have magnificent views
of the capitol.

1077
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,240
Our penthouse suites
are five thousand square feet...

1078
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,760
and have three hundred and sixty
degree vistas...

1079
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,760
but, of course, there...

1080
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,880
we're talking about
quite a bit of money.

1081
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,640
Salaam. Salaam. Kuwait.

1082
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,240
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I most humbly apologize.

1083
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,840
However, there seems
to be a confusion...

1084
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,200
because the prince
would like to know...

1085
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,880
how much
for the entire building.

1086
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,920
Wait. Let me see is correct.

1087
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,040
-Hassim yassi.
-Correct.

1088
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,600
I'm not sure that's possible.

1089
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,960
Get up! Oh, maladar! Ah-kleck!

1090
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,480
Salaam, salaam, salaam.
He say, "For right amount...

1091
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,840
camel can dance up pyramid."

1092
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,360
It loses something
in translation.

1093
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,840
Why don't you take the elevator
up to the penthouse suite...

1094
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,120
and I'll gather
some of my people together...

1095
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,480
and meet you up there.

1096
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
Make yourselves at home.

1097
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,600
It may be your home.

1098
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,360
Home.

1099
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,040
Go.
Give her big bug, beef jerky?

1100
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,000
Mine, all mine.

1101
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,440
He say
he would like to hump you...

1102
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,920
but we are
on a very tight schedule.

1103
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,000
Salaam aleichem.

1104
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,880
Come on, Berger.

1105
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,120
Is anybody home?

1106
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,080
What are you looking at?

1107
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,040
Nothing. You just look great
in a tablecloth, man.

1108
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,160
Not a lot of people
could pull it off.

1109
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,560
I mean, look at Arafat.
I mean, look at me.

1110
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,160
I look like
I should be driving a cab.

1111
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,480
Damn.
So this is Max's D.C. pad, huh?

1112
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,240
Mebala.

1113
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,840
Maxie? Maxie waxie?

1114
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,640
Your friends are here.

1115
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,840
-Watch your step, sir.
-Whoa! I'm all right.

1116
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,320
We'll meet back at my place
to prep for the hearing.

1117
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,000
All right, Max.

1118
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,200
Earl, you call me the minute
you hear anything, you got it?

1119
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,520
On it.

1120
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,200
Wonder where lard-ass is.

1121
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,480
Hello? Are you there?

1122
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,040
Max, it's Gloria.

1123
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,840
Pick up, Max.

1124
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,240
We're in the clear.
It's the phone.

1125
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,520
Are you there?

1126
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,000
Well, I just wanted to let you
know the money is in your desk.

1127
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,040
I mean, the contributions
for the senators.

1128
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,920
You may want to call me
for a reading with the cards.

1129
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,080
It's a PAC,
just like Shelly said.

1130
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,680
You still need me for the cards,
don't you, baby?

1131
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,440
So sad.

1132
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,320
The marrying maiden.

1133
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,920
What the hell's
that got to do with me?

1134
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,880
The ring.

1135
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,120
The thief.

1136
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,320
The castle.

1137
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,280
The thief is in the castle.
Dial Earl.

1138
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,160
Got it. Here they are.

1139
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,720
Look at that.

1140
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,000
See, you can't outright
just bribe these senators.

1141
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,000
You gotta give the money
to these PACs.

1142
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,800
PACs. I don't know.
It stands for something.

1143
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,080
Why don't you just save it
for the senators?

1144
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,320
-Wait. Wait, wait.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

1145
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,480
Earl, he's in my place.
He's at my apartment.

1146
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,840
Get the cops
and meet me over there.

1147
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,760
I'm going up the back way.

1148
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,920
Welcome back, Mr. Fairbanks.

1149
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,040
"...this, and eat shit.
Love, Max."

1150
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,680
A hundred and fifteen thousand
dollars cash.

1151
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,120
-The greatest crime.
-Maybe we should go, huh?

1152
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,440
What, and leave the ring?

1153
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,200
-Welcome back, Mr. Radburn.
-Not now.

1154
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,880
-Come on, let's go. Come on.
-Stop worrying, OK?

1155
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,000
I gotta get this ring.

1156
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,800
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have a prison record.

1157
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,880
I got some good undershirts,
didn't I?

1158
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,120
Oh, my God. Kevin.

1159
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,280
I told you,
let's get out of here.

1160
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,400
What?

1161
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,760
-I knew this was gonna happen.
-Berger's got his pager. Hold on.

1162
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,280
God, I'm hard.

1163
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,240
Earl Radburn,
head of security, T.U.I.

1164
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,360
Come on, let's go out the back.

1165
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,000
It's me, you idiot.

1166
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,280
Sorry,
but they went out the back!

1167
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,080
I came up the back. Moron.

1168
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,160
Oh, my goodness.
Well, you have to hold it in.

1169
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,880
-Let's get the hell out of here!
-Going out the back, huh?

1170
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,520
I'm gonna call the cell phone.

1171
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,720
Come on. We got the money.
Let's go, let's go.

1172
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,840
You really need help, man,
I'm telling you.

1173
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,080
Aah! Oh, you got me!

1174
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,760
-Berger, what's going on?
-Take a good look at me, huh?

1175
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,920
It's kind of hard to describe.
Look, I gotta go.

1176
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,520
Talk to me!

1177
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,760
Yeah, look at you,
falling all over yourself. Ah!

1178
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,600
You brought it--Aah!

1179
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,040
Look at you! Oh!

1180
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,240
The wrong damn ring?

1181
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,120
Amber,
I got the wrong finger, OK?

1182
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,760
His damn wedding ring.

1183
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,120
Baby, say something.

1184
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,160
You ain't said a word to me
since we left Washington.

1185
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,520
Can I get some convo?

1186
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,440
OK. I have never been so scared
in my whole life.

1187
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,080
All right, now, calm down, OK?

1188
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,560
I know it was sort of unusual.

1189
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,600
Unusual?
Oh, come on, Kevin.

1190
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,840
There were guns.
There were cops.

1191
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,080
Well, it's really not that bad
when you're in the middle of it.

1192
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,520
You know, your adrenaline
gets to pumping so hard...

1193
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,800
you really don't think about--

1194
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,920
-The consequences?
-Yeah, yeah, the consequences.

1195
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,640
Kevin, this has got to stop.

1196
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,080
You don't need to prove
that you love me.

1197
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,520
I know you do...

1198
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,960
and I don't care about that
stupid ring, do you hear me?

1199
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,440
I just want you.

1200
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,920
Well, then, don't worry.
You got me.

1201
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,640
So you'll forget
about the ring, then?

1202
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,800
Amber,
I'll forget about the ring.

1203
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,600
It's forgotten.

1204
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,280
Excuse me!

1205
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,960
Hey, what's up, girls?
How you doin'?

1206
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,120
Sorry.

1207
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,560
Yo, Jack. It's after 7:00.

1208
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,040
You seen your nephew
by the name of Kevin?

1209
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,160
No. What your rappin' ass
want with him?

1210
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,680
Later, man.

1211
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,120
Son of a bitch crazy.

1212
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,760
-That's twice you ran out on me.
-I know, but I'm sor--

1213
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,280
Oh, it was funny how you never
cramp up when you gotta run.

1214
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,640
Kevin, I got low potassium, man.
When I don't eat my bananas...

1215
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,200
I cramp up, dog. You know that.
Come on, man.

1216
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,440
Wait. What are you gonna do
with that doughnut?

1217
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,240
Oh, you want this?
Run get that.

1218
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,640
Yo, Kev,
thanks for the breakfast, man.

1219
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,640
-Here. You got that?
-No doubt.

1220
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,320
Hey, come on. Let's see it.
Let's see it, man.

1221
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,960
All right, cool.
Bam! Done!

1222
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,880
See? I came through, man.
If it wasn't for me...

1223
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,360
That's what so great
about this country.

1224
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,640
We're hand in hand,
synergistically...

1225
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,760
going forward into the future.

1226
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,160
That's the way it is.
It's give and take...

1227
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,240
and that's the way we feel
at T.U.I.

1228
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,640
You make a compelling point,
Mr. Fairbanks. Please continue.

1229
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,320
Thank you, senator.
As I was saying...

1230
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,600
restrictive monopoly laws...

1231
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,320
are choking communications
companies like mine.

1232
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,080
If T.U.I. can dominate a market,
why hold us back?

1233
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,320
T.U.I. provides employment...

1234
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,840
which in turn provides
tax revenues...

1235
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,440
in large markets
and in small alike.

1236
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,120
I contend that the laws
that limit ownership...

1237
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,880
of television stations by
telecommunications companies...

1238
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,440
are punitive and wrong.

1239
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,280
What's with Mount Rushmore
up there?

1240
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,520
Guess who, shit box.

1241
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,040
Ooh, it's the little thief.

1242
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,280
I beg your pardon?

1243
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,560
No, I'm not talking to you.

1244
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,760
Oh, man, I made, what,
two hundred grand robbing you?

1245
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,160
I wouldn't call that
"little" anything.

1246
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,480
State of mind.

1247
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,280
What are you yammering about,
Mr. Fairbanks?

1248
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,560
I'm not talking to you.
Excuse me.

1249
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,760
Well, let me tell you
what state of mind I'm in.

1250
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,320
My lady's getting sick and tired
of this whole thing...

1251
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,480
so I thought it would be easier
for the both of us...

1252
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,360
if you just
give me back my ring...

1253
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,680
and I give you back yours.

1254
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,880
Now, nod your head...

1255
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,960
'cause I'm watching
your little ass on TV.

1256
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,160
TV? Which camera? This camera?

1257
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Exactly. That one right there.

1258
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,320
Hold your head up...

1259
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,400
'cause you got that
double chin thing happening.

1260
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,800
Damn, that's cold.

1261
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,480
Take a good look,
you [Bleep] asshole.

1262
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,760
Does this look like the face
of a man who got where he is...

1263
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,160
by giving [bleep] away?
[Bleep] you.

1264
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,960
Mr. Fairbanks.

1265
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,720
Cussing on TV. He cussing on TV.
He dying.

1266
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,280
I think he's angry.
I think he's perturbed.

1267
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,920
-Mr. Fairbanks--
-Walter--

1268
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,040
-Hang up the phone!
-Mr. Fairbanks!

1269
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,160
Just a minute.

1270
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
It looks like the face of a man
who don't have a damn clue.

1271
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,240
-I took your PAC money.
-Oh, yeah?

1272
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,920
That's why all those little
fat white asses...

1273
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,080
ain't rolling over for you.

1274
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,120
Mr. Fairbanks,
a little respect, please.

1275
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,680
-Just a minute.
-Now, you give me my ring...

1276
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,640
-and I'll leave you alone.
-I'm addressing you.

1277
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,920
Well, you know what you can do,
scumbucket?

1278
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,280
-You can [bleep] my [bleep].
-Mr. Fairbanks!

1279
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,080
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

1280
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,520
C-SPAN's gotten better.

1281
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,680
All right, that's it.

1282
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,560
The ring's
coming off your finger...

1283
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,920
if I got to cut it off.

1284
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,080
Oh, yeah? [Bleep] you
and [bleep] your girlfriend.

1285
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,400
My girlfriend?

1286
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,920
This is a senate subcommittee,
Mr. Fairbanks.

1287
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,800
[Bleep] you, [bleep] you,
[bleep] you.

1288
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,280
I love democracy.

1289
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,240
That's what I call
entertainment.

1290
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,320
I told you this no-good gonif...

1291
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,600
was gonna make
a fool out of you.

1292
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,800
Look what you've done
over a stupid goddamn ring.

1293
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,120
I could've fixed the PAC thing.
You blew a whole market.

1294
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,400
You blew millions.
I hope you're satisfied.

1295
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,840
Walter, why don't you
go see a doctor...

1296
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,760
and ask him if he can find
some ghostly outline...

1297
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:13,960
where your balls used to be...

1298
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,360
and then plead with him
to stitch another pair back on?

1299
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,640
Stop the car, please.

1300
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,360
What?

1301
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,280
Max, I have been your lawyer
for twenty years.

1302
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,240
I have taken
your degrading insults...

1303
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,400
and your petty mockeries.

1304
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,400
I have stood by you...

1305
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,440
while you've bent the law and
while you've broken the law...

1306
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:38,560
because there's
something fascinating...

1307
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,920
in seeing how low you can go...

1308
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,440
and I felt a genuine kind
of pity for someone so driven.

1309
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,680
But if you're gonna continue...

1310
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,200
to play
this idiotic schoolyard game...

1311
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,280
over a cheap and ugly,
by the way, ring...

1312
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,400
this is the end of the line.
I am getting off the bus.

1313
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,000
Limo.

1314
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,600
Screw you, Max,
and the limo you rode in on.

1315
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,240
Where are you going?

1316
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,000
Come on. Get back in the car.

1317
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,960
Go with him. Go with him.
Walter.

1318
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,120
Come on.

1319
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,280
You can't walk all the way home.
What are you going to do?

1320
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,000
Guess I went a little
too far this time, Earl.

1321
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,160
Yes, sir.

1322
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,400
-You've been hacked.
-What?

1323
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,600
One of my people found out...

1324
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,640
our "friend" has been able
to track your whereabouts...

1325
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,600
by intercepting your e-mails.

1326
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,800
Why, that little son of a--

1327
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,640
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This could be good, Earl.

1328
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,280
Yeah, because now we can
control the situation.

1329
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,880
We can let him know exactly
what we want him to know.

1330
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:44,240
Bring him right to us.

1331
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,160
You're one crafty bastard, Earl.

1332
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,920
Thank you, sir.

1333
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,800
If the boys at the Pentagon
had had your faith in me...

1334
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,760
there'd be a Disney World
in Cuba right now.

1335
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,080
All right. Go on.

1336
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,360
The driver gave us a pretty good
description of the robbers.

1337
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,520
Too good. I've done some costume
design in community theater...

1338
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,640
so I've seen my share
of bad acting.

1339
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,000
Assign one of our people...

1340
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,600
to shadow
the driver and his assistant.

1341
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,040
It's too tempting when one is
around that much cash every day.

1342
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,400
You got it, detective.

1343
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,760
Oh, there he is. Hey, Tardio.

1344
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,440
Got all these files you asked
for concerning Fairbanks.

1345
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,360
-Thank you, Jerry.
-No problem.

1346
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,000
Didn't I see you at the Ice
Capades show last Monday?

1347
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,480
Come on, Tardio.
I don't do Ice Capades.

1348
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,280
The shoes say butch,
but the socks say...

1349
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,760
"Hi, how you doin'?"

1350
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,080
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey, baby.

1351
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,480
-Where's Amber?
-She asked for the day off.

1352
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,000
I knew she was upset.

1353
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,200
Amber got a pretty good
head on her shoulders.

1354
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,360
Maybe you need to listen
to what she has to say.

1355
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,720
You don't even like Amber.

1356
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,720
Amber and I happen to agree
on this one...

1357
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,920
so therefore I say she OK.

1358
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,800
-But?
-But?

1359
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,400
But you making this thing
personal with this Fairbanks...

1360
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,080
and that's bad for business.

1361
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,840
And that's the first thing
I taught you about this game.

1362
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,760
Kevin, I got two words for you.

1363
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,720
-Bankruptcy auction.
-What?

1364
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,000
I just got off the phone
with Shelly.

1365
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,120
-He hacked into their e-mail.
-Talk to me.

1366
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,600
Fairbanks is gonna be
at his beach house...

1367
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,280
for a bankruptcy auction
the day after tomorrow...

1368
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,560
and after, he's gonna be out of
the country for a couple months.

1369
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,120
Leave it alone, son.
This is your old uncle Jack.

1370
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,400
If you only listen to me
one time...

1371
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,720
for the rest of your life,
listen to me now.

1372
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,760
Take it from a man
who raised you from a pup.

1373
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,360
Let it go. I seen other guys
go down the road you're going...

1374
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,720
and you know
what they call that? Dead end.

1375
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,600
Let it go, Kevin.
Goddamn, Kevin, let it go.

1376
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,280
Seven million dollars worth
of art, jewelry, and antiques.

1377
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,200
I'll drive. Hand me my keys over
there, right underneath there.

1378
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,800
Come on, Lutetia.
Don't worry about it.

1379
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,520
Nobody even watches
these hearings. Excuse me.

1380
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,080
You've gone too far, Max.
Swearing on TV?

1381
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,240
You make a fool
out of yourself...

1382
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,040
publicly humiliate
the both of us...

1383
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,480
and put your entire company
at risk, for what?

1384
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,320
Some trinket
out of a crackerjack box?

1385
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,440
Look, when I catch
this little putz--

1386
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,560
Don't come home, Max.

1387
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,760
-What?
-You're a jerk. Grow up.

1388
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,600
Where's my lover? All right.

1389
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,160
Berger was looking for you.

1390
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,840
He found me.

1391
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,120
How you doin'?

1392
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,760
You're going, aren't you?

1393
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,480
Look, Amber,
you gave me something.

1394
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,480
I lost it.
I can't have that between us.

1395
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,320
Well, I would much rather
have that between us...

1396
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,560
than two inches of glass
at some state prison.

1397
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,000
I'm sorry, you know?
A man in my position--

1398
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,040
You know, you have always
said this is about me.

1399
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,840
This has never been
anything more...

1400
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,440
than a juvenile
dick-measuring contest.

1401
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,200
Wait a minute. If this was
a dick-measuring contest...

1402
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,320
I'd be declared the winner.

1403
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,720
Baby elephant trunk.

1404
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,400
Baby, I'm just playing.

1405
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,480
You know
I'm just messing with you.

1406
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,720
Kevin, grow up.

1407
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,520
He's making me nuts. I don't
know what to do with him.

1408
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,880
-So, what's the pre-nup like?
-There isn't one.

1409
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,440
Then divorce him.
Cream the bastard.

1410
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,400
Oh, I don't know. I don't know
what this says about me...

1411
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,000
but I'm kind of fond
of the old dog.

1412
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,520
I mean, s--

1413
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,960
-Is Jack inside?
-I think so.

1414
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,880
Man trouble?

1415
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,800
It's always man trouble.

1416
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,520
Well, now you got
woman trouble, too.

1417
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,040
That's my jacket.
What are you doing with it?

1418
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,560
-You're the thief's wife.
-The thief?

1419
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,720
-Your husband stole my ring.
-What?

1420
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,400
That was my ring,
and I gave it to my boyfriend.

1421
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,280
You want your jacket?
Have your jacket.

1422
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,560
Wait a minute.

1423
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,600
Pull daddy like a chariot.

1424
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,360
Look, kids.
Oh, what a beautiful child!

1425
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,760
-Thanks.
-Boy? Girl? Doesn't matter.

1426
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,960
Lovely child. So innocent.

1427
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,640
Damn. Where's that lens?

1428
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,120
-What a nice surprise.
-Yes, it is, isn't it?

1429
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,760
Hey, you feel like
taking a walk?

1430
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,520
Sounds good,
but I got to go see an optician.

1431
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,920
Yeah. You know, right now
my eye is acting up.

1432
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,800
You're a little blurry
right now.

1433
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,360
Really? Is that blurry?

1434
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,120
Uh, no. I see that just fine.

1435
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,040
That's good. Relax, would you?

1436
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,760
This is just an overlap
of two connected worlds.

1437
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,960
You never cross your line,
I never cross mine.

1438
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,320
Know what I mean, Kevin?

1439
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,160
-Damn!
-Just gas. Poor little thing.

1440
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,880
Even in the outdoors, huh?

1441
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,800
So what's new, Kevin?

1442
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,240
Uh, nothing.
Just playing at golf.

1443
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,040
Doing that Tiger Woods thing.

1444
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,200
You?

1445
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,960
Oh, busy. There's still
a lot of crime out there.

1446
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,040
Well, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

1447
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,680
Especially
after all your efforts.

1448
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,320
It can be time-consuming.

1449
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,200
I guess that's why I never
took up a sport like you.

1450
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,280
Although for some reason...

1451
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,240
I've always been drawn
to figure skating.

1452
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,080
Speaking of crime, do you know
what crime I hate the most?

1453
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,720
-Insurance fraud.
-Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1454
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,960
Because the crook is using me.

1455
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,480
"Oh, detective,
they took everything...

1456
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,040
"and here's the list
of the stolen items...

1457
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,160
"and can I have
that docket number...

1458
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,480
"so I can claim
my insurance money?"

1459
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,840
Nothing makes me angrier
than trying to solve a case...

1460
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,600
that never happened.

1461
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,600
So you think you got a burglary
that doesn't smell right?

1462
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,120
Big townhouse. Beacon Hill.

1463
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,000
I'm wondering if the arrogant
son of a bitch bankrupt bum...

1464
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,120
who owns the place

1465
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,840
maybe didn't set it up himself.

1466
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,440
Yeah, well...

1467
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,040
I didn't--I didn't hear nothing
about no scam...

1468
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,200
but if I do, I'll let you know.

1469
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,000
Do you still blink when you're
not telling the truth, Kevin?

1470
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,400
Must be the contact lenses.
Walkies.

1471
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,640
Come on, Pix.
We gotta get you a bran muffin.

1472
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,800
We're getting everybody
bran muffins. Good, good.

1473
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,320
Be cool.

1474
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,640
Mr. Man.

1475
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,760
Gloria, what the hell
are you doing here?

1476
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,160
I drove out here because there's
something I need to tell you.

1477
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,200
Here, pick one.

1478
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,920
Any one.

1479
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,920
-Yep. There it is again.
-What does it mean?

1480
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,440
The guy's got five daggers
in his head.

1481
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,680
What do you think it means?

1482
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,240
How bad is it?

1483
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,080
I guess a guy with six daggers
in his head would be worse...

1484
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,320
but they don't make that card.

1485
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,560
It just keeps coming up.

1486
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,120
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

1487
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,800
Would you have listened to me?
Do you ever listen to anybody?

1488
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,640
Max, put a stop to all of this.
No good is gonna come of it.

1489
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,160
-I can't.
-Why?

1490
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,280
I can't, I can't, I can't!

1491
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,680
Once a man in my position
gives in...

1492
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,080
lets his defenses down...

1493
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,040
is weak for one single moment,
he's dead.

1494
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,240
Dead, you understand?

1495
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,840
That's the way it is
with animals in the jungle...

1496
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,000
that's the way it is with me.

1497
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,200
Oh, cut the crap, Max.
It's only a ring.

1498
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,960
A silly, stupid ring!

1499
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,600
Yeah, and a bone
is just a bone...

1500
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,400
until two lions decide...

1501
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,520
that only one of them
is gonna walk away with it.

1502
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,880
You know what your problem is?
You always have to win.

1503
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,320
You figure out
what it is you want...

1504
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,840
and then you'll do anything
to get it...

1505
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,000
and when you get it,
you toss it aside...

1506
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,400
and move on to the next thing.

1507
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,720
I loved you, Max.

1508
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,360
I knew who you were,
and I still loved you.

1509
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,440
Who else can say that?

1510
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,440
You know who you are, and you
can barely tolerate yourself.

1511
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,960
Nobody talks to me that way.
Nobody.

1512
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,360
-I do!
-That turns me on.

1513
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,720
No! Get off me!

1514
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,480
Ow! What?

1515
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,000
You're doing it again,
you horny little bastard.

1516
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,960
Give me a hand.
You hurt my back.

1517
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,280
No. I quit, Max.
Good-bye.

1518
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,760
Come on. Glor--

1519
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,360
You quit?
You're fired!

1520
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,920
There goes
your medical and your dental!

1521
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,800
You know what? I don't need it.

1522
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,080
And I don't need you.

1523
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,560
All right.

1524
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,160
-Hello, hello.
-Buzz off.

1525
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,320
I was--

1526
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,800
Compound secure, chief.

1527
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,640
Come here.

1528
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,520
I am so flattered, sir.

1529
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,640
I've thought about this, too.
More than once.

1530
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,840
But honestly,
an employer and employee--

1531
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,120
what are the percentages?

1532
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,960
I just want you to help me up.
I hurt my back.

1533
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,920
That was a joke, by the way,
and--and a good one.

1534
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,320
Goddamn vultures
are starting to circle.

1535
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,680
Make yourselves at home,
scumbags!

1536
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,800
Calm down, Max. You're gonna
give yourself a coronary.

1537
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,680
I don't have coronaries.
I give them.

1538
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,160
Well, I know
this is tough for you...

1539
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,520
so I just called
to wish you well.

1540
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,480
My therapist won't be happy
about that, but what can I say?

1541
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,920
I have a soft spot for you.

1542
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,200
Well, thanks, Lutetia,
I appreciate it.

1543
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,440
You might be an asshole, Max,
but you're my asshole.

1544
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,320
Thanks again.

1545
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,720
-Masseuse.
-I didn't order a masseuse.

1546
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,960
I sent her over.

1547
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,720
I thought you might need
to relax.

1548
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,200
You sent me a masseuse?

1549
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,800
The therapeutic kind, Max...

1550
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:30,280
not the kind you're used to.

1551
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,200
I-I'll call you later, Lutetia.
Thanks.

1552
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,560
It's all right, sweetie.

1553
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,120
I'll get back
and check the tube, sir.

1554
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,280
We're gonna nail this thief...

1555
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,560
just so bad
you won't even believe it.

1556
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,360
Yeah, yeah, go nail him.

1557
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,240
About last night,
I just want you to know--

1558
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,760
-Get out of here!
-All right, sir.

1559
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,360
Yes. I'll do it.

1560
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,640
Wonderful.

1561
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,760
Yeah, come here, baby.

1562
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,240
Must go walkies in the park
one day--

1563
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,480
my dogs and yours.

1564
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,920
-Excuse me.
-Go away.

1565
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,520
Can't do it, sir.

1566
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,800
Sorry, sir.
I heard the groaning...

1567
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,760
but I'm afraid we need you.
The auction's about to start.

1568
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,480
-Any sign of him?
-Not yet.

1569
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,480
Would you like
a little massage oil?

1570
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,240
Ooh, yeah.
A little massage oil.

-Hey, how's it going?
-Good.

1573
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,120
Coconut shrimps are flying
like hotcakes. Hey, wait.

1574
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,480
You hitting that champagne?
Your eyes look funny.

1575
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,880
No, it's my allergies.

1576
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,120
Don't get up.

1577
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,280

please take your seats.

1579
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,880
Mr. Boyle regrets
that he cannot be here...

1580
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,680

as planned...

1581

Hmm? This wonderful

01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,160
Daytona Rolex watch?

1636
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,920
Will you slow down?

1637
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,040
Look, it's almost 2:00.
You gotta move your fat ass.

1638
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,280
Hey, that hurts my feelings.

1639
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,480
Oh, what feelings?
You got no feelings.

1640
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,520
-I lost ten pounds today!
-Yeah? Where, your toenails?

1641
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,600
-Just give me the box.

1642
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,120

We'll start the bidding

1647
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,440
Do I hear ten thousand dollars?

1648
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,480
Yo, big Max, now it's on.

1649
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,320
It's 2:00,
and it's time for the bomb.

1650
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,960
Hey, how you doing?

1651
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,600
Listen, Max...

1652
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,280
I'm sure by the time you see
this you're gonna be pissed...

1653
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,520
but I want to thank you...

1654
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,800
for having a brother
back at your beach house.

1655
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,160
I'd like to report a fire
at the Fairbanks estate.

1656
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,440
Twenty-five Harbor Heights
in Marblehead.

1657
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:25,760
Big fire.
Fire!

1658
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,280
You son of a--

1659

Are you ready for the mayhem?
Bam!

1663
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,240
Hustle, boys, hustle!

1664
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,120
Come on. Come on.

1665
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:01,800
Where is he?

1666
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,320
Didn't I tell you
you could do it?

1667
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,960
Look at the mess I caused.
Wait'll I tell the kids.

1668
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,120
Tell them, tell them.

1669
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,000
Hey, with this watch I can move
into a white neighborhood now.

1670
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,120
-Probably.
-Pull this truck out!

1671
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,040
-Come on, let's go!
-Yes, sir. Where's Kevin?

1672
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,120
Just go, just go.
He's used to it, trust me.

1673
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,200
-Fellas, we rich.
-Yeah, we're rich!

1674
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,640
-Filthy rich.
-I can't believe it!

1675
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,800
I deserve it!

1676
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,640
# It's the underground kid,
# I be hacking from the van

1677
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,280
# And everywhere I go they

# Yo, Shelly Nix the man,

1679
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,560
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?!

1680
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,560
Where the hell is he?

1681
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,600
No, get off of me!
No, leave me alone!

1682
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,960
I'm looking for somebody.

1683
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,800
Let go of me! Let go of me!

1684
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,800
Max! Oh, I love this. Max!

1685
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,320
I'm sorry, Max.

1686
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,880
I'm all right, OK?

1687
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:49,960
You understand? I'm OK!

1688
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,320
Jesus!

1689
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:59,920
Son of a...

1690
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,840
bitch!

1691
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,280
You think you're getting away.

1692
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,400
Your ass is mine!

1693
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,320
Your ass is mine!

1694
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,960
Stinking thief!

1695
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,560
Oh, my!

1696
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,320
You're not getting away.

1697
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,920
-Get off me!
-Give to me!

1698
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,960
Give me it, you son of a bitch!

1699
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,920
Give me that ring.

1700
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,480
-Oh, shit! Man!
-There's water!

1701
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,120
Wait, wait. This ain't the ring.

1702
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,360
-Wait are you trying to pull?
-That ain't the ring!

1703
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,760
What do you mean,
that ain't the ring?

1704
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,880
Whoa, water!

1705
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,600
-Look.
-What?

1706
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,040
-This has an inscription inside.
-Inscription?

1707
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,320
Yeah, it says, "Grow up."

1708
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,080
My lady said that to me.

1709
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,360
My wife told me the same thing.

1710
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,400
Damn! Lutetia did this.

1711
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,920
She got that masseuse to oil it
right off my finger.

1712
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,560
You--you joking, right?

1713
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,080
Let me see that.

1714
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,320
We're going down, man.

1715
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:46,040
Max Fairbanks?

1716
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,600
Max Fairbanks?
That's right. It's me...

1717
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,960
and I'm arresting you
under suspicion...

1718
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,520
of bankruptcy
and insurance fraud.

1719
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,920
Prove it!

1720
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,240
Oh! A woman scorned.

1721
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,560
Kevin Caffrey.

1722
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,600
Is that you?

1723
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,720
Hey! What up, Tardio?

1724
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,320
Kevin, what are you doing here?

1725
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,040
Well, uh...

1726
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,040
I swam out...

1727
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,400
when I saw that my fellow man
was in trouble.

1728
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,200
He's a total stranger.

1729
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:40,080
Never saw him before!
Trés bizarre.

1730
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,560
Oh, yes. Trés bizarre.

1731
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,200
Not as bizarre as you.

1732
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,080
Thanks, Max.
I owe you one, man.

1733
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,400
Ah, don't mention it.

1734
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:53,040
You and me,
we both love the game.

1735
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,120
There's no need to be penalized
for that.

1736
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,480
OK, come to Tardio.

1737
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,880
Go get 'em, boys and girls.

1738
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,240
-Yes, sir.
-OK.

1739
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,840
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, hey, nothing.

1740
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,520
That's my man. Go get her.

1741
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,040
You? The masseuse?

1742
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,800
I massaged that baby right off
his hairy little finger.

1743
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,880
His wife and I
decided you two had it coming.

1744
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,320
You're amazing.

1745
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,200
See that ring?

1746
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,960
I think it's got
the wrong kind of luck.

1747
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,640
-Throw it away.
-Throw it away?

1748
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,680
-We worked so hard to--
-Throw it away.

1749
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,240
Gone.

1750
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,880
This is Kerry Kilbride
reporting from Washington...

1751
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,280
where just moments ago
a Senate committee ended...

1752
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,080
its long-standing
investigation...

1753
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,760
into the alleged media
and broadcasting monopoly...

1754
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,360
of billionaire businessman
Max Fairbanks.

1755
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,080
Through a series of quick and
effective legal maneuverings...

1756
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,600
Mr. Fairbanks
and his attorney...

1757
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,560
have taken
the wind out of the sails...

1758
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,680
of the Senate committee.

1759
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,040
Shook 'em down.

1760
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,960
Brother hoodwinked
the entire Senate committee.

1761
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,240
That's my boy.

1762
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,680
Put on your rubber boots,
'cause here comes the bullshit.

1763
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,640
We now go directly to the scene
with Tracey Kimberly.

1764
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,840
This is Tracey Kimberly...

1765
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,640
reporting live
from the capitol...

1766
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:35,280
where we have just witnessed
a stunning turn of events...

1767
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,360
orchestrated by
a relatively unknown lawyer...

1768
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,400
from the firm
of Whiteman, Small, Johnson.

1769
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,680
-Whiteman, Small, Johnson?
-What do you mean by that?

1770
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,880
Here he comes now.

1771
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,000
Oh, look! That's my boy!
Look, he on TV?

1772
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,480
Yo, look at that!
He got that big--

1773
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,000
Oh, no, he didn't!

1774
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,160
I'd like to say
power to the people.

1775
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,080
Let's rise up.
A quick shout out to my mama.

1776
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,560
Mama, I love you.

1777
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,800
Mr. Fairbanks,
do you have a statement?

1778
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
I was dragged through the mud...

1779
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,920
I was tarred and feathered
in the streets.

1780
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,800
-Can we get an "Oop" up in here?
-Up in here!

1781
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,080
I was bent over and stuffed
like a Christmas goose.

1782
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,360
Can I get an "Ouch!
That's hurts"?

1783
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,960
Ouch! That hurts!

1784
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,840
But in the end,
the senators saw the truth--

1785
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,800
that I'm an honest
and legitimate businessman.

1786
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,160
Counselor, what exactly was your
game plan going in there today?

1787
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,920
Well, my brethren...

1788
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,000
I'm not one to stand up here
and conversate out of my ass...

1789
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,480
nor am I gonna stand up here
and jerk you all off.

1790
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,560
Besides the precedents
of Roe vs. Wade...

1791
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,400
uh, my Uncle Ray-Ray
vs. the Dairy Queen...

1792
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,680
I knew I had to get it
on the inside...

1793
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,800
to the big man
for the easy lay-up.

1794
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,480
I am full of de facto...

1795
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,120
habeas corpus
emancipation proclamation.

1796
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,400
I also have
a very, very big pro bono.

1797
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,440
Baby, it runs in the family.

1798
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,360
What do you believe changed
the senators' minds?

1799
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,400
Fourscore, darling!

1800
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,960
Yeah, I mean, hey,
everybody makes mistakes...

1801
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,560
even senators.

1802
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,680
Are you implying
there were improprieties...

1803
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,040
on behalf of the senators?

1804
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,720
Hey, man, I am a black male...

1805
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,400
not a blackmailer.

1806
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,720
Nobody's perfect.

1807
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,920
Isn't that right,
Senator Richards?

1808
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,080
-Senator Richards!
-Senator!

1809
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,600
Well, heh heh! I owe you one.

1810
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,200
Yeah. Hey, don't mention it.

1811
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,800
You just take care of yourself.

1812
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,240
-Hey, right on.
-Right on!

1813
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,040
What a guy.

1814
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,760
Son of a bitch!

1815
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,680
You stole my lucky watch!

1816
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,480
