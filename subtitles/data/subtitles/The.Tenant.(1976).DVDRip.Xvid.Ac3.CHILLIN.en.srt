1
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:36,316
Quiet, Mirza.
Mirza, quiet now.

2
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,085
Afternoon, madame.

3
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,149
- Yes, what is it?
- I'm sorry to bother you.

4
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,424
I was told about an apartment.

5
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:51,464
This is the right building
though, isn't it?

6
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,471
Who told you?

7
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,564
A friend of mine.

8
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:58,371
Uh, well, a relation, actually.

9
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,639
- The door.
- Sorry.

10
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,044
I gather it's a small
two-room apartment.

11
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:06,050
Think that's all I got to do?

12
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:09,053
Some people think a concierge
is a slave.

13
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,055
Not me, not me, I assure you.

14
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,853
Would it be more convenient
if I came back later?

15
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:17,453
Anyway, you have to
speak with Monsieur Zy.

16
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,931
- I can only show the apartment.
- I don't want to be a nuisance...

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,128
but if it were at all possible...

18
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,707
and if I might offer you some...

19
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,139
small compensation for your
trouble which is only reasonable.

20
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:39,046
What a lovely little doggie you are.

21
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,518
You're Mirza, aren't you?

22
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,456
It's a nice name, Mirza.

23
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,805
I'm sorry.

24
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,846
The previous tenant
threw herself out of the window.

25
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,358
You can still see where she fell.

26
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,129
Look.

27
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,528
He's gonna have to fix that.

28
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,096
She's not dead yet...

29
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,267
though she might as well be.

30
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,642
She's in the Bretonneau hospital.

31
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,204
What if she gets better?

32
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:53,080
Don't worry.
She won't get better.

33
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,484
You know,
you're onto a good thing here.

34
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,648
Poor woman.
What are the terms? Do you know?

35
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,625
Well, there's a fee for the water.
All the plumbing is new.

36
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,424
You used to have to go out
to the landing to get water.

37
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,430
- And the toilet?
- It's right over there.

38
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:09,956
You just go around the corridor,
and there it is.

39
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:13,732
That's a view worth looking at.

40
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,511
How much is the premium?

41
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:23,173
The rent is 600 francs a month.

42
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,582
Uh, the premium,
I'm not sure about.

43
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,917
I think he wants 5,000 francs.

44
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,550
Five thousand?
That's a lot of money.

45
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:37,323
It's not my business. For that
you'll have to talk to Monsieur Zy.

46
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,330
He lives right down here.

47
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,660
I have to get back now.

48
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,702
All right, all right.
We're not deaf.

49
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,239
- We don't give to charity.
- It's about the apartment.

50
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,243
What apartment?

51
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,407
On the floor above.
Could I speak to Monsieur Zy?

52
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,646
Afternoon.

53
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,987
Have you seen the apartment?

54
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:17,995
Yes. That's why I wanted to talk
to you, to discuss the terms.

55
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,266
Five thousand premium,
six hundred a month.

56
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:27,066
That's a lot of money.
I couldn't pay more than 4,000.

57
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,968
The concierge told you
about the water?

58
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,708
Yes, she did.

59
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,149
It's damned hard to find
an apartment these days, you know.

60
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,153
There's a student up
on the sixth floor...

61
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,781
gave me half that much
for a single room.

62
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,759
Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying
to criticize your apartment...

63
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:51,193
but the toilet is a problem.

64
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:55,393
Suppose I got sick-- which I don't
often do, I can assure you--

65
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:58,300
and I had to relieve myself
in the middle of the night.

66
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,666
It wouldn't be
very convenient, would it?

67
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,939
On the other hand, I could pay you
the 4,000 right away, in cash.

68
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:09,310
It's not only a question
of the money.

69
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,544
- Let's be clear, Monsieur--
- Trelkovsky.

70
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,348
Trelkovsky.

71
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,789
I won't exactly starve
without your 5,000.

72
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,292
No. I'm renting the apartment
because it's vacant...

73
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,795
and because I know
they don't grow on trees.

74
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:26,797
Of course, Monsieur Zy.

75
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:29,299
It's perfectly reasonable.
I understand your point.

76
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,928
Could I offer you a cigarette?

77
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,131
You want 5,000, fine.

78
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,972
But if you got paid by check,
you'd have to declare it.

79
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:41,308
Wouldn't you rather
get 4,000 in cash?

80
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,975
I'd rather get 5,000 in cash
than 4,000 in cash.

81
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,353
It's perfectly natural.

82
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:53,255
Anyway, the former tenant
is not dead yet.

83
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:57,022
If she comes back, you won't even
get your 4,000. You get nothing.

84
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,564
Are you married?
Excuse the question...

85
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:01,861
but it's because of the children.

86
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,494
This is a very quiet building.

87
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,563
- My wife and I are getting on--
- I wouldn't say that, Monsieur Zy.

88
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,073
I know what I'm saying.

89
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,702
My wife and I are getting on.
We don't like a lot of noise.

90
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,712
You needn't worry, Monsieur Zy.

91
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,340
I am very quiet myself,
and I am a bachelor.

92
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,718
Bachelors can be a problem too.

93
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,223
If you're looking for a place
to entertain your girlfriends...

94
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,094
I'd rather take 2,000 and give
it to somebody who really needs it.

95
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,128
I quite agree,
but I am not that type.

96
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,927
Well now, I can't give you
a definite answer...

97
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:37,560
while Mademoiselle Choule
is still alive.

98
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:39,763
But I like you.

99
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,740
You seem to be
a serious young man to me.

100
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,683
I want to visit
Mademoiselle Choule.

101
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,137
- Simone Choule?
- That's right.

102
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,140
- Are you a relative?
- I'm a friend.

103
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:30,487
Can I help you?

104
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,581
- Are you the head nurse, ma'am?
- Yes.

105
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,091
I'm very glad I found you...

106
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,594
because I was told at the
reception desk to see you first.

107
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:40,826
- It's about Mademoiselle Choule.
- Bed 18.

108
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,630
- May I see her?
- She's not to be disturbed.

109
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,863
She was in a coma till yesterday.

110
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,406
Go ahead,
but don't try to talk to her.

111
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,314
Are you a friend of hers?

112
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,613
Excuse me.

113
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,053
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

114
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,560
I was with her the night before.

115
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,362
No, two nights before.

116
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,665
She was in such good spirits.

117
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,104
Why would she do a thing like that?

118
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,973
To tell you the truth,
I'm not a close-- I--

119
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,478
I hardly know her at all,
actually, but believe me...

120
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,481
I'm terribly upset about...

121
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,483
- Yeah.
- what's happened.

122
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,686
It's awful.

123
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:14,449
Simone? Simone.

124
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:19,554
You do recognize me, don't you?
It's me, Stella.

125
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,999
Your friend, Stella.

126
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,593
Don't you recognize me?

127
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,338
You'll have to leave now.

128
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,577
Your bag.

129
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,120
Is there any hope of saving her?

130
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:45,554
What do you mean?
If we can save her, we save her.

131
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,650
Careful. You mustn't
give in to your grief.

132
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,982
Huh? If you like, we could go
and have something to drink.

133
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,993
I think it would help you.

134
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,396
There is a--

135
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,368
Here.

136
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,142
What would you like to drink?

137
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,223
I don't know.

138
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,351
I'll have, uh, beer. No, a coffee.

139
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,657
Coffee. And the lady?

140
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,664
I don't want a coffee.

141
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,168
You should have something strong.
It will pick you up.

142
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,703
I'll have a small glass
of Beaujolais.

143
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,467
A small glass of Beaujolais and...

144
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,735
- a Martini.
- No coffee?

145
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,743
No, no, a Martini.

146
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,410
I completely forgot!
I have a phone call to make.

147
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,745
I'll be right back.

148
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,897
- Waiter!
- All right, I'm coming.

149
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,943
I'll never understand suicide.

150
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,386
I have no argument against it,
but it's beyond my comprehension.

151
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,716
Did you ever discuss it with her?

152
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,657
Never.

153
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,160
I just can't believe it.

154
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,657
It's terrible. Terrible.

155
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,433
It's terrible, yeah.

156
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,904
Could it have been
a disappointment in love, perhaps?

157
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,806
- Something like that?
- Who with?

158
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,810
I don't know. Some man.

159
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,813
You know she wasn't
interested in men.

160
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,679
Oh, yes, I know, but--

161
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,450
Women as sensitive as she was--
as she is, I mean--

162
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,457
often tend to have...

163
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:38,087
much more complicated relationships
than they seem to.

164
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,665
Perhaps she will pull out
of it anyway.

165
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,464
I doubt it.

166
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,473
Did you notice that she didn't
even recognize me?

167
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,272
A tragedy.

168
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,382
Hey, man, you got any bread
for an artist?

169
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,624
I don't seem to have any change.

170
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,626
I don't care.
I'll take what you got.

171
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,457
There, you see?
I've only got notes.

172
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,997
Come on. You don't wanna look cheap
in front of your girlfriend.

173
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,535
Not a word of thanks.
Did you notice?

174
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,537
I don't like tramps.

175
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,597
You shouldn't have
given him anything.

176
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:04,439
Would you like to have a drink?

177
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,101
No, thanks.

178
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,304
Right.

179
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:11,108
- Good-bye, then.
- Good-bye.

180
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:13,308
Hope to see you soon.

181
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:35,704
- What is it?
-Just came over from CNMA.

182
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:39,173
- Was it sent by Monsieur Lott?
- Uh-huh, Monsieur Lott. Right.

183
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,210
That must be
the Villa LeDuc, then.

184
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:43,507
Yes, that's right.

185
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,710
Yeah, that's the Villa LeDuc.
"Unmounted, number 2601.

186
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:51,311
"Make detailed copy of spire
in the lower left-hand corner...

187
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:53,822
beside the registration number."

188
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,824
You have to do it by next Thursday.

189
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,196
I'm calling to ask you
if you have any news...

190
00:20:34,264 --> 00:20:36,789
about Mademoiselle Simone Choule.

191
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:40,199
<i>- What department is she in?
- Surgery.</i>

192
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,205
<i>- Choule? With a C?
- That's right.</i>

193
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:46,208
<i>- Simone Choule.
-Are you a relative?</i>

194
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:49,507
No, I'm a friend.

195
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:52,810
<i>The patient died
at 4:20 p.m.yesterday.</i>

196
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,786
Thank you.

197
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,756
Good-bye.

198
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:25,313
- Morning, monsieur.
- Morning.

199
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:27,322
Live opposite?

200
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,517
Yes. I just moved in.

201
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:34,029
You rented the apartment of that
girl that jumped out of the window?

202
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:38,829
-Yes. Did you know her?
-Sure, I did. Came in every morning.

203
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:43,668
Always sat in the same place.
Right there where you are now.

204
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:46,799
A cup of chocolate and a roll
and butter. Never drank coffee.

205
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:51,813
Used to say, "If I have a coffee,
I can't sleep for two days."

206
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:55,044
- Question of what you're used to.
- Shall I make you a chocolate?

207
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:57,381
A question of temperament too,
I think.

208
00:25:57,453 --> 00:26:00,217
Still, a young girl
like that killing herself.

209
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:01,756
I can't imagine why.

210
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:04,418
No reason at all, probably.

211
00:26:04,493 --> 00:26:08,589
A moment of depression,
and wham, it's all over.

212
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:12,633
Robert.

213
00:26:38,794 --> 00:26:40,386
Do you sell cigarettes?

214
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:43,955
- Yes. What would you like?
- Gauloises Bleu, please.

215
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,558
Oh. I'm right out of Gauloises.

216
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:49,366
- Oh, what else do you have?
- Gitanes, Marlboro.

217
00:26:49,438 --> 00:26:52,669
Mademoiselle Choule always smoked
Marlboro. Would you like a pack?

218
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:55,473
No. No, thank you.

219
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:40,349
Simone Choule, the Lord
has taken thee to his bosom...

220
00:27:40,423 --> 00:27:44,450
just as a shepherd brings in
his sheep at the close of day.

221
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:48,429
What could be more natural,
of greater consolation?

222
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,931
Is it not the fondest hope
and desire of all of us...

223
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,766
that we shall one day
rejoin the flock of holy ones?

224
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:58,295
Hope of eternal life?
The true life?

225
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:01,775
Shorn of all worldly cares?

226
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:05,974
Face to face in eternal
blessedness with Almighty God...

227
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:08,243
who through his son
our Lord Jesus Christ...

228
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:12,720
died for us on the cross.

229
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:16,019
Who deigns to look down upon us
poor mortal creatures...

230
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:18,526
full of love,
infinitely merciful...

231
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:23,031
the sick, the suffering, the dying.

232
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,092
Yes, the dying. The icy tomb.

233
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:31,697
Thou shalt return to the dust
from whence thou came...

234
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:33,935
and only thy bones remain.

235
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,136
The worms shall consume thy eyes...

236
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:39,648
thy lips, thy mouth.

237
00:28:39,715 --> 00:28:44,209
They shall enter into thy ears.
They shall enter into thy nostrils.

238
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:47,687
Thy body shall putrefy
unto its innermost recesses...

239
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:50,726
and shall give off
a noisome stench.

240
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:53,921
Yea, Christ is ascended
into heaven and hath joined...

241
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:58,057
the host of angels on high,
but not for creeps like you...

242
00:28:58,134 --> 00:29:00,329
full of the basest vice...

243
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:04,533
yearning only for
carnal satisfaction.

244
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:09,510
How dare you pester me,
and mock at me to my very face.

245
00:29:09,578 --> 00:29:11,546
What audacity!

246
00:29:11,614 --> 00:29:14,583
What are you doing here
in my temple?

247
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,016
The graveyard
is where you belong.

248
00:29:17,086 --> 00:29:19,077
Thou shalt stink.

249
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:23,091
Thou shalt stink like some putrefied
corpse lying along the wayside.

250
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,559
Verily I say unto thee...

251
00:29:25,628 --> 00:29:29,655
thou shalt never enter
into my kingdom.

252
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:40,675
Four, three, two, one, zero!

253
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:44,406
There he is. Hey, Trelkovsky.
The lucky lodger, huh?

254
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,414
Oh, Lucille Pampin, from Nice.

255
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:48,450
- On the Riviera.
- She's 5'4'' and 140 pounds.

256
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:50,576
Best blow job in Paris!

257
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:52,587
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do.

258
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,589
Don't anybody get up.
What is this?

259
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:57,455
No more chairs than that?
What a dump!

260
00:29:57,526 --> 00:30:00,086
There is a table right here.

261
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:02,722
Your fiance can come
and sit on my knees, okay? Come on.

262
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:06,400
It's against my principles.
Hey, come on. Give me a hand.

263
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:08,596
- Hi, how are you?
- Wait a second.

264
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:11,003
- Grab that end, will you?
- Ah, that's more like it.

265
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:13,007
Careful, huh?

266
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:17,502
- Put it right in the middle there.
- That's it.

267
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,708
- What about chairs though?
- Listen, maybe there's a bed here.

268
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,251
- Yeah, why not?
- Move that table over.

269
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,810
- Okay.
- Take the table outta there first.

270
00:30:25,888 --> 00:30:29,824
- Want me to do anything?
- Oh, thank you. You're very kind.

271
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:34,022
-Here, let me finish that.
-We'll just get this salad finished.

272
00:30:34,096 --> 00:30:36,291
- Have you met Viviane?
- Hello.

273
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:37,798
Hi.

274
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,936
- Set her down.
- There, that's okay.

275
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:45,132
- Easy does it.
- Oh. What the hell is this?

276
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,776
Is that one of yours?

277
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:58,409
No, no, cut it out.
He's got a heart of gold.

278
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:06,722
That's right,
he's got the heart of a chick.

279
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:09,127
Sure, you would. You'd be happy
to do it for a little bread.

280
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:11,132
No, I wouldn't.
I'm not interested.

281
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,725
You could offer me a fortune
and I still wouldn't dream of it.

282
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:15,963
Who you trying to kid?

283
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:18,438
You think there's anyone dumb
enough to offer you a fortune?

284
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:21,135
- She's talking about the principle.
- The principle?

285
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,144
- That's right.
- You know what I think of them?

286
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:26,079
- You wanna know what I think?
- Well, come on. What do you think?

287
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,343
It's a lot of crap.
That's what your principles are.

288
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:30,715
I tell you,
I'd do it for nothing.

289
00:31:30,786 --> 00:31:32,720
- You would?
- You bet. Absolutely nothin'.

290
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:34,722
It takes all kinds.

291
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,190
Nobody wants me to,
but I'd pay them to let me.

292
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:38,726
I'd write a check,
but I wouldn't pay.

293
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:42,560
I saw one once-- blech!
Makes you wanna throw up.

294
00:31:42,631 --> 00:31:44,565
Would anybody mind
if the subject were changed?

295
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:47,898
What do you want to talk about--
women's lib, social security?

296
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,904
Oh, keep women's lib out of it,
for Christ's sake.

297
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,497
Oh, yeah? Have you looked at 'em?
Have you looked at those militants?

298
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:54,702
It's enough to turn you queer.

299
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,715
Oh, look what that pig's doing now.
He's actually pissing in the sink.

300
00:31:59,715 --> 00:32:01,205
Oh, look what that pig's doing now.
He's actually pissing in the sink.

301
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:04,309
- How revolting!
- Come on, get off my back, will ya?

302
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:07,378
It's not my fault if there's
no john in this crummy apartment.

303
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:38,278
You're making a great deal
of noise, monsieur.

304
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:42,881
It's after 1:00, and you're
making a great deal of noise.

305
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:45,654
I'm just having a few friends
over for a quiet chat.

306
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:49,629
Quiet? I live upstairs, and I
can hear every word you're saying.

307
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:55,364
You've been dragging furniture
around, stamping about the place.

308
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:59,567
It's intolerable. Do you intend
to carry on like this much longer?

309
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:02,576
Who is that asshole? Hmm?

310
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:08,582
Look.

311
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:14,982
I'm terribly sorry I woke you.
I will be more careful from now on.

312
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:19,493
You don't seem to give a damn
about anyone else.

313
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:21,927
It's all very well
to have a good time.

314
00:33:21,997 --> 00:33:25,364
But some people have to work,
you know?

315
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:29,597
Tomorrow's Sunday. It's reasonable
for me to have a few people...

316
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:31,400
around on Saturday evening.

317
00:33:31,473 --> 00:33:34,533
No, monsieur.
It's not reasonable...

318
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:38,375
to make such a racket,
even on a Saturday evening!

319
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:45,113
We will be more careful.
Good night, monsieur.

320
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:57,495
Sure. Soon you won't even
be able to jerk off...

321
00:33:57,566 --> 00:34:00,296
without him knocking
on the door.

322
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:03,299
You shouldn't let him
push you around that way.

323
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:06,431
- I know. You should counterattack.
- Oh, you know what?

324
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:09,102
- We gotta take revenge.
- Why don't we set the john on fire?

325
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:11,577
- Throw scorpions down his chimney.
- Or crabs.

326
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:13,580
Crabs won't work. Scorpions.

327
00:34:13,648 --> 00:34:15,980
No. We'll drill a hole
in the wall and force gas in.

328
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:18,611
- Yeah!
- Or make a hole in the floor.

329
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:20,621
Don't be so silly.

330
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,317
That's because he only
thinks below the belt.

331
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:26,121
What's this? I'll be damned,
he's throwing us out of the house.

332
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,789
- Look, it's late.
- Aw, come on.

333
00:34:29,865 --> 00:34:32,390
Okay, gang.
Let's go find someplace else.

334
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:36,164
- Give me my coat.
- Pass me my coat, huh?

335
00:34:36,238 --> 00:34:38,763
Be careful.
Be careful with those coats.

336
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,933
- Come on. On your feet.
- My shoes.

337
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:43,944
Let's go, everybody.

338
00:34:44,012 --> 00:34:45,502
Wait. We going or what?

339
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,515
- Sure, buddy.
- Bye, everybody.

340
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,950
- Come on, everyone.
- Night!

341
00:34:53,021 --> 00:34:54,386
Let's go. Everybody out!

342
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,219
One hell of a party.

343
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:59,658
- Good night, my friends!
- Hey!

344
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:08,029
Shh! Don't make so much noise!
People are sleeping!

345
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:34,741
Morning, Monsieur Zy.
Lovely day, isn't it?

346
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:38,849
I'm terribly embarrassed
about last night...

347
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,117
and I can promise you
it will never happen again.

348
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,182
I should hope not.
You woke up both me and my wife.

349
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,990
Couldn't get back to sleep.
What was the meaning of all that?

350
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:55,034
I thought I'd have a few friends
over to celebrate my good fortune...

351
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:58,834
having found this lovely apartment.

352
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:03,867
A sort of a house warming,
without disturbing anyone.

353
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:07,847
And then, you know how it is
with the best will in the world...

354
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:12,319
and not dreaming
of disturbing anyone...

355
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:14,855
you talk,
you're having a good time.

356
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:19,292
And before you even know it,
you're making so much noise that--

357
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,797
Look, I'm sorry. I can promise you
it'll never happen again.

358
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:28,198
Well, I'm very glad to hear that,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

359
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:31,864
Because I was seriously
thinking of taking steps.

360
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,068
Apartments are hard enough
to come by these days.

361
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:38,135
So it's worth keeping the one
you have, don't you think?

362
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:18,278
"Outraged neighbor shoots
tipsy tenor...

363
00:40:18,346 --> 00:40:20,780
<i>for singing
La Tosca at 3:00 a.m.</i>

364
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:24,250
Louis Marais, age 39, a bachelor
and traveling salesman...

365
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,947
came home at 3:00 in the
morning after one drink too many...

366
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:29,956
and proceeded to sing opera
with his windows wide open.

367
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:32,254
When a neighbor, Monsieur Pierrot,
expressed a wish...

368
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:35,763
that he put off his warbling
until somewhat later...

369
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,129
Monsieur Marais illustrated his
contempt for such a suggestion...

370
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,327
<i>with an air from Tosca
delivered on the hall landing.</i>

371
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:44,463
Pierrot reappeared with a gun and
emptied it into the poor tenor...

372
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:47,303
who died before the ambulance
reached the hospital.

373
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:50,742
The murderer is under arrest."

374
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:58,215
You there! Quiet down!

375
00:40:58,286 --> 00:41:01,847
How much longer are you gonna
keep up this racket?

376
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,897
- Who is it?
- It's me.

377
00:44:46,814 --> 00:44:48,338
What can I do for you?

378
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:51,249
Monsieur, was it you who
registered a complaint?

379
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,983
A complaint?

380
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:55,989
Against whom?

381
00:44:56,057 --> 00:44:58,787
Against me,
for causing a disturbance at night.

382
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,420
I never made any complaint.

383
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:06,399
Someone has registered a complaint.
It came this morning.

384
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:09,834
She's the one who makes
all the noise all night long.

385
00:45:09,904 --> 00:45:14,341
- Who?
- That old woman. She's evil.

386
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:17,867
She's done everything she could
to make things difficult for us.

387
00:45:17,945 --> 00:45:20,846
Just because the girl is disabled.

388
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:26,510
- You didn't register a complaint?
- Of course not.

389
00:45:26,587 --> 00:45:29,420
Then it must have been her.

390
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,823
I asked downstairs.
They said it might have been you.

391
00:45:32,894 --> 00:45:36,455
Monsieur, we go to bed early.
Not like her.

392
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:42,436
She can't sleep at night, so she
walks up and down her apartment...

393
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:45,028
moves the furniture around.

394
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:48,132
She keeps me
and my daughter awake.

395
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:53,977
Do you know what she did, monsieur?
Jammed a broom up against my door.

396
00:45:54,048 --> 00:45:56,915
I had to heave it open
with all my strength...

397
00:45:56,984 --> 00:46:01,478
and I twisted a muscle
in my shoulder...

398
00:46:01,556 --> 00:46:03,615
and now she wants
to have us thrown out.

399
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:06,524
- She can't have you thrown out.
- Can't she?

400
00:46:06,594 --> 00:46:10,690
- Of course not.
- I never make any noise, honestly.

401
00:46:10,765 --> 00:46:13,598
Even if you did, they can't
throw you out like that.

402
00:46:14,736 --> 00:46:17,762
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

403
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:28,583
God bless you. God bless you,
monsieur. Thank you.

404
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,957
- What about your neighbors?
- Getting used to them.

405
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,466
I have no problem, you know.
They have to get used to me too.

406
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:53,833
If they keep bugging you,
Simon and I know a few ways...

407
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:55,842
of dealing with them,
eh, Simon?

408
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,844
Sure, we know some great tricks.

409
00:46:57,912 --> 00:46:59,243
Like, we could come around
in the middle of the night...

410
00:46:59,313 --> 00:47:02,908
and yell up at you from the
courtyard-- you see what I mean?

411
00:47:02,984 --> 00:47:06,215
Hey, Trelkovsky! Come out for
a drink! Come on now, get movin'!

412
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:09,521
Or we can knock on the floor below,
after midnight, of course.

413
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,990
That's right.
Knock on the door, shouting:

414
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:15,927
"On your feet, shitface. We're off
to the park for a blow job!"

415
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:19,098
You know--

416
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:25,732
There is something odd
going on in my building.

417
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:31,340
I quite often see people
in the toilets...

418
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:34,506
- across the courtyard.
- What are you, a peeping Tom?

419
00:47:34,582 --> 00:47:38,313
Do you mean people together
in the shithouse? Like an orgy?

420
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:43,653
No, no. They just stand there
for hours, you know?

421
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:46,454
Absolutely dead still.

422
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:47,994
They're obviously
playing with themselves.

423
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:49,495
Not at all.

424
00:47:49,563 --> 00:47:52,396
He just told you.
They stand dead still.

425
00:47:52,466 --> 00:47:55,299
Can you play with yourself
without moving?

426
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:07,211
- What would you like to drink?
- What are you having?

427
00:48:07,281 --> 00:48:09,647
- Beer.
- Beer's fine.

428
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,641
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.Just--

429
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,776
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

430
00:48:49,156 --> 00:48:52,148
- Turn it down a little.
- Leave it alone.

431
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:54,626
They're used to it by now.

432
00:48:54,695 --> 00:48:57,129
But it's too loud,
even for us.

433
00:48:57,198 --> 00:49:00,895
Try and get used to it.
Try to enjoy it while you can.

434
00:49:00,968 --> 00:49:03,493
You can't do it at home.

435
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:17,349
Neighbor.

436
00:49:18,552 --> 00:49:19,985
I hope so.

437
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,195
I hate to bother you, monsieur.
I see you have company.

438
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:41,071
But I wonder, could you turn down
the sound a little? My wife's sick.

439
00:49:41,142 --> 00:49:44,441
So she's sick, is she? Well,
what am I supposed to do about it?

440
00:49:44,512 --> 00:49:47,413
Stop living because of her?

441
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:50,746
If she's sick,
why doesn't she go to a hospital?

442
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:55,585
I'll play my records when I want
and as loud as I want.

443
00:49:55,656 --> 00:49:57,783
You know, I'm a bit
hard of hearing myself...

444
00:49:57,858 --> 00:50:00,224
but that's no reason to be
deprived of my music.

445
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:05,990
And don't try anything funny.

446
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:08,933
I know the superintendent
of police.

447
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:18,439
See? That's how
you deal with 'em.

448
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:21,003
- What if his wife really is--
- So what? I don't go...

449
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:24,573
moaning to him every time
I don't feel well.

450
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:28,520
He won't come back either.
I can promise you that.

451
00:50:47,308 --> 00:50:49,242
Just a moment, please.

452
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:51,924
Who is it?

453
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:54,695
Isn't this Simone Choule's
apartment?

454
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:05,478
Yes, it used to be.
I'm the new tenant.

455
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:07,480
Has she moved then?

456
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:11,350
Come in, please.
Don't stand there like that.

457
00:53:16,256 --> 00:53:18,190
Nothing's happened to her,
I hope.

458
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:23,330
Please sit down, Monsieur--

459
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:27,158
- Badar.
- Pleased to meet you, monsieur.

460
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:29,167
My name is Trelkovsky.

461
00:53:32,272 --> 00:53:35,764
I'm afraid there has been
an unfortunate, uh--

462
00:53:38,244 --> 00:53:40,178
Did you know her well?

463
00:53:42,515 --> 00:53:44,779
Did I know her?

464
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:46,785
She committed suicide.

465
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:51,457
Threw herself out of the window.

466
00:53:51,524 --> 00:53:55,858
- If you'd like to see--
- But--

467
00:53:55,929 --> 00:54:00,025
But why?
Why would she do a thing like that?

468
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,432
No one seems to know.

469
00:54:02,502 --> 00:54:05,767
- Do you know Stella?
- No.

470
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,808
She doesn't know either.

471
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:11,469
No one knows why she did it.

472
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:31,030
I went to the Egyptian department
at the Louvre this morning.

473
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:37,767
I found a nice postcard,
and I sent it to her.

474
00:54:39,272 --> 00:54:41,672
What irony.

475
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:45,472
Years of affection without
ever daring to say anything.

476
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:49,447
I acted as though we were
just friends each time I saw her--

477
00:54:49,516 --> 00:54:52,849
which wasn't very often,
I can tell you that.

478
00:54:54,587 --> 00:54:57,078
It just isn't fair.

479
00:54:57,157 --> 00:55:01,184
The day I summon up enough
courage to tell her...

480
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:03,559
I find out--

481
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:06,190
I find out she's--

482
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:14,630
Why?

483
00:55:14,707 --> 00:55:17,699
Why didn't I ever tell her?

484
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:22,575
She's gone without ever knowing it.

485
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:25,117
We'll be closing now,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

486
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:27,949
- Yeah.
- Life isn't worth living anymore.

487
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:30,285
- You mustn't--
- That'll be six francs sixty.

488
00:55:30,356 --> 00:55:33,792
You mustn't think like that.
You're young. You'll forget.

489
00:55:35,962 --> 00:55:37,395
Wait.

490
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:41,367
Wait a minute!

491
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:44,770
Thank you.

492
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,675
I can promise you
she didn't suffer.

493
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:00,742
And she didn't say anything?

494
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,414
- You sure?
- Absolutely certain.

495
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:07,024
All right, all right.

496
00:56:08,928 --> 00:56:11,522
It's my round,
for Christ's sakes.

497
00:56:11,597 --> 00:56:13,360
Drinks for everyone!

498
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,172
Everyone except him.

499
00:56:38,257 --> 00:56:43,058
Don't mind him.
He's drunk. Drunk.

500
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:47,394
- What you've done for me--
- It's natural.

501
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:51,926
- It's not natural at all.
- It is natural.

502
00:56:52,004 --> 00:56:57,067
There aren't many guys around
like you. It's as simple as this.

503
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:02,113
You saved my life.

504
00:57:25,671 --> 00:57:27,400
- Morning.
- Good morning.

505
00:57:30,743 --> 00:57:33,439
A cup of chocolate,
Monsieur Trelkovsky?

506
00:57:33,512 --> 00:57:35,104
Why not?

507
00:57:45,057 --> 00:57:46,991
Could I have some
Gauloises Bleu, please?

508
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,651
Yes.

509
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:03,467
Mmm. I wanted some Gauloises.

510
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:06,739
- Gauloises Bleu.
- I thought you said Marlboro.

511
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:11,943
I've run out of Gauloises.
I'll send Robert out for some.

512
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:15,043
Don't bother.
I'll take the Marlboro.

513
00:59:31,774 --> 00:59:34,368
- A pack of Marlboros.
- Gimme a pack of Gauloises.

514
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:38,372
A pack of Marlboros, please.

515
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:48,991
- Pack of Gauloises.
- Eight franc sixty.

516
00:59:53,096 --> 00:59:54,961
Okay, see ya next week.

517
01:00:22,992 --> 01:00:25,392
Hello! How are you?

518
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:28,692
Very well, thanks. I was just going
to buy some cigarettes.

519
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:31,632
Come and join us.
These are some friends of mine.

520
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:34,568
- May I?
- Of course.

521
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:37,105
- Hi.
- Hi.

522
01:00:40,243 --> 01:00:43,178
We were just
talking about Simone.

523
01:00:43,246 --> 01:00:45,476
- Simone?
- Simone Choule.

524
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:51,247
This is the guy I told you about--
the one I met at the hospital.

525
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:55,781
- We were the last to see her alive.
- Stella told us...

526
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:58,588
Simone didn't seem
to know her.

527
01:00:58,661 --> 01:01:00,925
- I don't think she did.
- And you?

528
01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:05,195
- Me?
- She didn't recognize you either?

529
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:08,794
It's hard to say.

530
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:12,307
I couldn't be sure
one way or the other.

531
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:16,141
Perhaps she was trying to say
something when she screamed.

532
01:01:17,914 --> 01:01:22,544
Anyway, that's the impression
I get when I think back on it.

533
01:01:24,153 --> 01:01:27,316
She was looking at you
when she let out that cry.

534
01:01:29,759 --> 01:01:31,886
- You think so?
- You know...

535
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:36,694
I still have some things of hers
at home. It's depressing.

536
01:01:36,766 --> 01:01:41,032
- What've you got of hers?
- Some books, a couple of records.

537
01:01:48,211 --> 01:01:50,543
There's one of Simone's books.

538
01:01:58,621 --> 01:02:00,987
- I haven't read it.
- Nor have I.

539
01:02:01,057 --> 01:02:03,753
I'm not interested
in Egyptology.

540
01:02:03,826 --> 01:02:08,229
She left it behind one evening.
You can have it if you like.

541
01:02:08,898 --> 01:02:12,197
Oh, you're very kind.
I would love to read it.

542
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:19,465
It's a magnificent place
you've got here.

543
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,974
Better than where I live,
I can tell you.

544
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:29,974
Sorry, if you don't mind me
asking, is the rent very high?

545
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:33,884
I don't pay for it.
It belongs to my brother.

546
01:02:33,954 --> 01:02:39,824
He's gone off to Peru
for a few months, a year, traveling.

547
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:41,485
Look, this track.

548
01:02:46,499 --> 01:02:49,024
Do you have any trouble
with your neighbors?

549
01:02:49,101 --> 01:02:50,534
What sort of trouble?

550
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:53,003
Well, you know...

551
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:56,734
these days, relationships
with neighbors can get...

552
01:02:56,808 --> 01:02:59,072
quite complicated.

553
01:02:59,144 --> 01:03:05,708
You know, little things that get
blown up out of all proportion.

554
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:07,411
You know what I mean?

555
01:03:07,485 --> 01:03:10,578
No. No, I don't.

556
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:13,556
I mind my own business.

557
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:20,194
So do I.
It's the best way.

558
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,331
If you like,
I'll take you home.

559
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:47,985
Shall we go back
to your place?

560
01:03:48,056 --> 01:03:50,320
My place?

561
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:57,330
Okay?

562
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,332
Sure. Fine.

563
01:04:01,635 --> 01:04:05,571
Only my place is a bit--

564
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:08,233
Well, it's a bit difficult.

565
01:04:08,308 --> 01:04:12,335
- In fact, it's impossible.
- Why?

566
01:04:12,412 --> 01:04:15,574
- Have you got a girlfriend?
- No.

567
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:17,878
Not exactly.

568
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:23,149
It's just that I've been repainting,
and the place is in chaos.

569
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:28,882
We could still spend
a couple of hours there, hmm?

570
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,556
On top of that, my uncle is
just up from the country...

571
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:35,929
staying a few days.

572
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,334
How about your place?

573
01:04:51,014 --> 01:04:53,277
Take off your coat.

574
01:05:05,428 --> 01:05:07,827
I'll be right back.

575
01:05:31,685 --> 01:05:33,549
I'd love something to drink.

576
01:05:40,527 --> 01:05:42,017
Cheers.

577
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,996
Cheers.

578
01:05:53,972 --> 01:05:56,202
Why don't you
take your tie off?

579
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:59,004
You look like you're
choking to death.

580
01:06:01,312 --> 01:06:04,372
I found a tooth
in my apartment.

581
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:07,316
- It was in a hole.
- A tooth?

582
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,854
In a hole?

583
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:14,948
Yeah.
A hole in the wall.

584
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:17,653
Wrapped in cotton wool.

585
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:22,460
So? No need to pull
such a long face over a tooth.

586
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,633
Pretty weird, though, isn't it?

587
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:30,336
Not really.

588
01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:33,671
When I was young,
we did it all the time.

589
01:06:33,742 --> 01:06:36,677
Whenever one of my teeth
fell out...

590
01:06:36,745 --> 01:06:39,440
I used to hide it.

591
01:06:39,514 --> 01:06:43,382
My mother said it would
turn into a coin.

592
01:06:43,451 --> 01:06:45,214
A coin.

593
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:53,987
Oh, God.

594
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:56,928
- Stella, I was wondering--
- Yeah?

595
01:06:56,997 --> 01:06:58,430
Tooth--

596
01:07:01,134 --> 01:07:03,795
Tooth is a part of ourselves,
isn't it?

597
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:08,466
Like a bit of our personality.

598
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:13,503
I don't know what you mean.

599
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:19,911
I remember, in the newspaper...

600
01:07:19,985 --> 01:07:25,446
a man lost his arm in an accident
and wanted to have it buried.

601
01:07:25,524 --> 01:07:28,015
He wanted to do what?

602
01:07:28,093 --> 01:07:31,459
Have it buried in a cemetery.

603
01:07:31,529 --> 01:07:34,794
- He must have been nuts.
- The authorities refused.

604
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,199
The arm was cremated,
and that was that.

605
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:41,738
Where did this happen--
in France?

606
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:47,909
I wonder if they refused
to give him the ashes.

607
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:51,640
And if so, by what right?

608
01:07:51,714 --> 01:07:54,182
Haven't you got anything
more cheerful to talk about?

609
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:06,393
All right. That'll do.

610
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:12,128
Don't worry.

611
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:25,807
Tell me--

612
01:08:25,879 --> 01:08:30,282
At what precise moment...

613
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:34,946
does an individual stop being
who he thinks he is?

614
01:08:36,155 --> 01:08:39,921
You know,
I don't like complications.

615
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:42,222
You cut off my arm, right?

616
01:08:42,294 --> 01:08:46,526
I say me and my arm.

617
01:08:46,599 --> 01:08:48,930
You cut off my other arm.

618
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,265
I say me and my two arms.

619
01:08:56,975 --> 01:09:01,139
Take out my stomach, my kidneys--

620
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:03,679
assuming that were possible.

621
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:08,348
And I say
me and my intestines.

622
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:12,813
Follow me?

623
01:09:16,826 --> 01:09:20,660
And now,
if you cut off my head...

624
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,290
would I say...

625
01:09:23,366 --> 01:09:27,734
me and my head,
or me and my body?

626
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:34,767
What right has my head
to call itself "me"?

627
01:09:38,213 --> 01:09:39,805
What right?

628
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,379
Oh, God.

629
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,597
Monsieur Trelkovsky?

630
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:26,637
Stay! Stay, Mirza, stay.

631
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:31,714
You were out all night, huh?

632
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:36,118
Yes, I had to stay with my uncle.

633
01:11:36,188 --> 01:11:38,122
He isn't well.

634
01:11:39,223 --> 01:11:42,158
I'll tell Madame Dioz
you're back.

635
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:44,456
Madame Dioz?

636
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:46,360
Who's Madame Dioz?

637
01:11:47,598 --> 01:11:51,364
This isn't for me. Look!

638
01:12:06,682 --> 01:12:11,085
"Best wishes from the Louvre.
Georges Badar."

639
01:13:26,456 --> 01:13:29,584
I should like to have
a word with you, monsieur.

640
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:31,718
Please, come in, madame.

641
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:36,130
I am Madame Dioz.

642
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:40,534
Pleased to meet you.

643
01:13:40,602 --> 01:13:44,902
This is why I've come to see you.
Please read it.

644
01:13:44,973 --> 01:13:49,500
It is a petition against
the unspeakable Madame Gaderian.

645
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:54,674
She's gone too far this time.
We've got to do something about it.

646
01:13:54,749 --> 01:13:59,516
Look. Even Monsieur Zy
has signed. There.

647
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:03,078
Who is this Madame Gaderian?
I don't know her.

648
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:07,286
You mean, you don't know her? Who
do you think makes all that noise?

649
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,261
It is her, my dear young man.
It is her.

650
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:14,960
Do you know she does her washing up
in the middle of the night?

651
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:17,935
And she whistles
at the same time.

652
01:14:18,003 --> 01:14:21,495
Now, does a civilized person
behave like that?

653
01:14:21,574 --> 01:14:23,474
No, I suppose not.

654
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:27,478
Well, go on then, sign. It's simply
a question of solidarity.

655
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:33,211
She's making life impossible for--
for the other tenants.

656
01:14:33,284 --> 01:14:36,481
Is she the one who lives
with a disabled daughter?

657
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:40,122
Disabled? No.

658
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:43,523
She has a boy--
a horrible, noisy brat...

659
01:14:43,594 --> 01:14:48,429
who's always playing skittles
or God knows what in the corridor.

660
01:14:48,498 --> 01:14:53,435
Are you sure? Are you certain
she doesn't have a young daughter?

661
01:14:54,538 --> 01:14:58,906
I don't know
what goes on in their lair.

662
01:14:58,975 --> 01:15:01,307
Ask the concierge.

663
01:15:05,181 --> 01:15:08,274
I'm sorry.
I'm not signing any petition.

664
01:15:09,918 --> 01:15:12,250
This woman has
never bothered me.

665
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,153
I've never seen her
or even heard of her.

666
01:15:16,491 --> 01:15:19,892
What apartment does
she live in anyway?

667
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:23,157
I shall make a note
of your attitude.

668
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,858
I can see what we're
dealing with here.

669
01:15:25,933 --> 01:15:28,697
Everyone for himself,
and never mind anyone else, hmm?

670
01:15:28,769 --> 01:15:30,396
Not at all. I--

671
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:34,167
I know your type exactly,
like that man opposite...

672
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,368
right up until the day he was
struck down with paralysis.

673
01:15:37,443 --> 01:15:41,311
Then his neighbors let him
stew in his own juice.

674
01:15:41,381 --> 01:15:45,181
By all means,
do whatever you think best.

675
01:15:46,252 --> 01:15:48,651
But I warn you:

676
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,746
Don't come whining to me later.

677
01:15:58,597 --> 01:16:00,530
Bastards!

678
01:16:08,673 --> 01:16:11,164
What do they want me to do--
drop dead?

679
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:18,843
With my wife,
it's always the same old--

680
01:16:29,758 --> 01:16:31,817
It's for me.

681
01:17:26,344 --> 01:17:28,938
<i>It's no use
playing innocent with me.</i>

682
01:17:29,013 --> 01:17:33,346
I've heard a good deal about you,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

683
01:17:33,417 --> 01:17:36,944
You specialize in breaches
of the peace at night.

684
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,581
I'm quite amazed, Inspector.

685
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:43,091
No one has said anything to me.

686
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,430
I'm certainly not
in the habit of making noise.

687
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,761
I'm certainly not
in the habit of making noise.

688
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,765
I have very few friends,
and I never entertain.

689
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:55,668
I'm not interested in your stories.
I have other things to do.

690
01:17:55,738 --> 01:18:01,004
But I keep getting complaints. It's
my duty to maintain law and order.

691
01:18:01,075 --> 01:18:03,100
So I say it once and for all:

692
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,339
Stop whatever it is
you're doing at night.

693
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:11,414
- Trelkovsky-- is that Russian?
- Polish.

694
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:14,687
So you're not French.

695
01:18:14,755 --> 01:18:19,249
- I am a French citizen.
- Let me see your identity card.

696
01:18:31,637 --> 01:18:33,901
It's in a very poor state.

697
01:18:35,441 --> 01:18:38,034
But you haven't registered
your change of address.

698
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:42,339
15 Rue Sedan. Where is this?

699
01:18:42,414 --> 01:18:45,178
I'm terribly sorry.
I'll do it at once.

700
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:50,319
You'd be well advised to.

701
01:18:50,387 --> 01:18:54,585
Right. This time I shall
close my eyes to the whole business.

702
01:18:54,658 --> 01:18:57,354
Just make sure I don't hear
any more about you.

703
01:18:57,428 --> 01:18:59,919
I won't have some little
troublemaker disturbing the peace.

704
01:18:59,997 --> 01:19:01,931
Thank you very much, Inspector.

705
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,034
Good-bye.

706
01:19:22,518 --> 01:19:24,452
Good afternoon, madame.

707
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,683
I would like to know who registered
a complaint against me.

708
01:19:29,525 --> 01:19:32,049
Do you know who it was?

709
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:36,790
If you didn't make so much noise,
there wouldn't be any complaints.

710
01:19:36,864 --> 01:19:38,855
Was there a petition?

711
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:45,599
Was it that woman that came to
see me the other day-- Madame Dioz?

712
01:19:47,274 --> 01:19:50,869
You only have
yourself to blame.

713
01:19:50,944 --> 01:19:52,878
Did you sign it?

714
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:32,107
That's it. She's won.
They've all signed it.

715
01:20:32,182 --> 01:20:35,014
All except you, monsieur.
I've come to thank you.

716
01:20:35,084 --> 01:20:37,678
You're a good person.

717
01:20:37,753 --> 01:20:39,812
I don't like to get
mixed up in this kind of thing.

718
01:20:39,889 --> 01:20:43,848
Nonsense. No, you are a good person.
I can see it in your eyes.

719
01:20:46,095 --> 01:20:48,119
I got even with them...

720
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:51,632
and the concierge too:
she's as bad as all of them.

721
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:55,636
I paid them back all right.
They gave me the idea.

722
01:20:55,704 --> 01:20:58,229
Do you know what I did?

723
01:20:58,306 --> 01:21:01,036
I did it on the staircase...

724
01:21:01,109 --> 01:21:04,236
in front of everyone's door.

725
01:21:05,946 --> 01:21:07,675
It's their own fault.

726
01:21:07,748 --> 01:21:11,479
They gave me the idea.
I didn't do it by your door.

727
01:21:11,552 --> 01:21:13,986
I don't want to cause you
any trouble.

728
01:21:15,388 --> 01:21:17,879
- How long ago?
-Just now.

729
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:22,785
I would love to see their faces
when they find out.

730
01:21:24,397 --> 01:21:26,865
It serves them right,
all of them.

731
01:21:26,933 --> 01:21:29,196
But they--
they'll say I did it!

732
01:21:29,267 --> 01:21:31,258
Good night, monsieur.
Sleep well.

733
01:26:59,038 --> 01:27:00,972
Hey, look.

734
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,098
They want to drive me
to suicide.

735
01:28:15,342 --> 01:28:18,937
All right.
I'll show them.

736
01:29:31,112 --> 01:29:33,477
Just shoes.

737
01:29:35,015 --> 01:29:39,543
Simply-- Where in the world
did you find them?

738
01:29:46,993 --> 01:29:49,655
Eighty francs.
You're kidding.

739
01:29:49,729 --> 01:29:51,663
Supermarket, yes.

740
01:29:58,203 --> 01:30:01,639
She's not as young
as she thinks she is.

741
01:30:06,044 --> 01:30:08,569
Beautiful, beautiful.

742
01:30:08,647 --> 01:30:10,740
Adorable.

743
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,847
A goddess, divine.

744
01:30:31,067 --> 01:30:33,001
I think I'm pregnant.

745
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:11,955
Monsters!

746
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:19,530
They'll never turn me
into Simone Choule.

747
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,862
Never!

748
01:32:23,169 --> 01:32:24,602
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

749
01:32:27,907 --> 01:32:31,308
Do you remember the conditions on
which I let you have this apartment?

750
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:33,470
I most certainly do,
Monsieur Zy.

751
01:32:33,546 --> 01:32:35,479
May I know what you're
referring to?

752
01:32:35,547 --> 01:32:37,515
I'm referring to what I said
about women.

753
01:32:37,582 --> 01:32:39,379
Oh, yes, of course.

754
01:32:39,451 --> 01:32:41,817
Then why do you
bring them around here?

755
01:32:43,722 --> 01:32:47,249
What? I never brought
any women around here.

756
01:32:47,325 --> 01:32:49,258
I know what I'm talking about.

757
01:32:49,326 --> 01:32:52,420
You had a woman up in your room.
You can't deny it.

758
01:32:53,564 --> 01:32:56,431
I'll turn a blind eye
to it this time...

759
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,230
but this is the last time.

760
01:32:59,303 --> 01:33:01,236
I hope that's clear.

761
01:33:09,445 --> 01:33:11,675
Good morning,
Monsieur Trelkovsky.

762
01:33:24,393 --> 01:33:26,452
Bring me a coffee.

763
01:33:26,528 --> 01:33:28,859
- You don't want a chocolate?
- I just told you, I want a coffee.

764
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:30,864
But you always have a chocolate.

765
01:33:30,932 --> 01:33:33,992
You always serve me
without asking what I want.

766
01:33:34,068 --> 01:33:37,367
Now, today I am telling you.
I'd like a coffee.

767
01:33:46,947 --> 01:33:50,849
I'm sorry, but the problem is,
you see...

768
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:54,352
the machine's broken down.

769
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,911
- Sure you won't have a chocolate?
- No!

770
01:33:56,989 --> 01:34:00,789
- Why the hell should I?
- It's nothing to get sore about.

771
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,727
I'll have a glass of red wine.

772
01:34:03,796 --> 01:34:06,492
I suppose you're
out of Gauloises.

773
01:34:06,564 --> 01:34:08,759
That's right.
We've only got Marlboros.

774
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,767
You can keep them.

775
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:14,565
I know just what you are up to.

776
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,369
Goddamn murderers!

777
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:22,042
No good looking at me like that.

778
01:34:22,112 --> 01:34:24,945
I know exactly
what your little scheme is.

779
01:34:43,499 --> 01:34:46,695
- What's wrong?
- My boat.

780
01:34:46,768 --> 01:34:50,067
- Which one?
- The red one.

781
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:58,768
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

782
01:35:03,684 --> 01:35:06,847
And you've lost your boat--
the red one?

783
01:35:08,455 --> 01:35:11,151
Okay, I'll get it back for you.

784
01:35:20,366 --> 01:35:22,425
Filthy little brat!

785
01:36:12,881 --> 01:36:14,143
Mother. Mother!

786
01:36:48,314 --> 01:36:50,317
It's him! He's there!

787
01:37:41,597 --> 01:37:43,224
I'll fight.

788
01:37:45,368 --> 01:37:47,598
I'll fight to the bitter end.

789
01:40:54,008 --> 01:40:55,942
Who is it?

790
01:40:56,010 --> 01:40:58,979
It's me, Trelkovsky.

791
01:41:04,552 --> 01:41:08,647
- Were you sleeping?
- What's the matter?

792
01:41:11,791 --> 01:41:14,624
Sorry to bother you
at this hour of the morning.

793
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:18,686
Do you mind if I
stayed here for a while?

794
01:41:23,335 --> 01:41:25,269
You're strange.

795
01:41:26,872 --> 01:41:31,808
You must tell me.
I wouldn't mind, really.

796
01:41:31,876 --> 01:41:35,676
No. No, of course
you can stay.

797
01:41:44,589 --> 01:41:48,354
- Look, you're hurt.
- It's nothing, really.

798
01:41:52,162 --> 01:41:55,529
- But it's filthy.
- That's nothing.

799
01:41:55,599 --> 01:41:59,500
Oh, wait, wait.
I think I've got some--

800
01:41:59,568 --> 01:42:01,695
some things here.

801
01:42:19,687 --> 01:42:21,882
How did you do that?

802
01:42:21,956 --> 01:42:24,651
It's them.

803
01:42:24,725 --> 01:42:27,193
Who?

804
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:29,194
They're trying to kill me.

805
01:42:32,499 --> 01:42:34,694
Drive me to suicide.

806
01:42:34,768 --> 01:42:37,998
What are you talking about?

807
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:40,061
Who's trying to kill you?

808
01:42:40,139 --> 01:42:43,302
Stella, I've been lying to you.

809
01:42:44,977 --> 01:42:47,810
I'm living in her apartment.

810
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,211
Whose apartment?

811
01:42:50,281 --> 01:42:52,408
Simone's.

812
01:42:52,484 --> 01:42:55,817
I rented Simone Choule's apartment.

813
01:42:57,155 --> 01:43:00,613
- How did you rent it?
- She died because of the neighbors.

814
01:43:02,227 --> 01:43:04,456
It was a plot.

815
01:43:04,528 --> 01:43:07,998
A plot against Simone?
You're completely insane.

816
01:43:08,131 --> 01:43:10,065
I'm not insane. Listen.

817
01:43:10,133 --> 01:43:13,102
They forced her
to commit suicide.

818
01:43:13,169 --> 01:43:15,933
I can prove it.

819
01:43:16,006 --> 01:43:20,271
And they are trying
to do the same thing to me.

820
01:43:20,342 --> 01:43:24,244
Everything's ready. They worked it
all out, every detail.

821
01:43:24,313 --> 01:43:27,441
Do you know what
they've been doing to me?

822
01:43:27,516 --> 01:43:29,915
It's--

823
01:43:29,984 --> 01:43:32,646
It's so appalling...

824
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:36,019
so incredible that
I can hardly tell you...

825
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:39,218
yet it's true, I swear it.

826
01:43:39,293 --> 01:43:42,819
Oh, tell me.
Tell me. I'm listening.

827
01:43:46,733 --> 01:43:52,000
They've been trying to
turn me into Simone Choule.

828
01:43:54,775 --> 01:43:59,370
There now. I'm your friend.
I'm going to help you.

829
01:43:59,445 --> 01:44:01,572
Come now.

830
01:44:01,647 --> 01:44:06,050
You're exhausted.
Lie down.

831
01:44:09,554 --> 01:44:12,523
I'm going to leave Paris
in a couple of days.

832
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:17,186
- They'll never find me.
- That's the best thing to do.

833
01:44:18,797 --> 01:44:21,459
You're the only one
I can trust.

834
01:44:21,533 --> 01:44:23,466
Aren't you?

835
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:03,633
It's me, Stella.

836
01:45:03,704 --> 01:45:05,968
Don't be frightened.

837
01:45:07,408 --> 01:45:10,639
You do recognize me,
don't you?

838
01:45:13,714 --> 01:45:16,307
Sorry.

839
01:45:16,382 --> 01:45:18,475
I was having a nightmare.

840
01:45:18,551 --> 01:45:20,246
I must get to work now.
I'm late.

841
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:25,223
I'll be back around 8:00.
I've left your breakfast ready.

842
01:45:26,392 --> 01:45:30,327
- I love you.
- And I love you.

843
01:45:32,898 --> 01:45:35,833
I even went out and
bought you some croissants.

844
01:45:38,036 --> 01:45:40,401
Please stay with me.
Don't leave me alone.

845
01:45:40,471 --> 01:45:42,405
Oh, now, listen.
I'm late.

846
01:45:42,473 --> 01:45:45,340
If you want to go out,
just leave the keys under the mat.

847
01:45:45,409 --> 01:45:49,368
I'll get another pair made tomorrow.
We'll each have our own set then.

848
01:45:51,883 --> 01:45:55,443
- Please don't go.
- Don't be naughty now.

849
01:45:55,519 --> 01:45:59,387
You're to be good
and stay here.

850
01:46:00,490 --> 01:46:03,357
You've got everything you need.

851
01:46:03,426 --> 01:46:06,519
If you like, you can go out
and get some fresh air.

852
01:46:06,595 --> 01:46:09,120
I'll bring some food
back this evening.

853
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:13,760
We'll eat in, or go out
to a restaurant, if you like.

854
01:46:13,836 --> 01:46:15,770
We'll see how you feel.

855
01:46:17,239 --> 01:46:19,366
See you tonight then.

856
01:47:22,733 --> 01:47:24,667
Is anyone there?

857
01:47:55,696 --> 01:47:58,062
Filthy bitch!

858
01:47:59,267 --> 01:48:01,633
They're all in it together.

859
01:48:44,975 --> 01:48:47,967
- Stop here. Stop, stop.
- Hey, what's wrong?

860
01:48:48,045 --> 01:48:51,037
Nothing. I'm getting out.

861
01:49:47,133 --> 01:49:49,600
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

862
01:50:44,352 --> 01:50:47,515
Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you very much.

863
01:50:57,297 --> 01:50:59,959
Have you got any idea
where I can buy a gun?

864
01:51:01,601 --> 01:51:05,765
- I'll pay good money.
- Get the hell out of here, punk!

865
01:51:05,839 --> 01:51:10,366
- This bugger wants to buy a gun!
- What?

866
01:51:12,911 --> 01:51:14,538
I'll tell the cops,
you little shit!

867
01:51:43,907 --> 01:51:47,967
I told you not to drive so fast.
Now look what's happened.

868
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:03,214
Monsieur, are you hurt?

869
01:52:03,291 --> 01:52:06,692
People who can't drive should
take taxis, you old jerks.

870
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:10,458
How dare you say that! My wife
hasn't had an accident in 25 years.

871
01:52:10,532 --> 01:52:13,796
He's right. The guy walked
right under the wheels.

872
01:52:13,867 --> 01:52:16,392
- I saw the whole thing.
- Let me through, please.

873
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:18,734
Excuse me. Let me through.
Let me through.

874
01:52:18,806 --> 01:52:21,331
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm a doctor.

875
01:52:43,628 --> 01:52:45,459
Murderers.

876
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:51,568
Believe me, my wife and I are
very upset about what has happened.

877
01:52:51,636 --> 01:52:53,899
Please stand back.
On the curb.

878
01:52:53,971 --> 01:52:56,462
- Back.
- Officer. This is how it happened.

879
01:52:56,540 --> 01:53:00,271
Your ID, please.
Yours too, monsieur.

880
01:53:00,344 --> 01:53:03,142
You're very lucky.

881
01:53:03,214 --> 01:53:05,773
Only a few scratches.

882
01:53:05,849 --> 01:53:07,680
Nothing broken.

883
01:53:08,618 --> 01:53:10,677
But you should have an X ray.

884
01:53:15,725 --> 01:53:19,524
It's not serious. A mild case of
delirium tremens, in my opinion.

885
01:53:19,595 --> 01:53:23,258
The driver and her husband made
a statement. They'll drive him home.

886
01:53:23,332 --> 01:53:26,495
Is that all right, Doctor?
Or should I call for an ambulance?

887
01:53:26,568 --> 01:53:29,537
Well, if this gentleman can
manage it, it'd be fine.

888
01:53:29,605 --> 01:53:33,335
We'd be glad to give this poor man
a lift home. Of course.

889
01:53:39,514 --> 01:53:42,415
We'll take you home, huh?

890
01:53:51,224 --> 01:53:53,692
That is preposterous!
No! Please!

891
01:53:55,228 --> 01:53:57,162
- They were trying to kill me.
- Yeah?

892
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:59,595
They were playing football
with a human head.

893
01:53:59,665 --> 01:54:02,031
I'll give him a shot
of something to calm him down.

894
01:54:02,101 --> 01:54:04,399
No. No injection.

895
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:06,233
I don't want any injection.

896
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:10,074
I don't want an injection.

897
01:54:11,242 --> 01:54:13,267
They tried to kill me.

898
01:55:16,336 --> 01:55:18,270
Mirza, quiet down!

899
01:55:21,808 --> 01:55:27,303
Good evening, madam. This gentleman
has had a slight accident.

900
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,973
Nothing serious, though.
Nothing to worry about, but--

901
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:34,417
- What did he do now?
- Let's get him up to the apartment.

902
01:55:35,621 --> 01:55:37,555
How did it happen?

903
01:55:37,623 --> 01:55:41,150
He sort of jumped out
in front of the car, and--

904
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:45,059
Luckily my wife
has very good reflexes.

905
01:55:46,998 --> 01:55:50,126
What's going on here?

906
01:55:50,201 --> 01:55:51,828
It's him again.

907
01:55:52,904 --> 01:55:55,236
Oh, that bastard!

908
01:58:12,899 --> 01:58:15,629
Stay. Stay, Mirza.

909
01:58:31,250 --> 01:58:34,150
- What was that?
- Down in the courtyard.

910
01:58:59,909 --> 01:59:03,538
We'd better call an ambulance.
Go get one, quick.

911
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,939
You shouldn't move!

912
01:59:11,187 --> 01:59:13,586
Monsieur, I swear
I am not Simone Choule.

913
01:59:13,655 --> 01:59:15,350
Quick, get him a blanket.

914
01:59:15,423 --> 01:59:18,324
Two suicides in succession.

915
01:59:18,393 --> 01:59:23,888
- It's quite unbelievable.
- Look at his clothes. He's insane.

916
01:59:23,965 --> 01:59:27,456
And we just finished
repairing the roof.

917
01:59:27,534 --> 01:59:31,368
I knew there was something wrong
with him the first time I saw him.

918
01:59:35,843 --> 01:59:40,472
Oh, God, Monsieur Trelkovsky! Be
reasonable. Wait for the ambulance.

919
01:59:59,464 --> 02:00:02,297
You gang of killers!

920
02:00:02,367 --> 02:00:04,800
I'll show you some blood.

921
02:00:08,205 --> 02:00:10,799
You wanted a clean death,
didn't you?

922
02:00:10,875 --> 02:00:13,867
- Be reasonable.
- It's going to be dirty.

923
02:00:15,079 --> 02:00:17,240
Unforgettable.

924
02:00:17,314 --> 02:00:20,146
It was better last time,
wasn't it?

925
02:00:20,216 --> 02:00:22,150
Well, I'm not Simone Choule.

926
02:00:23,820 --> 02:00:25,754
I'm Trelkovsky!

927
02:00:37,099 --> 02:00:40,364
All right, all right.
What's going on?

928
02:00:40,435 --> 02:00:43,404
- A tenant jumped out of a window.
- Again?

929
02:00:43,472 --> 02:00:46,099
- You must get them wholesale.
- Where is he now?

930
02:00:46,174 --> 02:00:48,574
He's gone back up
to his apartment.

931
02:00:48,643 --> 02:00:51,908
I think he must have had
some kind of a brainstorm.

932
02:00:51,979 --> 02:00:53,503
He's gonna jump again!

933
02:00:54,615 --> 02:00:58,106
- Tuck into the gallery.
- Take it easy! Don't move!

934
02:00:58,185 --> 02:01:01,780
- We'll come up and get you, okay?
- Be reasonable now.

935
02:01:01,855 --> 02:01:04,756
- Please! It's enough.
- Why is this happening?

936
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:10,959
- Oh, God, no.
- Don't do anything silly!

937
02:01:27,745 --> 02:01:29,838
Are you a friend of hers?

938
02:01:30,582 --> 02:01:32,209
Oh, I'm sorry.

939
02:01:35,820 --> 02:01:38,754
What on earth
could have happened?

940
02:01:38,822 --> 02:01:41,347
Why would she do
a thing like that?

941
02:01:43,293 --> 02:01:47,491
To tell you the truth,
I'm not a friend of hers at all.

942
02:01:47,564 --> 02:01:50,361
I hardly know her,
actually, but--

943
02:01:53,102 --> 02:01:55,036
Simone.

944
02:01:58,507 --> 02:02:01,704
You do recognize me,
don't you?

945
02:02:01,777 --> 02:02:05,473
It's me, Stella.

946
02:02:05,547 --> 02:02:08,516
Your friend, Stella.

947
02:02:08,583 --> 02:02:10,551
Don't you recognize me?

948
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
