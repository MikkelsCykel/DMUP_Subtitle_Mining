1
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,713
- I think this might be it, Paul. Good luck.
- Thanks.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,866
Boy, it sure is thick.

3
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:43,664
I'm in.

4
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,393
See, your brother's smart.

5
00:00:48,475 --> 00:00:51,706
He's smart. Are you as smart
as your brother? I think so.

6
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,269
We are so proud of you.

7
00:00:57,555 --> 00:01:01,309
- A full scholarship!
- Plus a meal plan.

8
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:06,512
First one ever in our family.

9
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:09,155
Of course,
the kid was reading <i>Archie</i> at one.

10
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:11,034
That's for Paul.

11
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,584
- Take this.
- Grandpa, no. I can't.

12
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,794
No. You don't know the city.
Everything there is very expensive.

13
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,991
Just parking your car costs $8.

14
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,225
Grandpa, I don't even have a car.

15
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,665
Make an old man happy.

16
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:33,224
Thank you.

17
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,226
Paul, dance with me?

18
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,554
Do it. All right.

19
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,753
Yeah! Cool.

20
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:57,990
Come on!

21
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:00,988
What are you doing?

22
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,786
No. Like this.

23
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:08,310
Come on, Paul. Do it right.

24
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,906
- You're messing it up!
- What?

25
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,230
There.

26
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,186
- You all packed?
- Yep.

27
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,508
Can I give you a hand?

28
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,632
Wiggle that tail section
for me just a skosh, will you?

29
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:35,592
Don't know what I'm gonna do around here
without my wing man.

30
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:38,826
I'll be back, soon as they catch on to me.

31
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,345
What have they got to catch on to?

32
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,868
Well, it's a tough school and...

33
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:47,634
...everyone else
will be more used to the city.

34
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:52,272
Did you know that one skyscraper has
more people than the town of Clairmont?

35
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:55,308
And they're all real sophisticated too.

36
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:58,626
You've seen that <i>Seinfeld</i> show, right?
It's just like that.

37
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,952
They've all got that
sarcastic kind of humor.

38
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,425
And who was purported to be
the funniest kid at Jackson High?

39
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:08,029
You told me a joke the other day.
It was hilarious.

40
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,707
- A frayed knot...
- String...

41
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:13,026
...walks into the bar.
- Wants a drink. Yeah, that was funny.

42
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:14,673
You're a funny guy.

43
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:20,748
I don't know. I mean, it's such a giant city.
How can you possibly meet anyone?

44
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,550
You want the secret to making friends?

45
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,674
- Sure.
- I picked this up in the service.

46
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:30,746
You'll have a lot of buddies
if you remember this one rule:

47
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:33,790
Interested is interesting.

48
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,908
- What do you mean?
- Well, everybody's got a story, okay?

49
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,953
And all they want
is for somebody to listen to it.

50
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,548
People are basically good.

51
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:47,866
If you care about them,
they're gonna want to be your friend.

52
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:51,948
All you got to do is look at people.
Look when you're talking to someone.

53
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,464
That's it. Look them in the eye. Focus.

54
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,468
Hear their story.
Hear what they've got to say.

55
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:00,315
You do that, buddy,
and you can do no wrong.

56
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,430
Yeah.

57
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:05,304
Thanks.

58
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:08,664
Wiggle that.

59
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:27,513
Excuse me. Do you want to sit in my seat?
You can have my seat.

60
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:29,634
That was for her.

61
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:44,034
You look familiar.

62
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:50,064
- Tall drip.
- That would be me.

63
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,508
Hi. I'm Paul.

64
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,907
Abnormal Psych.

65
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,313
We're in the same class.

66
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:12,549
See you there.

67
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,507
Left, no. Left, no!

68
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,306
But you're pushing!

69
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,272
- Guys, can it go over there?
- No.

70
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:42,266
- Good afternoon.
- What's up, man? How are you?

71
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:48,946
- Let me try that one again.
- No, that's good. Don't worry.

72
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,149
See you later.

73
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,823
Hey, guys.

74
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:06,265
That is a great hat.

75
00:06:06,955 --> 00:06:09,264
Did the producers of <i>Fargo</i>
have a garage sale?

76
00:06:09,355 --> 00:06:11,630
- Leave it be.
- Here, leave it be.

77
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:16,272
- That fraternity called for you.
- Which one? Which one was it?

78
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,913
Gamma something.

79
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,987
Gamma Delta. Gamma Delta Pi?

80
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,394
Gamma Delta Pi.

81
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:25,912
No, it was gamma globulin, it wasn't
a fraternity at all. It was a blood bank.

82
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,424
But they were really interested in you.

83
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:31,225
It was a blood bank.

84
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:36,267
<i>The Hunger Artist.</i>
It's the story of a performer...

85
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,585
...who fasts as a form of entertainment.

86
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:43,032
Sits in a cage all day. This is how
he manages to entertain his audiences.

87
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:45,385
But, with his dying breath...

88
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,790
...he reveals his great secret: He could
never actually find any food that he...

89
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:54,544
...liked.

90
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,992
- I meant that.
- Jerry Lewis, ladies and gentlemen.

91
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:03,467
Listen, do you mind if I continue
with Mr. Kafka's story?

92
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:06,714
Are you all right?

93
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,114
Yeah, I'm okay.

94
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:11,430
Looks like you banged
your knee pretty bad.

95
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,868
No, I'm fine.

96
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,467
Let's put some ice on it.

97
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:20,590
What was Mr. Kafka saying
about free will versus destiny?

98
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:24,512
Anyone in the class of 167 students...

99
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:27,155
...all paying $35,000 a year to be here?

100
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,906
You? Lady in the infantry?

101
00:07:30,715 --> 00:07:33,707
- I didn't read it yet.
- I understand that.

102
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:37,032
You had Ben Affleck
on the <i>Leno Show</i> last night.

103
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:40,188
Great stuff, witty banter,
looking forward to the movie.

104
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,994
Perhaps in the future there'll be a course...

105
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:46,988
...on twenty-first century literature,
but until that glorious day...

106
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,186
Want some honey? I have more.

107
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,383
No, thank you.

108
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:54,234
Listen people, those rectangular slabs...

109
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:57,113
...you're using as doorstops are books.

110
00:07:57,195 --> 00:08:00,585
Careful. First time you open them,
they'll crack a little bit.

111
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,033
Don't be alarmed.

112
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:07,064
Florence Nightingale, what was Kafka
saying about free will versus destiny?

113
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,874
I don't think it's about
free will versus destiny.

114
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,992
You don't. Would you mind telling us
what it is about?

115
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:15,590
Sometimes you are so powerless...

116
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:18,872
...the only thing you can control
is how little you can live on.

117
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:20,104
Interesting.

118
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:22,669
You've reduced
the father of modern literature...

119
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:24,825
...into an anorexic teenage girl.

120
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,265
You just love humiliating me, don't you?

121
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,550
Dora, I'm not going to have one of those...

122
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,264
..."I know and you know and we know
and they don't know" arguments in class.

123
00:08:34,355 --> 00:08:36,915
We've agreed that if we do this
it's got to be secret.

124
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:40,590
I know how ashamed you are of me.
I'm just your dirty little secret.

125
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,826
Secret means clandestine.
Shame means embarrassed.

126
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:46,110
I'd think you'd covered that in junior high.

127
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:50,188
Could you stop treating me like a baby?
Why don't you take me seriously?

128
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:53,786
I'm risking my job to be with you.
Is that serious enough for you?

129
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,435
I'm over 18.
It's not like you're selling me alcohol.

130
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,506
- Do you know Professor Brown?
- No!

131
00:08:58,595 --> 00:08:59,948
- No.
- No!

132
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:04,193
Of course not. He lost his tenure
for having an affair with a student.

133
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:08,473
The board considers that abusing
power we have over impressionable minds.

134
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:13,026
- I could tell them how pigheaded you are.
- You are so condescending!

135
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:17,029
If I'm not smart enough for you,
then go for your professor girlfriends!

136
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:20,152
Your capacity to edit out ideas
you don't like makes...

137
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:22,869
...TASS look like
an Al Goldstein publication.

138
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,946
You think I don't know anything.

139
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,631
I think you know how to walk
in a pair of platform Mary Janes.

140
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:34,547
I think you know how to style your hair
with an eggbeater.

141
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:37,991
Save a little time by layering on two,
three weeks' worth of eyeliner.

142
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:40,191
- God, I hate you.
- You don't hate me.

143
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:42,664
- Say you don't hate me.
- Let me go! Yes, I do.

144
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:45,667
- Let me go. Stop it!
- Say you don't hate me!

145
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:52,030
<i>- Hi, Ma.</i>
- Hi, Rho.

146
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:54,625
<i>- Hi, Brenda.</i>
- Hi, Bren.

147
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:57,315
<i>Hi there, son-in-law.</i>

148
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:17,064
We're ordering 'za, slap me a big head.

149
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:22,310
I've got the descending dollars
meal plan so I already ate at the union.

150
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:25,512
I have $120, but it has to last
till the end of this...

151
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:28,224
Sorry.

152
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:37,584
Chris.

153
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,505
You think you could turn it down a skosh?

154
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:44,429
- "A skosh"? What the hell is that?
- Just a little.

155
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:10,594
I'm going to tell you something,
and this is for your own good, okay?

156
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:14,948
No one likes you.

157
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:19,264
They don't?

158
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,224
No.

159
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,034
- You didn't notice?
- Well, no.

160
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:29,505
- What did I do? Why doesn't anybody...
- I don't know.

161
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:33,469
You talk weird, your clothes are lame.

162
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,830
You never come in with a sixer.

163
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:40,153
You're just a wormy little guy who sits
in his room and studies. It's so gay.

164
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:44,428
But I'm on a Regents Scholarship.
If I do badly, they'll kick me out.

165
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:49,390
And I'm not like you guys.
You can just drink all night and still pass.

166
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,746
You must be really intelligent.

167
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,746
No, believe me. We're not.

168
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,226
You just got to play it smart.

169
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,387
Take a few Mickeys.

170
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,672
- "Mickeys"?
- Mickey Mouse. Cake. Easy classes.

171
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,146
I have to take my prerequisites.

172
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:10,225
I mean, take whatever you want.
Just try not to be so much like...

173
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,544
...you.

174
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,672
Well, you know what I mean.

175
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,986
Yeah, I guess so.

176
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,673
Just trying to help.

177
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,110
Chris.

178
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,543
- What's a sixer?
- It's a six-pack.

179
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,386
Beer. Thanks.

180
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,952
Hi, Rho. Hi, Bren.

181
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,034
Excuse me.

182
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,274
Come here, please.

183
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,548
What can I get you?

184
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:04,949
Your pantyhose.

185
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,430
How about a screwdriver?
They're really good here.

186
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:09,392
I'll give you $50 for them.

187
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,190
You can get three for $10 at Wal-Mart.

188
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,309
$60.

189
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,385
Please order a drink.
Just get a beer and I'll think about it.

190
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:20,544
Okay.

191
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,425
Honey, do you have anything smaller?
We can't change this yet.

192
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,144
Thanks.

193
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,394
- Why'd you do that?
- Get small bills while they're sober.

194
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,945
When drunk, they won't know what
they gave you. Supplement your tips.

195
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:40,187
- You mean give them the wrong change?
- They're donating to your college fund.

196
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:43,193
- Yeah, but that's stealing.
- You're funny.

197
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,874
- You are such a little shit.
- Annie, get back here!

198
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:50,946
You want everyone to think
you're Mr. Stud.

199
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:52,150
I had to tell them.

200
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:56,547
- You did not!
- It's "Truth or Dare"! That's how you play.

201
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,143
What's wrong with you,
are you're unstable?

202
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:02,113
You think it makes me want you?
Must you rub my nose in it?

203
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:05,107
Are you out of your goddamn mind,
you raving lunatic?

204
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:07,151
Look at her, man, she's a psychopath!

205
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,223
Here.

206
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,394
- Sal, it's 11:30.
- I'm talking here.

207
00:14:14,475 --> 00:14:17,308
If I miss the 11:50, then I can't get home.

208
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:18,994
Give me the money.

209
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:22,348
If people would show
a little appreciation...

210
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:25,347
Nobody appreciates anything
you do for them anymore.

211
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,304
You're $40 short.

212
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:29,511
What? That's impossible.

213
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,426
Want to take it up with Victor?

214
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:33,870
I don't think that's something
you want to do.

215
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,832
There must be some mistake.

216
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:38,503
All right, he should be here soon.

217
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:45,306
- Here.
- Thank you.

218
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,993
<i>The 11:50 for Westchester,</i>
<i>Bronx and Yonkers...</i>

219
00:14:51,075 --> 00:14:53,873
<i>... now leaving on Track 17.</i>

220
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:57,552
<i>11:50 now leaving Track 17.</i>

221
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:00,834
Wait, wait! No!

222
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,668
Stop!

223
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:27,153
Ma, listen.
I got totally screwed at study group.

224
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,829
My topic was last, and I had to stay.

225
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,475
I rushed to the station,
but I missed the last train.

226
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:34,068
<i>Where are you, Grand Central?</i>

227
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:37,033
No, I went with my friend Linda
to the girls' dorm.

228
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,594
<i>Can you stay there?</i>

229
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:41,189
- Yeah, it's cool. I'll sleep on her couch.
- <i>Okay.</i>

230
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,948
- All right, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

231
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,794
She's going to "star 69."
It'll only be a second.

232
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:54,307
Rubin Hall, ladies' residence.

233
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:58,229
<i>- Is this a dorm for girls?</i>
- Yes, this is a dormitory for women.

234
00:15:58,315 --> 00:16:00,112
<i>Can anybody just get in there?</i>

235
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:02,834
No, there are security doors
and a night watchman.

236
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,549
<i>- Okay. Thank you.</i>
- You're welcome.

237
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:08,869
That was great. Thank you.

238
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:10,308
Bless you, honey.

239
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:40,032
I got this girl's phone number last night.
Guess what she's got.

240
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:40,991
Herpes?

241
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:43,669
No, genius, she's got a pierced tongue.

242
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:45,632
It means she's gay, you know.

243
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:49,345
- What are you talking about?
- It adds to their sensual pleasure.

244
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,949
- No, it's for my sensual pleasure.
- It is not.

245
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:53,787
Let's ask Dr. Drew.

246
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:56,871
We got Chris on the phone from Seattle.

247
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:59,708
He wants to know which sex prefers
a pierced tongue more.

248
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:01,114
I don't get it.

249
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:08,308
Come on, guys.
I just washed all these towels.

250
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,911
Speaking of which, Paul,
next time don't use so much starch.

251
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,031
Has anybody seen my toothbrush?

252
00:18:20,595 --> 00:18:22,904
You can't find it? Shit.

253
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:25,953
You better find that thing.
Those things can cost up to $2.50.

254
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:28,503
Yeah, and yours has such a nice handle.

255
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:44,034
You still don't qualify for financial aid.
Why don't you try student placement?

256
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:48,472
Those jobs only pay $5 or $6 an hour.
I make three times as much at the bar.

257
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:50,831
I can't pay tuition unless I work more...

258
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:53,349
...and I can't do that
because I have to travel home.

259
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:57,144
Not everybody who's accepted
can actually attend this school.

260
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:59,784
Why don't you try
to get yourself emancipated?

261
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,672
Okay. Thank you.

262
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:21,385
Where are your parents' tax returns?

263
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,274
I don't have them.

264
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:26,313
How can you prove they're not
claiming you as an exemption?

265
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:29,705
They kind of are, but if I get emancipated...

266
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,946
...and I get financial aid,
then I'm sure they'll stop.

267
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,586
Right. Who's your attorney?

268
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,712
Attorney against my parents?

269
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,705
Are you saying that it's uncontested?

270
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:48,944
Yeah.

271
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:53,392
Then you'll need W-2s, rent stubs,
proof of residence, power and water bills.

272
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:55,073
I don't have a residence.

273
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:58,784
You can't get emancipated
to live on the street. Okay?

274
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:02,192
I can't apply for work-study
unless I get emancipated.

275
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:06,274
- Then you'll have to get an apartment.
- But all my money goes to tuition.

276
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,915
Then you'll just have to make more money.

277
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,627
Noah, get up.

278
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,748
Give me a hand! Here, hold it up.
Hold it up.

279
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,744
Guys, shouldn't we call
the resident assistant or housing services?

280
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:46,910
We're not supposed to have waterbeds.
They'll think we did something bad.

281
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,670
Dude, it's only water. Let it dry, man.

282
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:53,225
- Guys!
- Noah, come on.

283
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,184
Noah!

284
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:08,110
- We have to resolve this Paul issue.
- That guy's totally weak.

285
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:11,153
We gave it our best shot.
I say we get rid of him.

286
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:15,433
Yeah. Look at him and look at us.
The guy can't possibly feel like he belongs.

287
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:19,992
If he was with his own kind, he'd feel
more comfortable, better about himself.

288
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,713
It would be best all around.

289
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:25,674
I try to get along with everybody
but that guy's got no personality.

290
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:28,355
And he reflects poorly on us
with the ladies.

291
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,588
- Do you take student meal vouchers?
- No.

292
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:47,430
Okay, Paul.

293
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,552
Apparently, you've caused
some problems for your roommates.

294
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:53,069
Let's see if I can't resolve this situation.

295
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,271
What are your complaints with Paul?

296
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,950
It's not that I don't like Paul as a person.

297
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,265
He a very fun-Ioving guy.

298
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:05,827
But we've divided up our chores
for the week and...

299
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:10,751
...he's always too busy
or has some excuse.

300
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:13,823
And we wind up doing his.

301
00:22:14,155 --> 00:22:15,349
How about you?

302
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:20,146
He says derogatory things
about other ethnic groups.

303
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:23,033
And even though I believe
in freedom of speech...

304
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:26,546
...you know, it's like the way
smoke is air pollution...

305
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:32,144
...I feel that racial slurs are
a form of hearing pollution.

306
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:36,183
I don't want to sound girly
about any of this...

307
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:40,871
...but I think all of us have taken
an exception to Paul's personal hygiene.

308
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:43,066
How about he makes more of an effort?

309
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:46,192
We'll meet again after a grace period
and see how it's going.

310
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:48,266
I don't know if I could do that.

311
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:52,587
I love making racial slurs,
and I hate doing chores...

312
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:55,952
...and indoor plumbing is
just way too confusing for me.

313
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:59,672
That's who I am,
and if they can't deal with it then...

314
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,147
...I'd rather live alone.

315
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:08,264
I'll file this with Housing
and see if we can't get you moved.

316
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,269
In the meantime, better start packing.

317
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:35,307
- You from the veterinary school?
- No.

318
00:23:35,555 --> 00:23:37,147
No? Then why'd they pick you?

319
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:41,626
There's a housing shortage, and I'm on
a list for another dorm, but since I'm not...

320
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:44,513
...a paying customer,
I'm sure I'm a low priority.

321
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:47,463
- That's okay, baby, it's all right.
- I'm sorry.

322
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:49,068
Did the mean man hurt you?

323
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:52,431
It's okay. Give me kisses. Don't worry.

324
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:55,987
It's all right, baby.

325
00:23:56,355 --> 00:23:58,107
These are the operating rooms.

326
00:23:58,195 --> 00:24:00,948
But don't ever go in there. They're sterile.

327
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:04,153
All you have to do is
change their poopie papers...

328
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:08,911
...give them their medications and
if any of the animals have an emergency...

329
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:10,747
...you got to page the vet.

330
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:13,344
And this here is your room.

331
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:16,587
You got your hot plate,
your bed and the refrigerator...

332
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:18,745
...but that's for employees only.

333
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:24,065
- You'll get used to the smell.
- Can I get some help over here?

334
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:26,144
Hold her down.

335
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:29,508
Shut up.

336
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,633
I could use your help
on a tooth cleaning as well.

337
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:36,273
You do something with her, okay? Thanks.

338
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:39,224
Yeah, I know.

339
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,873
I hear you. Boy, do I hear you.

340
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,264
Dora, Victor wants to see you.

341
00:24:48,715 --> 00:24:50,785
It's okay. You'll be okay.

342
00:24:53,915 --> 00:24:57,794
- I don't think this is working out.
- What? Why not?

343
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:02,227
Last night, Kitty's station, $1200,
Angel's, $1400...

344
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:03,668
...your station, $600.

345
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:06,906
But I'm in the back.
There's always less people back there.

346
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:10,510
You're not getting it.
What do you do if a customer talks to you?

347
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,547
I listen, act interested.

348
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:15,195
No. You say something funny,
then walk away.

349
00:25:15,435 --> 00:25:18,233
So if they want to talk,
they got to buy more drinks.

350
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:21,274
- Okay, I'll try and do better.
- No, forget it.

351
00:25:21,635 --> 00:25:24,229
You're too smart or too stupid,
but ain't happening.

352
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:26,704
It's a shame. Could have made
some real money.

353
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:28,467
Take this and get out of here.

354
00:25:28,555 --> 00:25:31,353
Please let me finish tonight.
I really need the tips.

355
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:34,552
Victor, she's working her way
through college.

356
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,593
Did I ask you?

357
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:40,945
Come on, take it. For last week. Take it.

358
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:48,508
Man, our T.G. Party was a total bust.

359
00:25:48,635 --> 00:25:50,944
Every time I got close
to hitting it with a mama...

360
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:53,469
...a girlfriend showed up
to screw everything up.

361
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:57,753
What we need is a higher female-to-male
ratio, like in cool nightclubs...

362
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:00,395
...where they let in five times
as many women as men.

363
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,751
How are we going to get
five times as many women to show up?

364
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,594
We have a party,
but we call it a fundraiser.

365
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:09,709
- Think of a charity.
- It's got to be the right charity.

366
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:11,228
It's got to attract hotties.

367
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,510
- What's the country with all the babies?
- China.

368
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:15,187
- Romania.
- No, but wait.

369
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:18,108
That's going to give them
the wrong message.

370
00:26:18,195 --> 00:26:19,947
All right. How about AIDS?

371
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:21,793
There's a mood-setter.

372
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,553
How about a suicide hotline?

373
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:26,354
But do they need a fundraiser?
All they have is phones.

374
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:27,424
Hey, backpacks.

375
00:26:27,515 --> 00:26:30,473
- What's going on?
- Inspections for drugs and alcohol.

376
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,108
- What?
- Since when?

377
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:33,907
O'Brien is in a coma.

378
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:34,905
So?

379
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:37,190
So the board instigated new policies.

380
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:38,634
This is whack.

381
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:41,428
- Can they even do this?
- I'll call my father's lawyer.

382
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:45,793
Our parents pay a lot of money for us
to enjoy our college experience.

383
00:26:48,635 --> 00:26:50,387
Hey, my metal detector!

384
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,426
I don't know how to make this any easier
for you. It's character evaluation.

385
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,983
It's not unlike one of those
"VH-1 Legend" shows...

386
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,863
...except you're discussing a fictional
character instead of a coked-out singer.

387
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,313
Understand this?

388
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:06,147
How about this? Dismissed.

389
00:27:06,315 --> 00:27:07,987
Ah, yes.

390
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:11,905
- I don't understand my grade.
- That's the letter we use for failure.

391
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,747
See me after class.

392
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:18,069
- Do you have to ask him something?
- No, it's okay. Go ahead.

393
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,314
Professor Alcott?

394
00:27:22,315 --> 00:27:23,304
- Yes.
- Hi.

395
00:27:23,395 --> 00:27:26,387
I'm on a Regents Scholarship.
I have to maintain a 3.5 average.

396
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:29,751
I can do it with two As and a B+
because I can get a B in Physics.

397
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:32,793
I can't get less than a B
because I'd only have one A left.

398
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:36,629
The thing is, my roommates
never let me have any quiet study time.

399
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,108
And now I've had to move.

400
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:41,028
I have this kind of crazy philosophy
that your grades...

401
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:43,868
...should represent your grasp
of the material...

402
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,987
...not your negotiating skills,
which are amazing, by the way.

403
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:50,909
No, I would never ask for a grade
that you didn't think was fair.

404
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:54,823
It's just that since I have 20 credits
and I only need 16.

405
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:58,072
I hoped to take this class pass-fail,
so I don't get kicked out.

406
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:01,943
Sir, I promise I wouldn't slack off.
In fact, I'd work doubly hard.

407
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:04,868
I'm ecstatic to hear your plans
to work doubly hard.

408
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:08,584
Because Lit 100 courses are
never given pass-fail.

409
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:11,314
Why don't you take
all that non-slacking energy...

410
00:28:11,395 --> 00:28:14,467
...and try to focus it
toward your finals. Okay?

411
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,224
Yes, sir.

412
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:20,353
That wasn't very nice.

413
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:23,873
I'm a mean son of a bitch.
When's your next class?

414
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:25,309
Not till 6:00.

415
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:26,794
I'm off at 4:00.

416
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:30,989
Okay, but can we discuss something
that I want to ask you about...

417
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,106
...in a non-emotional way?

418
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:37,427
Seriously, how am I supposed to teach
Camus when you're wearing this sweater?

419
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,267
I think we may have to take it off.

420
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:42,552
Do you think 4:00, my place?
I could be wrong, but I think so.

421
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:44,785
I'm sorry you feel that way
about the French.

422
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:48,993
It is a course on European Literature.
Can't ignore the whole country.

423
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,070
Paulie.

424
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,629
- Can I help you?
- Correct me if I'm wrong.

425
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:03,787
Didn't you kick me out of our room
for wetting your bed?

426
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,309
Wait a minute.
Noah didn't talk to you about this?

427
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:08,033
Look, what do you want?

428
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:10,306
You thought we kicked you out?

429
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:14,427
Come on. You're my asshole buddy.

430
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,944
- Look, since O'Brien died...
- What?

431
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:19,072
O'Brien, on the 8th floor, died.

432
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:22,625
They've instituted a new policy where
they're doing grocery inspections.

433
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,387
Making sure no alcohol comes in.

434
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:27,751
They're doing spot checks to make sure
there's one guest per person.

435
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:31,510
Just because one guy can't monitor
his buzz all of us got to suffer.

436
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:34,029
Which is why Adam
came up with this great idea...

437
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:36,754
...that one of us has to get
an off-campus residence.

438
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,108
- Noah didn't explain this to you?
- No, he didn't.

439
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,704
Maybe I'm the world's biggest cynic.

440
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:46,231
But I'm finding all of this
very hard to believe.

441
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:48,545
Paul, why would I play you, dude?

442
00:29:49,435 --> 00:29:51,391
Why? Why?

443
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:55,907
I don't know why. Why would you reset
my alarm clock so I'd be late for class?

444
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:59,908
Why would you hide all my clothes
and fill the drawers with Styrofoam?

445
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:02,987
Why did you glue together
every page of my Psych book?

446
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:04,946
You know how long that took?

447
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:11,109
I thought you'd laugh.
That's just stuff we do to each other.

448
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:18,830
All I wanted is for you to feel like
you were part of the group, man.

449
00:30:18,915 --> 00:30:20,189
I mean, seriously.

450
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:23,904
Remember those talks about
how nobody liked you, what you could do?

451
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,424
I was trying to help you get in with us.

452
00:30:26,515 --> 00:30:29,951
I was tired of seeing you
sitting around by yourself. Come on.

453
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:33,865
Can we have a trial run
get-together tonight?

454
00:30:34,355 --> 00:30:36,869
I guarantee you will tap some fine hide.

455
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:41,830
I have two Everclear tickets for tonight
and I was going to ask a girl.

456
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:42,904
Smooth.

457
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,194
This is Annie's.

458
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:56,145
I don't know where that came from.

459
00:30:56,275 --> 00:30:57,310
- Paul?
- What?

460
00:30:57,395 --> 00:30:59,067
Are you hitting my bitch?

461
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:03,070
No! No! I'm not hitting your bitch.

462
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,505
I've never hit your bitch
nor would I ever hit your bitch.

463
00:31:06,635 --> 00:31:08,466
I'm just playing with you.

464
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:12,072
- Because, you know, right? I mean...
- I know.

465
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:14,749
I knew it was there. I put it there.

466
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:20,669
- I got to go. Okay? Dust.
- Dust. Dust.

467
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:27,474
God.

468
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,594
Every part of me is satisfied.

469
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:33,829
Even my teeth are relaxed.

470
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:35,750
Oh, shit.

471
00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:39,547
I'm late. I got a 7:00 workshop.

472
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:44,832
- Wait. You said we'd discuss something.
- Yeah, I'm listening.

473
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:49,434
I got fired from my job and I won't have
the money for next semester's tuition.

474
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:50,834
What are we going to do?

475
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:54,430
If I get a job on graveyard shift,
I'll earn money instead of commuting.

476
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,983
- I could maybe just crash here...
- Hold on.

477
00:31:57,595 --> 00:32:00,234
I mean, not even in the bed.
I could sleep on the couch.

478
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:01,873
No, I don't want to go there.

479
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,707
- Go where?
- That domestic place.

480
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:07,071
I don't want your grunge gothic-wear
lying around in my closet.

481
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:11,194
Or those blackhead strips in the bathroom,
posters up of Axl Rose.

482
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:13,072
Whatever adolescent icon. Listen.

483
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:15,953
You know how these things sour
when people get too close.

484
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,707
You get tired of each other.

485
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,753
I don't want that ever to happen to us.
You know why?

486
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:22,593
Because I love you too much.

487
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,667
So much you'd have me sleep
on the street or drop out of school.

488
00:32:25,755 --> 00:32:27,905
I love the sweet... Where are my notes?

489
00:32:27,995 --> 00:32:30,748
My sexy, smart girl that I have fun with.

490
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:34,425
If I wanted teen angst,
I'd watch reruns of <i>My So-Called Life.</i>

491
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,545
I'd do anything to make you happy.

492
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:41,512
I type your papers, I grade your tests.

493
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:44,314
I've told you not to do that
unless you want to.

494
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:50,027
Just because I'm giving doesn't mean
I can expect a man to lift a finger for me.

495
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:54,627
If she were alive, Betty Friedan
would applaud your little epiphany.

496
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,073
If Kafka were alive, he'd say:

497
00:32:57,155 --> 00:33:00,386
"Stop misinterpreting my novels,
you pretentious bonehead!"

498
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,024
Hey, again.

499
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:38,704
Hi.

500
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,994
I eat here every night.
I've never seen you come in.

501
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:44,509
You eat in the student center every night?

502
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:47,063
There's like 20 restaurants on every block.

503
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:50,355
Yeah, I don't know New York that well.

504
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,310
You should do some exploring.
It's the best city in the universe.

505
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:56,544
See you.

506
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:59,230
- Where are you going?
- Job interview.

507
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:02,026
- I'll walk you.
- Okay.

508
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:07,629
I don't see why Alcott
wouldn't let you go pass-fail.

509
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:10,104
Rules are rules, right? What can he do?

510
00:34:11,235 --> 00:34:13,988
Say, do you know this group Everclear?

511
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:16,663
- Are you kidding? They're my favorite.
- They are?

512
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,827
I love self-Ioathing complaint-rock
you can dance to.

513
00:34:19,915 --> 00:34:23,066
You want to see them tonight?
I've got two tickets I came across.

514
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:24,224
Shut up!

515
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:27,474
But you know, I got these three interviews.

516
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:30,665
But there's an opening act, right?

517
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:33,306
Yeah. There's an opening act.

518
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:35,346
Can I meet you there at 9:30?

519
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,269
9:30 would be great.

520
00:34:40,155 --> 00:34:41,144
But here.

521
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:43,988
Why don't you take one,
and if your interviews go long...

522
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:46,350
I could just meet you inside.

523
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:47,830
Thanks.

524
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:49,826
Now, don't go scalping that.

525
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:52,584
Okay.

526
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:57,110
Why did you ask me?
You hardly know me.

527
00:34:58,035 --> 00:35:00,708
Sure I do. I know you're smart.

528
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:03,829
You care when people bang up their knees.

529
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:06,748
You don't waste money on food
when you can get free honey.

530
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:08,154
You're cute.

531
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:12,314
You take a train from somewhere, right?
The Number 6. I know that.

532
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,469
All right.

533
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:17,551
All right, I'll meet you there.

534
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:19,545
Paul.

535
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:21,434
I'm Dora.

536
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:25,594
- I'll see you, Paul.
- Yeah, I'll see you, Dora.

537
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:28,069
Dust.

538
00:35:41,915 --> 00:35:43,030
When did O'Brien die?

539
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:44,992
- After you left.
- Before the crackdown.

540
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:46,827
First they changed the dorm code.

541
00:35:46,915 --> 00:35:49,873
Then we got our idea
which we thought Noah told you.

542
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:51,070
My bad.

543
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:53,669
I feel awful I never got to know him better.

544
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,666
Yeah, that would've saved him.

545
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:01,674
I'll never forget how weird it felt...

546
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:05,026
...when I looked out the window
and I see this body go by.

547
00:36:07,355 --> 00:36:11,792
- I thought he was in a coma.
- Yeah. He fell into a coma.

548
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:16,029
Come check out my lighting design.
Look at this. You ready?

549
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:22,031
Lighting changes the party decor entirely.

550
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:23,594
Pretty extravagant.

551
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:27,583
Women expect you to set the mood.
We're not in high school anymore.

552
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,748
What about in here?

553
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:33,755
That's the operating room. Not in there.

554
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:36,789
I'm going to go grab a slice.
Want to come?

555
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:38,904
- Sure.
- Let's go.

556
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:41,907
- Look what I found.
- Come on.

557
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:47,708
That's for the animals.
You don't need flea medication, do you?

558
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:50,789
I don't know.
He has slept with a lot of dogs.

559
00:36:53,395 --> 00:36:54,794
All right, come on.

560
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:09,747
- What's this?
- An application for the night shift job.

561
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,833
- Where you get this?
- From the guy who was just here.

562
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:16,428
Night shift is dangerous.
We can't have girls.

563
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:20,504
This is the third time this has happened.
Why don't you say so in your ad?

564
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:24,190
- He should not have given you.
- I don't know if that's even legal.

565
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:28,553
Actually, it's not. It's in violation
of sexual discrimination laws.

566
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,110
- Call next week.
- Yeah, right.

567
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,306
Thanks for trying to help out.

568
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:43,548
It's disgusting the way women get treated.

569
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:46,069
I just wish they didn't waste my time.

570
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,669
Do you have plans tonight?
There's a great fundraiser.

571
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:50,473
It's blowing off the hook.

572
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,274
I have a date,
but it doesn't start for 45 minutes.

573
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,745
Come drop by. It's for a good cause.
Homeless animal shelter.

574
00:37:56,835 --> 00:37:58,746
I don't have any funds to donate.

575
00:37:58,835 --> 00:38:01,952
It's okay. Just come in out of the cold
until your date.

576
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:05,473
Okay. But only if I can help you carry that.

577
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,305
What's up, man? How's it going?

578
00:38:12,515 --> 00:38:14,073
Hey, how are you?

579
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:18,029
You look amazing. I like this very much.
That's very nice. Come in.

580
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,026
So, how've you been?

581
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:21,634
What a turnout, huh?

582
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,151
I don't know how I'll find my date.

583
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,228
Excuse me. I'll take a T-shirt.

584
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:37,745
You know what? I'll take two.

585
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:53,545
It's just juice. Drink it up.
You look a little dehydrated.

586
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:57,910
It's good. It's got juices and cranberry.

587
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:00,953
Do you know cranberry juice is good
for your urinary tract?

588
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:03,151
- What time is it?
- It's early.

589
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:07,673
So, which do you like better,
yellow or checks?

590
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:12,184
Why?

591
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:15,830
Because I want to know which kind of cab
to call when we're done.

592
00:39:16,715 --> 00:39:18,592
Dude, come here. Come here.

593
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:23,906
You got to help me. Lisa is all primed,
but her helpful friend, fat Rita...

594
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:26,668
...will take her home
unless she gets some action, too.

595
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:29,872
First of all, I'm way too wasted
to be operating heavy machinery.

596
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:33,231
Second of all, I got this little spinner
all G-ed out. She's liquid.

597
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:36,227
Leave her on the back burner.
Take one for the team.

598
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,154
You owe me one.

599
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,032
- Count on it.
- All right.

600
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:11,067
Where's the bathroom?
I don't feel so good.

601
00:40:11,155 --> 00:40:13,828
- What is it? Your head?
- No, it's my stomach.

602
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,314
Here, this'll settle it.

603
00:40:15,395 --> 00:40:17,147
- What is it?
- It's for your tummy.

604
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:20,193
Drink it real fast.
That'll help your stomach.

605
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:34,747
Where is the bathroom?

606
00:40:50,755 --> 00:40:53,189
Yo, Dora, where you been all night?

607
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:57,593
You got to give me your number
before you go, okay?

608
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,834
Excuse me. This seat's taken.

609
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,388
- What?
- This seat is taken.

610
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,911
- This seat's taken!
- What?

611
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:07,351
I know. We'll move when they come.

612
00:42:48,355 --> 00:42:49,674
Taxi, here.

613
00:42:50,675 --> 00:42:53,109
Good girl.
How'd you get out of your cage?

614
00:43:03,435 --> 00:43:06,029
Okay. All right. Roxi, come on.
Come on, Roxi.

615
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,345
Come on. Okay.

616
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:11,155
You, up there.

617
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,344
Come on, party's over. Let's go.

618
00:43:43,075 --> 00:43:44,224
Dora?

619
00:43:46,115 --> 00:43:48,834
Perfect. Hey, Dora, come on. Wake up.

620
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:53,146
Wake up. I don't believe
in sleeping together on the first date.

621
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:55,510
Especially one you didn't show up for.

622
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:57,150
Come on.

623
00:43:58,515 --> 00:43:59,630
Dora?

624
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:04,265
Come on, Dora, wake up. Please.

625
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:11,674
All right, I got you. Come on. Let's go.

626
00:44:22,955 --> 00:44:24,752
I'm sorry, that's all I got.

627
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:29,352
- What's her name?
- Dora Diamond.

628
00:44:29,435 --> 00:44:31,869
- How long has she been unconscious?
- I don't know.

629
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:34,674
- What drugs she ingested?
- All I found was beer cans.

630
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,074
- Are you a relative?
- No.

631
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:38,191
I found her like that.
My friends had a party.

632
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,344
Nice party.

633
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:42,831
<i>I got to put my glasses on because</i>
<i>it looks like hair growing there.</i>

634
00:44:42,915 --> 00:44:45,383
<i>And all Ron does is spray this.</i>

635
00:44:46,355 --> 00:44:48,311
Going bald sucks.

636
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:51,025
They say it comes from your mother.

637
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:54,825
- My mother's got hair, you know.
- Of course she does.

638
00:44:57,555 --> 00:44:59,193
- Is she okay?
- She's stable.

639
00:44:59,275 --> 00:45:01,152
We pumped her stomach just to be sure.

640
00:45:01,235 --> 00:45:04,545
If she took Rohypnol,
she'll be out for another eight hours.

641
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:06,984
The problem is,
on her student emergency card...

642
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:09,748
...she has Professor Alcott
as her next of kin.

643
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,669
You wouldn't happen to know
where her parents are or if she's insured?

644
00:45:14,035 --> 00:45:16,105
No, I don't know.

645
00:45:16,595 --> 00:45:18,233
Did you call Professor Alcott?

646
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,829
He doesn't know her.
And we can't keep her here.

647
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:23,304
I can take her. I'm her boyfriend.

648
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:28,825
- I thought you just found her like this.
- Yeah, I did. And boy, was I angry.

649
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:31,950
Okay.

650
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:34,712
Just fill this prescription.

651
00:46:07,995 --> 00:46:10,270
Am I a man of my word or what?

652
00:46:10,675 --> 00:46:13,508
- What the heck went on here?
- I came by to help clean up.

653
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:15,904
I suppose you don't have
any idea about Dora.

654
00:46:15,995 --> 00:46:17,223
No, who is that?

655
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:19,670
The girl who almost had
an OD in the bathroom.

656
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:21,074
- She almost OD'd?
- Yeah.

657
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:23,715
I found her passed out
and took her to the hospital.

658
00:46:23,795 --> 00:46:26,070
Shut up. All right. Where is she?

659
00:46:26,595 --> 00:46:28,950
Man, what kind of drugs
were you giving out here?

660
00:46:29,035 --> 00:46:31,595
Drugs? Man, all we had was beer.

661
00:46:32,035 --> 00:46:33,627
You can't pass out from beer.

662
00:46:33,715 --> 00:46:36,593
You can, if you take something
before you drink it.

663
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:39,034
Her?

664
00:46:39,915 --> 00:46:42,110
What do you mean, "Her?"

665
00:46:45,355 --> 00:46:47,915
Adam found her at a liquor store
looking for a party.

666
00:46:47,995 --> 00:46:50,065
Last time I saw her she was all over Noah.

667
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:52,464
Who knows
what she took before she got here.

668
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:53,590
It's impossible.

669
00:46:53,675 --> 00:46:56,428
Why is that impossible?
These are bridge and tunnel girls.

670
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:58,824
They sleep around to avoid the commute.

671
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:02,385
We were going to the concert.

672
00:47:03,715 --> 00:47:05,307
She never showed up.

673
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:10,112
Come here.
I'm going to help you out with this, okay?

674
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,265
Look. All right.

675
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:14,986
We're going do this again next Friday.

676
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:18,829
I'll hook you up with a nice girl.
The kind of girl that you deserve.

677
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:20,874
What will we do with her?

678
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:23,947
She just has to sleep it off,
rest a couple of days.

679
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:27,189
- Okay, what about her parents?
- I don't know.

680
00:47:27,515 --> 00:47:30,825
She put Professor Alcott
as her in-case-of-emergency person.

681
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:32,754
What's that all about?

682
00:47:33,515 --> 00:47:34,789
I don't know.

683
00:47:36,755 --> 00:47:38,313
I'm getting out of here.

684
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:42,832
- You'll call me if you need anything.
- Yeah, sure.

685
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:07,583
You can't sleep while you tan.
Look at you. You're all burnt.

686
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:09,905
The tan is underneath. I have many layers.

687
00:48:09,995 --> 00:48:13,544
- What's this genius plan you've devised?
- Okay, listen to this.

688
00:48:13,635 --> 00:48:16,354
We figure out which class
we're doing worst in and drop it.

689
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:21,031
Then we transfer into European Lit 101,
but it has to be Professor Alcott's class.

690
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:23,346
We dump a D and transplant it with an A.

691
00:48:23,435 --> 00:48:26,666
And why is Alcott
suddenly giving us all A's?

692
00:48:26,955 --> 00:48:28,149
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

693
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:33,265
All right. Quiet, you guys.

694
00:48:33,715 --> 00:48:34,591
Hi.

695
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:37,024
Good morning.

696
00:48:38,275 --> 00:48:40,835
- How long have I been asleep?
- Since Friday night.

697
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:43,072
Oh, my God.

698
00:48:43,435 --> 00:48:46,984
- I've been in your bed and everything.
- It's no problem.

699
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:50,555
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah. Sure.

700
00:48:50,715 --> 00:48:53,513
- Are you on any special medication?
- No.

701
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:56,943
- Did you have a lot to drink?
- No.

702
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:01,150
I was at a convenience store
applying for the night shift job.

703
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:04,787
There was a guy who told me
about a fundraiser he was having.

704
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:09,073
And he brought me back here.
I drank some juice.

705
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:11,830
I don't really remember much after that.

706
00:49:12,155 --> 00:49:14,623
I think somebody
slipped me a roofie or something.

707
00:49:18,635 --> 00:49:21,627
Boy, I have got to stop trusting people.

708
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:27,350
You want some lunch? Yeah, you do.

709
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:31,064
You haven't eaten in days.
I'm starving and I ate this morning.

710
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:35,748
When you took me to the hospital,
did they call anybody to come get me?

711
00:49:36,635 --> 00:49:37,863
No.

712
00:49:37,955 --> 00:49:40,594
They said you could go home
and rest a couple of days...

713
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:44,509
...and drink plenty of liquids.
And you need to take these.

714
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:47,064
Charcoal?

715
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,744
So I can start a fire in your heart.

716
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:56,543
All right, that'll be ready in just a minute.

717
00:49:56,675 --> 00:50:00,384
You just lie back and veg,
as you young people say.

718
00:50:00,955 --> 00:50:04,789
And I'll read <i>The Plague</i>
so we don't behind in Lit class.

719
00:50:05,355 --> 00:50:10,190
You know, I don't know about you,
but I really need a B+ in Alcott's class.

720
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:13,231
Alcott hates neediness.

721
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,073
You know how old he is?

722
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:19,392
He's only 34 and he's been
a full professor for almost 10 years.

723
00:50:19,715 --> 00:50:22,468
He was the youngest
in the history of the university.

724
00:50:22,555 --> 00:50:24,386
Is that going to be on the final?

725
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:27,752
I'm sorry. I should have told you
that he was my boyfriend.

726
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:30,745
We've been together all semester.

727
00:50:31,035 --> 00:50:34,471
I wish they would've called him
instead of causing you all this trouble.

728
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:40,273
It's no trouble. I enjoy having you here.

729
00:50:41,315 --> 00:50:43,306
Yeah, but I've been asleep.

730
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,387
I guess it's a good thing
I'm easily amused, right?

731
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:50,633
Why are you so nice?

732
00:50:53,995 --> 00:50:55,064
I don't know.

733
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:57,309
Hey, buddy.

734
00:50:57,515 --> 00:50:58,664
Yo. 420, later.

735
00:50:58,835 --> 00:51:02,032
Yo, going to see you Friday, right?
All right.

736
00:51:04,555 --> 00:51:07,945
Professor Alcott.
I need to talk to you about Dora.

737
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:12,109
I'll cut you the same deal
as I cut the others.

738
00:51:13,115 --> 00:51:17,347
Sir, the thing is, she's at my place
and she had her stomach pumped...

739
00:51:17,555 --> 00:51:20,752
...because she was given some drugs
and she's been sick all weekend.

740
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:23,429
Her file lists you
as her in-case-of emergency person...

741
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,664
Look...

742
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:26,631
Paul.

743
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:30,993
Miss Diamond has kind of like this
schoolgirl crush on me.

744
00:51:31,115 --> 00:51:34,312
You know how they build these entire
relationships up in their head.

745
00:51:35,715 --> 00:51:37,387
It's great of you to be concerned.

746
00:51:37,475 --> 00:51:39,909
- Sir, you don't understand.
- No, I understand.

747
00:51:39,995 --> 00:51:43,988
Okay, I understand. I get it. It's fine.
We'll work it out. Okay?

748
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:47,190
Sir.

749
00:52:04,195 --> 00:52:04,911
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

750
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:09,074
- Hi.
- Thanks, Dora. I can finish up.

751
00:52:09,515 --> 00:52:10,470
Good girl.

752
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,990
Come here. I got to show you something.

753
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:17,554
What do you think?

754
00:52:18,155 --> 00:52:19,270
I like it.

755
00:52:21,035 --> 00:52:24,027
Kind of institutional, yet post-Victorian.
Very nice.

756
00:52:24,795 --> 00:52:26,387
Wait, but look.

757
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:29,465
She's pregnant. We've got to let her out.

758
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:33,389
- She doesn't want to have them in here.
- She might run away, though.

759
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:37,151
But look at her. She's really unhappy.
She's got to find a safe spot.

760
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,786
Okay. Sure.

761
00:52:39,915 --> 00:52:42,748
Come here, sweetie. There you go.

762
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:47,271
I found these on your desk.

763
00:52:50,555 --> 00:52:52,307
Oh, my God.

764
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,467
It's almost not like him.

765
00:52:55,555 --> 00:52:58,945
I know he loves me,
but he's never committed to paper before.

766
00:53:01,915 --> 00:53:03,951
How can I ever thank you?

767
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:13,390
- For what?
- For saving my life, for taking care of me.

768
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:15,354
You've been amazing.

769
00:53:15,435 --> 00:53:18,666
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

770
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:22,109
I feel better now
and I've got to look for a job.

771
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:24,868
I'm sure you want a good night's sleep
in your own bed.

772
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:29,745
No. I mean, if you stay tonight,
you can get an early start tomorrow.

773
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:32,630
But I don't have any clean clothes.

774
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:35,514
Actually, I was just about to do a wash.

775
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:39,384
We can both wear
my extra-fashionable laundry clothes.

776
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,873
What is this?

777
00:53:43,395 --> 00:53:45,306
Mid-90s hip-hop for the heartland.

778
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:48,592
My mother tried to help me be cooler,
so she went to Sears, where...

779
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,314
...they take the guesswork out of
exposing underpants.

780
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:57,629
If this is all you have,
then I think we'd better do a wash.

781
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,234
I'll change in there.

782
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,987
I'm sorry.

783
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:10,873
I was looking for another bag
to put the laundry in.

784
00:54:10,955 --> 00:54:12,513
- I'll get you...
- Yeah. Thanks.

785
00:54:12,915 --> 00:54:14,394
I'll get you a bag.

786
00:54:18,035 --> 00:54:19,388
You didn't get it from me.

787
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:21,989
<i>Then how did I get it?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

788
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:25,949
- Is it burning and itching?
<i>- What's going to happen?</i>

789
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:29,033
Is there some... Is there a discharge?

790
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:31,549
<i>Suddenly you know all about it, don't you?</i>

791
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,506
Don't people talk gross on cell phones?

792
00:54:33,595 --> 00:54:37,429
You'd think they'd be embarrassed
to have private conversations in public.

793
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:40,075
- I hate people with cell phones.
- All of them?

794
00:54:40,315 --> 00:54:41,225
Yep.

795
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:44,552
I hate everyone in there because
can get the new Garbage CD.

796
00:54:44,755 --> 00:54:47,906
I hate them because they can eat
whatever they want to eat.

797
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,151
I hate anyone who has time to study.

798
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:54,984
- You hate a lot of people.
- I'm a rotten, nasty little person.

799
00:54:55,315 --> 00:54:57,226
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

800
00:54:57,515 --> 00:55:00,234
Not having any money isn't ennobling.
It makes you mean.

801
00:55:00,395 --> 00:55:04,627
Yeah, I get it. That's why
all the really nice people are rich.

802
00:55:07,035 --> 00:55:09,230
- So who do you hate?
- No one.

803
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,224
Really?

804
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:14,670
Yeah.

805
00:55:16,035 --> 00:55:17,912
I wish I could be more like you.

806
00:55:18,155 --> 00:55:20,032
So how come you always wear that hat?

807
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:24,505
'Cause something like 90% of your body
heat escapes through your head.

808
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:27,513
But you're not particularly attached to it,
are you?

809
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,548
No. Not really.

810
00:55:31,715 --> 00:55:32,591
Why?

811
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:34,347
- Come on.
- What?

812
00:55:41,395 --> 00:55:44,432
- These belong to someone.
- No one who needs them more than you.

813
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:45,914
Howdy, Miss Dora.

814
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:49,546
Wait, here. Try this.

815
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:55,675
- Yeah. Yeah, that's the one.
- Yeah.

816
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:56,904
Really?

817
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,103
Okay.

818
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:01,990
Should I leave this one here?

819
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:04,709
No, leave it in the park
for a homeless person.

820
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:08,947
- After you.
- Well, thank you.

821
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:10,668
Honey, I'm home.

822
00:56:10,795 --> 00:56:13,468
- Who are you talking to?
- The dogs.

823
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,987
- What about the kitties?
- Kitties, I'm home.

824
00:56:21,395 --> 00:56:22,794
It's moving. It's alive.

825
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:24,667
Come on, we have to hurry.

826
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,428
Here, put it on the heating pad.

827
00:56:29,155 --> 00:56:31,350
And get some gloves, okay?

828
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:37,474
I can't let it pick up our scent,
otherwise the mother will reject it.

829
00:56:37,755 --> 00:56:40,588
- Oh, no.
- So we have to carefully...

830
00:56:41,915 --> 00:56:44,987
...cut it out of its membrane.
What I need you to do...

831
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:47,148
Okay. Ready.

832
00:56:47,315 --> 00:56:49,988
- Okay, hold...
- God, be careful.

833
00:56:50,435 --> 00:56:52,585
- Don't poke it.
- Don't worry.

834
00:56:53,075 --> 00:56:54,269
- Hold that...
- Okay.

835
00:56:54,355 --> 00:56:57,267
...for me right like that, okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

836
00:56:57,795 --> 00:57:00,025
- I'll cut the membrane.
- Be careful.

837
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:02,185
We'll get this little guy out, okay?

838
00:57:02,475 --> 00:57:04,067
Watch the head.

839
00:57:04,995 --> 00:57:06,394
Watching it.

840
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:08,791
- Okay.
- Be careful.

841
00:57:09,315 --> 00:57:11,590
- Pull it back.
- All right, I'm almost there.

842
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:13,233
- You got it?
- All right. Yeah.

843
00:57:13,315 --> 00:57:16,193
All right, I'm just going to cut
right underneath there.

844
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:17,788
And, okay.

845
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:19,429
Here we go.

846
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:24,025
- Here he comes.
- Look at the head. It's so cute.

847
00:57:24,355 --> 00:57:26,471
- Is it alive?
- Yeah. It's alive.

848
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,864
Let's go.

849
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,434
Let's see.

850
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,906
Here. Come on.

851
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:37,554
Come on.

852
00:57:38,515 --> 00:57:39,709
Now what?

853
00:57:40,195 --> 00:57:43,710
We'll just keep it warm
and we'll try again in a few minutes.

854
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,026
I always wanted a kitty,
but my mom was allergic.

855
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,706
I wasn't allowed to have pets.

856
00:57:49,795 --> 00:57:52,070
My girlfriend, Janet, she had a Siamese.

857
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,509
You have a girlfriend?

858
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:55,910
Ex-girlfriend. We dated in high school.

859
00:57:56,355 --> 00:57:58,232
- Do you still see her?
- No.

860
00:57:58,715 --> 00:58:01,627
She lost weight over the summer
and dating a lot more now.

861
00:58:01,715 --> 00:58:03,307
You know how it goes.

862
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,545
It sounds lame to someone in a love affair.

863
00:58:06,675 --> 00:58:10,554
- Relationship. Whatever it is.
- I don't even know what it is.

864
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:15,106
He thinks I'm too young or something,
so he doesn't want to have a relationship.

865
00:58:15,195 --> 00:58:18,312
But then he says things like...

866
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:21,034
...how he feels
we're the same person inside and...

867
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:23,471
...if he was female, he'd be me.

868
00:58:23,955 --> 00:58:26,344
But he said he didn't want
a relationship with you.

869
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:28,630
Yeah, and that he'd always love me.

870
00:58:28,915 --> 00:58:31,987
And he said he didn't want to be
in a relationship.

871
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,993
Yeah. So?

872
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,113
Well, sometimes when someone's
telling you something...

873
00:58:37,755 --> 00:58:39,746
...they're trying to tell you something.

874
00:58:39,835 --> 00:58:42,747
Right. Like men know
what's good for them.

875
00:58:43,715 --> 00:58:46,673
- Should we try again?
- Yeah. Let's see.

876
00:58:48,555 --> 00:58:49,988
She's licking it.

877
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:52,784
Told you.

878
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,270
What do we do now?

879
00:58:54,555 --> 00:58:58,025
Get some sleep and I'll stay
to make sure she doesn't toss him out.

880
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:01,588
Thanks.

881
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:14,267
Do you really need models of all sizes?
I'm only 5 ft 4 in.

882
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:17,028
- That's not a problem.
- I don't have a portfolio.

883
00:59:17,275 --> 00:59:19,664
We'll take your pictures free of charge.

884
00:59:19,915 --> 00:59:22,634
What? I don't get paid for the pictures?

885
00:59:22,995 --> 00:59:27,307
This is an agency. We'll send 'em out
and hopefully somebody will bite.

886
00:59:27,675 --> 00:59:29,791
You can take your clothes off in there.

887
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:38,154
What makes you
so interested in lithography?

888
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,823
I've always loved posters
and calendars and stuff.

889
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:44,704
Especially the way the colors get put on
separately, then all come together.

890
00:59:44,795 --> 00:59:46,467
Are you in the union?

891
00:59:47,235 --> 00:59:50,113
It didn't say anything
about the union in the want ad.

892
00:59:50,315 --> 00:59:51,873
This is a union shop.

893
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:57,594
- Hi, I'm calling for the gal Friday job.
<i>- The job's taken.</i>

894
01:00:07,515 --> 01:00:12,270
Hi, I'm calling about the ad
for healthy girls with good SAT scores.

895
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:15,667
Is this for some sort of drug trial?

896
01:00:15,915 --> 01:00:20,306
And what is the
foremost principle of banking?

897
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:22,745
Remembering your secret PIN number.

898
01:00:24,275 --> 01:00:27,585
Forgive me if I reserve my chuckles
for when I grade your final.

899
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:38,790
- Guess what?
- What?

900
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:42,072
I won't have to leave school.
I'll have the money. I got a job.

901
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:43,907
- Doing what?
- Harvesting eggs.

902
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,593
- In New York?
- What?

903
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:49,553
You're going to be a farmer?

904
01:00:49,755 --> 01:00:50,870
No.

905
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:55,307
I grow baby eggs and at the end
of my cycle they take them out...

906
01:00:55,395 --> 01:00:58,785
...and give them to infertile couples.
I get a shot every day.

907
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:01,754
I'll have enough money for tuition
and time to study...

908
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:03,587
...and I'll get my mom a dishwasher.

909
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,791
- What kind of shots?
- I don't know.

910
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:08,185
Like hormones and girly stuff.

911
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:11,388
- Let's celebrate, okay?
- I only have $30.

912
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:13,187
It's on me. Come on.

913
01:01:13,835 --> 01:01:15,712
Wait. I'm a student member.

914
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:21,070
I can come any time. It's always warm.
There's artsy films and the paintings rock.

915
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:22,384
Thank you.

916
01:01:23,635 --> 01:01:26,513
You know what'd be fun?
If we pretend we're really rich...

917
01:01:26,715 --> 01:01:29,388
...and we can have
one painting from each room.

918
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:30,584
Okay.

919
01:01:36,115 --> 01:01:38,583
- That one.
- Puppies.

920
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,628
They're cute.

921
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:44,269
This one.

922
01:01:54,115 --> 01:01:55,264
That.

923
01:01:56,235 --> 01:01:57,634
This one.

924
01:01:57,835 --> 01:02:00,144
That? That's chick art.

925
01:02:00,235 --> 01:02:02,146
Then I suppose you like this one.

926
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:04,865
As a matter of fact, yes.

927
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:07,270
What guy wouldn't like a plate of breasts?

928
01:02:08,915 --> 01:02:09,870
What?

929
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,184
- Are you hungry?
- I could eat.

930
01:02:18,995 --> 01:02:21,350
- Wait, isn't that steal...
- Come on.

931
01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:36,907
Isn't this totally pleasant?

932
01:02:37,235 --> 01:02:40,671
This has been the best celebration.
Thank you for including me.

933
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:42,947
Ever been to a Broadway play?

934
01:02:43,595 --> 01:02:45,870
No, but like I said, I only have $30.

935
01:02:45,955 --> 01:02:47,308
Don't worry about it.

936
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:49,230
Okay.

937
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:54,790
Here you go.

938
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:00,628
You missed? Here, let's try again.
Here you go.

939
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:04,106
- You get it? You missed?
- No.

940
01:03:08,915 --> 01:03:10,428
Don't they check the tickets?

941
01:03:10,515 --> 01:03:14,064
No. Just pretend like we were
out here for a smoke. Come on.

942
01:03:54,635 --> 01:03:56,512
How much money do you have left?

943
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:59,793
$30. I can't believe
we didn't spend one cent.

944
01:04:00,155 --> 01:04:01,713
- Do you know why?
- Why?

945
01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:06,631
"The moon belongs to everyone

946
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:10,704
"The best things in life are free"

947
01:04:11,955 --> 01:04:14,185
- Don't you get whimsical on me.
- Sorry.

948
01:04:14,275 --> 01:04:16,311
Where's the nasty girl
who hates everyone?

949
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:18,431
I don't know. I have fun with you.

950
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:21,943
- What's that all about?
- I don't know.

951
01:04:24,835 --> 01:04:27,872
- Look at how good he looks.
- I know.

952
01:04:28,395 --> 01:04:32,149
He's so happy.
He's resting with his brothers and sisters.

953
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:35,951
You know,
we ought to start thinking about preschool.

954
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:38,550
What time is it? I want to take the 11:50.

955
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:41,424
Why don't you stay another night?

956
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,787
You know, I'll just get a video and a pizza.

957
01:04:44,955 --> 01:04:47,185
It's better than waiting
on the train platform.

958
01:04:47,275 --> 01:04:49,948
- We'll just chill in.
- You mean chill out?

959
01:04:50,275 --> 01:04:51,674
Either one. Your choice.

960
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:53,588
Yeah. Okay.

961
01:04:53,675 --> 01:04:56,826
You call your mom,
I'll go get the video and the pizza.

962
01:04:57,835 --> 01:04:59,234
Don't you go anywhere.

963
01:05:12,835 --> 01:05:13,870
Thank you.

964
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:24,990
Excuse me. Hello?

965
01:05:27,235 --> 01:05:28,953
- What's up?
- Hi.

966
01:05:30,915 --> 01:05:32,030
Okay.

967
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:34,307
Of these two...

968
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:37,110
...which would be good for me and...

969
01:05:37,315 --> 01:05:40,307
...you know, if I was watching alone
with a girl?

970
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,153
Yeah. There you go.

971
01:05:43,595 --> 01:05:45,347
<i>When Harry Met Sally</i>.

972
01:05:46,435 --> 01:05:49,711
Could you maintain a rod
and watch Billy Crystal at the same time?

973
01:05:51,075 --> 01:05:52,986
Don't feel bad. No one can.

974
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,547
<i>The Piano.</i>

975
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:58,428
I don't know. Full-frontal on Harvey Keitel.

976
01:05:58,795 --> 01:06:01,628
- Not good?
- No, that dude's a 90% wiener.

977
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:04,748
- Really?
- Even on the small screen, that'll hurt you.

978
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,103
Here's your winner:

979
01:06:06,355 --> 01:06:08,107
<i>Simon Birch</i>.

980
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:12,508
About a little goofy kid with problems.
Can't go wrong, you'll look like a stud.

981
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,986
And this is sexy?

982
01:06:16,195 --> 01:06:18,026
Good for the girl?

983
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:19,549
Yeah, works for me.

984
01:06:28,835 --> 01:06:29,950
Thank you.

985
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,434
Honey, I'm home.

986
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:39,272
It's so much better saying that
to an actual person.

987
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:42,308
Do you think people said it before TV?

988
01:06:42,635 --> 01:06:45,832
- Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Professor Alcott.

989
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:51,472
This has been the best day of my life.
Edward asked me to stay over.

990
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:54,149
It's going to be so amazing.
Isn't that great?

991
01:06:56,915 --> 01:06:59,031
He must really respect you.

992
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:02,064
Did he know you were in the hospital?

993
01:07:02,755 --> 01:07:04,711
I guess. He did get me those flowers.

994
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,467
It's a relief, because the pressure's off.
Taking these fertility drugs...

995
01:07:10,595 --> 01:07:14,634
...gives me financial freedom,
so I won't be annoyingly needy.

996
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:17,987
I may actually turn out to be
one of those lucky people.

997
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:21,427
What lucky people?

998
01:07:21,635 --> 01:07:26,151
You know those couples that stay together
because they can't do any better?

999
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:29,307
Or those people who are sad
and miserable and live alone?

1000
01:07:29,635 --> 01:07:34,470
But then there's this microscopically
teeny group of lucky people...

1001
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:37,513
...who get to be with the person
they're madly in love with.

1002
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:43,546
You ever consider being in love
and leaving out the madly part?

1003
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,786
What's the fun in that?

1004
01:07:48,075 --> 01:07:49,190
Dora, come on.

1005
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:55,994
Take care of the baby.

1006
01:08:31,595 --> 01:08:33,506
How about some change, man?

1007
01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:10,466
No, I mean that in a good way.

1008
01:09:18,795 --> 01:09:21,184
<i>And don't forget my Somalian beans.</i>

1009
01:09:21,395 --> 01:09:22,748
They don't have Somalian.

1010
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,071
- Can I just get Italian?
<i>- All right.</i>

1011
01:09:30,075 --> 01:09:31,986
You sat so far away yesterday.

1012
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:36,107
I thought you hate cell phones.

1013
01:09:37,515 --> 01:09:39,904
It's digital. Edward got it for me.

1014
01:09:41,195 --> 01:09:42,708
I miss you guys.

1015
01:09:44,475 --> 01:09:48,548
You know, Taxi, Roxi, Penny and the baby.
Is he eating solids yet?

1016
01:09:49,635 --> 01:09:50,829
Kitten Chow.

1017
01:09:54,555 --> 01:09:58,070
I printed this up for you.
It's about those fertility drugs.

1018
01:09:58,515 --> 01:10:00,585
Hormones that make you
produce more eggs...

1019
01:10:00,675 --> 01:10:03,030
...also make cancer cells grow faster.

1020
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:05,233
You should take a look at it.

1021
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:07,904
- You looked this up for me?
- No.

1022
01:10:08,515 --> 01:10:12,064
I came across it when I was doing
some research, so I thought...

1023
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,747
Do you like Monty Python?

1024
01:10:15,955 --> 01:10:18,105
The film school is having a series...

1025
01:10:21,115 --> 01:10:23,106
- Hello?
<i>- I think I'll do a dessert.</i>

1026
01:10:23,555 --> 01:10:25,785
<i>- Like a biscotti.</i>
- With nuts?

1027
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,073
<i>Yeah, it'll be great.</i>

1028
01:10:28,155 --> 01:10:29,827
- I'll be right back.
<i>- Hurry.</i>

1029
01:10:29,915 --> 01:10:30,904
Bye.

1030
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:36,074
So anyway, I was thinking of going,
and if you're free...

1031
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:37,833
I really don't have any time.

1032
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:40,635
If I let my grades fall, I'm out of here.

1033
01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:42,985
I didn't get much work done last week.

1034
01:10:43,475 --> 01:10:45,989
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1035
01:10:46,195 --> 01:10:48,834
I'm under a lot of pressure, you know?

1036
01:10:50,275 --> 01:10:51,310
Right.

1037
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:54,273
- Lf you change your mind...
- Yeah, okay.

1038
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,712
- Bye.
- Bye.

1039
01:11:15,515 --> 01:11:17,631
Isn't it great how comfortable this is?

1040
01:11:17,835 --> 01:11:21,430
I have this feeling of bliss.
Do you feel it too?

1041
01:11:21,515 --> 01:11:23,551
What changed your mind
about me being here?

1042
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:27,264
Can we turn down the intensity
just a notch?

1043
01:11:27,995 --> 01:11:30,953
I was thinking how beautiful you looked
while you were quiet.

1044
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:34,870
Okay.

1045
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:39,427
What did you want to say?

1046
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:43,988
I wondered what made you change
your mind about me being here.

1047
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:46,988
I figured as long as I suffered
the consequences...

1048
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,106
...I may as well have you here mending.

1049
01:11:49,915 --> 01:11:51,826
Suffer what consequences?

1050
01:11:52,035 --> 01:11:56,392
As you probably know, I'm listed as
your next-of-kin on your medical records.

1051
01:11:56,635 --> 01:11:59,945
- I wanted to talk to you about that.
- I don't want to discuss it.

1052
01:12:00,035 --> 01:12:02,424
Your fraternity buddies
want to spread the word...

1053
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:06,224
...of a student-professor affair,
date-rape, medication and stomach-pumps.

1054
01:12:06,315 --> 01:12:09,273
- Would you make me a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

1055
01:12:11,515 --> 01:12:13,824
- But I was drugged.
- Oh, it's fine.

1056
01:12:13,915 --> 01:12:17,066
They've agreed to silence
in exchange for A's in Lit.

1057
01:12:17,995 --> 01:12:22,147
Plunge the tea bag four to six times,
remove it and squeeze in a half a lemon.

1058
01:12:22,475 --> 01:12:24,466
And two and a half teaspoons of sugar.

1059
01:12:25,995 --> 01:12:27,906
Paul had nothing to do with it, right?

1060
01:12:28,075 --> 01:12:31,909
Paul, Adam, Chris, Noah.
They're all my little honor students.

1061
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:35,829
Bet they couldn't get through a copy
of <i>Rolling Stone</i> between the four of them.

1062
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:37,669
Here.

1063
01:12:37,835 --> 01:12:40,907
Not in a mug.
It needs to be in a cup with a saucer.

1064
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:43,784
Please.

1065
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:50,147
So they all came to you together
and blackmailed you?

1066
01:12:50,955 --> 01:12:52,274
I'm reading now.

1067
01:12:57,835 --> 01:13:00,907
Dora, Dora, hold up. Wait, wait.

1068
01:13:01,315 --> 01:13:03,988
- You've been an inspiration to us.
- What?

1069
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:06,191
We got this killer scheme.
We want you in.

1070
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:09,472
- It was Chris' idea.
- It would help us if we got a girl.

1071
01:13:09,675 --> 01:13:11,233
What are you talking about?

1072
01:13:11,315 --> 01:13:14,751
This spring, when we plan our programs,
we want to target...

1073
01:13:14,995 --> 01:13:17,145
...professors that are single, Ionely.

1074
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:19,590
For us, women, for you, men,
for more choices.

1075
01:13:19,675 --> 01:13:20,994
You know the drill after.

1076
01:13:21,075 --> 01:13:24,511
Once they're romantically interested,
you hint you're legally underage.

1077
01:13:24,635 --> 01:13:25,590
It's genius!

1078
01:13:25,795 --> 01:13:30,232
Meanwhile, we all get fake IDs,
except instead of being 21, we're only 17.

1079
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:33,591
- See where we're going with this?
- Imagine how high your GPA will be.

1080
01:13:33,755 --> 01:13:36,110
Just coordinate your schedule with us.

1081
01:13:36,595 --> 01:13:37,869
You guys are amazing.

1082
01:13:38,995 --> 01:13:40,269
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1083
01:13:41,115 --> 01:13:44,152
- Thank you. All right, she's in.
- She's in. She's in.

1084
01:13:47,435 --> 01:13:51,189
There you go again with those books.
What is that?

1085
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:53,264
Studying?

1086
01:13:53,955 --> 01:13:56,264
Good one, man. Don't forget about Friday.

1087
01:13:56,595 --> 01:14:00,383
What, you didn't raise enough money
at your last fundraiser?

1088
01:14:00,595 --> 01:14:02,904
We barely made enough to cover the beer.

1089
01:14:02,995 --> 01:14:06,032
But I got it in check. I scored some rope.

1090
01:14:06,515 --> 01:14:10,110
Normally, chicks can drink six
to seven cans and they don't feel it.

1091
01:14:10,395 --> 01:14:14,024
But these bad boys, one, and you're done.

1092
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:16,263
Careful.

1093
01:14:17,475 --> 01:14:18,749
Thanks, dude.

1094
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:20,349
So, Friday.

1095
01:14:30,435 --> 01:14:31,504
Can I help you?

1096
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:34,946
I'm looking for white pills that come
in a pop-out package.

1097
01:14:35,155 --> 01:14:37,350
We have aspirin in bubble pack.

1098
01:14:37,555 --> 01:14:41,389
These have writing on them.
I'm looking for pills without the writing.

1099
01:14:41,595 --> 01:14:42,994
There's this.

1100
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:47,389
- What do they do?
- Pretty much nothing.

1101
01:14:47,915 --> 01:14:50,873
- Any harmful side effects?
- Might make you a bit smarter.

1102
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:57,149
Oh, my God. Are you guys taking Psych?

1103
01:14:58,635 --> 01:15:01,024
- Did you ever look in the book?
- No.

1104
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,468
Look at this retard.

1105
01:15:06,995 --> 01:15:10,954
- What's cracking?
- I left some books in the closet.

1106
01:15:11,155 --> 01:15:14,306
- You mind if I get them?
- Of course not. Want a beer?

1107
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:16,346
Ever heard of autism?

1108
01:15:16,515 --> 01:15:19,587
Are we still on for the shelter on Friday?

1109
01:15:21,075 --> 01:15:25,307
I heard they might be painting the place
on Friday. I'll have to find out.

1110
01:15:25,475 --> 01:15:28,194
See what you can do.
Otherwise we're up shit creek.

1111
01:15:28,435 --> 01:15:29,345
Okay.

1112
01:15:29,435 --> 01:15:31,995
Help us out, Paul.
It costs a lot to rent a bar.

1113
01:15:33,835 --> 01:15:35,791
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks, buddy.

1114
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,945
Don't be a stranger now, buddy, okay?

1115
01:15:45,635 --> 01:15:47,273
Put your pants on.

1116
01:15:47,435 --> 01:15:48,788
Cover that up.

1117
01:15:51,115 --> 01:15:55,825
No need to argue, plenty for everyone.
Just line up in an orderly fashion.

1118
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:58,031
That looks like a penis, but smaller.

1119
01:15:58,795 --> 01:16:00,751
Don't knock it till you tried it.

1120
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:03,463
You got two minutes to cover it or lose it.

1121
01:16:07,515 --> 01:16:10,313
- This sucks.
- I would've said "blows."

1122
01:16:10,555 --> 01:16:13,308
Look at Kelly and Gwen.
I slipped them rope an hour ago.

1123
01:16:13,395 --> 01:16:15,670
I gave one to Shelly and look at that.

1124
01:16:16,315 --> 01:16:19,113
Maybe girls are developing an immunity...

1125
01:16:19,195 --> 01:16:21,789
...the way pesticides don't work
on a lot of bugs.

1126
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:24,230
- Look how amped these chicks are.
- Great.

1127
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:28,067
If this doesn't work,
we'll have to rely on our charm.

1128
01:16:30,315 --> 01:16:34,194
- That stuff you got was useless.
- You still owe me $150.

1129
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:37,313
The stuff I had had writing on the package.

1130
01:16:37,475 --> 01:16:39,067
What are you talking about?

1131
01:16:39,355 --> 01:16:40,674
This isn't them.

1132
01:16:43,075 --> 01:16:46,545
- Someone snagged our rope?
- Who knows where I keep my stash?

1133
01:16:49,955 --> 01:16:52,423
- Paul.
- Weak.

1134
01:16:56,155 --> 01:16:58,464
Do you see what's wrong with this?

1135
01:16:58,995 --> 01:17:01,304
The Greeks use a column
to hold something up.

1136
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:04,592
Form follows function,
and it's beautiful in its simplicity.

1137
01:17:05,315 --> 01:17:08,034
This Roman column is
incorporated into the wall.

1138
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:11,585
I assume from your mocking tone
you have an opposing viewpoint?

1139
01:17:12,635 --> 01:17:17,755
No. But don't you ever like
looking around because it's pretty?

1140
01:17:17,835 --> 01:17:18,984
Pretty?

1141
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:22,425
- Not everything needs a lecture.
- Christmas decorations are pretty.

1142
01:17:22,595 --> 01:17:24,904
The cast of <i>Friends</i> is pretty.

1143
01:17:25,195 --> 01:17:28,073
This is a world-class museum.
You only get what you put into it.

1144
01:17:28,155 --> 01:17:29,144
Sorry.

1145
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,271
Paul Tannek to see Professor Alcott.

1146
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:36,467
- He's in a meeting. Have a seat.
- Great, thank you.

1147
01:17:43,035 --> 01:17:44,753
- Peter.
- Paul.

1148
01:17:45,755 --> 01:17:48,064
- Should we go inside?
- What can I do for you?

1149
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:52,268
Dora left these, and I'm not sure
if she's supposed to take anymore...

1150
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:54,433
Goodbye, Professor Alcott.

1151
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:56,512
Thanks for helping, Kristen.

1152
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:00,708
Let's talk in here.

1153
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:04,985
How is Miss Diamond?

1154
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:09,630
You know Dora. A little goes a long way.

1155
01:18:09,995 --> 01:18:12,555
She's a sweet kid, though.
Keeps the place immaculate.

1156
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:17,115
You're lucky.
She cares about you a great deal.

1157
01:18:17,955 --> 01:18:19,229
That's for you.

1158
01:18:20,035 --> 01:18:22,424
- What is this?
- Final exam.

1159
01:18:22,995 --> 01:18:25,634
- The final's a take-home test?
- For you it is.

1160
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:28,790
That's the deal I worked out with Chris.

1161
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,435
I gotta have something
to substantiate an A.

1162
01:18:32,035 --> 01:18:35,914
- What's the matter?
- I wasn't aware of a deal.

1163
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,911
I guess it's a good thing you dropped by.

1164
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:43,190
Sir, if it's all the same, I'd rather not.

1165
01:18:43,955 --> 01:18:46,423
Are you planning
on saying anything to the dean?

1166
01:18:48,075 --> 01:18:49,144
No.

1167
01:18:49,955 --> 01:18:52,594
- You're going to tell Dora about Kristen?
- No. I'm not.

1168
01:18:53,635 --> 01:18:54,750
I don't understand.

1169
01:18:54,915 --> 01:18:57,065
Maybe I don't like the idea of being bought.

1170
01:18:57,155 --> 01:19:00,147
- You could lose your scholarship.
- I guess I could.

1171
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:03,868
Is this a moral stand?
Is that what you're doing?

1172
01:19:03,995 --> 01:19:06,463
I gotta tell you,
I don't think that's very smart.

1173
01:19:07,155 --> 01:19:08,873
You know what?

1174
01:19:09,395 --> 01:19:11,465
I really don't give a fuck what you think!

1175
01:19:19,235 --> 01:19:20,384
What are you doing?

1176
01:19:20,595 --> 01:19:23,234
You stole over $200 of our medication!

1177
01:19:23,315 --> 01:19:25,749
You mean the illegal drugs
you disperse at parties?

1178
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:28,713
Are you going to turn into a narc on us?

1179
01:19:28,835 --> 01:19:30,905
No. I want to be like the cool guys.

1180
01:19:31,155 --> 01:19:33,430
The guys who never go to class.

1181
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:35,710
The guys who hit on girls
who are unconscious.

1182
01:19:36,275 --> 01:19:38,789
All the girls want you
when they're straight.

1183
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:43,348
- You're with that Dora girl.
- What is that supposed to mean?

1184
01:19:43,915 --> 01:19:47,146
There's no velvet rope at Club Dora.
Any asshole can get in.

1185
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:52,064
You okay?

1186
01:20:00,355 --> 01:20:02,585
Good Lord, I am so sorry. Come on.

1187
01:20:02,795 --> 01:20:05,628
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

1188
01:20:05,795 --> 01:20:08,548
Let's get that looked at. Come on.

1189
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:10,347
Oh, great news.

1190
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:11,544
What?

1191
01:20:11,755 --> 01:20:14,144
I know it vexes you
we never do anything together.

1192
01:20:14,235 --> 01:20:16,703
So I'm taking you to my parents'
for Thanksgiving.

1193
01:20:16,795 --> 01:20:19,514
- You told your parents about me?
- Yeah.

1194
01:20:20,075 --> 01:20:24,034
I told them my girlfriend's out of town
so I'm bringing my assistant.

1195
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:26,668
But it'll be great.

1196
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,428
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Dad.

1197
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,951
Hey there, college boy!

1198
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:36,590
What's the matter?
You sound a little blue.

1199
01:20:36,675 --> 01:20:37,824
<i>How's New York?</i>

1200
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:40,993
It seems like this city is one big orgy.

1201
01:20:41,155 --> 01:20:44,192
And if you actually care about anyone,
you're a chump.

1202
01:20:44,355 --> 01:20:48,826
- I'll go, but which cleaners?
<i>- It's the one on 8th Street...</i>

1203
01:20:48,995 --> 01:20:50,314
Can you hear me?

1204
01:20:52,355 --> 01:20:55,028
<i>Sounds like things are rocky</i>
<i>with you and Dora.</i>

1205
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:58,266
It's not like that, Dad.

1206
01:20:58,475 --> 01:21:01,035
I don't even think she knew
I liked her that way.

1207
01:21:01,715 --> 01:21:03,945
It was just so fun having her around.

1208
01:21:04,395 --> 01:21:05,464
I don't know.

1209
01:21:06,515 --> 01:21:07,994
Maybe I should come home.

1210
01:21:08,475 --> 01:21:09,988
I don't think I belong here.

1211
01:21:10,555 --> 01:21:14,753
At your age, you'll get your heart broken
no matter what city you live in.

1212
01:21:15,795 --> 01:21:17,194
Yeah. I guess.

1213
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:20,508
I just miss her.

1214
01:21:29,235 --> 01:21:30,953
God, it's all so expensive.

1215
01:21:31,155 --> 01:21:33,953
"What we obtain too cheap,
we esteem too lightly."

1216
01:21:34,475 --> 01:21:35,703
Thomas Paine.

1217
01:21:37,915 --> 01:21:39,633
Why don't I make something to wear?

1218
01:21:41,715 --> 01:21:43,671
Maybe. Help, please.

1219
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:47,231
If they think I'm your assistant,
I'll go as myself.

1220
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,427
Dora, it's my parents.
I can't even go as myself.

1221
01:21:50,595 --> 01:21:52,586
That looks fabulous on.

1222
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:54,154
I'll start a room for you.

1223
01:21:55,755 --> 01:21:58,030
I feel funny about you buying me an outfit.

1224
01:21:58,235 --> 01:22:00,510
Consider it a loan until you're wealthy.

1225
01:22:00,675 --> 01:22:02,074
The clothes, the haircut.

1226
01:22:02,155 --> 01:22:04,111
- A haircut?
- I made an appointment at Bliss.

1227
01:22:04,195 --> 01:22:07,028
Just do a little shaping thing.

1228
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:09,664
Okay.

1229
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:11,864
Thanks.

1230
01:22:12,235 --> 01:22:14,385
Oh, thanks for the flowers.

1231
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:15,989
What flowers?

1232
01:22:16,995 --> 01:22:19,748
The yellow flowers.
When I got my stomach...

1233
01:22:19,915 --> 01:22:21,143
Don't mention it.

1234
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:23,823
- Those just came in.
- Thank you.

1235
01:22:24,035 --> 01:22:26,026
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

1236
01:22:41,595 --> 01:22:42,994
Beautiful there, huh?

1237
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:50,471
Dora! We're going to a dinner,
not a fox hunt.

1238
01:22:52,515 --> 01:22:54,665
I just shouldn't go with you.

1239
01:22:55,475 --> 01:22:59,309
I'll take you to Calvin Klein.
Maybe they are more borough-friendly.

1240
01:23:01,795 --> 01:23:04,628
- I had a little scare today.
- What happened?

1241
01:23:04,755 --> 01:23:07,394
Dean Hackelman said
he wanted to talk to me.

1242
01:23:07,475 --> 01:23:09,352
I was afraid Paul had informed on us.

1243
01:23:10,595 --> 01:23:11,630
Why Paul?

1244
01:23:11,795 --> 01:23:15,390
My "special" students
got to take the final home.

1245
01:23:15,475 --> 01:23:18,990
Basically <i>carte blanche</i> to get an A,
and he wanted nothing to do with it.

1246
01:23:19,715 --> 01:23:21,945
I thought they were blackmailing you.

1247
01:23:22,035 --> 01:23:25,994
That's just it. Apparently he wasn't
in on it. It was just the others.

1248
01:23:26,195 --> 01:23:29,107
He even gave me a discourse
on how he can't be bought.

1249
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:37,233
- So what grade did you give him?
- B.

1250
01:23:37,835 --> 01:23:40,633
- Why didn't you give him a B+?
- It was a B paper.

1251
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:42,354
Yeah, but his scholarship?

1252
01:23:42,515 --> 01:23:45,234
He wanted that whole fairness thing,
not me.

1253
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:56,824
When we get to my parents, none of this...

1254
01:24:21,795 --> 01:24:22,784
Hello?

1255
01:24:32,675 --> 01:24:33,664
Come on in.

1256
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:39,792
I came by to warn you that Alcott
was giving you a B.

1257
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:45,469
I knew that was going to happen,
so I dropped his class.

1258
01:24:45,995 --> 01:24:49,146
I can take an extra credit
and keep my average up.

1259
01:24:49,475 --> 01:24:50,703
Great!

1260
01:24:52,195 --> 01:24:53,548
You cut your hair.

1261
01:24:55,555 --> 01:24:58,911
Yeah, I did.
Got to keep up with the times, right?

1262
01:24:59,555 --> 01:25:02,592
I was kind of going for that...

1263
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:07,067
..."George Clooney, my face is too cute
to hide behind my hair" look.

1264
01:25:08,555 --> 01:25:09,783
It looks good.

1265
01:25:10,315 --> 01:25:12,306
What's with the pizza?

1266
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:17,105
I realized we never watched
that video you rented.

1267
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:21,188
So I got another one, and got a pizza
just in case you were hungry.

1268
01:25:21,635 --> 01:25:22,750
Look, Dora.

1269
01:25:25,235 --> 01:25:29,945
I can't just go around watching movies
and eating pizza with you.

1270
01:25:31,435 --> 01:25:32,948
Not that I don't want to.

1271
01:25:34,995 --> 01:25:37,953
You know, there's other stuff.

1272
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:40,504
I know you're thinking,
"What about our stuff?"

1273
01:25:40,595 --> 01:25:43,189
And you're right. I miss it a lot.

1274
01:25:44,195 --> 01:25:46,584
But I know Alcott is your boyfriend.

1275
01:25:47,035 --> 01:25:50,072
And to tell you the truth, I don't like him.

1276
01:25:51,795 --> 01:25:55,470
Not that that has anything to do
with how I feel about you.

1277
01:26:01,275 --> 01:26:03,743
It has a lot to do with how I feel about you.

1278
01:26:05,075 --> 01:26:07,145
That's why I can't have any pizza.

1279
01:26:09,635 --> 01:26:13,992
- Maybe I should try that again.
- Paul, he's not my boyfriend anymore.

1280
01:26:16,435 --> 01:26:18,869
Don't you want to be one
of those lucky people?

1281
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:21,071
I do! Don't you?

1282
01:26:23,555 --> 01:26:28,106
You can't waltz in here with your videos,
and looking all cute.

1283
01:26:28,995 --> 01:26:31,384
- Unless, unless...
- Unless what?

1284
01:26:31,555 --> 01:26:32,954
Unless you mean it.

1285
01:26:41,475 --> 01:26:42,624
What was that?

1286
01:26:43,755 --> 01:26:44,744
A kiss.

1287
01:26:45,475 --> 01:26:47,193
You call that a kiss?

1288
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:21,625
A botched hairplug operation
caused Chris to lose his "good looks."

1289
01:27:21,755 --> 01:27:24,315
He hoped women would see
his other good qualities...

1290
01:27:24,395 --> 01:27:26,033
Except he has none.

1291
01:27:26,475 --> 01:27:28,625
Adam was recruited
by a large corporation

1292
01:27:28,755 --> 01:27:31,827
and setup to take a fall
for their shady practices...

1293
01:27:32,515 --> 01:27:37,145
He now has an active social life... in jail.

1294
01:27:38,195 --> 01:27:42,825
Noah used himself as a guinea pig while
trying to create a stronger party drug.

1295
01:27:43,595 --> 01:27:46,553
He's currently relearning to tie his shoes.

1296
01:27:49,195 --> 01:27:52,585
Professor Alcott is serving 3 to 5 years

1297
01:27:52,755 --> 01:27:55,428
for having an affair
with a seventeen year-old.

1298
01:27:56,635 --> 01:28:00,833
Dora used the animal hospital
as her residence and got financial aide.

1299
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:03,469
She didn't have to sell her eggs.

1300
01:28:05,595 --> 01:28:07,631
Paul has first dibs on them.
