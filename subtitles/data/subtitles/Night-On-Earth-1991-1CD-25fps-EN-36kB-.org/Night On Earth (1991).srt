young actresses in the country.

six of them were perfect.

138
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:03,309
But he just keeps
- he keeps wanting them younger and younger.

139
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:07,307
Now he wants someone 18 with
absolutely no experience...

00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,419
but the nerves of a paratrooper.

Listen. Were there any messages for me?

158
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:58,448
Uh-huh.

159
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,545
Uh-huh.

160
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,314
Carol...

161
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,925
did Mr. Kincade call?

162
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,567
You're sure?

163
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:17,553
Okay.

164
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,464
Okay.

165
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:24,080
Okay then. I will, um -

166
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,065
I'll
- I'll talk to you tomorrow.

167
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:28,201
Great. Bye-bye.

168
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:53,703
<i>Is Mr. Kincade, like, your boyfriend?</i>

169
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,224
Yes, he is.

170
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,647
At least I think he is.

171
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,182
Guys
- Can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em.

172
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:11,846
Yeah. You can say that again.

173
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:16,165
Oh, your phone book. Here. Thanks a lot.

174
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,119
Sure.

175
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,461
Boy, it sure gets dark fast
in the winter, doesn't it?

176
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:56,812
<i>Driving at night doesn't
seem to bother you.</i>

177
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,733
<i>Why should it?</i>

178
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,646
<i>Oh, with me it's a big
problem. I have night blindness.</i>

179
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,451
Is that, like, something
that happens when you get old?

180
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:11,209
No. No. Actually, it isn't. Uh -

181
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,659
It has nothing to do with
age. I've had it all my life.

182
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:26,795
Fuckin'-A, man. That's fucked.

183
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,684
Oh, thank you.

184
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,508
Thank you.

185
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:15,400
You know, it really isn't any of
my business, but you smoke too much.

186
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,700
Okay, mom.

187
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,849
You're really happy driving
this taxi, aren't you?

188
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,836
Fuck yes.

189
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:29,510
I mean, yeah. It's a cool job.

190
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:34,411
But, I mean, is that
your whole goal in life?

191
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:37,356
Driving taxicabs?

192
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,426
Is there somethin' wrong with that?

193
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,347
No, no, no. I'm
sorry. I - I -

194
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,090
I really didn't mean
that the way it sounded.

195
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,778
Yeah, well, I'll tell you somethin'.

196
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:02,087
I don't always want to be a cabdriver.

197
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:07,107
- What do you really want to be?
- A mechanic.

198
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,283
A mechanic?

199
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:11,656
I practically know all
there is to know about it.

200
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,577
Both my brothers are mechanics.

201
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:16,991
They're older than me, but, you know,
'cause I'm, like, a girl, and I'm, like...

202
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,994
still kind of young and all, I gotta
kind of, like, work up to it, you know.

203
00:17:21,098 --> 00:17:24,328
<i>What about
marriage and a family?</i>

204
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:27,144
<i>Definitely.
Definitely want a family.</i>

205
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,763
<i>Boys though. Lots of boys.</i>

206
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,754
<i>No girls?</i>

207
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,534
Girls are nice too, I think.

208
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:38,017
Yeah. Maybe some girls too.

209
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:40,936
But, you know, like, that stuff
- that's all beside the point.

210
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,969
The real problem is to find
a good guy for the father.

211
00:17:44,074 --> 00:17:46,409
Tell me about it.

212
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,898
Well, I'm real particular, you know.

213
00:17:53,002 --> 00:17:57,257
And I'm also patient enough.
I mean, at least I hope I am.

214
00:17:57,354 --> 00:18:01,413
'Cause, you know - I don't know - maybe
you gotta wait a while, you know...

215
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,823
'cause, like, maybe it's not so easy to
find, like, the exact right guy, you know.

216
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,133
Like, the one guy, you know?

217
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,952
No.

218
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,595
- Another mechanic maybe.
- Hell, I don't care what he does.

219
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:17,381
As long as he loves me right.

220
00:18:17,481 --> 00:18:19,782
With his soul.

221
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,117
You know, takes me for who I am.

222
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,776
I know what you mean.

223
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:33,095
Like Popeye says, "I am what I am."

224
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,014
Right?

225
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:36,999
Yes. You certainly are.

226
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:25,318
Hello? Oh, hi, Marty.

227
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,133
Yes. I talked to him.

228
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:31,548
<i>Of course I know what he wants.
I've heard it a hundred times.</i>

229
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,232
Oh, Marty. Go ahead. Just tell me again.

230
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:41,862
Try driving school, you fucking nimrod!

231
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,646
Marty...

232
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:58,078
I may be having a brilliant
streak right here in the taxi.

233
00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:01,444
Yes, I'm really in a taxi.

234
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,550
No, I can't tell you right now.

235
00:20:04,614 --> 00:20:06,436
Um...

236
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:08,476
all I can say is...

237
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,470
I have an idea.

238
00:20:11,686 --> 00:20:15,712
No. That's why I don't
tell you things, Marty.

239
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:21,211
I'm sorry I sound calm. I
assure you I'm hysterical.

240
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,773
I'll call you the
minute I know anything.

241
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:26,628
Good-bye, Mar-
Good-bye, Marty.

242
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,276
<i>All right. This is Beverly
Drive coming up. Where to?</i>

243
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:35,162
Uh, just turn right on Beverly Court...

244
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,269
then follow the hill up
to Beverly Circle, please.

245
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,260
Got ya.

246
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,698
<i>It's up on the left. 971.</i>

247
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,465
- Want me to take these in the house
for you? - No. Uh, that's okay.

248
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:01,433
- Just put 'em over there, please.
- No, I got it. It's my job.

249
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,250
No -

250
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:24,349
Okay, that'll be, um, 33 bucks, please.

251
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:27,766
Okay. Uh, no. Keep the
- Keep the change.

252
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,492
- Listen
- - Thanks.

253
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,482
Can I ask you something?

254
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,545
Now, this is gonna sound a
little crazy to you, but, uh -

255
00:22:36,706 --> 00:22:38,746
Well, I'm a casting agent.

256
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:41,238
That means that I go
out and I find people.

257
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:43,899
You know, for really big movies.

258
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:48,378
And I've been observing you.

259
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:51,580
And I - I honestly think
you have something special.

260
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:56,121
As a matter of fact, I'm casting a part right
- right now that I think you'd be perfect for.

261
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,363
This is a
- a terrific part.

262
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,183
You could be a movie star.

263
00:23:01,281 --> 00:23:04,412
- What, like right now?
- Well, yeah.

264
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,184
I really wouldn't want
to do that, you know.

265
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,770
I mean, I have a job. I really wouldn't
want to lose this job, you know.

266
00:23:11,874 --> 00:23:14,328
I really wouldn't want to fuck
things up right now, you know.

267
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,287
You understand, right?

268
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:18,207
Well...

269
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:20,126
let's not be hasty.

270
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:24,023
Um, I'm - I'm - I'm serious
about this, you know.

271
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:28,253
I just want to be sure you
understand what I'm offering you.

272
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:31,070
Yeah, but, you know, I'm a cabdriver.

273
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:32,991
You know, this is what I do.

274
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:35,455
Like I told you, I'm
gonna be a mechanic.

275
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:41,816
I don't want to press
you. I really don't. Um -

276
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,914
But I just want to make
sure that I understand.

277
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:49,179
Are you saying that you -

278
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,541
you just wouldn't be interested
in being a movie star?

279
00:23:53,535 --> 00:23:57,311
- Nah.
- Hey, you could be a mechanic later.

280
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:00,310
Everyone wants to be a movie star.

281
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,709
Look, lady. You know, I
like the movies and all.

282
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:07,069
And -And I see you're
being serious, you know.

283
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,298
But that's not a real
life for me. You know?

284
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:14,490
I mean, I'm sure there's tons of girls
who wanna be in the movies and all...

285
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,762
and, you know, I -

286
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,546
I'm not saying it right.

287
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:23,324
It's just that I have everything
planned out for me, you know?

288
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,944
I mean, everything's going
just right for me now.

289
00:24:30,622 --> 00:24:32,695
Well, you can't beat that, can you?

290
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,646
Nope.

291
00:24:37,151 --> 00:24:39,572
But, you know,
I mean, I appreciate it.

292
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,543
- Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.

293
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,325
- Take it easy.
- Sure, mom.

294
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,572
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>

295
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:53,687
Taxi! Yeah.

296
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:56,373
Yo, yo, yo, yo, taxi! Shit.

297
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,776
Gotta get a taxi, man.

298
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:01,395
Here we go. Taxi!

299
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:04,368
Taxi! Yo, man. Right here.

300
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,580
Right here. Whoo! Right.

301
00:27:06,683 --> 00:27:08,536
This is the ticket. Yo, what's up?

302
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:13,941
Brooklyn.

303
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,391
Brooklyn, man. Yo!
Yo, man! You suck, man!

304
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:20,313
<i>I got your plate number!
I'm gonna call the T.L.C.I</i>

305
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:22,712
<i>Come on, man. Somebody pick me up.</i>

306
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,396
Yeah. Come on. Pick me up. What's -

307
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:28,280
<i>There's a million fuckin' cabs out here.</i>

308
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,769
Cash, man.

309
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,484
Yeah. That's the ticket.
This is gonna get me home.

310
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,586
Shit. It's gonna get my ass home, man.

311
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,210
I got cash, man!

312
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:43,510
Taxi. Look. I got the cash right here.

313
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,432
Taxi. Come on, man.

314
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,537
Come on, man!
What -What -

315
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:50,227
<i>Fuck all y'all!</i>

316
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:54,708
No, you ain't gettin' -You ain't takin'
my cab now. You ain't takin' my cab.

317
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,784
That's right. Just keep
walkin'. Yeah. That's right.

318
00:27:57,881 --> 00:28:01,874
Shit. They know you desperate. That's
all it is. What am I, invisible, man?

319
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:05,751
I don't give a fuck. Get me a
taxi. Have my name on it too.

320
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:17,170
You go to Brooklyn?

321
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:20,496
Hello. How are you?

322
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:24,279
I wanna go to Brooklyn.

323
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,995
Uh, come in, sir.

324
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:27,990
All right.

325
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:33,590
- You know how to get to Brooklyn?
- "Brookland"?

326
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:36,305
Uh, better you show me.

327
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,308
Yeah. All right. Look.

328
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:43,855
Phew. Go straight down Broadway,
and then I'll explain as we go.

329
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:51,958
Hey, what's up?

330
00:28:53,176 --> 00:28:56,591
What? You new at this? You

331
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,957
<i>Hey, man. You gotta put it in drive.</i>

332
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,510
"D."

333
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,503
"D"! "D" is to drive.

334
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,342
- Put the motherfucker in drive!
- Yeah, yeah. "D" is to drive.

335
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,573
So -

336
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:13,941
Okay.

Hey, what's -What you

Hey.

340
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,580
Hey. No, no, man. It ain't automatic.

341
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:37,166
<i>Yo. Yo, man. What's wrong with-
Hey, look. What's - What's up, man?</i>

342
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,605
- It's automatic.
- Pull over, man!

343
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:42,669
Just pull the fuck over! Yeah.
Pull over right here, man.

344
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,957
Shit.

345
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,029
What?

346
00:29:51,126 --> 00:29:54,868
Hey, man. I don't think this shit's gonna
work out, man. I'm gonna get me another cab.

347
00:29:54,966 --> 00:29:57,105
Oh, no, no. Please. Please.

348
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:01,810
You are -You are my-
my most best customer.

349
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,527
No, man. Look, you ain't takin' me
to Brooklyn. You can't even drive!

350
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:08,371
But you want taxi.
I am a taxi. I am here. Taxi.

351
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:12,811
I know you are a taxi. But
I'm gonna get me another taxi.

352
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:15,732
But no. No. Uh -

353
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:18,448
It's important. It's
very, very important to me.

354
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,437
We go.

355
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,604
Man.

00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,925
Yeah.

357
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,884
All right. All right.

358
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:32,014
<i>I'll go to Brooklyn, all
right? We will go to Brooklyn.</i>

359
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:33,938
But you let me drive.

360
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:37,615
<i>See, I drive and you ride.</i>

361
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:40,018
I'll pay the fare and all that.

362
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:42,483
<i>But I drive.</i>

363
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,816
No. No. It's -

364
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:48,810
<i>- What do you mean, no?
- It's not allowed. Not allowed.</i>

365
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:52,331
Look. Yeah, it's
allowed. This is New York.

366
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:55,567
New
- Okay.

367
00:30:55,668 --> 00:30:57,555
Good.

368
00:30:57,652 --> 00:30:59,987
New York. New York.

369
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,972
New York.

370
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,621
Big trouble.

371
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:06,633
Big trouble.

372
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,522
In big fucking trouble.

373
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,442
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

374
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,961
- Do you understand what I
am - what I am saying? - Yeah.

375
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,620
Please drive careful.

376
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,506
Uh, drive
- drive careful.

377
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:21,775
- Yo, man. I know how to
drive. - No - No accident.

378
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:24,014
- No accident. Get in.
- No accident.

379
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,258
But don't tell. Don't tell.

380
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:33,389
- Who am I gonna tell, man? Look- -

381
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,720
- Look, man. Just relax, all right?
- Job. Go.

382
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:40,464
Just wait a minute, all right? Look at
this. You didn't even turn the meter on.

383
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,018
First thing you gotta do is
turn that fuckin' meter on.

384
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:47,823
See, it turns the light off on
top. That means you're occupied.

385
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:52,232
I am -Yes, I am oc -
occupied. Occupied. Yes. There.

386
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:54,543
Then you gotta put it in "D." You see?

387
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:57,577
I - I know that.

388
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,268
Hey, don't be saying nothing
bad, man. I understand that shit.

389
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,476
<i>- Put it in "D." "D" is for drive.
- Ja.</i>

390
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:04,618
Just -Just chill out, all right?

391
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,544
Damn, man!

392
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:24,049
It's nice.

393
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,512
<i>It's New York. It's cool.</i>

394
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:32,268
<i>Ja. It's cold. It's cool.</i>

395
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:36,111
<i>Nah, nah, nah. You know,
it's hip. It's cool. It's happening.</i>

396
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:40,103
<i>Ah, I understand.
"It's cool” is good.</i>

397
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,616
<i>Right.</i>

398
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:52,239
Goes good. Goes good.

399
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:55,817
Yeah. Yeah. Goes good.

400
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,473
In English we say, "It's good to go."

401
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,781
- It's good to go.
- Yeah.

402
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,214
It's good to go. That's good.

403
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:05,801
It's good to go. It's good.

404
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:08,938
- Good to go.
- Yeah. Yeah, man. Just chill, all right?

405
00:33:10,097 --> 00:33:13,609
We have the same
- We have the same hat.

406
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:15,535
- What?
- The same hat.

407
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:19,407
- No. No, no. Mine's different.
- Oh, no. It's the same hat.

408
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:22,089
- Mine's different, man. -
This is different here. This -

409
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:24,842
Mine's
- Mine's the newest, latest. Mine's fresh.

410
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:27,627
No. The ear things here. The same.

411
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:30,826
- Ear. This - - No, man.
Look, mine is the - the hype.

412
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,750
- What is this? Hype?
- The hype.

413
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,757
- What's a hype?
- It's fresh.

414
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:37,678
- Fresh. Fresh hat.
- It's the jammy. The newest, latest.

415
00:33:37,776 --> 00:33:40,361
Fresh hat. It sounds good.

416
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:42,635
- Fresh hat.
- Right.

417
00:33:49,807 --> 00:33:52,011
<i>So where you from anyway?</i>

418
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:54,566
<i>From, uh, Germany.
Eastern Germany.</i>

419
00:33:54,671 --> 00:33:57,224
- Eastern Germany?
- Yeah.

420
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,905
From the city of Dresden, which
is close to Czechoslovakia. Uh -

421
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,112
Close to what?

422
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,418
Czechoslovakia.

423
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,428
Prague.

424
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:10,218
- Main town. Prague.
- Hmm.

425
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:13,188
Huh. What, you -you escape from there?

426
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:15,182
No, no. I was free to go.

427
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,510
You got a family over there?

428
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:20,646
I have no family.

429
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,045
So, uh...

430
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:30,378
what'd you do over there
before you came over here...

431
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:32,366
'cause I know you sure
didn't drive no cab!

432
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:34,404
I was a circus clown.

433
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,037
Get the fuck outta here.

434
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:39,491
No, no, no. I
- Wait. I'll show you.

435
00:34:39,598 --> 00:34:41,485
Here.

436
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:55,554
Oh, shit.

437
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,050
That's some bugged-out shit, man.

438
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:08,457
What's your name, man?

439
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:12,616
Helmut Grokenberger. Here.
There. You can read it. That's me.

440
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:14,277
Helmet?

441
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,203
Helmut.

442
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:19,907
- That's your name?
- Yeah.

443
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,388
That's a fucked-up name to
be naming your kid. Helmet.

444
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,684
See, 'cause in English,
a helmet would be, like -

445
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:31,202
you know, like something you
wear on your head, you know?

446
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:33,163
You know. A -A helmet.

447
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:38,721
In English, that'd be
like calling your kid, uh -

448
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:40,683
Oh, shit. Uh -

449
00:35:40,779 --> 00:35:42,722
"Lampshade." Some shit like that.

450
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:44,683
No, but -

451
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,489
"Hey, Lampshade! Come here
and clean up your room!"

452
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,932
So, what's your name?

453
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:56,011
Yo Yo.

454
00:35:57,643 --> 00:35:59,531
What?

455
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:02,344
Yo Yo. It's my name.

456
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:04,515

- What? Yo Yo.

457
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,434
Yo Yo. Yo Yo.

458
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,474
Yo Yo.

459
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,197
Yo Yo. It's, uh

460
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:15,495
No, it - it ain't got nothing to do
with that. It's my name. Yo Yo.

461
00:36:15,595 --> 00:36:17,799
It's a toy for ki -Yo Yo.

462
00:36:18,987 --> 00:36:22,053
- Ain't got nothin' to do with that, man.
- Okay. Okay.

463
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:24,521
Your name Yo Yo. My name Helmut.

464
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,659
Yo Yo, Helmut.

465
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:29,894
- It's good.

466
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,713
What?

467
00:36:58,377 --> 00:37:01,028
What the fuck is she doin' out here?

468
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,924
<i>- Goddamn it!
- What has happened?</i>

469
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,327
<i>Damn.</i>

00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:13,987
<i>There she goes again, man.
Fuckin' up again as usual.</i>

471
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:16,936
<i>What has happened?</i>

472
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:19,488
<i>Shit.</i>

473
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:22,463
Just be cool, Helmet.
I'll be right back.

00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:26,146
<i>Angela! Angela!</i>

475
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:29,315
Where the fuck are you goin', man?
Where you goin'? What are you doin'?

476
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:34,502
What are you doing,
Yo Yo? Get the fuck off me!

477
00:37:34,601 --> 00:37:37,567
- Hey, don't be grabbing my clothes, man!
- Then get the fuck off me, man!

478
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,007
Ain't nobody on the street. Where
you goin'? Where you steppin' to?

479
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:43,007
- What are you so concerned about what
the fuck am I doing? - I'm concerned!

480
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:45,251
- Why you so fuckin' stupid?
- Party here. Party there. Always partyin'.

481
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,654
- It's none of your fuckin' business.
- It is my business. I'm family.

482

<i>- You're not my family!
- You're supposed to be home with your husband.</i>

483
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:53,349
- He knows where I'm at!
- I doubt if he knows where you're at.

484
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:55,455
He's
- Don't be touchin' me no more.

485
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:59,041

to me. All right? - What? What?

486
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:03,780
What's up with you? It's a
family thing, all right? Step off.

487
00:38:04,776 --> 00:38:06,598
- Angela, come on.

Don't make me have to hurt you.

497
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:32,864
Don't be kickin' me. Don't be kickin'.

498

What you doin'?

500
00:38:37,287 --> 00:38:39,229
Let me out of this car!

501
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,374
What the fuck is your problem, man?

502
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:44,447
- What the fuck is your fuckin'
problem, man? - You're my problem!

503
00:38:44,551 --> 00:38:47,169
- No, you're my fuckin' problem.
- Angela, don't be cursin' me out.

504
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:51,329
- Well, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
- Look, Angela. Just shut up!

505
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,405
No, you shut up. Don't
be telling me to shut up.

506
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:54,439
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

507

You know what your
fuckin' problem is, Yo Yo?

509
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:05,280
You don't realize that you're
wearing your ass on your head.

510
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:10,366
Oh, hey, don't worry, Helmet,
man. It's just a family thing.

511
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,575
- You're not my fuckin' family.
- Look, I am your family.

512
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:15,012
- You ain't shit to me. - I'm
your brother-in-law, all right?

- Angela, just calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

514

She's really beautiful. She's beautiful.

515
00:39:22,342 --> 00:39:24,763
- Yeah, you think so, huh?
- Yes.

516
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,812
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

517
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:32,862
- What's your name?
- Helmet.

518
00:39:32,966 --> 00:39:36,097
- His name is Helmet Lampshade or some
shit like that. - Oh, fuck you, all right?

519
00:39:36,198 --> 00:39:39,580
- Don't fuck with me.
- No, no. My name is Helmut Grokenberger.

Here. You can read it.
Helmut Grokenberger.

521
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,868
Great.

522
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,964
I'm driving with a fuckin'
idiot and some clown.

523
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,011
Oh, yes. I am a clown.

524
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:52,386
Yeah, Angela. It's true.

525
00:39:52,485 --> 00:39:54,306
- Shut up!
- No, it's true. Check it out.

526
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:56,445
- Shut up.
- Hey. Come on, Helmet. Show her.

527
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:59,232
- Do that horn thing you did, man.
- Ah, yes.

528
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:10,076
Yes.

529
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,635
That shit is so bugged, man!

530
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,814
What the hell are you doing?

531
00:40:16,452 --> 00:40:20,281
- Thank you.
- See, what'd I tell you, Angela?

532
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:04,770
Helmet, man. Forget about her.

533
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:08,824
Check it out, man. Brooklyn
Bridge. Right over there.

534
00:41:08,931 --> 00:41:10,752
Oh, that's -

535
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,331
<i>That's

536
00:41:18,594 --> 00:41:20,481
All the lights.

00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:34,338
Oh!

538
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,857
Like.

539
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:47,169
You got it, man.

540
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:52,800
- I'm the driver.
- Yeah.

541
00:41:52,897 --> 00:41:54,784
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

542
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,548
Is somebody gonna tell me what
the fuck is goin' on around here?

543
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,472
- What you mean?
- What do I mean?

544
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:04,188
What the fuck are you driving
this cab for, Yo Yo, huh?

545
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:06,362
And what's up with the fuckin' hats?

546
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:08,702
What is this, the fuckin'
Rocky and Bullwinkle show?

547
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:11,998
Yes, yes. We -We have
the same hats. Both.

548
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:14,104
Look. Just forget about
the hats. All right?

549
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:18,137
Look. It was Helmet's first day drivin'. He
drive like shit. All right? So I took over.

550
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:20,729
- Oh, you took over.
- Yeah.

551
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:24,411
You know, you're a fuckin' typical
control freak. You know that?

552
00:42:24,512 --> 00:42:26,618
- Man! Shit.
- Look. Angela, just shut up, all right?

553
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:29,209
Don't tell me to shut up. I
already told you about that shit.

554
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:31,069
- I'm telling you to shut up.
- You shut up!

555
00:42:31,169 --> 00:42:32,314
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

556
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,521
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, all right?

557
00:42:34,624 --> 00:42:36,479
Damn.

558
00:42:37,537 --> 00:42:40,024
You're a fuckin' idiot,
Yo Yo. You know that?

559
00:42:40,128 --> 00:42:42,975
Yo, you see the sign? It says,
"Sit back in case of short stops."

560
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:44,927
You never know. I might stop real short.

561
00:42:45,025 --> 00:42:48,821
You better be careful, because if I get
hurt, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

562
00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:50,870
- Always got to have the last word, right?
- That's right.

563
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:51,958
<i>- Right.
- That's right.</i>

564
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:54,006
<i>- Right.

565
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:56,480
Damn!

566
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:58,398
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Say somethin'. Go ahead.

567
00:42:58,496 --> 00:43:01,562
If you fuckin' stop talkin' to me, then
you won't have to hear my fuckin' mouth.

568
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:05,755
So why don't you shut the fuck up, and then I won't
have to be talkin' all the time, you stupid idiot.

569
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:08,539
- Right.
- Oh, fuck you.

570
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,549
Angela, fuck you too.
You know what you like?

571
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,241
You're like a fuckin' Chihuahua,
always gnawing at my fuckin' ankles.

572
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:16,824
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna take a big fuckin'
bite out of your fuckin' ass then...

573
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,348
so you better watch
out for this little dog.

574
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:22,041
- Shit.
- Damn.

575
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:24,794
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck.

576
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,785
- Nice family. Nice family.
- 'Cause he's an asshole. That's why.

577
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,710
- Yeah. Right.
- Huh?

578
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:33,629
Asshole. He's an asshole.

579
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:38,040
Asshole.

580
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:53,372
<i>Check it out, Helmet. This is Brooklyn.</i>

581

What you think, man?

582
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:57,278
Uh, it's great.

583
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:00,852
It's a dump.

584
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,893
Don't be sayin' shit like that,
Angela. It's our neighborhood.

585
00:44:03,997 --> 00:44:06,070
Like I give a shit?

586
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:10,587
It's "Brookland."

587
00:44:37,982 --> 00:44:40,403
You see, Helmet? This is where we live.

588
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:44,055
- Thanks for nothin', asshole.
- Don't be hittin' on me, Angela.

589
00:44:44,157 --> 00:44:46,677
- Oh, shut up.
- No, you shut up.

590
00:44:49,468 --> 00:44:52,185
Good-bye to you, Angela.

591
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:55,549
Good-bye to you
too, Helmet-head.

592
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:57,466
Good-bye.

<i>- Hey, Yo Yo.

594
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,684
Fuck you!

00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:14,011
- Take this.
- Oh, yes.

596
00:45:17,372 --> 00:45:21,495
Hey. You should count that shit.
You should always count that shit.

597
00:45:24,092 --> 00:45:25,979
<i>Ja.</i>

598
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:34,586
You see?

599
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:36,789
<i>Ja.</i>

600
00:45:36,892 --> 00:45:38,779
It's a little less.

601
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:41,429
The meter say 13. I only gave you 12.

602
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:43,419
Yes.

603
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:49,490
It's New York, Helmet.

604
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:52,464
<i>Money is -Ja. Money...</i>

605
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:55,609
is not important for me.

00:45:55,707 --> 00:45:57,615
I am a clown. I
- I need it.

607

It's not important... for me.

608
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:03,473
Yeah. Yeah.

609
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:13,558
So, you know how to get
back to Manhattan, Helmet?

610
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:15,894
Uh, we -

611
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,508
- No. No.
- Shit.

612
00:46:20,922 --> 00:46:26,224
All right. You're gonna make the opposite
of every direction we made to get here.

613
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:29,973
So if - if we made a right, then this
time you're gonna make a left.

614
00:46:30,073 --> 00:46:32,440
And if we made a left,
you're gonna make a right.

615
00:46:32,538 --> 00:46:35,320
- Right?
- Ah, yeah. Two rights.

616
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:37,807
No, no, no, no, no, no.

617
00:46:37,913 --> 00:46:39,736
Helmet, look.

618
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:43,248
You go down there,
you make a right, then-

619
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:48,049
When you get to that wide street -
you know, that - that - that big one?

620
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:51,055
- Yeah.
- You're just gonna stop and ask somebody.

621
00:46:52,153 --> 00:46:54,325
Okay. Okay, Mr. Lampshade.

622
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:58,200
No, no, no, man. No.

623
00:46:58,297 --> 00:47:00,850
No, man. You be Mr. Lampshade.

624
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:02,993
- I be Mr. Lampshade?
- Yeah!

625
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:05,945
Okay. I be Mr. Lampshade.

626
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,162
Yeah.

627
00:47:10,265 --> 00:47:12,153
Later for you, Helmet.

628
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,480
"D" is to drive.

629
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:22,229
Yeah. Yeah. You got it. Yeah.
"D." "D." "D" is to drive!

630
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:26,071
Learn some English, Helmet!

631
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,399
<i>Right.</i>

632
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:34,995
<i>Right! Helmet, go right!</i>

633
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,779
There's a nice family.

634
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,516
Left... or right?

635
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:16,879
Uh, two rights. Two -

636
00:48:22,454 --> 00:48:24,277
No.

637
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,196
Huh?

638
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:28,182
Straight.

639
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:31,253
Here.

640
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:34,740
<i>Ja, ja, ja.</i>

641
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:56,267
New York.

642
00:48:56,374 --> 00:48:58,261
New York.

643
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:26,540
- In the bag.
- In the bag.

644
00:50:26,964 --> 00:50:28,523
You're quite a guy!

645
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:30,288
So am I.

646
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,223
We sure impressed that ambassador.

647
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,338
Ah!

648
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:37,096
He's been taken in.

649
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:40,913
More champagne! That's what we need.

650
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:43,306
The way we suckered him...

651
00:50:44,562 --> 00:50:47,464
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

652
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:51,048
We told you to drive carefully.
We're important people.

653
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:54,668
Hell yes! Extremely important people.

654
00:50:54,994 --> 00:50:56,904
If you only knew what's in this case.

655
00:50:57,074 --> 00:50:58,481
Don't you tell him.

656
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,319
The Cameroon ambassador wants
to see us in the morning.

657
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,286
In one piece.

658
00:51:02,387 --> 00:51:05,289
And you drive like a lizard,
first left, then right.

659
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:06,987
You think you're in your jungle here?

660
00:51:08,147 --> 00:51:11,310
We're not from the
same jungle, are we? No.

661
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:12,781
Drive carefully.

662
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:17,036
These little brothers who come to
France, don't they have any respect?

663
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,625
Did you even hear him say hello?

664
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,345
Little brother, where do you
come from that you're so rude?

665
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,268
You from Togo?

666
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:25,809
From Gabon?

667
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:29,520
You can't be from Cameroon. From Dakar?

668
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:32,301
Wait, I'll have a closer look.

669
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:35,472
If his looks don't kill you.

670
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:37,324
With that face he might.

671
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:48,999
I'll tell you.

672
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,534
With a face like that,

673
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:53,062
he must be a representative
of King Beyanzed.

674
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:55,628
You're killing me.

675
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:57,577
It's true!

676
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,535
That's a Beninese's face!

677
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:01,521
That's it. Benin.

678
00:52:03,217 --> 00:52:04,045
Little brother,

679
00:52:05,104 --> 00:52:06,282
are you from Benin?

680
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:09,993
The Ivory Coast.

681
00:52:12,816 --> 00:52:14,310
Ivory Coast.

682
00:52:15,345 --> 00:52:17,133
<i>He's an 'Ivoirien'.</i>

683
00:52:19,824 --> 00:52:21,385
"Can't see a thing!"

684
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,829
That explains it!

685
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:25,032
<i>He's an "Y voit rien. "</i>

686
00:52:26,096 --> 00:52:28,845
You've run four red lights,

687
00:52:28,943 --> 00:52:31,878
you can't see a thing, and you drive
at night without your glasses on.

688
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:36,424
Don't leave your glasses at
home! Keep your eyes on the road.

689
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:39,118
Look! The road is over there!

690
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,469
<i>Who gives these people
cars? An '‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘‘Ivoirien’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’'!</i>

691
00:52:45,104 --> 00:52:48,616
What do you mean, "that explains it"?

692
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:50,694
Ah?

693
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:55,400
I work from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.,
so don't fuck with me in my own taxi.

694
00:52:55,823 --> 00:52:57,862
And I don't give a shit
about your ambassador, okay?

695
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:01,380
Can't we have some fun?

696
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:04,581
We've had champagne, we're very happy...

697
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,621
No, you don't have fun in
my taxi. I work in this taxi.

698
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:10,955
It's my place of business,
not your fucking playground!

699
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:12,843
Okay, get out.

700
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:13,967
What do you mean?

701
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:15,884
Just get out of my taxi.

702
00:53:15,982 --> 00:53:18,284
Little brother, I only said...

703
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:19,624
Forget it. Just get out.

704
00:53:21,038 --> 00:53:22,020
Out of my taxi!

705
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:24,263
But it's 4:00 in the morning.

706
00:53:27,118 --> 00:53:28,711
Little brother, what's wrong with you?

707
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:30,536
Look where you're leaving us!

708
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:35,913
Can you believe this guy?

709
00:53:36,014 --> 00:53:37,956
Does he expect us to find a taxi here?

710
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,899
What a fucked-up day.

711
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:53,474
<i>Rutain.</i>

712
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:55,337
Big brothers, my ass...

713
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:00,200
Shit, they didn't even pay!

714
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:02,189
I can't believe this shit.

715
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:13,228
I'll kick your ass.

716
00:54:43,499 --> 00:54:45,638
Here's one that won't give me any shit.

717
00:54:59,148 --> 00:55:01,537
Nice driving, asshole.
You almost flattened me.

718
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:15,427
What are we waiting for?

719
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:17,571
Quai de l'Oise, near
Porte de la Villette.

720
00:55:17,867 --> 00:55:19,143
It's near the canal.

721
00:55:37,322 --> 00:55:39,362
At the next intersection

722
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:42,313
just follow Canal St.
Martin up to Stalingrad Place

723
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,166
then along Quai de la Seine.

724
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:47,945
Look, I know my job. Don't
tell me how to do my job.

725
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:59,042
IF YOU HAVE A PREFERRED ROUTE,
INDICATE THIS TO THE DRIVER

726
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:05,798
Doesn't this sign say
to follow my directions?

727
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,809
Did you change something?

728
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:46,504
What, me? Nothing!

729
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:59,015
<i>Pardon.</i>

730
00:56:59,112 --> 00:57:02,112
Don't they teach you how to
drive before unleashing you?

731
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,662
What are we doing in this tunnel?

732
00:57:50,182 --> 00:57:53,564
Why'd you take the fucking tunnel?
I didn't tell you to go this way!

733
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:00,065
I hate the tunnel.

734
00:58:12,934 --> 00:58:14,494
Hold still. I got it.

735
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:21,606
<i>Merci.</i>

736
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:59,934
Hey, don't blind people
usually wear dark glasses?

737
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:03,681
Do they? I wouldn't know.
I've never seen a blind person.

738
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:14,142
You've always been blind?

739
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:15,580
Yeah.

740
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,957
Must be a real drag being blind, huh?

741
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,548
Listen, jerk-off. I
can do anything you can

742
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:29,310
and a lot of things you'll never do.

743
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:31,035
I'm blind, that's all.

744
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,301
You can't drive a car, for example.

745
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:35,995
And you can?

746
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:46,972
I didn't mean to make you mad.

747
00:59:48,036 --> 00:59:50,588
I don't know any blind people.
I'm curious, that's all.

748
00:59:50,947 --> 00:59:55,038
I'm just like you. I drink,
I eat, I taste things.

749
00:59:56,483 --> 00:59:59,550
I listen to music. I feel music.

750
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:02,906
I do whatever I want.
I even go to the movies.

751
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:06,462
The movies?

752
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:09,693
And what do you see at the movies?

753
01:00:12,258 --> 01:00:13,852
Sometimes I feel the film.

754
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:16,384
I can hear it.

755
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,739
Oh, forget it. You're a pain in the ass.

756
01:00:22,179 --> 01:00:24,862
Yeah, but when you eat,
you can't see the food.

757
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,474
The carrots could be blue, for example.

758
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,061
And with music, you
can't see the musicians!

759
01:00:32,226 --> 01:00:34,233
You don't even know
the shape of a guitar.

760
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:36,825
Yes I know the shape
of a fucking guitar.

761
01:00:36,962 --> 01:00:39,231
I feel things I'm sure you never will.

762
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:57,309
Okay then, if you're so smart,
let me ask you a question.

763
01:00:59,105 --> 01:01:00,960
Here's the question.

764
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:03,224
What color am I?

765
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:05,440
I don't give a fuck about colors.

766
01:01:06,593 --> 01:01:09,081
But people have
different colors of skin!

767
01:01:09,185 --> 01:01:13,495
Look, I don't care if you're
green or... blue like a carrot.

768
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:15,903
For me the word color
doesn't mean anything.

769
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:17,599
I feel colors.

770
01:01:18,753 --> 01:01:20,476
But you'd never understand that.

771
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,621
Okay. You hear my voice, my accent.

772
01:01:34,336 --> 01:01:35,581
Tell me where I'm from.

773
01:01:37,248 --> 01:01:39,899
And if I'm right I win
a color TV, is that it?

774
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:44,060
I don't know, Africa.

775
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:48,089
From Cameroon.

776
01:01:49,536 --> 01:01:50,747
No, the Ivory Coast.

777
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:54,653
Not bad!

778
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,746
You're exactly right! Treichville.

779
01:03:00,895 --> 01:03:02,934
Can I ask you something personal?

780
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:04,956
What now?

781
01:03:10,142 --> 01:03:11,898
What's it like in bed?

782
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:14,108
What in bed?

783
01:03:16,446 --> 01:03:20,701
With a man, if you can't see
anything, when you make love,

784
01:03:22,014 --> 01:03:24,697
how do you know who's next to you,

785
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,459
who you're making love with?

786
01:03:33,245 --> 01:03:36,540
Listen, when I make love it's
with every centimeter of my body,

787
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:39,669
every pore of my skin.
Unlike you, I'm sure.

788
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:43,321
Believe me, I know the
man I make love with.

789
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:47,386
Even when he's on the
stairs, I know it's him.

790
01:03:48,221 --> 01:03:50,076
I can smell him from a block away.

791
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,549
A block away! He must really stink.

792
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:56,186
Fuck you.

793
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:59,575
I'm glad I can't see you, 'cause
you must be an ugly bastard.

794
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:02,260
That's right.

795
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:50,490
<i>Et voilà.</i>

796
01:04:50,588 --> 01:04:52,016
Is this Quai de l’Oise?

797
01:04:52,123 --> 01:04:53,432
<i>Ouais.</i>

798
01:04:53,531 --> 01:04:54,610
Which side?

799
01:04:55,899 --> 01:04:57,972
West of the canal, facing
Porte de la Villette.

800
01:04:58,075 --> 01:04:59,122
<i>OK.</i>

801
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,121
How much is it?

802
01:05:03,675 --> 01:05:04,690
Forty francs.

803
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,858
Listen, asshole. I've been
trapped in here longer than that,

804
01:05:07,963 --> 01:05:10,134
and I don't need your fuckin' charity.

805
01:05:11,163 --> 01:05:12,569
It must be 48 or 49.

806
01:05:12,762 --> 01:05:14,290
Here's 50.

807
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:15,636
Keep the change.

808
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,159
You think I was born yesterday?

809
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:39,416
Watch out for yourself!.

810
01:05:40,602 --> 01:05:42,609
Watch out yourself.

811
01:06:33,976 --> 01:06:36,278
Don't you look where you're
going? We're not in Africa here!

812
01:06:36,376 --> 01:06:37,718
You're a racist!

813
01:06:37,912 --> 01:06:40,497
No, I'm not a racist, but you
drive like a fuckin' black!

814
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:43,412
The road goes this way,
and you were going that way!

815
01:06:44,248 --> 01:06:46,004
Are you blind or what?

816
01:06:47,256 --> 01:06:48,500
But it's not my fault!

817
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:57,674
# I see by your outfit #

818
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,814
# That you are a cowboy ##

819
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:08,338
I can't see a thing.

820
01:09:09,235 --> 01:09:11,723
They could put up a streetlight
once in a while in Rome.

821
01:09:29,683 --> 01:09:32,913
Would you like to meet
and make love?

822
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:36,043
<i>Confirmed. I repeat,
send a car immediately.</i>

823
01:09:36,212 --> 01:09:37,805
Where should we do it?

824
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,500
<i>12 Marmoratta Street.</i>

825
01:09:39,603 --> 01:09:40,399
And then?

826
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:41,513
<i>Buffalota Street, number 40.</i>

827
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:42,578
And after?

828
01:09:42,739 --> 01:09:44,778
<i>Piazza Quadrata, but there is no number.</i>

829
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:48,174
Okay, we'll do it in Piazza Quadrata.

830
01:09:48,306 --> 01:09:50,478
<i>Correct, confirmed,
but there is no number.</i>

831
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,806
How many times will we do it?

832
01:09:54,035 --> 01:09:55,529
<i>One thousand and one.</i>

833
01:09:55,635 --> 01:09:56,812
How soon?

834
01:09:57,171 --> 01:09:58,764
<i>Five minutes. Three cars.</i>

835
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:02,162
Three taxis? You little
slut! We're through.

836
01:10:22,226 --> 01:10:24,648
Hotel Genius. What a name for a hotel!

837
01:10:24,946 --> 01:10:27,280
Good evening. I'd like a room between...

838
01:10:28,146 --> 01:10:30,383
Leonardo da Vinci and Einstein.

839
01:10:30,578 --> 01:10:32,301
Yes, thank you. Who's this?

840
01:10:32,434 --> 01:10:33,611
Dante Alighieri, how's it going?

841
01:10:33,745 --> 01:10:36,080
I'm here having coffee with Shakespeare.

842
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:37,191
Isaac Newton!

843
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:38,376
Beethoven!

844
01:10:38,737 --> 01:10:40,974
Beethoven, I'd like you
to meet Charlie Parker.

845
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,256
Say something to him, Charlie.

846
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:56,496
Charlie Parker at the Hotel Genius...

847
01:10:58,417 --> 01:11:00,392
If there's no room at the Hotel Genius

848
01:11:00,593 --> 01:11:02,535
I'll take a room at the Hotel Imbecile.

849
01:11:11,504 --> 01:11:13,806
Rome deserted.

850
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,489
Beautiful city.

851
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:18,822
The Romans have all left Rome.

852
01:11:18,928 --> 01:11:20,172
Where did they go?

853
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:21,829
Everyone's in Bergamo.

854
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:23,974
What do they do in Bergamo?

855
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,709
I love these one-way streets!

856
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:42,695
It's like bumper cars.

857
01:11:43,791 --> 01:11:46,791
"In the middle of the
journey of our life,

858
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:49,130
oh, dear friends, to you I convey,

859
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:51,817
I found myself down a street one way."

860
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,814
It's a one-way street!

861
01:12:04,814 --> 01:12:07,564
That's right, it's one-way, you jerk!

862
01:12:16,559 --> 01:12:18,217
This wall wasn't here yesterday!

863
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:20,422
Like Saint Pete, I will retreat.

864
01:12:23,054 --> 01:12:26,731
And like the saints that
led, I'll move ahead.

865
01:12:28,751 --> 01:12:30,125
Another one-way street!

866
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:33,255
They're always changing
everything. Fuckin' idiots...

867
01:12:39,726 --> 01:12:40,838
I'm dangerous?

868
01:12:41,326 --> 01:12:43,781
I've got a taxi and they've got guns

869
01:12:44,014 --> 01:12:45,738
and I'm dangerous!

870
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:52,450
I should turn around
and run them both over.

871
01:12:54,926 --> 01:12:57,347
# I see by your outfit #

872
01:13:23,788 --> 01:13:26,538
A bishop alone in Rome
at 4:00 a.m.!

873
01:13:26,925 --> 01:13:28,036
Bad luck! Touch my balls.

874
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:09,448
Excuse me, Father.
The statue confused me.

875
01:14:09,548 --> 01:14:11,555
I couldn't see you. Excuse me.

876
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:14,920
Across town, please. To Tiburtino.

877
01:14:15,019 --> 01:14:17,408
Tiburtino? Not the Vatican?
Aren't you a bishop?

878
01:14:17,675 --> 01:14:21,155
No, not the Vatican.
And I'm not a bishop.

879
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:56,197
Father, I want to tell
you that I'm deeply honored

880
01:14:56,394 --> 01:14:58,368
to have a bishop in my taxi.

881
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:01,471
My dear son, I'm not a bishop.

882
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:04,191
Yes, I know, you're not a bishop, but...

883
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:13,252
My son, may I ask you a favor?

884
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:14,594
Anything, Father!

885
01:15:14,985 --> 01:15:17,025
Could you remove your sunglasses?

886
01:15:17,162 --> 01:15:19,911
It's not safe to drive at
night with dark glasses.

887
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:27,936
<i>Grazie, padre.</i>

888
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:30,758
I put them on this morning
and forgot I was wearing them.

889
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:33,503
I see better now. Thank you!

890
01:15:34,857 --> 01:15:38,850
I feel like a blind man who's
miraculously recovered his sight!

891
01:15:38,953 --> 01:15:40,840
<i>Grazie, padre. Grazie tante.</i>

892
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,903
<i>Padre.</i>

893
01:15:57,001 --> 01:15:58,691
Everything okay, Father?

894
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:00,165
Everything's okay.

895
01:16:30,408 --> 01:16:34,019
Excuse me, but it says NO SMOKING.

896
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:37,573
That sign? I keep forgetting
to get rid of it. Sorry, Father.

897
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:42,979
They put one in every
taxi. It's ridiculous.

898
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:16,128
Father, I know this will
sound a little strange,

899
01:17:16,326 --> 01:17:18,628
but here we are alone,
at night in a taxi,

900
01:17:19,527 --> 01:17:21,534
and it's a little embarrassing,

901
01:17:21,798 --> 01:17:23,108
but I would like to confess.

902
01:17:24,454 --> 01:17:26,941
But this is not the
appropriate place, my son.

903
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:29,409
I know, I said it myself

904
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:33,021
we're in a taxi, not church,
but I must confess, Father.

905
01:17:33,446 --> 01:17:36,413
Dear son, confession is an
act that must remain anonymous.

906
01:17:36,517 --> 01:17:40,292
The church must preserve
this anonymity. Otherwise...

907
01:17:41,158 --> 01:17:43,841
But I promise I won't tell anyone!

908
01:17:44,965 --> 01:17:47,387
I'm not Roman, I'm Tuscan.

909
01:17:47,494 --> 01:17:49,664
I've had this taxi for
15 years here in Rome,

910
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:50,976
and in 15 years

911
01:17:51,077 --> 01:17:53,597
I swear I've never picked
up the same person twice.

912
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:56,735
And even if I picked
you up again in 10 years

913
01:17:56,966 --> 01:17:58,754
I wouldn't recognize
you, dressed as a bishop.

914
01:17:59,078 --> 01:18:01,532
And I promise I won't
look you in the face.

915
01:18:01,861 --> 01:18:03,716
After all, I've got to drive.

916
01:18:05,701 --> 01:18:08,003
I must confess. Please!

917
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:12,216
You won't have to pay the fare, okay?

918
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:17,500
If you don't hear my confession,
I'm afraid I'll burn in hell.

919
01:18:17,892 --> 01:18:19,998
But this is unacceptable.

920
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,515
Father, I've got so
many sins to confess.

921
01:18:26,565 --> 01:18:29,913
First thing, when I was
about 12 or 13 years old,

922
01:18:30,116 --> 01:18:32,865
when boys become big men,

923
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,131
well, each his own physique...

924
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:41,181
and you begin to feel that
desire for, how can I say it...

925
01:18:41,572 --> 01:18:42,466
for love!

926
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:43,768
For sex!

927
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:45,823
You feel the need for

928
01:18:46,404 --> 01:18:47,516
release!

929
01:18:50,179 --> 01:18:54,456
You understand? To
relieve this desire to...

930
01:18:56,547 --> 01:19:00,343
Anyway, I lived in the country
and there weren't many women,

931
01:19:00,483 --> 01:19:02,370
and though you're still a kid,

932
01:19:04,131 --> 01:19:06,302
inside you feel a man's feeling,

933
01:19:07,171 --> 01:19:11,481
and there was no way
to... release this feeling.

934
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:17,695
So the idea, not mine, but a
real intelligent friend of mine's,

935
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,900
of relieving ourselves with...

936
01:19:20,034 --> 01:19:22,816
we made love with... how do I say this?

937
01:19:23,522 --> 01:19:25,345
With pumpkins.

938
01:19:26,243 --> 01:19:29,888
Warm, soft, damp, with
seeds inside, so round...

939
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:36,927
And we would... Help me
find the words, Father.

940
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,963
We relieved ourselves
with these pumpkins.

941
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:46,646
But then, after a certain age, I quit.

942
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,631
I don't know if my friends
quit, but that's their business.

943
01:19:51,362 --> 01:19:54,776
I quit because I felt, Father,
and I'm sure you'll agree,

944
01:19:54,882 --> 01:19:58,744
in growing up to be a
sensitive, even religious man,

945
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:01,533
that love is something every man needs

946
01:20:01,858 --> 01:20:04,542
not with a vegetable, but with something

947
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:05,728
alive!

948
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:11,643
Something that moves, that's
warm, that looks you in the eyes.

949
01:20:12,162 --> 01:20:14,201
Something with a soul.

950
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:16,063
Anyway, there was a...

951
01:20:16,162 --> 01:20:17,624
a sheep.

952
01:20:17,728 --> 01:20:19,484
A beautiful little sheep!

953
01:20:21,569 --> 01:20:25,213
She was nice, kind, sweet, pretty.

954
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,546
I called her Lola.

955
01:20:27,649 --> 01:20:30,202
Not an ugly old sheep like the others,

956
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:33,439
but a little sheep.
So delicate, refined!

957
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:37,245
Soft wool, two big eyes watching me.

958
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,964
At first I didn't even notice.

959
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:44,602
And what a sweet little voice!

960
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,725
And I was enchanted.

961
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,814
Not like the other sheep.

962
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,080
Her movements were so refined.

963
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:02,103
She'd come beside me, and somehow

964
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,185
I was always on top of her.

965
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,179
She was so pretty... even erotic!

966
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,077
She would embarrass me because

967
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,243
she would come around
when I was with my friends.

968
01:21:20,928 --> 01:21:23,742
People began to notice
this. It was embarrassing.

969
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,744
In fact, finally my father noticed.

970
01:21:27,519 --> 01:21:28,893
A horrible memory.

971
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:31,006
Do you know what my father did?

972
01:21:31,135 --> 01:21:32,990
He sold her to a

973
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:38,202
a butcher.

974
01:21:39,647 --> 01:21:42,330
He sold my Lola to a butcher!

975
01:21:42,687 --> 01:21:45,437
A butcher named Guido Rusticoni.

976
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:50,040
A fat, hairy, sweaty
guy. Rude, uneducated.

977
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:53,686
Really ugly, disgusting.
He was horrible.

978
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:56,856
My Lola to a butcher for 80,000 lire.

979
01:21:57,086 --> 01:22:00,282
I felt so badly that I
haven't eaten meat since.

980
01:22:00,575 --> 01:22:03,476
Even now when they ask me,
"Do you want some lamb?"

981
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:05,849
Me, lamb? No, thanks.

982
01:22:06,269 --> 01:22:09,237
I don't eat vegetables either,
because of the pumpkins.

983
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,310
In fact, I don't eat
much at all anymore.

984
01:22:13,214 --> 01:22:15,669
It was very traumatic for me.

985
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:20,700
What I want to say is, I
understand that these are big sins,

986
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:24,537
but truly, Father,
they are sins of love.

987
01:22:34,365 --> 01:22:37,911
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

988
01:22:51,965 --> 01:22:53,209
<i>Ciao, Gino!</i>

989
01:22:53,308 --> 01:22:55,195
<i>Ciao.</i>

990
01:22:57,469 --> 01:22:59,607
Gino, how are you?

991
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:01,657
<i>Ciao.</i>

992
01:23:01,756 --> 01:23:04,953
Nothing's going on,
really. No customers.

993
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:06,361
It's a lousy night.

994
01:23:06,813 --> 01:23:08,820
Nothing here either. A real slow night.

995
01:23:08,957 --> 01:23:11,161
We haven't made a cent.

996
01:23:12,508 --> 01:23:13,402
A bishop.

997
01:23:13,692 --> 01:23:14,936
A bishop?!

998
01:23:15,036 --> 01:23:17,043
A real one? Oh, let me see!

999
01:23:17,468 --> 01:23:20,118
What a darling little bishop!

1000
01:23:26,364 --> 01:23:27,379
He's charming.

1001
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,441
Stop by later, okay?

1002
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,307
<i>Ciao.</i>

1003
01:23:42,556 --> 01:23:44,760
Gino always cheers me up.

1004
01:23:48,252 --> 01:23:49,975
Pretty girls, eh?

1005
01:23:50,236 --> 01:23:53,083
So, my brother Vincenzo
lives here in Rome too.

1006
01:23:53,499 --> 01:23:56,728
He's a plumber. Repairs pipes, water.

1007
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:58,833
One night he invited me to dinner,

1008
01:23:59,963 --> 01:24:02,134
he and my
sister-in-law. Monica.

1009
01:24:02,491 --> 01:24:04,531
So I went to their house.

1010
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:07,417
They have a female dog too. Very cute.

1011
01:24:07,803 --> 01:24:11,250
So after dinner, he
got an emergency call.

1012
01:24:13,946 --> 01:24:17,874
The pipes exploded in a
condominium. Water everywhere.

1013
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:22,194
And like a lightning bolt,
he ran off with his tools,

1014
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,719
and I was left alone with Monica.

1015
01:24:25,947 --> 01:24:29,078
Now, Monica is beautiful!
You should see her.

1016
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:31,250
Absolutely gorgeous.

1017
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,801
She really likes me.

1018
01:24:36,442 --> 01:24:40,883
She always looks at me with those
strange "sister-in-law eyes."

1019
01:24:41,082 --> 01:24:43,285
At their wedding I
said, "Congratulations!"

1020
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:46,031
But she looked at me strangely.

1021
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:48,787
She married my brother,
and we're the same type.

1022
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:51,191
I'm even more handsome than he is.

1023
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:53,679
So Monica and I were alone.

1024
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:56,529
She started to clean up at the sink.

1025
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:00,306
As she bent over, I was
sitting behind her like this,

1026
01:25:01,113 --> 01:25:03,764
and from this position I saw

1027
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,041
two cheeks!

1028
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:10,451
An ass from out of this world!

1029
01:25:10,553 --> 01:25:12,179
With tiny white panties,

1030
01:25:12,282 --> 01:25:15,184
riding up a little so you
could see one whole cheek!

1031
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,564
The other was partly covered.

1032
01:25:16,665 --> 01:25:20,462
Father, I couldn't control myself!.

1033
01:25:20,921 --> 01:25:24,304
She turned and looked back
at me with those eyes...

1034
01:25:26,361 --> 01:25:28,597
and suddenly I was on top of her.

1035
01:25:28,793 --> 01:25:30,647
Father, that beautiful ass!

1036
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:35,473
Pink, soft, round like a pumpkin!

1037
01:25:35,768 --> 01:25:38,670
Those soft, wool panties
reminded me of the sheep,

1038
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,077
the pumpkin, the sheep,
my brother's wife...

1039
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:43,119
I was on fire!

1040
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:47,955
Then we were on the
floor, under the table!

1041
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:50,101
The beauty of it!

1042
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:54,291
What pleasure! We enjoyed
ourselves like... imagine, Father...

1043
01:25:54,425 --> 01:25:56,312
Heaven on earth!

1044
01:25:57,431 --> 01:26:01,010
I said to myself, "But
this is my brother's wife!"

1045
01:26:01,112 --> 01:26:02,606
But I couldn't stop!

1046
01:26:02,712 --> 01:26:06,127
And I said it again, "It's
your brother's wife! Stop!"

1047
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:07,475
But I couldn't!

1048
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:11,413
It lasted hours!

1049
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:13,453
And she screamed!

1050
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:16,048
And I screamed!

1051
01:26:16,151 --> 01:26:17,875
It was terrible.

1052
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,348
Just beautiful.

1053
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:20,622
I turned her over,

1054
01:26:22,007 --> 01:26:25,553
kissed her all over, her
neck, her perfect breasts...

1055
01:26:26,263 --> 01:26:28,401
I stayed there all night.

1056
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:31,922
I never went back because
she's my brother's wife,

1057
01:26:32,342 --> 01:26:34,197
although he never noticed anything.

1058
01:26:34,391 --> 01:26:36,398
Now she smiles whenever she sees me -

1059
01:26:36,503 --> 01:26:37,747
<i>Ciao. Ciao.</i>

1060
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:41,741
and I say, "Remember when we
fucked like animals on the floor?"

1061
01:26:41,878 --> 01:26:44,365
It was truly paradise!

1062
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,543
My gorgeous
sister-in-law!

1063
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:50,893
I don't know if you ever made love
with your sister-in-law, Father,

1064
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:54,891
but you should try it,
because it's absolute heaven.

1065
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:57,518
Then you just confess. It's incredible.

1066
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:02,187
Father, I know these
sins must be confessed,

1067
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:04,589
but they were just so wonderful.

1068
01:27:09,846 --> 01:27:11,667
<i>Bellissima.</i>

1069
01:27:11,766 --> 01:27:13,708
<i>Eh, padre?</i>

1070
01:27:14,773 --> 01:27:17,075
<i>Oh-oh. Padre.</i>

1071
01:27:19,861 --> 01:27:21,716
I haven't upset you, have I?

1072
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:23,022
I guess he fell asleep.

1073
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:26,991
<i>Padre.</i>

1074
01:27:27,093 --> 01:27:28,751
Padre.

1075
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:34,570
<i>Padre!</i>

1076
01:27:34,677 --> 01:27:36,368
Father, don't fool around!

1077
01:27:36,469 --> 01:27:38,356
<i>Padre!</i>

1078
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,614
<i>Padre. Padre.</i>

1079
01:27:45,716 --> 01:27:47,659
Not feeling well?

1080
01:27:47,764 --> 01:27:50,448
<i>Padre. Padre.</i>

1081
01:27:50,549 --> 01:27:53,396
You're not... dead, are
you? I don't hear anything!

1082
01:27:53,589 --> 01:27:54,603
Holy shit!

1083
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:57,075
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

1084
01:27:57,172 --> 01:27:59,059
<i>Padre. Padre!</i>

1085
01:27:59,156 --> 01:28:00,912
It's me, your taxi driver!

1086
01:28:01,395 --> 01:28:02,825
I've killed him!

1087
01:28:08,308 --> 01:28:10,512
My God, what have I done?

1088
01:28:11,188 --> 01:28:12,017
He's dead!

1089
01:28:12,116 --> 01:28:14,003
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1090
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,681
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

1091
01:28:17,779 --> 01:28:19,273
I've killed a priest.

1092
01:28:19,412 --> 01:28:21,386
Even worse, a bishop!

1093
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:25,235
They'll give me life!

1094
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:28,141
How many years do you get
for a bishop? Twenty? Thirty?

1095
01:28:29,235 --> 01:28:31,057
<i>Padre!</i>

1096
01:28:31,154 --> 01:28:32,365
Are you asleep?

1097
01:28:33,107 --> 01:28:34,220
Joking?

1098
01:28:35,954 --> 01:28:37,809
He's dead. I've killed a priest!

1099
01:28:38,131 --> 01:28:39,560
I'll be in all the papers:

1100
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:41,489
TAXI DRIVER KILLS BISHOP

1101
01:28:41,843 --> 01:28:45,159
My brother will find out
everything about me and Monica!

1102
01:28:45,267 --> 01:28:46,674
What a fucking mess!

1103
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:50,443
<i>Padre! Padre.</i>

1104
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:54,641
And such a nice little
priest. So delicate!

1105
01:28:54,866 --> 01:28:57,834
I shouldn't have told him
about the sheep and Monica!

1106
01:28:58,994 --> 01:29:01,994
I'm sorry, Father. Now
I'll really burn in hell!

1107
01:29:02,099 --> 01:29:04,488
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

1108
01:29:04,595 --> 01:29:07,246
Where should I put him?

1109
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,596
Only a priest, but he weighs
enough to be a cardinal.

1110
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:03,656
<i>40 India Street, first call.</i>

1111
01:35:04,552 --> 01:35:07,487
<i>40 India Street, car
needed. Second call.</i>

1112
01:35:08,809 --> 01:35:14,078
<i>Car 285 to India Street. Thanks, 285.</i>

1113
01:35:17,512 --> 01:35:21,952
<i>29 Industrial Road, three
customers waiting. First call.</i>

1114
01:35:22,824 --> 01:35:26,402
<i>29 Industrial Road, three
customers. Second call.</i>

1115
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:30,949
<i>Industrial Road 29, three
customers. Third call.</i>

1116
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:36,199
Car 101 will take Industrial Road.

1117
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:40,963
<i>Hi, Mika! Okay. Bye, bye.</i>

1118
01:35:42,439 --> 01:35:43,366
Bye, bye.

1119
01:36:52,069 --> 01:36:53,476
You called a taxi?

1120
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:56,508
No, we called a garbage truck.

1121
01:36:58,085 --> 01:37:00,419
But you'll have to do the job.

1122
01:37:15,269 --> 01:37:16,545
Is he all right?

1123
01:37:18,469 --> 01:37:20,356
No, he's not all right.

1124
01:37:21,924 --> 01:37:23,517
But don't worry about it.

1125
01:37:27,109 --> 01:37:28,156
Let's go.

1126
01:37:29,028 --> 01:37:29,890
Where?

1127
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,667
Home.

1128
01:37:33,508 --> 01:37:36,094
My house is closest,
so drop me off first.

1129
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:38,747
We're gonna take Aki home first.

1130
01:37:39,907 --> 01:37:42,079
But he lives furthest
away, and he's fucked-up.

1131
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:44,888
You're the one who's
fucked-up. He's our friend,

1132
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:47,994
and in that condition, we've got
to make sure he gets home okay.

1133
01:37:48,228 --> 01:37:49,472
Then you'll have to pay.

1134
01:37:49,668 --> 01:37:50,682
But I don't have any money!

1135
01:37:50,883 --> 01:37:51,996
Well, I don't either!

1136
01:37:54,019 --> 01:37:56,834
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1137
01:37:57,827 --> 01:37:59,202
What about him?

1138
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,838
His severance pay.

1139
01:38:04,548 --> 01:38:06,588
Okay, we've got money.

1140
01:38:07,107 --> 01:38:07,968
Let's go.

1141
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,595
Where?

1142
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:12,704
We all live on the same block.

1143
01:38:13,379 --> 01:38:15,234
Just drive across town.

1144
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:52,953
What's your name?

1145
01:38:53,571 --> 01:38:54,399
Mika.

1146
01:38:56,034 --> 01:38:59,132
When I was a kid I had
a hamster named Mika.

1147
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:01,120
Mika. Mika.

1148
01:39:05,058 --> 01:39:08,189
By the way, what was that
about his severance pay?

1149
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:11,993
He lost his job today.

1150
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:15,255
Is he all right?

1151
01:39:16,865 --> 01:39:18,938
No, he's not all right.

1152
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:22,625
Didn't he just tell you
that he lost his job today?

1153
01:39:24,896 --> 01:39:27,035
He's all fucked-up,

1154
01:39:27,329 --> 01:39:31,257
and losing his job is
just a small part of it.

1155
01:39:32,576 --> 01:39:33,689
What do you mean?

1156
01:39:35,297 --> 01:39:38,777
Today was the worst fuckin'
day of his entire life,

1157
01:39:39,905 --> 01:39:41,627
that's what I fuckin' mean.

1158
01:39:44,449 --> 01:39:47,384
Or yesterday was, anyway...

1159
01:39:51,617 --> 01:39:52,827
I'm sorry to hear that.

1160
01:39:55,584 --> 01:39:57,242
What would you know about it?

1161
01:39:58,529 --> 01:40:00,917
You have no idea how he feels.

1162
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:08,120
At the moment, I doubt
he feels much of anything.

1163
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:14,494
Look, Mr. Taxi Man, don't fuck with us!

1164
01:40:14,783 --> 01:40:17,205
Be careful, you idiot! He's driving!

1165
01:40:17,408 --> 01:40:18,335
You're the idiot!

1166
01:40:18,559 --> 01:40:21,494
Stop! Or you morons can walk home!

1167
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:42,940
Can I ask something?

1168
01:40:44,447 --> 01:40:45,211
What?

1169
01:40:47,295 --> 01:40:51,005
Your friend. What happened
to him that was so terrible?

1170
01:40:51,774 --> 01:40:53,018
Besides losing his job, I mean.

1171
01:40:55,775 --> 01:40:57,630
What was so terrible?

1172
01:40:58,943 --> 01:41:01,331
I'll tell you what was so terrible.

1173
01:41:02,559 --> 01:41:06,104
This morning he drives his car to work.

1174
01:41:06,335 --> 01:41:08,407
New car, just paid off.

1175
01:41:09,631 --> 01:41:11,802
He parks and goes to work.

1176
01:41:14,142 --> 01:41:16,597
He's late for work,
but that's nothing new.

1177
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:19,606
But today, bad news:

1178
01:41:19,902 --> 01:41:21,396
he's fired.

1179
01:41:21,598 --> 01:41:23,606
Late once too often.

1180
01:41:24,926 --> 01:41:27,314
So then he has a big
fight with his boss.

1181
01:41:27,454 --> 01:41:30,487
They throw him out into the street

1182
01:41:30,717 --> 01:41:32,725
and his severance pay after him.

1183
01:41:35,326 --> 01:41:38,489
He picks up the envelope,
brushes himself off

1184
01:41:38,588 --> 01:41:41,077
and walks back to his car.

1185
01:41:41,566 --> 01:41:44,948
But instead of his brand-new car

1186
01:41:46,718 --> 01:41:51,387
there's a smashed,
fucked-up ghost of his car.

1187
01:41:51,741 --> 01:41:53,148
Smashed to fuckin' shit.

1188
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:57,977
Some fuckin' idiot has
turned his brand-new car

1189
01:41:58,492 --> 01:42:00,151
into a useless pile of shit.

1190
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:05,844
So he has a few drinks to calm
down, then takes a bus home.

1191
01:42:06,045 --> 01:42:09,787
At home, waiting for him, are
his wife and 16-year-old daughter.

1192
01:42:10,237 --> 01:42:14,742
They're both crying, and the wife
tells him they have a big problem.

1193
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:20,085
Then the daughter runs
off to her room, crying.

1194
01:42:20,284 --> 01:42:23,699
And the wife tells him that
his daughter, 16 and unmarried,

1195
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:25,210
is pregnant.

1196
01:42:25,404 --> 01:42:27,892
A beautiful girl too, his daughter.

1197
01:42:28,156 --> 01:42:32,825
You shut up! That's no way to talk
about our best friend's little daughter.

1198
01:42:32,988 --> 01:42:34,264
I didn't mean it like that!

1199
01:42:34,364 --> 01:42:38,226
I know what you meant,
you fuckin' slimy fungus!

1200
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:41,139
So, is that all?

1201
01:42:42,811 --> 01:42:44,502
No, that's not all.

1202
01:42:45,724 --> 01:42:48,823
He tells his wife that he's lost his job

1203
01:42:49,019 --> 01:42:51,027
and then about their car.

1204
01:42:51,835 --> 01:42:56,342
She becomes hysterical and
screams that she wants a divorce.

1205
01:42:57,627 --> 01:43:01,205
That he's no good as
a father or a husband.

1206
01:43:02,427 --> 01:43:04,882
And then she chases him from the house

1207
01:43:05,562 --> 01:43:07,385
with a big fuckin' butcher's knife.

1208
01:43:07,579 --> 01:43:08,506
A bread knife.

1209
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:09,843
A butcher's knife!

1210
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:11,798
He said it was a bread knife!

1211
01:43:12,027 --> 01:43:16,304
<i>- No, he made a point of saying it was
a butcher's knife! - OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.</i>

1212
01:43:16,410 --> 01:43:18,233
<i>OK.</i>

1213
01:44:00,281 --> 01:44:02,070
Things could have been worse.

1214
01:44:06,362 --> 01:44:08,183
What could possibly be worse than that?

1215
01:44:10,265 --> 01:44:13,134
Okay, Mr. Taxi Man.

1216
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:18,004
Whatever happened to you
that was worse than that?

1217
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:20,978
You want me to tell you?

1218
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:22,964
Yeah.

1219
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:26,481
Do you have any children?

1220
01:44:27,192 --> 01:44:28,207
I have a son.

1221
01:44:28,473 --> 01:44:29,520
I have a daughter.

1222
01:44:31,033 --> 01:44:34,196
I'm glad I have a son
and not a daughter.

1223
01:44:34,361 --> 01:44:36,629
You're an idiot. A
daughter is much better.

1224
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:39,927
That way you won't have a son
who'll grow up to be like you.

1225
01:44:41,048 --> 01:44:43,187
Even more important then, in your case.

1226
01:44:43,416 --> 01:44:45,750
- In your case, soon nothing
will be important! - Hey!

1227
01:44:45,944 --> 01:44:48,846
Knock it off!. Or you
idiots will have a long walk.

1228
01:44:56,055 --> 01:44:59,122
What about the terrible story
you were about to tell us?

1229
01:45:01,592 --> 01:45:02,802
I'm married.

1230
01:45:03,512 --> 01:45:05,105
That is terrible!

1231
01:45:05,303 --> 01:45:06,252
Big deal.

1232
01:45:06,392 --> 01:45:11,859
My wife and I both work hard. She
has a job, and I have two jobs.

1233
01:45:12,983 --> 01:45:15,504
We've been saving money because
we want to have a family.

1234
01:45:15,831 --> 01:45:17,904
A daughter or a son.

1235
01:45:19,319 --> 01:45:21,905
For a year we've
worked at having a baby.

1236
01:45:22,679 --> 01:45:24,817
Nice work if you can get it.

1237
01:45:25,111 --> 01:45:27,533
Shut up and let him finish.

1238
01:45:28,407 --> 01:45:30,708
Is that your wife?

1239
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:31,628
Yeah.

1240
01:45:32,983 --> 01:45:34,095
Eija.

1241
01:45:36,343 --> 01:45:39,856
Anyway, after a while
my wife became pregnant.

1242
01:45:40,631 --> 01:45:44,078
We were so happy. My wife's
belly got bigger and bigger.

1243
01:45:44,854 --> 01:45:47,756
Then, in the sixth month,
she started feeling strange

1244
01:45:48,246 --> 01:45:50,417
so I took her to the
hospital right away.

1245
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:53,714
Was she all right?

1246
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:57,397
Well, I took her to the hospital
and they took her inside.

1247
01:45:58,518 --> 01:46:01,235
I was worried, waiting
and waiting for hours.

1248
01:46:02,678 --> 01:46:04,500
Finally the doctor came and told me

1249
01:46:04,695 --> 01:46:06,637
that Eija had a baby.

1250
01:46:07,478 --> 01:46:12,115
She was all right, and the
baby, a little girl, was alive.

1251
01:46:13,141 --> 01:46:15,313
I was so happy I was about to explode.

1252
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:18,867
- A little daughter.
- Ya.

1253
01:46:20,437 --> 01:46:22,193
But the doctor looked worried.

1254
01:46:23,093 --> 01:46:25,297
He told me the baby was way too early.

1255
01:46:26,454 --> 01:46:29,999
So far she was okay, but
she was in an incubator.

1256
01:46:31,349 --> 01:46:32,559
And then he said

1257
01:46:34,069 --> 01:46:36,654
there was almost no
chance the baby would live.

1258
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:45,393
So what happened?

1259
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:51,789
The next day I brought my
wife home from the hospital,

1260
01:46:52,693 --> 01:46:55,180
but the baby stayed
there in the incubator.

1261
01:46:56,948 --> 01:46:58,377
You should have seen her though.

1262
01:46:59,861 --> 01:47:01,552
So tiny and perfect.

1263
01:47:02,261 --> 01:47:04,267
Tiny hands, tiny feet.

1264
01:47:06,068 --> 01:47:09,101
She was shaped like a little peanut.

1265
01:47:15,668 --> 01:47:18,002
But the doctor didn't give us much hope.

1266
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:22,031
He said she wouldn't
live more than a week,

1267
01:47:22,292 --> 01:47:23,819
our tiny daughter.

1268
01:47:25,108 --> 01:47:27,824
Eija was so scared that
she was about to go crazy.

1269
01:47:28,468 --> 01:47:29,874
So I made a big decision.

1270
01:47:30,868 --> 01:47:34,031
I decided that I wouldn't
love this tiny little child.

1271
01:47:35,156 --> 01:47:39,017
If she was going to die, I would
have to stay strong and distant.

1272
01:47:39,475 --> 01:47:43,152
I couldn't stand the
pain of losing this child.

1273
01:47:44,947 --> 01:47:47,848
So I decided to kill my love.

1274
01:47:56,179 --> 01:47:59,113
A week went by, and the baby lived.

1275
01:48:02,994 --> 01:48:06,572
Then another week went
by, and part of a third.

1276
01:48:07,986 --> 01:48:11,117
After three entire weeks
the child was still alive.

1277
01:48:11,795 --> 01:48:14,096
But the doctor was still very negative.

1278
01:48:14,739 --> 01:48:16,527
That started to make me angry.

1279
01:48:17,362 --> 01:48:19,632
I sat up all night in the kitchen

1280
01:48:20,146 --> 01:48:22,187
while my poor wife lay
awake in the bedroom.

1281
01:48:24,626 --> 01:48:27,309
And I sat there, just as
the dawn was about to break.

1282
01:48:28,530 --> 01:48:31,148
The light outside was
just like it is right now.

1283
01:48:32,562 --> 01:48:35,976
Then Eija came to me and
said I'd made a mistake.

1284
01:48:37,362 --> 01:48:38,790
I realized she was right.

1285
01:48:39,506 --> 01:48:42,888
If that baby was going to
make it, it needed all my love.

1286
01:48:43,634 --> 01:48:45,324
The strongest love possible.

1287
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:48,358
It was a relief.

1288
01:48:48,786 --> 01:48:55,725
I felt my love for that baby surge
through every pore of my worthless body.

1289
01:48:58,801 --> 01:49:01,289
I felt so happy and clear.

1290
01:49:02,448 --> 01:49:04,904
That little peanut was our child

1291
01:49:06,353 --> 01:49:08,524
and we cried out of happiness.

1292
01:49:09,488 --> 01:49:12,238
We tried to eat some
breakfast, but we couldn't.

1293
01:49:15,888 --> 01:49:17,611
Then we drove to the hospital.

1294
01:49:18,705 --> 01:49:22,316
We wanted that baby to feel
all the strength of our love.

1295
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,404
At the hospital

1296
01:49:27,504 --> 01:49:29,644
the doctor was right there to meet us.

1297
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:32,494
His face was very serious.

1298
01:49:33,328 --> 01:49:35,019
He took us aside.

1299
01:49:37,424 --> 01:49:40,140
And then he told us that
a short time earlier,

1300
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:41,930
just before sunrise,

1301
01:49:42,096 --> 01:49:43,590
the baby had died.

1302
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:48,075
Nothing could be done.
It was too late...

1303
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:10,279
Hey.

1304
01:50:10,384 --> 01:50:11,365
Don't worry.

1305
01:50:12,368 --> 01:50:15,564
You and your wife can make another baby.

1306
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:20,552
Maybe we can, sometime.

1307
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:26,054
Such a sad story.

1308
01:50:30,766 --> 01:50:32,653
You're a good guy, Mika.

1309
01:50:35,214 --> 01:50:36,807
Aki is so full of shit.

1310
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:42,151
His life isn't so terrible after all.

1311
01:50:42,446 --> 01:50:45,261
He fuckin' whines
about such trivial shit.

1312
01:50:45,358 --> 01:50:48,970
Some people have got real troubles.

1313
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:54,249
You're right, Mika.

1314
01:50:57,678 --> 01:50:59,533
You're a good man.

1315
01:51:03,309 --> 01:51:05,513
Hey.

1316
01:51:05,613 --> 01:51:07,043
We're almost home.

1317
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:12,132
Take the next right, then
a left. That's our street.

1318
01:51:13,293 --> 01:51:16,261
What about your friend? Is he okay now?

1319
01:51:16,717 --> 01:51:17,481
Fuck him.

1320
01:51:17,613 --> 01:51:18,823
Yeah, forget about him.

1321
01:51:18,957 --> 01:51:21,194
What about his wife, and the big knife?

1322
01:51:22,445 --> 01:51:24,006
What knife?

1323
01:51:24,974 --> 01:51:27,013
Oh, that. Fuck it.

1324
01:51:27,117 --> 01:51:32,202
He'll push his way into one of our
houses if he can't get into his own.

1325
01:51:33,293 --> 01:51:34,918
He's a leech anyway.

1326
01:52:39,179 --> 01:52:43,008
Don't worry. Everything
will be all right.

1327
01:52:43,851 --> 01:52:47,778
Yeah. And send greetings
to your wife, Eija.

1328
01:52:48,587 --> 01:52:50,561
Yeah, give her my best too.

1329
01:53:58,952 --> 01:54:01,025
Hey. Aki.

1330
01:54:01,608 --> 01:54:02,949
Wake up, Aki!

1331
01:54:07,144 --> 01:54:08,672
Who the fuck are you?

1332
01:54:10,568 --> 01:54:11,976
Where the fuck am I?

1333
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:15,397
You're in a fucking taxi,
near your fucking home

1334
01:54:15,528 --> 01:54:17,535
and you owe me the fucking fare.

1335
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:24,167
Yeah, I know. Nothin' for free.

1336
01:54:37,512 --> 01:54:38,373
Thanks.

1337
01:54:53,127 --> 01:54:54,371
You all right?

1338
01:54:58,183 --> 01:54:59,776
You know where you are?

1339
01:55:01,255 --> 01:55:02,182
Yeah.

1340
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:04,993
Helsinki.

1341
01:56:08,357 --> 01:56:09,535
Morning, Aki.

1342
01:56:10,437 --> 01:56:11,517
Morning.

1343
01:56:53,637 --> 01:56:56,320
<i># When I was a boy #</i>

1344
