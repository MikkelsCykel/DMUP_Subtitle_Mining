00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,526
Everywhere I see your faces...

2
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:23,982
Everywhere you sing
your smile and...

3
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,213
Every time you're not around...

4
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:32,089
It doesn't matter,
'Cause you're everywhere to me...

5
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:42,477
Everyone you've ever known...

6
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:44,206
Counts on you...

7
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:46,221
Waits for you...

8
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:47,950
To come through...

9
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,228
Don't you know...

10
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,247
That you're gonna
break through?

11
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,997
And everywhere
you came and left...

12
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:06,189
You came in the name
of love and...

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,734
Left a wake of happiness
and tenderness...

14
00:01:10,735 --> 00:01:15,340
And sweet conflict...

15
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,767
Sweet conflict...

16
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,588
You hang around...

17
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:27,980
You come on down...

18
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,869
You come on
down...

19
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,140
And it's on...

20
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:36,844
And on and on and on...

21
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:40,593
It's on...

22
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,077
It goes on...

23
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:48,172
You're everywhere...

24
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:51,852
Everywhere everywhere...

25
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:54,091
To me...

26
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:57,356
Everywhere everywhere...

27
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:59,180
Everywhere...

28
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,548
To me...

29
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,541
Calling...

30
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,923
Calling...

31
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:09,228
I'm calling your number...

32
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,571
Calling...

33
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,363
I'm calling your number...

34
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:14,059
Calling...

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,947
I'm calling your number...

36
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:19,595
Calling your number...

37
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:23,116
I'm calling your number...

38
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,620
Calling...

39
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,606
You're everywhere...

40
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:35,820
You're everywhere to me...

41
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,649
Everywhere to me...

42
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,938
Oops, sorry, Shaquan.

43
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,474
Again you go down.

44
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:45,323
Very easy for me.
That's very unfortunate.

45
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,882
Now got get me some Yoo-hoos
and some blunt wraps...

46
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,514
in honor of my victories.

47
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:51,477
I got next.

48
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,138
Nah, I don't play
no charity games.

49
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,594
What, are you afraid
of the Irish hand?

50
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,675
Look, dawg,

51
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:05,418
I don't play no octagons, all right?
There's no Geritols on the court.

52
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,918
50 bucks says
I'll kick your ass, salsa boy.

53
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,312
Let's go, fat man.

54
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:17,457
I'll even give you first serve.

55
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:23,274
Here comes the lightning.
Are you ready, boy?

56
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,131
Listen, you fat bitch,

57
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:26,635
don't call me boy.

58
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:28,714
It's very embarrassing.

59
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:30,731
You smell like moth balls.

60
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,561
- Serve it up.
- Bring it.

61
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:41,934
Serve it.

62
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,329
Come on, serve it.

63
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,121
That's what I'm doing.
You all right, pops?

64
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:57,641
Enough to kick your ass, Julio.

65
00:03:57,642 --> 00:04:00,746
Paco.
My name is Paco.

66
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,423
Whatever.

67
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:15,155
You all right, pops?
(echoing)

68
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:18,665
Want to take it easy
for a second?

69
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,790
Serve 'em up.

70
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,847
Pops, you all right?

71
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:33,678
Yeah.

72
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:37,287
Hey, come on, come on, pops.

73
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,924
Cut it out. Get up.

74
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,183
Hey, pops?

75
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:46,768
Yo, call 911.

76
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,906
Somebody call the 911.

77
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,633
(people chattering)

78
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:07,698
(kettle whistling)

79
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:13,449
He loved the game.

80
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm sure he's happy
he died on the court.

81
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:19,561
He never should have been
playing in this heat.

82
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:24,085
63 and 220 pounds...
he shouldn't have been playing at all.

83
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:28,200
(sighs)

84
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,343
[Man]: All right, quiet.

85
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:32,882
Come on, quiet.

86
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,895
All right, shut it!

87
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:40,849
Well, you'd better get out there
before your uncle breaks something.

88
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:44,360
[Man]: I'm gonna say something
about my brother.

89
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:46,951
John always talked about
having a wake like this, you know,

90
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:50,599
where family and friends came
and got stinking drunk...

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,703
and told stupid stories
about him.

92
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,070
I already talked
to a lot of you,

93
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:59,943
so the stupid part's
all taken care of, I guess.

94
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:03,639
But I loved my brother.

95
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:09,045
He- he was a lot of things
to a lot of people.

96
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:12,872
He was a husband...

97
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,239
to his beautiful Gracie.

98
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,895
He was a father...

99
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,847
to Henry and Cate.

100
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:22,181
He was a boss
in his own business.

101
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:25,605
He's probably raising a pint
right now...

102
00:06:25,606 --> 00:06:27,749
and challenging
the Lord Christ himself...

103
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,702
in that big handball court
in the sky.

104
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:32,453
[Man]:
Here here. Yeah.

105
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:34,405
To John.

106
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,741
[All]: To John.

107
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,309
Is there someplace
you and Henry and I can talk?

108
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,955
Oh, sure.

109
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:51,212
Hey.

110
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:01,222
[Woman]: Jesus, Colin.
Doesn't anybody knock?

111
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,085
Sorry, Sheila.

112
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:06,423
(toilet flushes)

113
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:13,925
Why are we in my room?

114
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:16,261
It's not important
where we are, Hank,

115
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:18,245
only that we're here together,

116
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,221
which leads me to
why we're here together.

117
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:22,821
You're the head
of this household now.

118
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:25,092
You are, Hank,

119
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,916
not me.

120
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:29,413
I can't be, because...

121
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:31,919
I'm the head
of another household...

122
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,300
my household.

123
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:37,765
I'm Charlie Doyle, Henry.

124
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,813
This is Charlie Doyle, Henry.

125
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:42,469
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

126
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,156
I am your father's attorney.

127
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:46,948
There are some important
decisions...

128
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,252
Mr. Doyle has some important things
he needs to talk to you about.

129
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,605
There's no easy way
to put this, Henry,

130
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,588
so I'm just going
to be blunt.

131
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:57,252
The family's broke.

132
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,460
In fact, it's worse than that.

133
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:01,477
There are substantial debts.

134
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,733
Yeah, well, I figured my dad wasn't
too good with money,

135
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,909
but he did have
a life insurance policy, right?

136
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,853
Your father's life insurance company
expressly warned him...

137
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:13,156
about participating
in certain activities...

138
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,011
such as handball,

139
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:18,020
which they considered
a health risk.

140
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,451
He wasn't covered.

141
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:22,403
So there's no insurance money?

142
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:24,451
I'm afraid not.

143
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:25,571
Sorry.

144
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,099
What about the business?

145
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,435
Your father was the business.
There are no assets there.

146
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:35,076
Are you going to work?

147
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:37,155
I switched shifts
so I could be at the funeral.

148
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:40,109
(sighs)

149
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,707
Look,

150
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:48,142
at least the old man
went down swinging.

151
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:51,427
That's great, Uncle Colin.

152
00:08:51,428 --> 00:08:53,770
I'm real proud.

153
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,890
Uh, Dean Swift.

154
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,227
Oh, hello, Henry.

155
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,403
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

156
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:19,777
Thank you.

157
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:21,281
You know what?
I can come back.

158
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:24,420
Actually, I could use your help.
Come come.

159
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,491
I just have to fix this one model
for Miss Abel's class.

160
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,306
Can you hold the vagina
in place here...

161
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:33,187
Sure. I can do that.

162
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:36,291
...while I put the bladder in?

163
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:37,507
There you go.

164
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:39,555
Sorry to see you leave, Henry.

165
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:41,731
Your scores were beginning
to improve.

166
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,458
Well, it should just be
temporary.

167
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,410
Can you pass me the rectum?

168
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:48,298
(whispers)
The rectum.

169
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,259
Thank you.

170
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,788
Henry, this is an ovary.

171
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,507
You should be able to recognize
a rectum by now.

172
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,170
You're better than that.

173
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,775
You're right.

174
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,601
Is this it?

175
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,001
Mm-hmm, yes.
That's a rectum.

176
00:10:08,002 --> 00:10:11,488
I want to complete my coursework
as soon as possible.

177
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,536
I just really need to make
some money right now.

178
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,233
I understand, Henry.

179
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,569
You have two years to make up
the remaining classes.

180
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,713
I hope to do it
as soon as I can.

181
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:23,562
Do you see the testicular
self-examination model?

182
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,827
Oh.

183
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,769
You take care
of yourself, Henry.

184
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,177
- Thank you.
- We'll all be pulling for you.

185
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:27,296
I can help you?

186
00:11:27,297 --> 00:11:28,608
I'm here to see George.

187
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,733
Okay.

188
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,567
The name?

189
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:40,736
Uh, George...

190
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:42,143
George...

191
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:44,353
No, buddy, not his name.

192
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,560
I know his name.
He's writing my paycheck.

193
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,840
Your name.

194
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,440
Sorry. Henry O'Shea.

195
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,960
Mr. George, there's a Henry O'Shea
in the lobby.

196
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,592
I'll be right there.

197
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

198
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:57,631
He's coming.

199
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:59,722
Great.

200
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,883
You like working here?

201
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,040
(elevator dings)

202
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:20,928
O'Shea?

203
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,272
Yeah.

204
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,094
Yeah, hi. What?

205
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:26,046
- What?
- What are you looking at?

206
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:27,790
Nothing.

207
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,958
- I'm Henry.
- Yeah, George.

208
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,596
Come on, we'll take this
down to my office.

209
00:12:36,703 --> 00:12:40,255
The first thing you need to know is
you never go through that front door.

210
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:42,687
The only time you're in the front
is when you're in uniform.

211
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:45,247
- You got it?
- Got it.

212
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:47,198
Got it?

213
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,912
Look, kid, your Uncle Colin and I...
we go way back.

214
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:53,278
I'm doing him a solid
giving you a job.

215
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,782
Okay, thank you, sir.

216
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:57,629
No no no, you save the "sir" crap
for the tenants, all right?

217
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,030
Me- my name's George.
That's what you call me.

218
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,981
I know I look like a fighter,

219
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,190
but I'm a real pussycat.
Ask anybody.

220
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:07,101
Go ahead, sit down.

221
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:09,086
Yeah, just put that on the floor.

222
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:13,855
So what makes you think
you're doorman material?

223
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,742
Uh...

224
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:17,950
You Uncle Colin said that you
wanted to be a nurse...

225
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,886
- but you couldn't hack it, right?
- No, not exactly.

226
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:24,158
Look, I don't give a horse's tit
about your past.

227
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:26,973
Billy Donovan was a fruit.
He worked here for 15 years.

228
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,605
You know, your past
is your past.

229
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:30,333
Your Uncle Colin says
you're a good kid,

230
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,350
so you're a good kid
until you prove otherwise.

231
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:34,141
Okay, good, but...

232
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,062
Save it for the shrink.

233
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,599
Let's go over the rules.

234
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,854
The most important rule,
the golden rule is...

235
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,511
you want to guess?

236
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:46,782
Uh...

237
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,893
treat other people
like you want to be treated?

238
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,012
Wrong. Dead wrong.

239
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:51,964
The most important rule is...

240
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,588
you never ever let somebody
in the building...

241
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,021
- they're not supposed to be in.
- Okay. Of course.

242
00:13:57,022 --> 00:13:59,516
Don't say, "of course". If it was
of course, you'd get it right, right?

243
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:02,684
Everybody- they think
being a doorman is easy.

244
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:05,373
It's not so easy.
The devil’s in the details, kid.

245
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:07,773
You know, you gotta learn
how to put out packages,

246
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,685
learn people's names,
you know?

247
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:13,149
And what's the most
important thing?

248
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,669
Don't let other people in
that aren't supposed to get in.

249
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,917
Yeah, good.
Don't forget that.

250
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:20,412
No eating or sleeping
in the lobby.

251
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,460
Don't fraternize
with the residents.

252
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,285
They got better things to do
than talk to you.

253
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,557
You keep it short, businesslike.
You want to write this down?

254
00:14:26,558 --> 00:14:28,764
No, I'll remember.

255
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,364
Well, if you don't, you're out.

256
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:33,181
All right, tomorrow, 10:30 PM.

257
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,038
You'll talk to Raul.
He'll show you around.

258
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,693
And don't pick up
any of his bad habits.

259
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,196
- All right.
- Let's go.

260
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,539
(knocks on door)

261
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:48,476
[Mother]: with me
about every detail.

262
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,947
[Daughter]: I'm not arguing.

263
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,988
Scarlett, I don't understand
why you're being so ungrateful about this.

264
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:56,251
Because it's just not that big a deal.
It's a birthday party.

265
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:57,883
It's your birthday.

266
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,675
And it was a big for me
when I had you.

267
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:02,492
You were large and painful.
And since I happen to be financing...

268
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,315
this particular birthday party,

269
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:05,852
it's my simple wish...

270
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,124
that no hobos be allowed.

271
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,452
White shirts, two,
a little starch.

272
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,203
Afternoon, Mrs. Dowling,
Scarlett.

273
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,563
This is Hank.
Hank's the new doorman.

274
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:18,811
Hi, I'm Henry.

275
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:21,275
Welcome to the building, Hank.

276
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:23,163
George, you did get my message
about the caterer?

277
00:15:23,164 --> 00:15:26,107
Yes, ma'am, sure did.
All taken care of, Mrs. D.

278
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,227
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

279
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:28,892
Can I get those?

280
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:31,202
No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

281
00:15:32,285 --> 00:15:33,884
Go ahead.

282
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:36,156
[Mrs. Dowling]: There are plenty
of people on the list...

283
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:38,108
- Okay, floor, please?
- Penthouse.

284
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,811
[Mrs. Dowling]: All right,
we'll discuss it later.

285
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,858
(jazz music playing)

286
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,778
(phone ringing)

287
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,475
Hello.

288
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,566
Honey, it's Gretchen.

289
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:11,418
Should I just leave these here?

290
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:15,130
Take them all to Scarlett's room-
down the hall, the last door at the end.

291
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,222
And this is for you, Harry.

292
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,320
Thank you.

293
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,362
See anything you like?

294
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,153
Oh, hey.

295
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:06,201
Your mom told me to put
your bags in here.

296
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,025
And snoop through my stuff?

297
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,225
No no, I wasn't snooping.

298
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:14,790
No? 'Cause it looked
a little like snooping.

299
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,334
I should probably go.

300
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,745
Nice to meet you.

301
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:24,729
"Classy ladies...

302
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,545
make 5000 dollars a week
without leaving your house.

303
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,720
No experience necessary".

304
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,417
I don't think you want
that one.

305
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,728
Why not?

306
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:34,819
'Cause they're looking
for hookers.

307
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,559
Oh.

308
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,312
Are you sure?
Because it sounds pretty good.

309
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:41,815
Yeah, I'm sure.

310
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:45,240
Look, maybe I could get you a shift
walking dogs,

311
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,737
but it's not exactly
a walk in the park.

312
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:49,080
Isn't it?

313
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,384
The fact that you think that
makes me know that you are not ready.

314
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,241
"Cashier...
good starting pay.

315
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,417
No experience necessary".
How hard could that be?

316
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,911
Yeah, you know what?
Call them.

317
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,416
And don't let them
jerk you around.

318
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:03,330
You've got to be ready
to play hardball, eh?

319
00:18:04,185 --> 00:18:06,136
- (mumbling)
- (laughs)

320
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,600
You got a real knack
making oriental food.

321
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:09,785
Ha ha ha.

322
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,983
Wow, I'm gonna have a job.

323
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:15,511
I haven't had one
in 20 years.

324
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,264
They're gonna love you, Ma.
It's gonna be great.

325
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,664
Just don't tell your brother.
I don't want to argue with him.

326
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:23,161
I won't say anything.

327
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:25,080
Won't say anything about what?

328
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:26,296
What? Hey, how's school?

329
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,801
Great.
Won't say anything about what?

330
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,663
- I'm getting a job.
- She's getting a job.

331
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:35,062
No, you're not.

332
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:36,470
You listen to me.

333
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:38,615
I'm your mother.

334
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,855
And you can't tell me
what I can't do.

335
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:43,479
I'm not gonna just roll over
and give up my house...

336
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,752
that I lived in for 15 years.

337
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,671
We need money
and I'm getting a job.

338
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:50,744
No one's giving up
the house, Ma.

339
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:53,047
I left today

340
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,998
and Uncle Colin got me a job
as a doorman.

341
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:58,167
So you don't have to
go to work.

342
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:01,917
You quit
to take care of me?

343
00:19:03,095 --> 00:19:05,911
I took a leave of absence.

344
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:10,070
You precious angel.

345
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:12,056
You're gonna be a doorman?

346
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,751
What the hell is wrong
with being a doorman?

347
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,607
You're gonna be able
to tell me pretty soon.

348
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,965
Have a nice evening,
Miss Janet, okay?

349
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:33,248
Hey, you, come here.

350
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:36,630
You must be the new kid.

351
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,164
Yeah, Henry O'Shea.

352
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,567
Raul.
You're on with me tonight.

353
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,197
Go get changed.

354
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:44,951
The locker room's on B1...
down the stairs, make a right.

355
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:47,261
Hurry up.

356
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:54,367
(man snoring loudly)

357
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:12,917
(coughs, exclaims)

358
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:14,422
What the hell are you doing?

359
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:15,798
I'm Henry.
I'm the new doorman.

360
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,303
- What's going on?
- I was sleeping.

361
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,677
This guy was touching me.

362
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:20,917
- Touching you?
- No, I wasn't touching him.

363
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,549
Was he touching you?

364
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,500
Okay, yes, I was touching him,

365
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,323
but I thought something was wrong
with his breathing.

366
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,117
I was listening to his chest.
I was on my way to get my uniform.

367
00:20:28,118 --> 00:20:30,228
What's wrong with my chest?

368
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,636
Francisco, settle down, okay?

369
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,140
Look, buddy, I'm not gay.

370
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:35,380
Oh, who said anything
about being gay?

371
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,101
He said I was touching him.
I'm studying to be a nurse.

372
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:40,437
And you're not gay?

373
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:42,484
Look, Dr. Kildare,
you're not working here.

374
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,437
You're not on call, okay?

375
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,837
If anything is wrong with him,
you let him die.

376
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:49,717
Now get a uniform,
get dressed,

377
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,093
and no touching.

378
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:53,044
Don't touch anybody
that works here.

379
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,508
Don't touch anybody who lives here.
You got it?

380
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,269
Right.

381
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,219
What's wrong with me?

382
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,324
You've got obstructed breathing.

383
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:06,075
What's destructive breathing?

384
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,895
Forget it.

385
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:13,085
Do we really have to
wear the hat?

386
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,187
Nice fit.

387
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,339
Thanks.

388
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,619
It's hot, right?

389
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,835
Yeah.

390
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,499
That's 'cause it's made of wool...

391
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,188
one uniform for summer,
winter, spring and fall.

392
00:21:35,189 --> 00:21:37,299
You ain't gonna find
no air conditioning nowhere...

393
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,443
that's gonna stop you
from sweating your nuts off.

394
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,523
Terrific.

395
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:43,188
You see Francisco downstairs?

396
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:46,291
Oh, yeah.
We had a nice conversation.

397
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,507
Yeah?

398
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,427
That's weird.

399
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:51,475
He's usually asleep.

400
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,427
Why didn't you eat early
when you had time?

401
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,763
Look, I couldn't
because I was waiting for you.

402
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:58,450
- Oh, waiting for me.
- Did you pack the Blackberry charger?

403
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,075
Yes, I packed the Blackberry charger.
How many times are you gonna ask me?

404
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,188
As many times as it takes
to know you did it, Debbie.

405
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,108
Don't Debbie me.

406
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:06,643
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. Silverman.

407
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,275
Hey, Bobby.
This is our new doorman Henry.

408
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:09,715
Hello, Henry.

409
00:22:09,716 --> 00:22:12,019
- Pleased to meet you, Henry.
- Nice to meet you too, sir.

410
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,034
Here, take Hercules.

411
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:18,385
I need to take my Klonopin
before we leave for this nightmare...

412
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:21,307
I mean, our romantic
anniversary getaway.

413
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:28,819
The car's ready, Mr. Silverman.

414
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,514
Thank you, Raul.

415
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,307
We'll be back on Sunday.

416
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,802
If you can't get us on the cell,
you know you can always email.

417
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:37,938
Your father doesn't even have
a bowel movement without his Blackberry.

418
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,762
No parties, Bobby.

419
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:41,491
I'm not gonna have
any parties.

420
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:43,314
You listen to your father.

421
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:45,873
I love you, sweetie.

422
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,667
Me too, Mom.

423
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,009
(snaps fingers)

424
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:55,314
Keep an eye on him, okay, Henry?

425
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:57,952
I will, sir.
Thank you very much.

426
00:23:18,546 --> 00:23:22,577
You hungry, man? I'm starving.
Let's get something to eat.

427
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,977
I thought we weren't
supposed to eat up here.

428
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:28,128
We ain't supposed to be seen eating.
That don't mean we gotta starve.

429
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,657
- Yeah, Mo's.
- Yeah, what's happening?

430
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:35,217
Let me get- hold on one second.
What you want on it?

431
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:38,385
It's my first night.
I'm all right.

432
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:39,793
Sausage, pepperoni... what?

433
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:42,288
Sure.

434
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:45,905
Let me get a large half-pepperoni
half-sausage.

435
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:47,985
1500 Fifth Avenue.

436
00:23:47,986 --> 00:23:50,161
- [Man]: Raul?
- Yeah, what's up? It's Raul.

437
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,338
I'm just chilling.
You know what's happening.

438
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:56,088
- Be about 20 or 30 minutes.
- Mm-hmm, okay, thanks. For sure.

439
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:00,151
30 minutes or less.

440
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,752
Nurses' School, huh?

441
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:06,672
I guess that's cool.

442
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:08,496
You don't want to be
no doctor?

443
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,513
You know how much it costs
to go to med school?

444
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:13,487
- No.
- More than I got. Crazy money.

445
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:16,823
And I didn't have the scores
for a scholarship.

446
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:23,217
I'm gonna take off, buddy.

447
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:25,233
What do you mean, take off?

448
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,368
You don't need me here, man.
You got this job down pat.

449
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,896
Somebody comes-
open the door, let them in.

450
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:34,160
I mean, the night shift is dead.
It's easy.

451
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,920
It's easier
than being a nurse, right?

452
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,263
What if George comes?

453
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:38,672
George is asleep.

454
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:42,447
And if he do come, just cover for me.
Tell him I went to get some coffee.

455
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,566
Good looking, my brother.

456
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,551
Hey.

457
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:24,366
He's kind of cute.

458
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,710
A doorman.

459
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:43,007
(door buzzes)

460
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:52,239
- What's up?
- Hi, can I help you, ladies?

461
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
Yeah, we're here to see Roberto, 8B.
We're his cousins.

462
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,573
Uh, okay.

463
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:01,308
Hang on one second.

464
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:03,661
You said 8...

465
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,614
Yeah.

466
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:08,054
There.

467
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,371
One second.

468
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,621
- Bobby?
- Buenas noches.

469
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,933
Bobby, is that you?

470
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:25,421
[Bobby]: Bobby is not here.
Yo estoy Roberto.

471
00:26:25,422 --> 00:26:28,942
Okay, Roberto, your cousins
are here to see you.

472
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:31,341
I'm sorry, what did you say
your names were?

473
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:34,318
Mercedes and Portia.

474
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,557
Mercedes
and Portia.

475
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,470
[Bobby]: Ah, yes,
cousin Mercedes.

476
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:41,813
Send them up, por favor.

477
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:44,590
You said you were his cousins?

478
00:26:44,591 --> 00:26:46,542
Yeah, distant cousins,

479
00:26:46,543 --> 00:26:49,331
removed a couple times.

480
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:54,062
Are you gonna let us go up
or what, baby?

481
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:57,179
Okay, go see your cousin.

482
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:08,980
I'm gonna regret that.

483
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:26,450
(knocks on door)

484
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:32,108
Sorry, didn't see you there.

485
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,332
Don't apologize.
Help me.

486
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,596
- Thanks.
- Sure.

487
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,549
- Henry, right?
- Yeah.

488
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,499
Scarlett, stop flirting
with the doorman...

489
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,451
and take Buck.

490
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:54,636
I want to go home.

491
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:56,938
Did somebody have a little
too much to drink?

492
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:58,890
Fuck you.

493
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:01,682
I had exactly the right amount.

494
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:10,155
Wow, he can puke
and be an asshole all at the same time.

495
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:12,107
I think I'm gonna be sick.

496
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,980
No, sweetie, I'm sure
you won't embarrass yourself.

497
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:19,413
Thanks, Gretch.
I'll take it from here.

498
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,539
- Isn't he precious?
- Yeah.

499
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,618
I'm gonna go.

500
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:29,931
Call you tomorrow.

501
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:31,659
[Buck]: Later, hot stuff.

502
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,772
Eat me.

503
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:36,043
Don't worry, I'll clean that up.

504
00:28:36,044 --> 00:28:40,172
I'm gonna let you
clean up my boyfriend's puke.

505
00:28:40,173 --> 00:28:42,315
He can clean up.
He's a doorman.

506
00:28:42,316 --> 00:28:45,912
Buck, stop being such a jerk.

507
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:50,922
Listen, don't worry about it.
I clean up puke all the time...

508
00:28:50,923 --> 00:28:52,873
at school.

509
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:54,826
I was studying to be a n...

510
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:57,258
don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

511
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:59,241
You're really sweet.

512
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:01,195
Thank you.

513
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,411
I owe you one.

514
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:05,865
Oh, fruit juice. Give him
some fruit juice and some aspirin.

515
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:07,754
It'll help his hangover.

516
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:09,514
Okay.

517
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:11,858
Great, thanks.

518
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:45,577
The night shift is dead, my ass.

519
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:48,312
(knocks)

520
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:57,353
Have you seen a couple of hos
come in here five seconds ago?

521
00:29:57,354 --> 00:29:59,369
Sir, if I could please ask you
to wait outside...

522
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,537
Man, ring up the apartment
and tell them I'm here right this second,

523
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:04,553
or you'll need a tourniquet
where your dick used to be...

524
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,434
and a feeding tube
where your mouth used to be. Feel me?

525
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:10,793
Okay. Okay.

526
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:13,561
Just give me one second.

527
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,672
- Bobby.
- Buenas noches.

528
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:20,776
Bobby, you send those girls
back down here immediately.

529
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,497
Do it now
or I will tell your father everything.

530
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:26,921
[Bobby]: Fine, I'm coming.

531
00:30:26,922 --> 00:30:29,225
He's coming. If I could just
have you wait outside...

532
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,529
No no, if they ain't
down here soon,

533
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,481
I'm going up.

534
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:36,118
Okay, you can just
stay there.

535
00:30:48,201 --> 00:30:50,150
You Roberto?
Who got my money?

536
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:54,376
I don't have it. I thought
I could use a credit card.

537
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:56,777
Could I borrow a few bucks?

538
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:58,664
How much?

539
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:00,840
- 200 dollars.
- 200 dollars for...?

540
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:02,703
I'll totally pay you back.

541
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,038
200 dollars. Here.

542
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:14,503
Still short, man.
I want my money.

543
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:18,100
Look, there's 196 there. Are you
gonna hurt this kid over four bucks?

544
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,996
It's your lucky day, Roberto.

545
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:32,904
Are you nuts?

546
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:36,230
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back with interest.
Just don't tell my folks.

547
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:39,175
Don't tell... you...
go to bed.

548
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,678
You're gonna tell,
aren't you?

549
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,759
No, I'm gonna finish
mopping up this puke...

550
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,126
and you're gonna pay me back
tomorrow, okay?

551
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:48,006
I don't live on Fifth Avenue.
200 dollars is a lot of money to me.

552
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,878
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I owe you one.

553
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:52,423
You owe me 2 hundred and one.

554
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:55,213
Go to bed
before I change my mind.

555
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:19,912
Hey, George.
I was just adjusting my back.

556
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:21,767
Balls. You were sleeping.

557
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:24,359
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Kid, you can't sleep in the lobby.

558
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,823
You gotta get used
to the night shift.

559
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:28,647
Don't let it happen again.

560
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:30,421
All right.

561
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:33,669
Where is Raul?

562
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,070
He's here.

563
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:37,253
Where?

564
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:38,469
He was here.

565
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,684
Where?

566
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:41,605
Hey, I was just out getting coffee.
You want one?

567
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:44,111
No.

568
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:49,541
- This one's on me.
- Thanks. How did you-?

569
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,526
Look, man, I've been working here
for eight years.

570
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:52,966
I pick up on habits.

571
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:56,117
That man right there... George...
he's a creature of habit.

572
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,197
Ugh, what is that?

573
00:33:00,198 --> 00:33:01,509
Aged coffee.

574
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:05,041
I keep it hid outside
behind the bushes.

575
00:33:05,606 --> 00:33:08,965
Hey, partner.
Right on time, baby.

576
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:11,471
Yo, what's up?

577
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:06,642
(distant dogs barking)

578
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:18,597
[Caitlin]: Stella.

579
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,357
What?

580
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:22,884
[Caitlin]: Stella, shut up.

581
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:26,211
Don't look at me like that.
I know damn well you started it.

582
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:29,091
Here.

583
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,953
Get over yourself.

584
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:35,780
What's with the dogs, Cate?

585
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:39,172
They're normally really well-behaved,
but Stella can be a little bitch.

586
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:41,251
- No, I mean, why are they here?
- Oh, that?

587
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:44,195
I'm making some extra cash
doing overnight boarding.

588
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:46,371
So we're running a kennel now?

589
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:49,139
Mom is fine with it
as long as they keep quiet.

590
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:51,396
They're not quiet.

591
00:34:51,397 --> 00:34:53,635
By dog standards,
they are church mice.

592
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,370
Forget it. You don't know
anything about dogs.

593
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,121
Okay, where's Ma?

594
00:35:00,004 --> 00:35:02,705
I think she got a job.

595
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:06,506
Great.

596
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:12,145
So sensitive, that one.

597
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:28,994
Welcome back.

598
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:30,146
Thanks.

599
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:32,752
You have here
a letter or something.

600
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:37,034
One night, and he has
a secret admirer.

601
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,178
That's it for me.

602
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,515
I have sucked enough ass
for one day.

603
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:46,466
Have a good night, Henry.

604
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,329
All right, you too.

605
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:59,212
(door buzzes)

606
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:04,578
...jealous of the fact
that I can sing better than you.

607
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,818
I can sing better than you
and that's why you don't like it.

608
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:09,090
Okay, let me tell you something...

609
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:12,450
it's "heartache tonight,"
not "party tonight".

610
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:13,762
It's not a happy song, Ray.

611
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:15,873
[Ray]: Why can't you just admit
when you don't know something...

612
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,600
except talking
out of your hoop. Why?

613
00:36:17,601 --> 00:36:19,361
Ring! Hello, clue phone.
It's for you.

614
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:21,313
It's The Eagles calling to say
you're an idiot.

615
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:24,161
Oh, like The Eagles would call you,
Mr. Wrapped-Up-Like-A-Douche.

616
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:26,432
Oh, please, everyone thinks
it's "douche" at nine years old.

617
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,576
[Ray]: I think you're a douche.
Can you help us?

618
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,689
- Do you know that song...?
- Let it go, Ray.

619
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,761
I'll buy you the CD
for Rosh Hashanah.

620
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:36,449
Oh, no. Your dog.

621
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,114
- No, it's The Eagles.
- No no no, your dog...

622
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,353
is going up in the elevator
with the leash.

623
00:36:40,354 --> 00:36:43,372
- Oh my God, Cassius.
- Oh my God.

624
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:47,168
Oh my God.

625
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,088
[Jason]: Cassius.

626
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:51,903
[Ray]: He's not making noise.

627
00:36:51,904 --> 00:36:55,073
[Jason]: Cassius,
everything's gonna be fine. Breathe.

628
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:57,954
This is all your fault. If you weren't
so in love with Glenn Frey...

629
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,617
[Ray]: Oh, shut up.
Shut up.

630
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,634
I'm sure he'll be fine.

631
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,944
(elevator dings)

632
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:08,033
Oh my God.

633
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:12,127
He's dead.
Oh my God, he's dead.

634
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:13,887
You killed him.

635
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:16,927
- What is he doing?
- I think he's reviving him.

636
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:19,007
Hang in there, Cassius.
Hang in, baby.

637
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:21,055
Hang in.
Don't go in the light.

638
00:37:21,056 --> 00:37:23,455
Don't go in the light.

639
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:26,657
[Jason]: What's he...?
What's he?

640
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:29,185
[Ray]: He's CPRing him.
Are you blind?

641
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:31,974
Oh, Cassius.

642
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,744
- Oh, Cassius.
- Oh, look at that.

643
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:42,399
Cassius, baby boy.

644
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,128
Baby boy.

645
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:46,112
Oh, my little angel.

646
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:47,711
You scared me.

647
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,343
Hey. Hi.

648
00:37:49,344 --> 00:37:50,815
I am so sorry.

649
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,224
No, I'm sorry.

650
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:53,537
No, I'm sorry.

651
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,552
And you, mister...

652
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:57,247
who's amazing?
You are.

653
00:37:57,248 --> 00:38:00,128
Thank you so much.
I don't know how we can ever repay you.

654
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:02,081
Don't worry.
I'm just doing my job, sort of.

655
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:04,224
- Come here.
- You don't need to...

656
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:06,239
Thank you so much.

657
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,192
On the mouth?

658
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:10,014
You just grossed him out.

659
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:12,618
- I was thanking him.
- Pick up that leash.

660
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:15,614
Hi, Scarlett.

661
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:18,943
Wow, I've never seen anyone
do that before.

662
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:21,376
Yeah, that was my first time
with a dog.

663
00:38:21,377 --> 00:38:23,167
That didn't sound right.

664
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:25,935
No, it didn't.

665
00:38:30,943 --> 00:38:32,095
What was that?

666
00:38:32,096 --> 00:38:33,640
What?

667
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,662
What did I tell you about getting
too personal with the residents?

668
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:40,767
It wasn't a resident, sir.
It was a dog. And he was gonna die.

669
00:38:40,768 --> 00:38:43,006
Not the dog, wise guy.
Miss Dowling.

670
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,261
Oh.

671
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,613
You don't listen
too good, do you?

672
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,822
What are you standing for?
Get to your station.

673
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:56,165
(elevator dings)

674
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:03,486
I didn't know you could
do that to a dog.

675
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:06,276
Yeah, right, 'cause you're always...

676
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:12,669
Yeah, like I was saying, you know,
I've been trying to do my thing.

677
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,805
- (door buzzes)
- Flowers for Scarlett Dowling.

678
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:17,277
I'll take those up.

679
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:20,526
Sorry, tenant's not home.
I'll sign for them.

680
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:29,388
(classical music playing)

681
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:34,140
(doorbell rings)

682
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,451
Someone get that.

683
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:39,811
[Mrs. Dowling]:
Could you get that?

684
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:44,970
(quietly) Nothing would give me
more pleasure.

685
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:54,846
Oh, hello.
Thank you so much.

686
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:56,093
Who is it, dear?

687
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,300
Flowers, darling.

688
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:00,669
Don't forget the tip.

689
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,620
Could you...?

690
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:05,029
Getting him a tip.

691
00:40:11,324 --> 00:40:13,564
Those for me?

692
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:14,941
Yeah, I think so.

693
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:17,480
Right this way, please.

694
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,212
I think they're
from your friend Buck.

695
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:22,589
[Scarlett]: Yeah, I figured.

696
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,892
All done and dusted.

697
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:27,497
You can just move
some of that crap away.

698
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:36,069
Your room is great.

699
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,867
Isn't it?

700
00:40:39,868 --> 00:40:41,628
I wish it didn't
make me so sick.

701
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:43,485
Why? What's wrong with it?

702
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:46,732
I didn't decorate it.

703
00:40:47,613 --> 00:40:50,621
Mother.

704
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:53,820
You have a little
orange something on your nose.

705
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:55,228
Orange stuff?

706
00:40:55,229 --> 00:40:57,883
Yeah, it's like powder
or something.

707
00:40:57,884 --> 00:40:59,035
There you go.

708
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:01,211
Thanks.

709
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:03,515
Okay.

710
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:05,531
Henry.

711
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:07,387
Yeah?

712
00:41:07,388 --> 00:41:09,468
How did you know how
to save that dog last night?

713
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,803
What, are you like a vet
or something?

714
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:13,756
Oh, no, I was never
in the military.

715
00:41:13,757 --> 00:41:15,900
(laughs)

716
00:41:15,901 --> 00:41:18,235
I'm a nurse.
I'm almost a nurse.

717
00:41:18,236 --> 00:41:21,628
So you're almost
a nurse-slash-doorman?

718
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:24,091
Yeah. Well, I'm still in school.

719
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,970
- Oh.
- I had to take some time off...

720
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,339
to help... we... my...

721
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,348
Hey, there you are.

722
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:34,811
Buck, don't you have a phone?

723
00:41:34,812 --> 00:41:36,569
Nice flowers, man.

724
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,401
Yeah.
I'm glad you approve.

725
00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:45,340
What? Don't tell me
you're mad about last night.

726
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:48,155
I think those cocktail olives
were bad,

727
00:41:48,156 --> 00:41:50,107
'cause I didn't have
that much to drink.

728
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,570
They're lucky I don't sue.
Listen, I'm gonna make a drink,

729
00:41:52,571 --> 00:41:54,809
and you change,
put something nice on...

730
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,337
- and we'll go.
- Okay, you go do that.

731
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:58,948
Bye.

732
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:11,130
Hey, Grace, looking good.

733
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:15,707
I got your green tea
chai latte.

734
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,458
I took the liberty
of putting in...

735
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:19,706
a phytonutrient tablet.

736
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,881
It's got some powerful
antioxidants...

737
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:23,705
to give you a boost.

738
00:42:23,706 --> 00:42:25,881
Well, that's very sweet.
Thank you, Laszlo.

739
00:42:25,882 --> 00:42:28,138
Are you happy?

740
00:42:29,274 --> 00:42:31,802
Very happy.
This chair is really comfortable.

741
00:42:31,803 --> 00:42:34,138
It's one of our best sellers,
comes with a how-to video

742
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:36,570
that's amazing.

743
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:39,673
Well, I'm glad
that you're happy.

744
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:42,714
'Cause if you're happy,
the workplace is happy,

745
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:44,825
the customers are happy,
and then I'm happy.

746
00:42:44,826 --> 00:42:49,081
I'm a people person.
At least I try very hard to be.

747
00:42:49,082 --> 00:42:51,225
Well, I love people.

748
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:53,176
And I really like
working here already.

749
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:54,297
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

750
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:56,248
Well, jeez, I love to hear that.

751
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:58,968
And you're doing
a great job.

752
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:00,088
Keep it up.

753
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,241
Okay, you too.

754
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:03,194
I do.

755
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:06,009
All right.

756
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,858
Thank you for my, uh, phyto...

757
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:35,129
The last time we were in Japan
was in '95 and I...

758
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,009
No no, that was Hong Kong.
We were in Japan in '98.

759
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,417
Absolutely.

760
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:42,403
- We were in Hong Kong?
- Yes.

761
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:46,687
(groans)

762
00:43:53,272 --> 00:43:56,440
We were invited to see
a Japanese production of "Cats,"

763
00:43:56,441 --> 00:44:00,256
which, let me tell you,
was better than the original.

764
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,607
Can we go in, please?

765
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:10,935
- Dude, you killed it.
- Did I? Sorry, buddy.

766
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:13,847
Hey, thanks for doing your job.
I appreciate it.

767
00:44:13,848 --> 00:44:16,375
- Sorry about that, guys.
- Whatever.

768
00:44:16,376 --> 00:44:18,936
We went swimming in a lake
and I don't know if you know...

769
00:44:18,937 --> 00:44:21,080
that these little fish...
I forgot the name of them,

770
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,711
but when you urinate
in water...

771
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:24,727
they fly up the stream
the other way.

772
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,063
- Hello, Mrs. Dowling.
- Hi, Buck.

773
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,305
- How are you?
- Thank you for coming.

774
00:44:29,306 --> 00:44:30,936
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

775
00:44:30,937 --> 00:44:32,599
- Hey, you look great.
- Oh, thank you.

776
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,724
- I mean that.
- Thank you.

777
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,495
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

778
00:44:37,496 --> 00:44:40,099
- "You look great, I mean that"?
- I did mean that.

779
00:44:41,976 --> 00:44:44,726
Your boyfriend's already
completely loaded.

780
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:46,647
Welcome to my life.

781
00:44:46,648 --> 00:44:48,439
I don't know
why I put up with it.

782
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,375
Because good-looking and rich
is rare commodity.

783
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:55,031
God, I'm not that shallow, am I?

784
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:57,046
No, of course not.

785
00:44:57,047 --> 00:44:59,382
A helicopter to the Hamptons
every weekend...

786
00:44:59,383 --> 00:45:01,687
doesn't necessarily mean
you're shallow.

787
00:45:01,688 --> 00:45:03,894
- No.
- I mean, who wants to do that drive,

788
00:45:03,895 --> 00:45:06,084
especially in the summer?

789
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:10,583
Are you okay?

790
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,726
(glass dings)

791
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:15,670
Everybody, everybody,
can I have your attention? Thank you.

792
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:18,646
Now if the birthday girl
could join me?

793
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:21,527
You know,
I can hardly believe...

794
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:24,790
that this
whose diaper I changed,

795
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:26,870
whom I taught
to ride a bike...

796
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,823
and whom I can still hear...

797
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:30,998
reciting the lines of Puck...

798
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:33,718
from the immortal Bard
in fourth grade,

799
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:35,701
has transformed into...

800
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:38,453
this beautiful, graceful...

801
00:45:38,454 --> 00:45:42,709
and sophisticated young woman.

802
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,853
Scarlett, I know that I speak...

803
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:47,157
on behalf of your mother
and myself...

804
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:49,686
when I say that we genuinely
could not have asked...

805
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:51,829
for a better child.

806
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,981
Thanks, Dad.

807
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:54,742
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

808
00:45:54,743 --> 00:45:57,052
Happy 21st, Scarlett.

809
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,562
Oh, I nearly forgot.

810
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:07,541
A small token of our affection,

811
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:09,885
very small.

812
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,174
No.

813
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:15,029
Oh my God.

814
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,845
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

815
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:20,118
- Hi.
- This is my buddy.

816
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:22,230
I need another drink...

817
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:24,757
a whisky and coke.
Could you get that for me, please?

818
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:28,085
- Happy birthday, baby.
- Give me that.

819
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,486
- Anyway, so...
- Hey hey hey.

820
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,965
We need to talk.

821
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:42,274
Jake, here.

822
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:45,172
This party sucks.

823
00:46:45,173 --> 00:46:46,868
Do the right thing.

824
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:49,173
Gracias, amigo.

825
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,253
Dude, that's her baby picture.

826
00:46:51,254 --> 00:46:52,468
Whatever.

827
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:54,420
Right.

828
00:46:54,421 --> 00:46:55,828
Holy shit.

829
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,396
What?

830
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,092
That's a lot of witch, bro.

831
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:01,428
Would you stop
being such a pussy, Jake?

832
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:03,738
We'll split it.

833
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:07,701
(snorting)

834
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:10,099
- Oh!
- Yeah.

835
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,212
- (Buck snorting)
- You gonna do all mine too?

836
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:13,557
- Come on, man.
- Ahhh!

837
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:15,125
Hey!

838
00:47:15,126 --> 00:47:17,301
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Thanks.

839
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:19,425
(exhaling)

840
00:47:23,029 --> 00:47:25,338
So good.

841
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,468
(Jake giggles)
Mmm.

842
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:30,962
I want a white one, Mr. Dowling.

843
00:47:30,963 --> 00:47:33,395
- A ribbon?
- A car, silly.

844
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:36,562
Oh oh oh, no problem.
When do you need it by?

845
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:40,379
It's Buck. He's passed out on
the floor in the bathroom.

846
00:47:47,189 --> 00:47:49,011
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

847
00:47:49,012 --> 00:47:50,739
- What happened?
- I don't know.

848
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,563
He just...
he fell and then...

849
00:47:52,564 --> 00:47:54,259
Jake, tell me what happened!

850
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,267
We were doing some blow,
all right, Scarlett? He did too much.

851
00:47:57,268 --> 00:47:59,922
Call 911.
Somebody call 911.

852
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:02,579
- What's going on?
- Isn't there a doctor here?

853
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,363
Dr. Rosenthal and his wife RSVP'd
but they never showed up.

854
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:07,634
Mother, call Henry downstairs.
He's a nurse.

855
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,403
- Henry the doorman?
- Yes, just do it!

856
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:13,698
(intercom buzzes)

857
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:16,627
Front desk. Raul.

858
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:19,924
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

859
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:22,495
Okay, I'll send him up
right now.

860
00:48:23,156 --> 00:48:26,206
Henry, 911 to the Dowling’s' apartment.
Somebody's hurt.

861
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:29,553
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

862
00:48:29,554 --> 00:48:31,383
Come on!

863
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:34,257
- Get in there.
- Excuse me.

864
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:36,049
Excuse me.

865
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,258
- What happened?
- He was doing coke.

866
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:40,850
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Jesus. He must've done a lot.

867
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,291
- He did a ton.
- Okay.

868
00:48:46,932 --> 00:48:49,617
Come on, you stupid prick.
Breathe. Breathe.

869
00:48:49,618 --> 00:48:52,562
Is that CPR?

870
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,239
(Henry breathes)

871
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:59,217
- Come on, man. He's turning blue.
- Okay, this isn't working.

872
00:48:59,218 --> 00:49:00,818
- Oh my God.
- [Henry]: Okay.

873
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:03,442
I'm gonna have to ask everybody to
back up. Could I have you guys back up?

874
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:05,753
I'm gonna try something.

875
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:09,667
(inhales)

876
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,402
(Buck grunts)

877
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:15,169
- Are you okay?
- Oh.

878
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,432
- Cocaine OD?
- Yeah.

879
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:22,512
I tried to give him CPR
but it didn't work.

880
00:49:22,513 --> 00:49:24,241
So you hit him with
the pericardial thump?

881
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:25,968
- Uh-huh.
- Nice work.

882
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:28,016
- Thanks.
- We'll take it from here.

883
00:49:28,017 --> 00:49:30,001
You're lucky you're not dead, kid.

884
00:49:30,002 --> 00:49:33,216
Not too many people know
how to do a thump.

885
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:41,688
(elevator door opens)

886
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,977
- You okay?
- Yeah.

887
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:50,928
Are you sure, man?
'Cause you don't look okay.

888
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:54,257
I was so freaked out.
I just saved a guy's life.

889
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,944
- No shit? Who?
- Yeah, Scarlett's boyfriend.

890
00:49:56,945 --> 00:49:58,800
- Wow.
- (door opens)

891
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:02,366
(indistinct EMT radio)

892
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:10,449
You saved my friend's life, man.
I wanna thank you.

893
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,937
I got 200 bucks on me.
I wish I had more, but...

894
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:15,953
200 dollars?
That's cool, baby.

895
00:50:15,954 --> 00:50:18,160
No, I'll get...
I have a check.

896
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:19,920
Make it out to Henry O'Shea.

897
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:21,712
You do know how to spell O'Shea,
don't you?

898
00:50:21,713 --> 00:50:22,864
- O'Shea?
- Yeah.

899
00:50:22,865 --> 00:50:24,719
All right.

900
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,950
No no no. No no. I'm not taking a tip
for saving a guy's life.

901
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:31,024
If you'd like,
you can make it out to Raul.

902
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:32,368
- Raul?
- Yeah.

903
00:50:32,369 --> 00:50:33,872
R~A~U...

904
00:50:33,873 --> 00:50:37,208
Look, you already thanked me.
That's fine.

905
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:41,429
Are you... you serious?

906
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,400
Thank you.

907
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:49,328
Kid, let me explain
something to you...

908
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:52,080
you cannot turn down
a 200 dollar tip, man.

909
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:55,471
I'm not taking a tip for saving
a guy's life. It's not right.

910
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,720
Well, give it to your crew.
We didn't save nobody's life.

911
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,144
- Hi.
- Hey.

912
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:11,919
You were amazing.
I don't know how to thank you.

913
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,447
- You don't have to, really.
- You saved his life.

914
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:16,718
I mean, the paramedic said so.

915
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:18,542
I've never done that before.

916
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:21,038
I mean, we practiced
in school, but...

917
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,077
never on someone
who was about to die.

918
00:51:24,078 --> 00:51:25,294
It's kinda scary.

919
00:51:25,295 --> 00:51:27,214
You didn't look scared.

920
00:51:27,215 --> 00:51:29,167
- No?
- No.

921
00:51:29,168 --> 00:51:32,623
You looked like you were totally
in control of the situation,

922
00:51:32,624 --> 00:51:35,950
kinda like when you had
that dog's head in your mouth.

923
00:51:35,951 --> 00:51:38,139
It was kinda hot.

924
00:51:39,247 --> 00:51:41,486
Very funny.

925
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,644
You're a sweet guy, Henry.

926
00:51:49,615 --> 00:51:52,569
- I gotta go.
- 'Night, Miss Dowling.

927
00:51:54,513 --> 00:51:56,399
(exhales)

928
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,023
You got a real problem
with keeping your hands to yourself.

929
00:51:59,024 --> 00:52:02,287
Come on, George.
She was upset. I was comforting her.

930
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:04,079
This is your last warning.

931
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,877
Next time if I hear or see you
touching anybody in this building,

932
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:11,766
you hit the bricks.

933
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:15,068
And that goes for dogs too.

934
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,029
(exhales)

935
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,461
"You're a sweet guy, Henry".

936
00:52:20,462 --> 00:52:23,732
(sighs)
What am I doing, man?

937
00:52:26,925 --> 00:52:29,678
Do you have girl trouble often?

938
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,981
Raul is a love doctor.

939
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,830
Tchh! Then fix me, Doctor.
Fix me.

940
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:39,421
Let her go, papito.

941
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:50,285
[Caitlin]:
So how's the doorman business?

942
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:52,238
It's definitely been
a lesson in humility.

943
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:53,805
Any good stories yet?

944
00:52:53,806 --> 00:52:55,853
None that don't make me
seem ridiculous.

945
00:52:55,854 --> 00:52:58,163
What kind of stories
do you think I like?

946
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:01,678
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, shoot.

947
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,990
Get. (clucks)

948
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:06,106
- Would you...
- Hey. Hey.

949
00:53:07,694 --> 00:53:10,636
- Would you date a guy who was dirt poor?
- No.

950
00:53:10,637 --> 00:53:11,820
Okay.

951
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,444
I'm just pulling your leash.
Of course.

952
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:17,147
Hey, get over yourself.

953
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:20,076
Girls don't care about money...
not the good ones, anyway.

954
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:23,564
Girls just want you
to be the alpha, you know?

955
00:53:23,565 --> 00:53:26,444
You be strong and assertive,
you'll have to beat 'em off with a stick.

956
00:53:26,445 --> 00:53:28,557
You want a guy to be the alpha?

957
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:30,573
Me? Hell no.

958
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:33,228
Wait a second.
Why are we talking about this?

959
00:53:33,229 --> 00:53:35,117
Who's the girl?

960
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:37,164
No, I mean, there's no girl.

961
00:53:37,165 --> 00:53:38,923
Hank, you're Lying to me.

962
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,195
You're a terrible liar.
What's her name?

963
00:53:41,196 --> 00:53:43,244
When would I have had time
to meet a girl?

964
00:53:43,245 --> 00:53:45,933
I don't know, may-
she lives in the building.

965
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:47,501
- (laughs)
- She lives in the building.

966
00:53:47,502 --> 00:53:49,132
- What's her name?
- You're good.

967
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:53,068
- What's her name?
- Uh, Scarlett- Scarlett Dowling.

968
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:55,020
- Scarlett Dowling?
- Mmm.

969
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:56,620
Oh, good luck.
What is she,

970
00:53:56,621 --> 00:53:58,987
some kind of high-maintenance
trust-fund kid or something?

971
00:53:58,988 --> 00:54:00,298
I don't know. Probably.

972
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:02,538
- You asked her out yet?
- No, of course not.

973
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,563
Why not?

974
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:06,699
Because rich girls from Fifth Avenue
don't date their doormen.

975
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,270
- Plus I would get fired.
- Mmm.

976
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,728
Yep, that would be bad.

977
00:54:22,188 --> 00:54:25,739
- Hello, Miss Dowling.
- Henry, please don't call me that.

978
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:28,555
- It's Scarlett.
- Sorry, Scarlett.

979
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,018
How's Buck doing?

980
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:32,587
Rehab.

981
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:35,083
Well, I guess that's a good thing.

982
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:37,077
It is.

983
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,169
Listen, Henry,

984
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,924
I think I figured out
how I want to thank you.

985
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:45,323
- I want to take you somewhere.
- Oh, yeah?

986
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,946
Yeah, and it's a surprise.

987
00:54:47,947 --> 00:54:50,859
I'm gonna bring those up
as soon as they arrive, Miss Dowling.

988
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,292
- Hi, George.
- Hello, Scarlett.

989
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:56,106
George, did you know
that Henry here...

990
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:59,507
is the best doorman
that we've ever had?

991
00:55:00,235 --> 00:55:02,698
Oh, yeah.
Henry's, uh...

992
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,257
he's got a real way
with the residents.

993
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:08,200
You keep it up, Henry.

994
00:55:08,201 --> 00:55:10,426
Keep it up.

995
00:55:12,203 --> 00:55:15,978
- Okay, so what is with the tape?
- I don't know.

996
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,379
Yeah, it's been one of
the great mysteries of the building.

997
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,618
I don't think anyone's been
able to ask him.

998
00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:22,602
I'm not asking him.

999
00:55:22,603 --> 00:55:25,850
So you'll come?

1000
00:55:27,146 --> 00:55:30,089
Yeah, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1001
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:33,450
Um, they don't like us getting
too friendly with the residents...

1002
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:35,402
and I'm pretty sure
George would fire me.

1003
00:55:35,403 --> 00:55:37,770
Uh, I can't afford that right now.

1004
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:41,171
Okay, so we won't go out.

1005
00:55:42,315 --> 00:55:43,819
We'll have a meeting.

1006
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,602
- A meeting?
- Yes, a meeting.

1007
00:55:46,603 --> 00:55:48,362
And it starts tomorrow at 7:00 PM,

1008
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:51,561
Pier 83 on the Westside Highway.

1009
00:55:51,562 --> 00:55:53,992
- (elevator dings)
- Mum's the word.

1010
00:55:53,993 --> 00:55:55,721
- Scarlett, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1011
00:55:55,722 --> 00:55:58,792
No, I can't. I really want to,
but I can't.

1012
00:55:58,793 --> 00:56:01,233
You... I'm...

1013
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,216
- You said Pier 83?
- Mm-hmm.

1014
00:56:06,217 --> 00:56:08,840
- At 7:00?
- Yes.

1015
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:12,489
Okay. Sounds like a good place
for a meeting.

1016
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,024
Meeting.

1017
00:56:14,025 --> 00:56:16,335
It's just a meeting.

1018
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:36,776
Hi.

1019
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:39,112
I'm so sorry.
You weren't waiting long, were you?

1020
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:41,353
- No no.
- I couldn't find a cab...

1021
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:43,816
and I was just... I...

1022
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,057
- What?
- No, nothing.

1023
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:48,296
- Uh...
- Why are you looking at me like that?

1024
00:56:48,297 --> 00:56:49,959
You just- you look great.

1025
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,647
Thank you.

1026
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:54,760
I look like a Mormon missionary.

1027
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:57,031
No, you look great.

1028
00:56:57,032 --> 00:56:59,303
- Well, maybe we should...
- Yeah.

1029
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:01,256
- go in.
- I didn't know where we were going.

1030
00:57:01,257 --> 00:57:03,080
- How about a hint?
- A hint?

1031
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:06,728
Well, let's see... it's bigger
than a breadbox...

1032
00:57:06,729 --> 00:57:08,840
and it floats.

1033
00:57:08,841 --> 00:57:10,600
Hi, two tickets, please.

1034
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,584
[Henry]:
Oh no, I've got this.

1035
00:57:12,585 --> 00:57:14,152
No, don't be silly.
I asked you here.

1036
00:57:14,153 --> 00:57:16,488
No, I insist.
I wasn't raised like that.

1037
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:18,054
- Two, please.
- Thank you.

1038
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:19,600
You're welcome.

1039
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,135
- (beeps)
- Your card's declined.

1040
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,311
- What?
- Got another one?

1041
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:28,135
Uh, that can't be right.

1042
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:29,895
You want me to try it again?

1043
00:57:29,896 --> 00:57:32,296
No, I have cash.

1044
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:35,208
I was supposed to pay anyway.

1045
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:37,032
Your machine must be broken.

1046
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:39,720
Yeah, the machine's broken.

1047
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:41,640
(scanning)

1048
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:44,454
- Sorry about that.
- Here you go. Have a good time.

1049
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:47,343
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1050
00:57:49,064 --> 00:57:50,789
How can I help you?

1051
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:54,736
(upbeat music playing)

1052
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:07,814
You should've listened
to what Mama said...

1053
00:58:07,815 --> 00:58:12,678
I walked away with
someone else instead...

1054
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:18,502
You should've listened
to what Grandma said...

1055
00:58:18,503 --> 00:58:22,962
Married someone
more like Fred...

1056
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:40,134
You should've listened
to your inner voice...

1057
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:44,397
While you had time
to sell it short...

1058
00:58:45,543 --> 00:58:47,270
May I ask you something?

1059
00:58:47,271 --> 00:58:48,485
Sure.

1060
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:50,564
Why be a doorman?

1061
00:58:50,565 --> 00:58:53,445
I thought you were studying
to be a nurse.

1062
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:56,454
My uncle Colin,
he's been a doorman forever.

1063
00:58:56,455 --> 00:58:58,789
He got me the job.

1064
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:01,574
But why a doorman?

1065
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:03,749
I mean, no offense.
I just...

1066
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,565
I thought you might do something
in the medical field.

1067
00:59:06,566 --> 00:59:09,317
It just seems...

1068
00:59:09,318 --> 00:59:11,653
What? Beneath me?

1069
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:14,468
No, not that.

1070
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:17,381
(helicopter passes)

1071
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:19,685
I'm not really in nursing school.

1072
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:22,836
I mean, I was, but...

1073
00:59:23,623 --> 00:59:25,862
my Dad died.

1074
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:28,454
And his life insurance...

1075
00:59:28,455 --> 00:59:30,277
well, whatever.
It's complicated.

1076
00:59:30,278 --> 00:59:32,997
But my mom was left
with a lot of debt,

1077
00:59:32,998 --> 00:59:37,060
so I just had to
get a job fast.

1078
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:39,556
I'm really sorry.

1079
00:59:39,557 --> 00:59:41,956
I didn't know that.

1080
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:44,048
It's all right.

1081
00:59:49,765 --> 00:59:51,659
Wow.

1082
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:54,436
She's amazing.

1083
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:57,292
Are you trying to
make me jealous?

1084
00:59:58,149 --> 01:00:01,412
You two are so different.
You really shouldn't compare yourself.

1085
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:03,747
I mean, she's so much bigger...

1086
01:00:03,748 --> 01:00:06,123
and greener.

1087
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:09,771
[Scarlett]:
Maybe you're right.

1088
01:00:10,628 --> 01:00:13,347
"Give me your tired,

1089
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:16,036
your poor"...

1090
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:17,898
What is it?

1091
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:22,885
"Give me your tired,
your poor,

1092
01:00:22,886 --> 01:00:26,154
your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

1093
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:31,332
Send these...

1094
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:35,587
homeless,
tempest-tossed to me.

1095
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:39,138
I lift my lamp beside
the golden door".

1096
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:41,346
Now you're just showing off.

1097
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,938
Not really.
It's one of the only poems I remember.

1098
01:00:43,939 --> 01:00:48,366
Emma Lazarus. I had to memorize it in,
like, seventh grade.

1099
01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:57,026
Who sew the lions...

1100
01:00:57,027 --> 01:01:00,964
Hungry in the cage...

1101
01:01:00,965 --> 01:01:04,146
With the confidence
of a clown?

1102
01:01:06,435 --> 01:01:08,323
The little man...

1103
01:01:08,324 --> 01:01:13,026
Who rises on the stage...

1104
01:01:13,027 --> 01:01:17,124
As he falls without a safety net...

1105
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:20,099
We have this story...

1106
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,044
Of the impossible...

1107
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:25,635
A tale...

1108
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:28,291
- What?
- This is where I get off.

1109
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,785
Oh, right.

1110
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:32,482
I'll watch you go in from here.

1111
01:01:32,483 --> 01:01:35,554
- You don't have to.
- No, I want to.

1112
01:01:35,555 --> 01:01:39,216
Thanks for a great,
uh, meeting.

1113
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,316
Thank you.

1114
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:51,874
Whatever happened to

1115
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:54,796
- The great escape...
- Good evening, Miss Dowling.

1116
01:01:55,362 --> 01:01:58,152
And all the plans we made?

1117
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:06,732
Crafted with pride
by monsters on the train...

1118
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:10,274
The world is great
to suckers...

1119
01:02:10,275 --> 01:02:13,698
We have this story...

1120
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:15,745
Of the impossible...

1121
01:02:15,746 --> 01:02:19,113
A tale...

1122
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:25,121
No, that's just it.

1123
01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:28,513
She wasn't wearing anything
under the dress.

1124
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:31,631
Well, of course she's too old.

1125
01:02:33,762 --> 01:02:35,950
Mm-hmm.

1126
01:02:36,577 --> 01:02:38,945
Well, just because she left him,

1127
01:02:38,946 --> 01:02:41,825
I don't see why she has
to completely lose control.

1128
01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:44,647
(camera beeping)

1129
01:02:46,402 --> 01:02:49,485
Ellen?
Ellen, I have to call you back.

1130
01:02:58,786 --> 01:03:01,161
(dialing)

1131
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:07,599
Yes, this is Mrs. Dowling.
I need to speak with George.

1132
01:03:09,027 --> 01:03:10,465
Hey, George.

1133
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:12,840
You wanted to see me?

1134
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,217
I'm gonna get right to the point.

1135
01:03:17,218 --> 01:03:20,479
Did you or did you not...

1136
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,871
go on a date
with Scarlett Dowling?

1137
01:03:23,872 --> 01:03:28,447
I... I... no.
I didn't go on a date.

1138
01:03:28,448 --> 01:03:31,231
Don't lie to me, kid.
The mother is fit to be tied.

1139
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:33,119
George, it wasn't a date.
All right? It was a meeting.

1140
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,424
Don't sass me.
I hate to be sassed.

1141
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:37,695
Okay, just listen to me for a sec.
I can totally explain.

1142
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:39,680
Her boyfriend, or her ex-boyfriend
or whatever...

1143
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:41,855
Buck OD'd in the apartment, right?

1144
01:03:41,856 --> 01:03:44,096
And they asked me up...

1145
01:03:44,097 --> 01:03:46,688
and I went up there and I saved
the kid... I saved him in the apartment.

1146
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,358
And she asked me out
to thank me.

1147
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,071
What?

1148
01:03:55,072 --> 01:03:57,993
You've got a tattoo
on your face.

1149
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,183
- A face tattoo.
- All right, that's it, you're fired.

1150
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,423
- Get out.
- Look, George, listen to me, please.

1151
01:04:03,424 --> 01:04:05,120
I really need this job.

1152
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:08,671
Yeah, well, you should've thought
about that when you dated her, Romeo.

1153
01:04:08,672 --> 01:04:13,033
You knew the rules.
You broke the rules. You're out.

1154
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,141
And don't use the front.
Use the service elevator.

1155
01:04:32,448 --> 01:04:34,589
(ringing)

1156
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:37,279
Hi. Hi, is Scarlett there?

1157
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,519
Um, it's the front desk calling.

1158
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,239
Oh, what the hell
are you doing?

1159
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,254
Get outta here!

1160
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,717
I'm calling your uncle!

1161
01:04:46,718 --> 01:04:48,526
(door closes)

1162
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,502
(door dings)

1163
01:05:12,862 --> 01:05:14,750
Hi, Raul.

1164
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,980
Could I leave this with you?
It's for Henry.

1165
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:24,220
- It's just a letter.
- Maybe I should call George.

1166
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,492
No no, it's for Henry.

1167
01:05:26,493 --> 01:05:29,383
I think you should call George.

1168
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:34,813
Okay.

1169
01:05:34,814 --> 01:05:37,897
I'll give it to him myself.

1170
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:46,908
You got fired.

1171
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:49,405
Yeah, I did.
Thanks for being discreet.

1172
01:05:49,406 --> 01:05:51,196
Sorry.

1173
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,572
Why'd they can you?

1174
01:05:54,141 --> 01:05:56,990
Super found out that I went
on a date with Scarlett.

1175
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,070
You got fired over a girl.

1176
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:02,334
Do you have any idea how cool that is?
I wish somebody would get fired for me.

1177
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:05,340
Yeah, well, it's not gonna be so cool
when we lose the house.

1178
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:08,477
Dad's gone. No one's going to
take care of this for us.

1179
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:09,501
Just...

1180
01:06:09,502 --> 01:06:12,700
What am I supposed to do
if I can't find another job?

1181
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:15,931
Look, you're smart, okay?
You got all your teeth.

1182
01:06:15,932 --> 01:06:18,755
(man muttering)

1183
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:21,414
Sorry.

1184
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:24,987
Anyway, look,
forget about the job, all right?

1185
01:06:24,988 --> 01:06:28,827
Jobs grow on trees. What are you
gonna do about the girl?

1186
01:06:28,828 --> 01:06:31,068
I'm not gonna do anything
about the girl.

1187
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:34,524
- It was her family that got me fired.
- Mmm.

1188
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:36,285
(sighs)

1189
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:38,235
Whatever.

1190
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:41,339
I'm always gonna be
a doorman to those people.

1191
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,347
Well, looks like you don't have to worry
about being the doorman anymore,

1192
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:47,643
so that's solved.

1193
01:06:47,644 --> 01:06:50,140
And besides,
we're not gonna lose the house.

1194
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:51,740
Mom got a great job.

1195
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,443
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

1196
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,729
Oh my...

1197
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:31,867
Is there something you
want to tell me?

1198
01:07:31,868 --> 01:07:34,779
Well, um...

1199
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,114
apparently purple is
the color this season.

1200
01:07:37,115 --> 01:07:38,747
Damn it, Mother,
I am serious.

1201
01:07:38,748 --> 01:07:42,107
So am I. Look at these pictures.
I look awful in purple.

1202
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:45,626
- What did you do to Henry?
- I had him fired.

1203
01:07:45,627 --> 01:07:47,676
Why would you do that?

1204
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:51,355
You can't date the help, Scarlett.
It doesn't look good.

1205
01:07:51,356 --> 01:07:53,915
Henry is not the help, Mother.

1206
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,451
He's a human being.

1207
01:07:55,452 --> 01:07:57,531
All right, fine.
He's a human being.

1208
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,635
But sweetheart, a doorman?
Why on earth would you date a doorman?

1209
01:08:00,636 --> 01:08:02,458
How do you think that
makes me feel?

1210
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:04,698
Meredith Dowling's daughter
is going out with their doorman.

1211
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:06,938
I just hope no one
saw you together.

1212
01:08:06,939 --> 01:08:09,529
I had no idea what
an elitist snob you are.

1213
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:11,769
Don't talk to me that way.

1214
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:14,745
And don't be so dramatic.
I just want what's best for you.

1215
01:08:14,746 --> 01:08:17,658
No, you just want
what's best for you.

1216
01:08:17,659 --> 01:08:19,834
I'm gonna date whoever I want.

1217
01:08:19,835 --> 01:08:24,281
Okay? Whether it's the doorman,
the trash man or the mayor.

1218
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:27,194
And it's gonna have nothing to do
with their station in life,

1219
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:30,180
but everything to do
with who they are.

1220
01:08:51,323 --> 01:08:53,250
George?

1221
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:57,818
Oh, Miss Dowling.

1222
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:01,144
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah, can it, George.

1223
01:09:01,145 --> 01:09:02,809
Hire him back.

1224
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:07,160
Oh, no no no, I'm sorry. There are
strict rules about fraternization.

1225
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:09,144
Okay, well,
give me his number.

1226
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,513
I'm sorry.
I can't do that either.

1227
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:14,169
I really am sorry.

1228
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:16,728
Fine. Fine, be a jerk.

1229
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:20,282
I mean, I can get his number.
You don't think I can get his number?

1230
01:09:20,283 --> 01:09:22,584
I can get it.

1231
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:25,273
76 Henry O'Sheas?

1232
01:09:25,274 --> 01:09:28,641
- You're kidding, right?
- [Operator]: No, ma'am. I don't kid.

1233
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,513
No, I guess you don't.

1234
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:34,264
Okay.
Okay, give 'em to me.

1235
01:09:34,265 --> 01:09:37,080
I can only give you
two numbers at a time.

1236
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:40,450
If you want more,
you'll have to call back.

1237
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:44,449
Forget it.
That's fine, forget it.

1238
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:51,992
- Okay.
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1239
01:09:51,993 --> 01:09:53,015
Can I help you?

1240
01:09:53,016 --> 01:09:56,567
- Yeah, I want to talk to Scarlett Dowling.
- You're gonna have to wait outside.

1241
01:09:56,568 --> 01:09:58,679
We cannot have all
these animals in our lobby.

1242
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,375
Would you just get her down here?

1243
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:03,678
These dogs crap on command and they
eat uncooperative doormen.

1244
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,975
(barks)

1245
01:10:05,976 --> 01:10:08,407
Just get her down here.

1246
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:10,904
- Are you a friend?
- What's your name?

1247
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:12,055
Raul.

1248
01:10:12,056 --> 01:10:15,064
Raul, I'm Cate.
I'm Henry's sister.

1249
01:10:15,065 --> 01:10:19,327
So would you just be a sport
and call up for me?

1250
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,444
Sit. I mean it.

1251
01:10:28,313 --> 01:10:29,559
(beeps)

1252
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,895
Yeah, it's Raul
from downstairs.

1253
01:10:31,896 --> 01:10:34,071
- There's some lady down here saying...
- Not today. Not today.

1254
01:10:34,072 --> 01:10:35,832
Henry's sister.

1255
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,713
Okay.

1256
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:40,599
She'll be right down.

1257
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,296
So you're Hank's sister?

1258
01:10:42,297 --> 01:10:43,864
Yeah.

1259
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,528
He didn't tell me
he had a sister.

1260
01:10:45,529 --> 01:10:47,575
Hmm.

1261
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,351
Listen, I think that's bullshit
what happened to Hank.

1262
01:10:51,352 --> 01:10:53,015
We kinda miss him.

1263
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:55,031
That's cute.

1264
01:10:55,032 --> 01:10:58,134
But Hank needs to go back to school.
Maybe this will make that happen.

1265
01:10:58,135 --> 01:11:00,694
Why'd he leave anyway?

1266
01:11:00,695 --> 01:11:02,614
Our dad died.

1267
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:04,791
Wow. Sorry to hear that.

1268
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:07,777
I lost one of my dads too.

1269
01:11:08,951 --> 01:11:11,798
I'm sorry.

1270
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:14,390
So yeah, that's why
Hank dropped out.

1271
01:11:14,391 --> 01:11:16,885
That's f- that's messed up.

1272
01:11:16,886 --> 01:11:18,847
(elevator dings)

1273
01:11:20,087 --> 01:11:23,542
- Hi, you're Henry's sister?
- Yeah, Cate.

1274
01:11:23,543 --> 01:11:25,205
- Scarlett.
- You want to take a walk?

1275
01:11:25,206 --> 01:11:27,830
- I would love to.
- Excellent.

1276
01:11:27,831 --> 01:11:31,031
- Nice to meet you.
- Do you need a hand?

1277
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:32,838
I got it.

1278
01:11:36,503 --> 01:11:38,999
I feel really bad about
what happened to Henry.

1279
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,950
I mean, he told me he was
going to get fired,

1280
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:44,150
and I insisted.
It's- it's my fault.

1281
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:46,261
Pardon me for saying,
but that is bullshit.

1282
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:49,078
Hank got fired because of Hank,
not because of you,

1283
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:51,477
not because of your mother,
although she sounds colorful.

1284
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:52,885
I heard about that.

1285
01:11:52,886 --> 01:11:56,244
He got fired because of him,
whatever he did.

1286
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,100
I still feel awful.

1287
01:11:58,101 --> 01:12:00,246
Hank will get another job.

1288
01:12:00,247 --> 01:12:03,604
I'm just happy to hear
that you feel awful.

1289
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:05,589
You know, I think I can help him
get his job back.

1290
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:07,318
Maybe you shouldn't.

1291
01:12:07,319 --> 01:12:08,917
You don't think
he wants my help?

1292
01:12:08,918 --> 01:12:11,541
No, it isn't that.
Ooh, easy.

1293
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:14,389
Easy easy.
Okay okay.

1294
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:18,204
It isn't that. It's just, you know,
Hank needs to be back in school.

1295
01:12:20,694 --> 01:12:22,933
You're right.

1296
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:25,877
He's too smart to
be a doorman.

1297
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:30,165
No, he's not. It's just that
he wants to be a nurse.

1298
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,886
What's wrong with
being a doorman?

1299
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:35,861
No- nothing.
Nothing's wrong with being a doorman.

1300
01:12:35,862 --> 01:12:38,710
I just think it's
a misuse of Henry's talents.

1301
01:12:38,711 --> 01:12:41,182
We agree about that.

1302
01:12:42,709 --> 01:12:44,156
Come on.

1303
01:13:03,765 --> 01:13:05,856
No.

1304
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:08,899
No way.

1305
01:13:09,908 --> 01:13:12,531
This can't be it.

1306
01:13:12,532 --> 01:13:15,380
Young wo[Man on TV]:
She told me that I was going on a trip,

1307
01:13:15,381 --> 01:13:16,916
and that I was going to meet...

1308
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:20,276
some tall dark stranger.

1309
01:13:20,277 --> 01:13:24,223
(girl and man moaning)

1310
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:28,353
What you lookin' at?

1311
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:35,605
Grace:
You need help finding something?

1312
01:13:35,606 --> 01:13:38,132
"Grand Theft Anal"?

1313
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:41,011
Section 4, Male Erotic.

1314
01:13:41,012 --> 01:13:43,891
- Mom.
- Henry.

1315
01:13:43,892 --> 01:13:46,035
What a nice surprise.

1316
01:13:46,036 --> 01:13:48,274
- What are you doing here?
- I'm working.

1317
01:13:48,275 --> 01:13:51,635
No, you don't work here. This is
a sick sick place for sick perverted...

1318
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,715
Shh! Hush.

1319
01:13:53,716 --> 01:13:56,787
It's a video store, honey,
for- for adults.

1320
01:13:56,788 --> 01:13:58,484
- [Girl on TV]: Yes, take me!
- Okay.

1321
01:13:58,485 --> 01:14:00,435
We need to talk.
Not here. Outside.

1322
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,963
I'm working.
Don't you need to get to work?

1323
01:14:02,964 --> 01:14:04,851
- Hey, Gracie.
- Oh.

1324
01:14:04,852 --> 01:14:07,603
- Great job on the dildo display.
- Thank you, Lazlo.

1325
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:10,546
- I would like you to meet my son Henry.
- Hey!

1326
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:13,970
- It's a great pleasure.
- Yeah, it's- sure. Great.

1327
01:14:13,971 --> 01:14:17,234
Look, I'm sorry to tell you that
my mother needs to resign...

1328
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:19,090
- from your store.
- Really?

1329
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:22,209
But she's employee of the week.

1330
01:14:22,868 --> 01:14:24,787
Hey, Henry,
what do you do?

1331
01:14:24,788 --> 01:14:26,898
Uh, I'm a nurse.

1332
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:28,690
Ooh. Well, to each his own.

1333
01:14:28,691 --> 01:14:32,147
You know, when the customers come
in here and they figure out that...

1334
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:34,129
Gracie is working here,

1335
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:36,082
well, it makes them
more relaxed.

1336
01:14:36,083 --> 01:14:38,225
They feel like they're at home,
'cause maybe their mothers...

1337
01:14:38,226 --> 01:14:40,657
didn't appreciate
these kinds of things.

1338
01:14:40,658 --> 01:14:42,738
So she's great for business.

1339
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:44,977
- Isn't he sweet?
- [Girl on TV]: Yes! Yes!

1340
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:47,506
- Yes! Ahh!
- I only wish that my mother...

1341
01:14:47,507 --> 01:14:49,234
were more like her...

1342
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,986
hot and totally
non-judgmental.

1343
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,706
Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

1344
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,658
- We need to go.
- Henry, no.

1345
01:14:56,659 --> 01:15:00,370
I'm not quittin'. I'm treated
with respect here and I like it.

1346
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:03,505
All right. How would you like
to be assistant manager?

1347
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:06,289
Would you like that?
Two bucks more an hour?

1348
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:08,401
- Yes.
- All right, you're assistant manager.

1349
01:15:08,402 --> 01:15:10,673
- Nice meeting you.
- [Girl on TV]: Ahh ahh ahh!

1350
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:14,001
- Ahh! Oooh!
- Aw.

1351
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:17,203
You cannot work here anymore.
You need to go and tell him that you quit.

1352
01:15:17,204 --> 01:15:19,282
You are really bothering me.
I'm working.

1353
01:15:19,283 --> 01:15:21,265
I'm serious.
You'll find another job. You can't...

1354
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,153
- Henry?
- Oh, no.

1355
01:15:23,154 --> 01:15:25,777
No no no no.
Scarlett. Uh...

1356
01:15:25,778 --> 01:15:28,114
- you can't be here. Not here.
- [Girl on TV]: Oh, yeah, baby!

1357
01:15:28,115 --> 01:15:30,480
- Right there.
- Don't look at that.

1358
01:15:30,481 --> 01:15:31,792
[Man]:
Yeah, baby, look at it.

1359
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,577
Mmm, yeah.
Now spit on it.

1360
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:36,688
Need help finding
something, sweetie?

1361
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:40,815
Uh, Scarlett,
this is my mother, Grace.

1362
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:43,505
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Very nice to meet you too.

1363
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:44,593
[Man on TV]:
Do it like that for Daddy.

1364
01:15:44,594 --> 01:15:46,417
Are you looking for
an adult film?

1365
01:15:46,418 --> 01:15:49,008
No, I was looking for Henry.

1366
01:15:49,009 --> 01:15:51,344
Damn, it's hot in here.

1367
01:15:51,345 --> 01:15:54,160
[Girl on TV]:
Yeah yeah yeah!

1368
01:15:54,161 --> 01:15:57,360
(slow motion)
Nooooo!

1369
01:15:57,361 --> 01:16:00,958
What the hell are you doing?

1370
01:16:01,745 --> 01:16:05,104
I thought that... wh...
Forget it.

1371
01:16:05,105 --> 01:16:07,408
I'm not supposed to
wear this uniform in here.

1372
01:16:07,409 --> 01:16:09,232
I won't tell if you don't.

1373
01:16:09,233 --> 01:16:12,317
[Man on TV]:
Yeah, oh!

1374
01:16:12,977 --> 01:16:14,416
What are you doing here?

1375
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:17,777
- Cate said you might be here.
- You talked to Cate?

1376
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:20,273
Yeah, she came by the building,
which I'm glad she did...

1377
01:16:20,274 --> 01:16:22,577
because I was having a hell
of a time finding your number.

1378
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,984
Were you?

1379
01:16:23,985 --> 01:16:25,839
I wanted to say
I was really sorry.

1380
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,047
It's my fault that you got fired
and I really want to fix it.

1381
01:16:28,048 --> 01:16:29,327
You got fired?

1382
01:16:29,328 --> 01:16:32,366
Yeah. I'm sorry, Ma.
I was gonna tell you.

1383
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:36,399
Sorry about what?
Everybody gets fired...

1384
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,055
except here...

1385
01:16:39,056 --> 01:16:41,233
with Lazlo.

1386
01:16:41,234 --> 01:16:45,080
- Let's talk outside.
- Okay.

1387
01:16:47,056 --> 01:16:49,168
I can help you find
another job.

1388
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:51,727
My father knows a lot of people.

1389
01:16:51,728 --> 01:16:54,768
Look, I'll find something, okay?
It's really not your problem.

1390
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,903
But I want to help.
I mean, it's the least I can do.

1391
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:59,663
- My dad has this friend...
- Just stop, all right?

1392
01:16:59,664 --> 01:17:02,031
I don't need your help
and I don't need your dad's help.

1393
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:04,398
I can take care of myself
and my family.

1394
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:07,631
Fine. You don't have to be
such a jerk about it.

1395
01:17:07,632 --> 01:17:11,228
- I'm not being a jerk about it.
- Yeah, you kind of are.

1396
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:14,095
Okay, what are we doing here?

1397
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:17,839
- Fighting about you being a jerk.
- Seriously.

1398
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,303
Henry, I like you.

1399
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:23,223
You know, I really want
to see you again.

1400
01:17:26,192 --> 01:17:29,340
I'm sure your mom
would love that.

1401
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:33,389
Look, I don't know
what a guy like me

1402
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:36,751
can possibly hope to offer
someone like you.

1403
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:39,022
I mean, I can't put 100 bucks
on a credit card,

1404
01:17:39,023 --> 01:17:42,653
much less take you out to dinner
anywhere but a hot-dog stand.

1405
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:47,228
I like hot dogs.

1406
01:17:47,855 --> 01:17:51,502
- I don't really care about that stuff.
- Yeah, well, I do.

1407
01:17:51,503 --> 01:17:56,059
And you can't possibly know
what that feels like.

1408
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,653
I mean, you're Fifth Avenue
and I'm always gonna be Flatbush.

1409
01:18:00,654 --> 01:18:03,805
All right?
I couldn't keep up.

1410
01:18:05,743 --> 01:18:07,867
Okay.

1411
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:12,344
You know, there's a reason that people
don't date their doormen.

1412
01:18:14,671 --> 01:18:16,814
Maybe you're right.

1413
01:18:16,815 --> 01:18:19,735
Have a nice life, Henry O'Shea.

1414
01:18:29,709 --> 01:18:32,151
(starts engine)

1415
01:18:42,287 --> 01:18:44,443
Shit.

1416
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:49,261
All right, little guys,

1417
01:18:49,262 --> 01:18:51,693
it's a field trip.

1418
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:53,165
Come on.

1419
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:56,085
All right.
Come on.

1420
01:18:56,973 --> 01:19:00,334
Hey eh eh!
She find you?

1421
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,644
Hey.

1422
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:05,837
Coma guy,
Scarlett find you?

1423
01:19:05,838 --> 01:19:08,148
Yeah, she just left.

1424
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,573
- Hi, honey.
- Oh hey, Ma.

1425
01:19:10,574 --> 01:19:12,845
Hi. Hey, did your friend leave?

1426
01:19:12,846 --> 01:19:15,629
- Yeah, how'd it go?
- She's got beautiful bone structure.

1427
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:17,260
Okay, I don't wanna talk about it.

1428
01:19:17,261 --> 01:19:19,129
Okay, you know what?
I didn't spend 14 dollars for a cab...

1429
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,079
for "I don't wanna talk about it".
So start talking.

1430
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,116
Why? What happened?

1431
01:19:23,117 --> 01:19:24,843
I don't wanna talk about it.

1432
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:26,347
- Okay.
- (Grace laughing)

1433
01:19:26,348 --> 01:19:28,429
So Henry's really into this rich girl
at his building, right?

1434
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,508
So finally she asks him out...
whatever...

1435
01:19:30,509 --> 01:19:32,109
and then he gets fired.

1436
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:34,220
For dipping your penis
in the company ink.

1437
01:19:34,221 --> 01:19:36,204
Ma, don't talk about
my penis.

1438
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:38,540
I just learned that expression.
I like it.

1439
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:40,971
I don't think that
that's the exact saying.

1440
01:19:40,972 --> 01:19:43,052
So that was her in the store?

1441
01:19:43,053 --> 01:19:46,860
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

1442
01:19:46,861 --> 01:19:49,236
She's just gone.

1443
01:19:49,997 --> 01:19:52,620
It was never gonna work out.

1444
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,668
They're millionaires.

1445
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:58,220
I mean, they've got a car and a driver
and a house in the Hamptons.

1446
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:01,675
They got a Jamaican lady who lives
in their apartment and cooks for them.

1447
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:05,548
I thought she was the maid too, but it
turns out they got another lady for that.

1448
01:20:05,549 --> 01:20:07,532
I mean, I was in
their living room the other night...

1449
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:10,539
and above their fireplace
they have a Cézanne...

1450
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:13,706
not like a poster,
like a real Cézanne.

1451
01:20:13,707 --> 01:20:15,755
I mean, these people live
on a different planet.

1452
01:20:15,756 --> 01:20:18,122
They don't want me
dating their daughter.

1453
01:20:18,123 --> 01:20:20,777
You know? I mean, what?
At best, I'm gonna be a nurse?

1454
01:20:20,778 --> 01:20:22,953
My dad wasn't the master of the universe,
he was a plumber.

1455
01:20:22,954 --> 01:20:26,520
My mom works in a porn shop,
my sister's a dog walker.

1456
01:20:27,084 --> 01:20:30,298
These two worlds don't mix.

1457
01:20:31,947 --> 01:20:33,674
Are you done?

1458
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:35,755
Yeah, I guess.

1459
01:20:35,756 --> 01:20:39,114
You're done insulting yourself
and your family?

1460
01:20:39,115 --> 01:20:41,719
You're done labeling
the entire world?

1461
01:20:42,444 --> 01:20:44,714
I don't care if you date
this girl or not,

1462
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:47,851
but you don't define
your father as a plumber,

1463
01:20:47,852 --> 01:20:51,466
or your sister as a dog walker
or yourself as a nurse.

1464
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:55,316
Your father...

1465
01:20:57,452 --> 01:21:01,976
loved people.
He loved his family.

1466
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,442
Yeah, he loved handball
a little too much,

1467
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:10,217
but he was a kind,
compassionate man...

1468
01:21:10,218 --> 01:21:13,685
who would have given the shirt off
this back to anybody.

1469
01:21:14,986 --> 01:21:18,985
There's no girl that's too good
for my Henry.

1470
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:23,794
I don't care how rich or pretty she is,
she'd be lucky to be loved by you.

1471
01:21:28,075 --> 01:21:30,775
I'm gonna go.

1472
01:21:32,874 --> 01:21:36,361
Yeah, I'm gonna go sell
some lubricants.

1473
01:21:36,362 --> 01:21:38,704
I'll see you later.

1474
01:21:39,914 --> 01:21:42,223
Hank!

1475
01:21:44,714 --> 01:21:47,056
(dog barking)

1476
01:22:53,738 --> 01:22:56,200
Yo, Henry.

1477
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:58,856
Yo, I don't want to sound
like a dick,

1478
01:22:58,857 --> 01:23:01,191
but George says you're not allowed
in this building no more.

1479
01:23:01,192 --> 01:23:03,015
Raul, I just need you
to call Scarlett.

1480
01:23:03,016 --> 01:23:05,384
- She's not here.
- Come on, Raul.

1481
01:23:05,385 --> 01:23:08,230
- Can't you just call her for me, please?
- I'm telling you, man,

1482
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:10,919
she's not here, for real.
They just left, the whole family.

1483
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,223
Do you know where
they were going?

1484
01:23:13,224 --> 01:23:15,016
I think they went to
the Gotham Club.

1485
01:23:15,017 --> 01:23:16,904
The Gotham Club?

1486
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:20,904
Your sister was here too.
She told me about your dad.

1487
01:23:20,905 --> 01:23:22,439
Sorry, buddy.

1488
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,167
If there's anything that we can,
you know...

1489
01:23:24,168 --> 01:23:26,600
Just, where is it? The Gotham place?
Do you know where it is?

1490
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:29,319
It's on Park and 55th.

1491
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,175
Park and 55th.
Thanks, man.

1492
01:23:31,176 --> 01:23:35,187
Hold on, man. You can't get in
wearing that bullshit.

1493
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:46,535
So what's your rush?

1494
01:23:46,536 --> 01:23:50,696
Uh, I think I really like this girl
and I might have blown it.

1495
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,512
Not so fast, hot shot.

1496
01:23:53,513 --> 01:23:56,677
Let me tell you something
about women...

1497
01:23:56,678 --> 01:24:00,211
never to be trusted
for a second.

1498
01:24:01,478 --> 01:24:04,165
I once had
a huge property...

1499
01:24:04,166 --> 01:24:07,501
swimming pool, tennis court,
waterfall.

1500
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:11,248
It was like heaven on earth, man.

1501
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:15,206
And this Svengali bitch
took me for everything.

1502
01:24:15,207 --> 01:24:18,471
Sorry to hear that, uh, Rajib.

1503
01:24:18,472 --> 01:24:21,063
Let me tell you something, kiddo:
"Run"!

1504
01:24:21,064 --> 01:24:24,647
Run like Seabiscuit, okay?

1505
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:28,757
And don't look back.
Never look back.

1506
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:32,805
Here we are, tiger.

1507
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:36,006
That will be... nine-seventy-five.

1508
01:24:36,007 --> 01:24:38,726
- Thanks for the advice.
- Anytime.

1509
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:43,055
Nine-seventy-five... 10 bucks.
25 cent tip. Now I can retire.

1510
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:46,450
Cheap bastard.

1511
01:24:48,614 --> 01:24:51,300
- May I help you, sir?
- Yeah, I'm here to see Scarlett Dowling.

1512
01:24:51,301 --> 01:24:54,053
- I think she's here already.
- Sir, if you're meeting the Dowling’s,

1513
01:24:54,054 --> 01:24:57,732
you cannot come into the club
without the correct attire... coat and tie,

1514
01:24:57,733 --> 01:25:01,004
no jeans, no sneakers.

1515
01:25:01,573 --> 01:25:03,812
Look, I don't suppose you'd
just let me run up there...

1516
01:25:03,813 --> 01:25:06,865
- and give her a message quickly?
- I'm afraid not.

1517
01:25:09,575 --> 01:25:12,165
How about this?
I'll let you hold my ID.

1518
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,769
Sir, this isn't a night club.

1519
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:17,681
No, right.

1520
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:22,033
I like your work.

1521
01:25:58,852 --> 01:26:01,076
Hey, boys.

1522
01:26:03,877 --> 01:26:06,052
Just another night on the job...

1523
01:26:06,053 --> 01:26:09,322
waitin', getting' food...

1524
01:26:14,372 --> 01:26:16,780
Takin' my break, guys.

1525
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:22,154
[Meredith]:
I cannot believe he ordered...

1526
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:30,030
You know, you're incorrigible.

1527
01:26:38,341 --> 01:26:41,284
- Henry?
- I need to talk to you.

1528
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:42,692
Couldn't you have just called?

1529
01:26:42,693 --> 01:26:44,707
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this, Mrs. Dowling,

1530
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:47,362
but I really need to talk to Scarlett.
Can I borrow her for a second?

1531
01:26:47,363 --> 01:26:49,698
Did you get dressed as a chef
just to get in here?

1532
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:51,746
Yes, sir, I did.

1533
01:26:51,747 --> 01:26:54,466
(laughs)
I like it.

1534
01:26:54,467 --> 01:26:57,092
You're the chap who
saved Buck, aren't you?

1535
01:26:57,093 --> 01:26:59,043
The doorman, Phillip.

1536
01:26:59,044 --> 01:27:01,636
Is there a problem, Mrs. Dowling?

1537
01:27:01,637 --> 01:27:03,811
Mother, don't.

1538
01:27:03,812 --> 01:27:07,236
I don't believe this man
belongs in the club.

1539
01:27:07,237 --> 01:27:09,923
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Dowling.

1540
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,363
Sir, you need to leave.

1541
01:27:11,364 --> 01:27:14,786
Wait a second.
Scarlett, hear me out.

1542
01:27:14,787 --> 01:27:17,795
And if you don't ever want to
talk to me again, that's fine,

1543
01:27:17,796 --> 01:27:20,194
but what I said before
was bullshit.

1544
01:27:20,195 --> 01:27:23,650
I don't care that you're Fifth Avenue
and I'm Flatbush. It doesn't matter.

1545
01:27:23,651 --> 01:27:25,731
I haven't stopped
thinking about you...

1546
01:27:25,732 --> 01:27:28,868
since that first time I saw you
getting out of the elevator.

1547
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,235
And you know what?
I don't care who knows it,

1548
01:27:31,236 --> 01:27:33,154
or what anybody else thinks.

1549
01:27:33,155 --> 01:27:35,522
And maybe I'll never be rich,

1550
01:27:35,523 --> 01:27:39,041
and maybe I'll never be a member
of a fancy club,

1551
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:41,264
but none of that matters to me.

1552
01:27:42,819 --> 01:27:44,321
That's very touching.

1553
01:27:44,322 --> 01:27:46,401
Mmm. Come on, let's go.

1554
01:27:46,402 --> 01:27:48,481
Let go of him.

1555
01:27:48,482 --> 01:27:51,937
Mother, I'm leaving
with Henry.

1556
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:55,073
Scarlett, you will do nothing of the sort.
Come back here and sit down.

1557
01:27:55,074 --> 01:27:59,566
Why, Mother? Because you're afraid
I'm going to embarrass you?

1558
01:28:01,155 --> 01:28:03,778
Look, everyone.

1559
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,725
Meredith Dowling's daughter
is leaving with the doorman.

1560
01:28:08,739 --> 01:28:11,617
Don't worry. He's not
a doorman anymore.

1561
01:28:11,618 --> 01:28:14,209
Mother had him fired.

1562
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:17,025
- Scarlett, come back here.
- Meredith...

1563
01:28:17,026 --> 01:28:21,058
be quiet.
Let them be.

1564
01:28:21,059 --> 01:28:23,713
Scarlett.

1565
01:28:23,714 --> 01:28:26,242
Henry.
How are you?

1566
01:28:26,243 --> 01:28:28,674
Not too bad.
How are you doing, Buck?

1567
01:28:28,675 --> 01:28:32,193
Just trying to stay sober.
Every day's a struggle.

1568
01:28:32,194 --> 01:28:35,520
Nice to see you, Buck.
We were just leaving.

1569
01:28:35,521 --> 01:28:36,903
Okay.

1570
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:40,575
Gretchen?

1571
01:28:40,576 --> 01:28:42,886
You're a hooker.

1572
01:28:44,257 --> 01:28:47,328
Hey, you're not a hooker.
Come on.

1573
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:49,388
- Promise?
- Yeah.

1574
01:29:01,281 --> 01:29:04,016
Well, that went well.

1575
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:09,217
Gotta gift, hesitate...

1576
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:12,801
Never make
the same mistakes...

1577
01:29:12,802 --> 01:29:16,416
If he could only see
the person...

1578
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:20,992
If he could only stay
the same...

1579
01:29:20,993 --> 01:29:24,768
Sweetheart...

1580
01:29:24,769 --> 01:29:28,608
Sweetheart...

1581
01:29:28,609 --> 01:29:31,297
Sweetheart...

1582
01:29:31,298 --> 01:29:33,055
I could help you...

1583
01:29:33,056 --> 01:29:37,133
Open and unfurl.

1584
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:43,520
[Raul]:
She sure is beautiful.

1585
01:29:43,521 --> 01:29:44,991
Oh, thanks, baby.

1586
01:29:44,992 --> 01:29:46,975
No, I was talking about
Lady Liberty.

1587
01:29:46,976 --> 01:29:49,568
Not that you're not
beautiful and all.

1588
01:29:49,569 --> 01:29:51,775
It's just, you know,
being up under her torch,

1589
01:29:51,776 --> 01:29:54,688
she sort of makes us
all feel equal.

1590
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,991
Black or white,
rich or poor,

1591
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,711
- Mets or Yankees.
- Jets or Giants.

1592
01:29:59,712 --> 01:30:02,398
- Nicks or Nets.
- Rangers or Islanders.

1593
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:05,502
- Nice.
- Broadway or peep shows.

1594
01:30:05,503 --> 01:30:08,127
Broadway or peep shows?

1595
01:30:08,128 --> 01:30:09,758
Lower East
or Crown Heights.

1596
01:30:09,759 --> 01:30:11,390
- That's better.
- That's my baby.

1597
01:30:11,391 --> 01:30:13,567
- Queen of the Concrete...
- Cab or subway.

1598
01:30:13,568 --> 01:30:15,840
With heels on your small feet...

1599
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:18,431
Your head at an angle...

1600
01:30:18,432 --> 01:30:21,248
Like you know
something... thing...

1601
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,550
Like you know something...

1602
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:26,078
And the car
takes a right turn...

1603
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:28,349
It rolls to a slow burn...

1604
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:31,038
And you start shaking...

1605
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,174
Because it's just what
you do do...

1606
01:30:34,175 --> 01:30:36,510
It's just what you do...

1607
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:38,430
Little hula girl...

1608
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:41,310
Absorbing the world...

1609
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:43,486
And you can swing
your round hips...

1610
01:30:43,487 --> 01:30:46,207
Make the grass skirt swirl...

1611
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,542
Oh, little hula girl...

1612
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:51,390
You're not a plastic pearl...

1613
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:53,886
And it'll all spin around you...

1614
01:30:53,887 --> 01:30:56,254
On a tilted world...

1615
01:30:56,255 --> 01:30:59,454
Oh, you never even make
a sound sound...

1616
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,758
You never make a sound...

1617
01:31:01,759 --> 01:31:04,573
Does it ever get you
down down?

1618
01:31:04,574 --> 01:31:07,395
Does it ever get you down?

1619
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:13,930
You know it
when you wake up...

1620
01:31:15,487 --> 01:31:19,614
Put on your shirt
and go out...

1621
01:31:19,615 --> 01:31:21,726
You should know the way
by heart...

1622
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:26,828
Now we hardly even know it
when it's gone...

1623
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:37,277
The days, the nights,
truck in...

1624
01:31:37,278 --> 01:31:41,565
You hardly even guard
yourself to breathe...

1625
01:31:41,566 --> 01:31:44,381
He calls you in the morning...

1626
01:31:44,382 --> 01:31:49,484
And you would never
change it for the world...

1627
01:31:50,302 --> 01:31:55,324
Hard days keep moving in...

1628
01:31:55,325 --> 01:31:57,757
I'm a teenager...

1629
01:31:57,758 --> 01:32:01,158
I am anxious
in repose...

1630
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:08,845
(vocalizing)

1631
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:49,668
If somebody were gonna
lay down...

1632
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:55,484
You wouldn't even try,
now would you?

1633
01:32:55,485 --> 01:32:58,556
We used to be
the fighters here...

1634
01:32:58,557 --> 01:33:02,786
We didn't want it anymore...

1635
01:33:08,094 --> 01:33:11,395
Since that
we're giving up now...

1636
01:33:13,468 --> 01:33:17,595
Didn't even try to support it...

1637
01:33:17,596 --> 01:33:20,570
No one ever reaches there...

1638
01:33:20,571 --> 01:33:25,786
No one ever reaches there
at all...

1639
01:33:25,787 --> 01:33:31,323
Hard days keep coming...

1640
01:33:31,324 --> 01:33:34,074
I'm tense...

1641
01:33:34,075 --> 01:33:36,732
I'm anxious in repose...

1642
01:33:36,733 --> 01:33:41,540
I changed,
I came home.

1643
01:33:42,427 --> 01:33:45,511
(vocalizing)
