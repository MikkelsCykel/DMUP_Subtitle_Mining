1
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,400
I think I saw something!

2
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,700
Steady lads!

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,800
Past the French border and
we'll be safe over there!

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
Falcon!

5
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
- Private, coming in hot!
- Then lift it 30!

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Stay with me, private! Private!

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,700
Wing commander Gutsy,
this just came from a sea border.

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,700
- None of them made it back alive.
- None of them?

9
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,600
- But those were some of our top fliers.
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm just a messenger pigeon.

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,200
If we don't find some more birds fast,
our goose is going to be cooked.

11
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,100
VALIANT

12
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
BIRDS ON THE MARCH

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,000
Across the nation and the globe

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,900
pigeons are taking wing
in a fight for freedom.

15
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,300
Delivering top secret messages
from behind enemy lines,

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,700
these fine pigeons are
applied of the allied forces.

17
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,800
It's the Royal Homing Pigeon
Service that leads the way.

18
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,300
Whether cutting through enemy
lines or just coming wise.

19
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,300
These power pigeons are
the marvel of bird.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
But don't come for dubs.

21
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,300
War bomb birds play a vital role
in raising seed for the troops.

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Wait a minute.

23
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,800
Nursing girls at two o'clock.
Now that's what I call a task force.

24
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,300
Laundry bird bath. Why not?

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
These hotty heroes need to look their best.

26
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,000
Of course not just any pigeon
can make the cut out.

27
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,300
But there's always room for a few recruits.

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,300
And there they go. Off to
another exciting mission.

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,900
Homing pigeons, we salute you!

30
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,000
This is a shot boys, watch this.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,900
Two in the corner, eight...

32
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,600
- Valiant, do you mind?
- Sorry. Felix!

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Felix, I could do it!
I could do that, Felix!

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,500
- Do what, lad?
- I could be one of those brave recruits.

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,900
Taking wing in a fight for freedom,
I know I could! I know it!

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Valiant! Did I ever tell you?
When I was your age,

37
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,800
I was all ready on the cost of France.

38
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Aquatic brigade.
Gull division.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,700
If it weren't for that wooden drum
taken that shram deck,

40
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,800
- I'd be there right now.
- Maybe you're right.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm just what they're looking for,
a pigeon with that something extra.

42
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,200
You know it's not a wing spand,
it's a size of a spirit!

43
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Look at them!

44
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
Look at that move!

45
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,000
Royal Homing Pigeon Service! Magnificent!

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Commander Gutsy!
The most decorated pigeon ever!

47
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,200
- Much obliged. Thank you, thank you.
- Who will have a drink with me now!

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,100
- What would it be, boys?
- Hot juice, shaken, not stirred.

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,700
He has always drinks on the house!

50
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,600
- Hot juice. Shaken. Not stirred.
- Merci beaucoup.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,900
He's from France!

52
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,800
- So, what's the news from the front?
- Can't say of course. Classified.

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,900
But danger is our business. And I'm
sorry to say, business is all too good.

54
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,600
Let me through! Got to get
to wing commander now!

55
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,500
- Excuse me, wing commander!
- Yes?

56
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,200
- Sir, where do I sign up?
- Aren't you a bit underwaist?

57
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,900
Talking about small wings, man.

58
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,200
There's always a place
for a few valiant birds.

59
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,000
Sign up is tomorrow in London.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,700
I'd love to stay and chat, but
duty calls and we must answer.

61
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Dukes up, boys!
Let's make wing.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,100
Hip hip hurray!

63
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,500
General!

64
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,900
You've come back, general Von Talon.

65
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Congratulations, sir.

66
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Under the Geneva convention as an officer

67
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,900
I have the right to be treated as a pigeon of war.

68
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,900
Have no fear, you will be.

69
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,700
Take him to the cage!

70
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,200
Get your talons off me!

71
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,100
Pigeons, ascetic little creatures.

72
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,400
You don't eat your prisoners at war, do you?

73
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,400
Eat you!

74
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm a vegetarian.

75
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,800
Have you ever worn cape?

76
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,100
- Who is your contact in resistance?
- You know they'll send a crack team to rescue me?

77
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,600
Rescue you?
You're a pigeon!

78
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,800
- How important do you think you are?
- VIP. Very Important Pigeon!

79
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:37,600
Very Impudent Pigeon!
Who is your contact in Resistance?

80
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,500
Speak!

81
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,400
This canary will never say it.

82
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,700
- Listen to your mother, you can't go!
- Mom, there's a war going on and I want to do my bit!

83
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,200
- Why! Why! Why!
- Oh, mom! Good bye.

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,900
Please listen to what I tell you!

85
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,300
- Mom!
- You little baby!

86
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,400
Mother, it's not helping!

87
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,800
- Mother, honestly, I'm going to be fine!
- You were such a cute little egg!

88
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,300
Mom, I'm not an egg anymore!
It's time I left the nest.

89
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
No one thinks I can do this.

90
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,900
Maybe my only chance to show them
and myself that they're wrong!

91
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,800
Well, at least have some
breakfast before you go.

92
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Mom, no thanks.

93
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,000
- Valiant!
- Right then.

94
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
I love you.
Good bye!

95
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,500
My little baby.

96
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,600
- Go there Valiant!
- I'm off now Felix! Wish me luck!

97
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,500
- Good luck!
- Good bye!

98
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
That boy is gonna do great.

99
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
LONDON 57

100
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Valiant pigeon! Fearless flier!

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Flier in the ally forces.

102
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,100
Fight the enemy.
Not fight the ladies.

103
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Spits danger smack in the eye!

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,900
Look at that!
It's London!

105
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,500
Oh, this is easy.
I mean you go as I tell you.

106
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,900
All you're gonna do, keep
your eyes on the pebble.

107
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,300
Give a chance to boogie this day.

108
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,100
Find her and the
crumbs is yours!

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,300
Has it gone that way,
that way or has it not?

110
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Find her and the crumbs is yours!
Which way is under?

111
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,600
- That one!
- That one?

112
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Oh, no! Bad luck again!

113
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,300
Get one more go! I think
you're gonna win this time.

114
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,400
Serious thing, which
one has the pebble?

115
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,100
Wow! I know you're excited...

116
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
Why don't you set again...

117
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,200
- You've been cheating! Give me my crumbs back!
- Listen. I know what you're thinking...

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Come and get me, falcons!

119
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,800
Strike me down if I tell you lie.

120
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,100
Look at him. That was lucky.

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
Prayed for answer, that's
never worked before but...

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hello, mate! Lost control, but then you
could not offict by the time you drop in.

123
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,800
- Bugsy is the name.
- I'm terribly sorry, I'm Valiant.

124
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,700
- So what brings you to my manner?
- I've come to be an aviator.

125
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,800
With the Royal Homing Pigeon Service.
Fighting for king and country!

126
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,900
I've never been much of the
howling glory bird myself.

127
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,900
I'm rather partial to a little
something called freedom.

128
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Yeah, I fleet about as at least.

129
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
Now I tell you what to do, all way to do it.

130
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,600
- Are those flies?
- Oh, they're friends of mine.

131
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,200
So, RHPS recruit,
right this way mate.

132
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,500
I'm feeling rather patriotic
myself all of a sudden.

133
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,600
- There he is!
- Come on, after him.

134
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Let's keep going, come on.

135
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,600
He's here somewhere.
I can smell him.

136
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
Follow in here.

137
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,600
- Hello. Two on the list please.
- Valiant pigeon.

138
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,500
- Reporting for duty, sir.
- Never heard of you.

139
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Valiant pigeon.
The Valiant pigeon.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
- You don't have Valiant on your list?
- No!

141
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,700
- Clerical error.
- Should I have?

142
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,100
Yes, I think you should have.
Look at him, he's a perfect specimen.

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,100
He's as fast as lightning,
strong as knocks.

144
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
Fits all for high standard.

145
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,600
The bird's a legend
in his Hempshire area.

146
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,000
Too small! He should be yea high
and he's not even hey high.

147
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,500
- Charming, that's charming.
- But you!

148
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,400
- Have you by any chance heard of a war fare?
- I've got me a rare feather condition.

149
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,300
Makes me itch.

150
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Clear of the territory. Get lost!

151
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,400
- But, wing commander Gutsy...
- Yes. Wing commander Gatsy. That's right.

152
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,500
Valiant is the best mate.
They went to school together.

153
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,300
You don't wanna get on
the wrong side with him,

154
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,200
if he hears about this you're
gonna lose those stripes, mate.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,200
- You know wing commander Gutsy, you say?
- Well... Oh, yeah.

156
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,000
- Well, that makes a difference. Sign here.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,000
There he is!
You clowns!

158
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,500
When I get hold of you,
I'm gonna knock your beak!

159
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,100
- Hey! That's it! Enough.
- Get your wings of me!

160
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,100
- Where do I sign up?
- Just sign here.

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,700
- All right, in you go.
- Thank you, sir.

162
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,900
Who is this Gutsy anyway?

163
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
If I see your ugly face around
here, I'm gonna have you!

164
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
- We made it!
- Sight on town.

165
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,600
We're in the Royal Homing Pigeon Service!

166
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,900
The elite of the elite! Fighting
the heroic battle to save...

167
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,500
Save? I'll tell you for this.
Each word like a charm.

168
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,700
So with that I'll be here to sky way.

169
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,900
Cheers mate, good luck. God bless.

170
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,000
If you get back in one piece, be sure to...

171
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Hello? Hello?

172
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,500
Gents, hello! Hello!

173
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,000
- No! There's been a terrible mistake!
- Trust me, this is all gonna work out brilliantly.

174
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
Hey! Come on! Come back!

175
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,900
It's so bright.

176
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
- Sorry about that.
- You'll be good, you little fellow.

177
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,600
Hey, little fellow! It's not the
size of your wing spand, no!

178
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,700
- It's the size of your spirit!
- If you say so, mate.

179
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
- Can't argue with that.
- I'm Tailfeather, this is Toughwood, my brother.

180
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,400
Not the sharp to speak on, block.

181
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,000
- What?
- But...

182
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,700
If you're ever in the scrum, there's
no better bird to be your team.

183
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,900
Absolutely.

184
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,600
- Nice to meet you. I'm Valiant.
- Valiant? It's good to meet you.

185
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,700
Let's go! It's two foot to Tailfeather.

186
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,500
Quite elite unit, on quote they
seem to let in anything with wings.

187
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,800
Including those flies.
Certainly your bottom.

188
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,400
- Wait! Who do you think you are?
- I'm Lofty, tedious word to pigeon.

189
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,500
I come from a long and
honourable line of warrior pigeons.

190
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,300
Lads!

191
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,400
I trust you had a blaze of journey.

192
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,600
Well, I think I'll speak for all of us when I say
the right must have been bumping on the way.

193
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,700
Maybe check the suspension on that motivate.

194
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
We are thirsty, if we could have some
cold drinks, that would be nice.

195
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,100
Oh, that certainly can be arranged.

196
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Line up! Spread feathers and
tell me you're flamingo!

197
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,500
So that's it in all.

198
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,800
For the next six weeks
your tails belong to me.

199
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,500
You'll learn to march like bird,
fly like bird and fight like bird.

200
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,200
I will make birds of you,
turkeys even if it kills you!

201
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,900
- Except you. You won't last a week.
- Permission to die trying, sir!

202
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,100
It's like this, ladies. You will shape up
and you will shape up fast

203
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,800
or I will personally draw
you out of the claw!

204
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,000
Funny, you should. I would love to get drown
down, I was gonna bring out a few hutton.

205
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,300
- Hey, leave him alone! He help me to...
- Hut down, beaks queek.

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,300
I'm more interested in letting
you all drop and give me 50

207
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,300
courtesy of your short little friend here.

208
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Training at last.

209
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,400
I say wouldn't it be more sporting if the
chap who actually committed the...

210
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,300
Gentlemen, welcome to the
Royal Homing Pigeon Service.

211
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
For the last time what was your mission?

212
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,600
And where are these
messages coming from?

213
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
Very well. Have it your way.

214
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,000
- Allow us to black out his feathers!
- And his knees.

215
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,700
And his feelings.

216
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,900
No, worse. Much worse.

217
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,900
We have ways of making you squawk.

218
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,600
What kind of birds are you?

219
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,500
This is hugely!

220
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
One two, one two and hop!

221
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,700
Now forward report
to the nursing docs.

222
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,300
- Hello nurse.
- Look at that!

223
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,800
- I've been waiting for you.
- Do you have a little something

224
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,700
for a brave pigeon about to
go into battle? Hey, darling?

225
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,200
It just so happens I do
have something for you.

226
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,600
- Did you hear that?
- Is this what you had in mind?

227
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,100
Wow. It's awfully big. You're
kind of short for a nurse.

228
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,600
Look who's talking, I'd say you're kind
of short for a carrier pigeon.

229
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,400
- I'm Valiant by the way.
- All right then Valiant. I'm Victoria.

230
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,900
I know you lads have had a tiring day,
and what you need is a nice relaxing shower.

231
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Then you are to a fancy dinner.

232
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,400
We'll get your little feather cut.

233
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
Set you up with some uniforms.

234
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,000
- Oh, sorry fellows.
- You got me!

235
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
That's it!

236
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,000
Come here!

237
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,200
We're all turning for a good night sleep.

238
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,400
So this is where the smelly rotten
bits of disgusting refue set up.

239
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,400
And our sleeping quarters would be well.

240
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,200
Never sleep in the attic.

241
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:10,500
- Well, this isn't so bad.
- Oh, just like home.

242
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I've had enough!

243
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Speak!

244
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,000
Lieutenant Mercury, Royal
Homing Pigeon Service, 4121444697.

245
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Bring me the truth serum.

246
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,300
Come on, come on.

247
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,400
- One shot of this and we will know everything.
- I'll never talk! Never! Never!

248
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,100
Wakey wakey!

249
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,500
You bad reigns are squad F.
You know what that means?

250
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,500
Squad Fantastic!

251
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,300
Philosophical!

252
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:25,400
No, it means you are
the fliers of the future.

253
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,200
The far future!
But mind you're somehow

254
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,800
estimate you the carrier pigeons of today.

255
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
Good maneuver. It might work
if you kept your eyes open.

256
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,000
- Back to your nursy down there.
- Thanks, Bugsy.

257
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,300
You must really like it here, because this
is the third time you get to see me.

258
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,600
- I wish you be more careful.
- Oh, don't you worry.

259
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
Where I come from, danger is our business.

260
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,600
Oh yeah, we spit danger in the eye.

261
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,100
If the condition, I can take it.

262
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,900
- And where do you come from?
- West Nestington.

263
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,600
That's near Nestington, it's
some close to the west actually.

264
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Oh, Valiant!

265
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,300
Well I have to return to my duties, so...

266
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
- Good bye.
- Oh, Valiant wait!

267
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,800
As homing pigeons it's our
duty to transport messages.

268
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,100
In a worst of conditions
wind, hail, slip, snow,

269
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,700
bombs exploding, bullets flying
and as if that weren't enough,

270
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,900
mother nature has the audacity
to create a little something called

271
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
The Falcon.

272
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,500
Twenty pounds of pigeon eating muscle,
measuring five of your wing spands.

273
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,000
They like to fly seek their pray,
speed excessive 200 miles per hour.

274
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,300
But not to buy it. Not yet.

275
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,100
The first strike is merely for impact.
They'll let you drop of it.

276
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,800
They make sure you're defenseless, and
scoop you up in their razor sharp talons.

277
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:21,400
And in the dark of the night you'll have not a
split second to recognize friend from foe.

278
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,700
Friend or foe?

279
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
- Foe!
- No!

280
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,600
You idiots, it's a pigeon!
Friend or foe?

281
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,400
- Foe! No!
- Friend!

282
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,900
- No, it's a foe.
- Yes, yes!

283
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,800
Friend or foe?

284
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,600
- Friend!
- Friend!

285
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,200
99. 100. 101. 102.

286
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,200
To survive his mission a pigeon must have
the strength to carry his message capsule.

287
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
You must have the speed
to fly like the wind.

288
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,600
You must have the ability
to vault maneuver the enemy.

289
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,600
And you must have the
endurance to battle relevance

290
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,300
flying long distances over raging suds.

291
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,400
- Me again.
- Valiant.

292
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,900
Oh, my favourite!
How did you know?

293
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,800
The parrot is to be right about we doing!

294
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:28,700
This is why I think I'm afraid of height!
You are afraid of height!

295
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,500
- That's it!
- Come on!

296
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,600
- Good afternoon.
- Hello Guts. What news?

297
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,400
Not good I'm afraid. We just
lost squadron E over Belgium.

298
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,100
That means these new
recruits are at any chance.

299
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,600
- They have to leave tomorrow.
- You can't be serious.

300
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,800
They haven't even finished the training.

301
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Sorry, but those are the orders. Have
them ready at 8.00 tomorrow. Cheers.

302
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,500
Commandor Gutsy is here, so I
suppose you'll be out soon.

303
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,100
I know! I know! I can't wait! This is
the moment I've been waiting for!

304
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,200
Well, I'd like to be part of
what you come home to.

305
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,400
I don't care if you're a hero. Just
concentrate on your getting back.

306
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,200
You need to understand something, lads.

307
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,600
Our losses have been heavy. We got to stop it.

308
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:59,900
You're all we've got! And so
today we fight for our country.

309
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,700
Tommorow our feathers may be
flopped from our rifless bodies.

310
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:13,400
And our bones bend to rubbed
weasels. But never mind that.

311
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,400
On this day in this place
let it forever be known

312
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,000
that you, pigeons did your
part in the heroic battle for...

313
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,100
- Seeds!
- Freedom!

314
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,600
Right! You will be commander
Gutsy support wing.

315
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,500
I expect you to do whatever it takes
to ensure the success of this mission.

316
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,900
Chaps, the message we have been sent
to carry is of the utmost importance.

317
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,300
The upcome of the war could well depend on it.

318
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,000
We pigeons have never been entrusted
with more critical or dangerous mission.

319
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,300
May you fly straight! And may
your instinct guide you home.

320
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,200
- What did Gutsy mean by highly dangerous?
- I don't know. But I can tell you this.

321
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:15,200
I am a bird of principle. And
my number one principle is

322
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,800
don't get involved with anything
called highly dangerous!

323
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,700
And I will never violate my beliefs. Do
not ask me to violate my beliefs.

324
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
You're talking to the wrong pigeon.

325
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Sir, point of clarification please.
Recalling the highly dangerous mission.

326
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,500
I truly regret that I have but one
life to give for my country.

327
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,400
- I'd love to die. But I can't. Not on Sunday.
- Are you finished?

328
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,400
Not quite, listen, maybe I'm not
that conscientious, but I do object.

329
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Get back to the barracks! Now!

330
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,300
Do I still have to go on
a dangerous mission?

331
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,400
- Now!
- Yep.

332
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,900
- Take that as yes, I do.
- Now!

333
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,200
- Hey, where are you going?
- Keep it down, mate.

334
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,600
- Got some serious flying ahead.
- Flying, what do you mean flying?

335
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,100
- Flying to where?
- Back to old Trafalgar square, son.

336
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,900
- You're not leaving, you'll break up the team.
- Team? I'm not a team player.

337
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,300
These question aren't why I'm
leaving, but why you're staying?

338
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,800
Why am I staying? Because
it's my duty, it's our duty!

339
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,100
Hold on! Sorry!
Did I miss something?

340
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,500
Did we start this? No.
Did we make those?

341
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,100
All those? I've seen them before, mate.
And this is not a great sight.

342
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,600
The truth is, I'm scared.

343
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Don't tell them that.
Cause I'll deny it.

344
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,800
- Well, I'm scared too.
- Then come with me.

345
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,100
- Just have the square we asked. Come on!
- We didn't make Trafalgar square either.

346
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Where do we go if they start
dropping bombs there?

347
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,600
- No, I'm staying. I'm doing my bit.
- Yeah, luck to you, mate.

348
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,500
Anyway, keep your wings in front of you.

349
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,400
- What's up then?
- What's going on?

350
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,100
It's time for me to fly home, all right?
So I guess this is farewell.

351
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,700
- Wait, where are you going?
- You can't just leave, Bugsy.

352
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,900
Look, I've got urgent
business to take care of.

353
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,500
I better catch the wind
while it's blowing.

354
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,500
Look me up when you get back, kid!
You know where I'll be!

355
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,900
Gentlemen, take your places!

356
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,000
Our mission is to be dropped behind
enemy lines in occupied France.

357
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,300
To make contact with
the French resistance.

358
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,100
To get a top secret message and bring it
back here by sun dawn tomorrow.

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,100
Good luck. The fate of the freedom
loving world depends on us.

360
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,200
- Wait!
- Hey, Bugsy!

361
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,600
You can't go without me!
I can't let you go with glory!

362
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,900
Good luck, lads.

363
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,900
- Hey, Bugsy! Thanks for coming back!
- I'll tell you the truth,

364
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,500
it's the first work worth I've ever done.

365
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,700
We're gonna be fine. Right, Lofty?

366
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,900
Indubitably! Birds of a feather are all that.

367
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,600
- Going off to you mate, we stick together.
- Hey Tailfeather, can you believe that

368
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,700
we're the ones they pick to save the
most important mission in World War II?

369
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,200
- Yeah!
- Me too!

370
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Truthfully, I'm not a good singer anyway.

371
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:37,800
- Enough already! You've been chattering for days!
- Hey, who gave me the serum?

372
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,500
You want me to talk, okay I'm talking.

373
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,200
I'm glad you did this. Homing
Pigeon recruit is only good,

374
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
but it's a stiff effort beat
rubbish all the time.

375
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,600
I got feelings and I wanna express them.

376
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,100
I always used to think my favourite
color was blue, cause it's for boys...

377
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,300
Shut up!

378
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,200
I didn't deserve that treatment I mean
most of you treat me like this!

379
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,500
Even that charming Resistance chat
with that fabulos view over harbour

380
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,400
the last time I was in the attic in San Pierre...

381
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
San Pierre.

382
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,300
The truth serum is genious.
Cover his cage!

383
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,000
- I'm curious what is your favourite color?
- Pink!

384
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,800
Not a hot pink, just a kind of pink pink.

385
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,200
You know what I mean, just pink.

386
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,400
- Excuse me.
- I like pink too.

387
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,000
Come on! Cheer up, Valiant!
It's difficult for me.

388
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,400
- Gentlemen, get ready to drop!
- Are you ready to drop?

389
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,500
I think I'm not that ready!

390
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,300
It's okay to be scared, fellows!
I'd be worried if you weren't.

391
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,300
It won't get past,
but you'll get used to it!

392
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,300
Go! Go! Go!

393
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,800
It's stuck!

394
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,000
- Sir, let me help you!
- No! Go now! That's an order!

395
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,500
Yes, sir.

396
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,100
Come on Gutsy,
get out of there!

397
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,600
Oh, come on.

398
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,000
- Hello? Hello? Will you help chaps?
- Hold on there, we'll get you out.

399
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,400
Yeah, little bit of a tenuous landing.
Are you saying it got to be worse?

400
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,700
Look out!

401
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,900
- Sorry Lofty.
- Not to worry, old chap.

402
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
What's that? Bit of a muddle.

403
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,600
- But at least we're all in one peace.
- Not quite all.

404
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,300
- Where's Gutsy?
- He was still in the plane.

405
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:42,800
- What do you mean he was still in the plane?
- His cage got stuck. I don't think he got out.

406
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,900
That's it! We're dead!
We're finished! Nice knowing you.

407
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,300
You're quite mistaking, boy.
I'm sure he made it out.

408
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,800
Gutsy always makes it out, he's going to
come and find us any minute now.

409
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,300
And give us the plans for the mission.

410
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,000
- Then who has back up plan?
- You want the back up plan?

411
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,100
- We die. That's the back up plan.
- But I'm not ready to die!

412
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,200
- Am I ready? No one's asked me!
- So many books to read! Regret!

413
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
We're dead. Thank you very much.

414
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,800
Everyone be quiet. Quiet!

415
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,300
We need a plan.

416
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,400
And the plan is, is to find a safe
location to plan the next move.

417
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:36,300
- You heard the bird.
- So our plan is to make a plan?

418
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,300
Come on.

419
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
France is spooky.

420
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Quiet! Did you hear that?
There's someone in there!

421
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,800
Somebody better go and have a look.

422
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,700
All right, I'll go.

423
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
All righty turkies, let's go.

424
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,300
Valiant, just pull yourself together.
There's nothing in here.

425
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,700
Unless you're counting guns, bombs,
all the falcons, pigeon eating falcons.

426
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,900
Pigeon eating falcons!

427
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Tailfeather, you grabbed the grail.

428
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,000
Hello, my pigeon friends.
You are the RHPS, no?

429
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:05,000
- French resistance, Mers division.
- I'm glad to see you. I'll tell you.

430
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,700
- How did you find us?
- Well, there was the plane and the explosion.

431
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
And this gleaming and pleeding.

432
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,300
More scleemings and beggins and cryings,
whinings, winging, yelling, poohing.

433
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,300
- Enough about that.
- Absolutely.

434
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,500
Definitely, yep.

435
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,800
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Charles De Girl.

436
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:33,700
- De Girl? Why did they call you De Girl?
- Because I am a girl. The one and only girl.

437
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,100
- I like France.
- Do you speak French?

438
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,200
- Well, may we...
- Does o la la mean anything to you?

439
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,500
Or wa wa woom! Bon jour?

440
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,000
All right! We don't have time for this!
You have a message, we have a mission.

441
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,800
- Let's get on with it!
- Not so fast, monsieur!

442
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,000
This is Rollo. He's an expert in sa...

443
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,200
Sabotage!

444
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,400
Sabotage!

445
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,900
Pardon.

446
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,500
Now monsieur, before you
continue on your mission,

447
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,900
it's our national cost on to...
- Break the bridge?

448
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,900
- Cut the cheese.
- Thank you for your hospitality,

449
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,200
but we just don't have time to eat.
And anyway we're birds.

450
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,800
- We don't eat cheese.
- We don't?

451
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,300
- Look, about that message.
- We will take you to it. But the road is dangerous.

452
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,600
And guarded by the enemy falcon.

453
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,300
But this cannot be a problem for
such highly trained pigeons.

454
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,800
- That is why you are squad A?
- The things is you see...

455
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,200
- Squad B.
- Not squad B.

456
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,500
Squad C?

457
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,300
You are squad D?

458
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,300
Just between us, squad D was never
really what it was cracked up to be.

459
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,100
I will not lie to you, you will
definitely be among the falcons.

460
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:16,000
- Wow, that was a fine fromage.
- Can you burp on Q?

461
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,800
I can burp on all the letters. Not just Q.

462
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,200
Watch this. A. B. C.

463
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,900
Be silent! The falcons!

464
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
- I say!
- Excuse me.

465
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,300
Come on.

466
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,300
Falcons!

467
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,900
All clear!

468
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,300
Stop that!

469
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,400
Oh, squad F.

470
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,600
- We are here.
- This is invigorating.

471
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,600
The attic! There it is!
Fly, English pigeons! Fly!

472
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,300
- Oh, dear. Sorry.
- Dirty bird!

473
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,800
Lofty pigeon at your service.
Hold on, mademoiselle!

474
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,800
He's heavy, this one!

475
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,500
Faster!

476
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,200
Sabotage!

477
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,700
To the right!
I'm gonna get you!

478
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,200
Hold on, De Girl!

479
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,200
This is it!

480
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,700
I must do the secret knock.

481
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
- Who is it?
- De Girl.

482
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,100
- You must do the secret password.
- Jacques, there is no time!

483
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,700
- Have you any?
- Wine?

484
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,200
No, no, that is yesterday's password.

485
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,400
- Trees?
- No.

486
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,300
- Seeds?
- No, no.

487
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,800
Falcons!

488
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,900
Jacques, move it!

489
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
- Let me give you le message.
- You can give me le massage.

490
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,900
Pretty sure it's a full body massage.

491
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,300
Message! The message that is to go to
London. Our freedom depends on it.

492
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,600
And who carries them?

493
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,300
- Wait. I'll take it.
- Bugsy?

494
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,400
- And you said you weren't the team player.
- I see it my own way.

495
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
- Good luck, Bugsy.
- Fly straight.

496
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,400
And let our instincts guide us home.

497
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,600
Good bye. And good luck, pigeons!

498
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,300
Okay, farewell.

499
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,000
Absolutely charmed.

500
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,300
Just one tiny thing. How are we gonna
get out of there! We're trapped!

501
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,200
I've got an idea!
I've got an idea!

502
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,400
Where are they?

503
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,700
Let's go!

504
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,100
- Hey, it worked like a charm!
- They'll be teaching that one in the Academy!

505
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,900
- I just thought the others are okay.
- Count on it!

506
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,400
Let's go.

507
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,200
I say let go!

508
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,400
You can't do better than
that, you English pigeon!

509
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,900
Bugsy!

510
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,300
Bugsy!

511
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,900
Bugsy!

512
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,200
It was not easy, herr
general. But I have...

513
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,400
catched their leader!
- The leader?

514
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,100
No, perhaps, assisstant leader.

515
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,500
- But along, herr general.
- Get on with it!

516
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,000
May I present you,

517
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,000
the message! Ta-ta.

518
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,800
The high commander will be pleased!

519
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:09,900
There will be medals, photographs,
commemorative spanks!

520
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,800
I will personally deliver it to him.

521
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:24,900
They must be desperate indeed to give the
message to this putrid smelling reject.

522
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,700
Oh no, Dennis! You're squished!
He was my favourite.

523
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,700
I am putrid stinky rub. Eat me,
you'll be sick for a week.

524
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,900
- Take him away!
- No!

525
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,600
I've got feather condition!

526
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Wait. On second thoughts
he may prove useful.

527
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,600
Yes! Oh, yes!

528
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh, thank you.
You're very wise.

529
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,600
What would you like?
Cards? We can play cards.

530
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,900
Find the pebble?
I've got a lovely voice.

531
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,500
That would be noisy...

532
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,900
I was thinking more along
delights of a celebration dinner.

533
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,800
Celebration dinner!
Brilliant idea!

534
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,500
I cook well, I cook well!

535
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,700
I can make great crumbs in oven.

536
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,800
Oh, you haven't tried my
bread crumb bird seed thing.

537
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,400
No, pigeon on the glass.

538
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,900
It was a lovely liebfrau reduction.

539
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,900
What did you do to him?

540
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,700
- You're all right, mate?
- Wait a minute now!

541
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,800
That little bell should be over there!

542
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,100
Who was I kidding?
I don't belong here.

543
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,000
I've let everyone down. Folks even
wouldn't be here if it weren't for me.

544
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,000
Folks! There's Valiant! Follow me!

545
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,100
Hey! Lofty! Toughwood!

546
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,500
- Chaps!
- Gutsy! You're alive!

547
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,700
What happened?
Tell us what happened!

548
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,800
Plane exploded. Shoot gave out.

549
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,500
Free fall at 300 feet. Set on fire.

550
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,400
Flew through barbed wire, picked up
some shrap from a straight granade.

551
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,900
Thought I was on the wrong
move. And here we are.

552
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,500
Right! We can dispense
with the chit chat.

553
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,000
I guess the falcons require the message.

554
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,300
- Yes, sir.
- Where's Bugsy?

555
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,200
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The falcons got Bugsy and the message.

556
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,900
- Which way did they go?
- That way.

557
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,800
Oh, no!

558
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,400
Britania rolls way!

559
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,000
Come on, pull yourself
together. Snap out of it!

560
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,800
Come Bugsy, let's find us
the way out of here.

561
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,900
When there's a will, there's a way.

562
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,200
Right. You chaps sit tight.

563
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,000
I'll fly in avoiding the barriers,
clever traps and deadly ambushes.

564
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,900
Then some resistance.
And secure the message.

565
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,600
Absolutely. Gutsy by
name. Gutsy by nature.

566
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,300
I will bathe.

567
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,700
- Bring me my best cape.
- Yes, herr general.

568
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,900
- Join the army you said.
- You did, it was your idea.

569
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,000
I'm not listening!

570
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,400
I'm afraid it's not that
simple as I thought.

571
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,000
This is a highly fortified bunker stuffed
with the guills, with enemy falcons.

572
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,200
There's one opening, scarcely
big enough for a homing bird.

573
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,600
It's down the barrow of that gun.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid it's hopeless.

574
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,400
I'll do it!

575
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,900
Bugsy.

576
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,800
I'm too young to die!
I can't believe it!

577
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,900
- Hey!
- Hey?

578
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
- Valiant?
- Bugsy.

579
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,500
Hey! The message!
It's in there.

580
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:53,300
Oh, no! Red is strong and decisive!

581
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,500
- Red it is!
- Yes, general!

582
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:03,900
- No wait, the blue has the actual chimb.
- We'll do as you like, general.

583
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,300
They're coming!

584
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,600
Valiant, get down!

585
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,900
- So many capes to someone!
- I'm sick of capes! I hate capes!

586
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,100
Here goes.

587
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,300
- Okay, you're out of here, Bugsy.
- It's of no use, he took the key with him.

588
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,400
- Complete the mission!
- Bugsy! I can't!

589
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,500
Forget about me! You've got the
message, now get out of here!

590
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,700
- No, Bugsy!
- Go.

591
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,700
Don't! Don't do it!

592
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,000
Underlingk?

593
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,600
- Underlingk!
- Yeah, herr general!

594
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,500
- My beak wash!
- Yeah, herr general.

595
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,000
- Cuffingk?
- Yeah, herr general!

596
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,200
- My talon clippers.
- Yeah, herr general!

597
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,800
Valiant! They're coming!

598
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,900
- Get him!
- Stop him!

599
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,300
What's going on!

600
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,000
- Bugsy!
- Valiant!

601
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,300
Come on, last chance. Get up!

602
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,100
What is that!

603
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,000
Not to watch around,
gotta go! Come on!

604
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,300
Well done, my lad!

605
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,500
- You're from squadron E, right?
- It's a long story, I'll tell you later!

606
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,200
You idiots!

607
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,900
Valiant! Bugsy!

608
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,600
- We did it!
- You made it!

609
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,000
- And the message?
- Yes, sir! Safe and sound.

610
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,200
- Good man!
- Thank you, sir.

611
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,400
Right lads, we have a message
to deliver. Let's make wing!

612
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,900
Those falcons are gonna think
twice before they try to mess with us!

613
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,400
Enemy fliers!
Toughwood! Tailfeather!

614
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,100
- Take them away! Dispose!
- Yes, sir!

615
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,700
Come on lads, attack formation!

616
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,000
Valiant, complete the mission.
You are way to go.

617
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,000
Give me tail, pal.
Let's go chaps!

618
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:31,400
You're tired, little bird? Won't
you like to rest in my belly?

619
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:39,100
So you are the elite?
The best of the best?

620
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,300
I hope I'm gonna make it.
I think I'm gonna make it.

621
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
I'm going to make it!

622
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,500
You can't escape me, pigeon!

623
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,500
Valiant back so soon!
What a nice excitable boy!

624
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,000
Falcon! Set the alarm!

625
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,600
Set the alarm!

626
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,100
It's just you and me, pigeon!
This is where it ends.

627
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,600
You are nothing but
a lonely woof pigeon.

628
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,400
You are no match for a falcon.

629
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,000
It's just as I imagined!
Pieces and shreds!

630
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,600
Valiant!

631
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,700
You ugly stupid falcon!

632
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:25,600
Come out, little birdy. I may
even spare your puny little life!

633
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,300
Just stay calm.
You can do this!

634
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,600
You squeak!

635
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,900
My name is not squeak!
My name is Valiant!

636
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,900
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a message to deliver.

637
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,900
That's my boy!

638
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,400
Valiant? You've made it?

639
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,900
Valiant pigeon.

640
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,800
Sir, I have a message to deliver.

641
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
WAR ROOM

642
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,900
Gentlemen, a change of a plan.
We now land in Normandy.

643
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,300
FOR VALOUR

644
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,800
Well done, son.
This could mean promotion.

645
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,500
- I'm proud of you. You are credit to the Service.
- Thank you. Thank you, sir. It's been a...

646
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,700
Sorry! Sorry!

647
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,000
- Valiant!
- Well done!

648
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,600
You medal beauty.
Well done, mate.

649
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,200
Seed!

650
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
WINGED WAR HEROES

651
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,600
Hold there, Valiant!

652
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,800
I saw her earlier!

653
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,000
I was doing all right to you, kip.

654
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,000
- Hello, handsome!
- I say!

655
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,100
Shall we shake, Tailfeather?

656
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,100
- Oh Valiant, would you like to dance?
- Sorry, I'm not available.

657
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,900
Well you don't know how available I am.
